Paul McCartney turned 80 last month shortly after wrapping up North American dates on his “Got Back” tour. Former Beach Boy Brian Wilson, 80, is touring through September. The Rolling Stones – anchored by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, both 78 – are playing stadiums across Europe. The Who, with Pete Townshend, 77, and Roger Daltrey, 78, are touring into November.\n\nAlso on the road this summer are Eric Clapton, 77, Rod Stewart, 77, Elton John, 75, and 78-year-old Roger Waters, co-founder of Pink Floyd, who is still packing arenas with his majestic songs and mind-bending stagecraft. The list goes on.\n\nCarlos Santana performing at Pine Knob Music Theatre on July 5 in Clarkston, Michigan. He collapsed onstage later that night but is recovering. Scott Legato/Getty Images\n\nAt arenas and stadiums across the world, we are witnessing history. Never before has such a grizzled group of rock icons graced so many major stages at the same time.\n\nThis moment is something to celebrate. But it’s also a little bittersweet, because it marks the twilight of an early generation of rock ‘n’ roll – the rockers who came right after seminal artists like Chuck Berry, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nWe can still get a thrill from hearing these performers live: the visceral punch of the opening guitar chords to “Start Me Up,” the lilting piano intro to “Tiny Dancer,” the shimmering sonic brilliance of “Good Vibrations.”\n\nBut let’s just say it – by almost any standard, these rock stars are old. And it forces those of us who grew up with their music to acknowledge that we’re getting old, too.\n\nAs critic Steven Hyden wrote in his 2019 book, “Twilight of the Gods: A Journey to the End of Classic Rock,” “You can’t talk about classic rock now without also thinking about death.”\n\n‘It’s better to fade away like an old soldier than to burn out’\n\nIn 2019, Damon Linker wrote a widely shared essay for The Week, provocatively titled, “The coming death of just about every rock legend.”\n\nIn it he predicted that most aging rock icons were likely going to die in the next decade or so.\n\n“Behold the killing fields that lie before us,” he wrote, before listing 28 rock stars in or on the verge of their seventies: Dylan, McCartney, Wilson, Jagger, Richards, Daltrey, Townshend, Waters, Clapton, Stewart, Elton John, Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel, Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Ray Davies, David Gilmour, Debbie Harry, Neil Young, Van Morrison, Bryan Ferry, Don Henley, James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThree years later, all 28 of them are still alive. (So are Tina Turner, now 82, Ringo Starr, 81, Neil Diamond, 81, Sly Stone, 79, Bob Seger, 77, Stevie Nicks, 74, Ozzy Osbourne, 73, Bonnie Raitt, 71, and many others.)\n\nBrian Wilson, founding member of the Beach Boys, performs at The Kia Forum on June 9, 2022, in Inglewood, California. Scott Dudelson/Getty Images\n\nConsidering the rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle’s toll on musicians’ health, and the fact that we’ve since been hammered by a global pandemic that preys on the elderly and has killed more than 6 million people, that seems nothing short of amazing.\n\nSo is the fact that most of these artists are still touring.\n\nShould they still be touring? That is another question entirely.\n\n“People always ask me, ‘How do you feel about writing, ‘I hope I die before I get old?’” Townshend told the audience at an April show by The Who in Miami. “I feel really, really old.”\n\nOne of Neil Young’s songs from the 1970s goes, “It’s better to burn out than to fade away,” a much-repeated lyric about the creative lifespan of rock musicians. The line, famously quoted by Kurt Cobain in his suicide note, suggests rock stars are better off flaming out in a brief blaze of creative glory than fading slowly into obsolescence.\n\nBut John Lennon, asked about Young’s song in an interview three days before he died, said he hated the lyric.\n\n“It’s better to fade away like an old soldier than to burn out,” Lennon said. I worship the people who survive.”\n\n‘These are giants of music history still walking the earth’\n\nLinker isn’t so sure. In a follow-up piece for The Week last year, he argued that the quality of rock stars’ musical output invariably declines as they age, become rich and lose the creative fire that sparked their earlier songs.\n\nAnd live, many of them appear physically diminished as well.\n\nLinker says he and his wife recently caught Genesis’ reunion tour and were dismayed watching the 71-year-old Phil Collins, so limited by health problems that he couldn’t play the drums and sang sitting down.\n\n“It was a good show — great lights and sound, and Phil Collins’ son Nic did a fabulous job with the drums. But Phil clearly wasn’t up to it,” Linker told CNN. “That left us kind of down by the end of the evening. It can’t help but be a constant reminder that we’ve gotten so much older, too.”\n\nPhil Collins sings during a reunion concert by Genesis at U Arena on March 17, 2022, in Nanterre, France. David Wolff - Patrick/Redferns/Getty Images\n\nLinker feels similarly about other septuagenarian rock bands who keep soldiering on despite the deaths of key members.\n\n“I don’t want to sound mean, but Roger Daltrey of The Who hasn’t been able to hit high notes in decades. Who songs are really hard to sing! And he’s now 78 years old. Yet they keep going out there. There’s something very sad — very needy — about that,” Linker said. “I feel the same way about the Rolling Stones: Come on, guys, you had a great run — maybe the best run in rock history! Time to give it a rest.”\n\nBut Scott Russell, music editor of Paste magazine, disagrees.\n\nTo him, there’s something special about watching someone take a song you’ve loved for decades and bring it to life before your eyes.\n\n“These are living legends with catalogs to match, giants of music history still walking the earth despite decades in a grueling industry. You may be able to hear the years in Bob Dylan’s voice, but that’s never what made his music special to begin with,” he told CNN.\n\n“Touring is a major strain on the body and mind, so any artist still on the road at an advanced age is doing it for more than just financial security,” Russell added, noting that the vast majority of professional musicians must scrape and claw to make a living touring.\n\n“Any artist who makes it to that mountaintop has earned the right to hang out there as long as they like.”\n\nA farewell tour for classic rock\n\nThese rock ‘n’ roll icons are all survivors. But time, you might say, is no longer on their side.\n\nAnd their specific genre of music is doomed as well.\n\n“Classic rock” was coined by radio programmers to describe guitar-driven music of a distinct time — roughly from the mid-’60s through the grunge era, Linker and Russell point out.\n\n“By definition, that’s a thing from the past,” Linker said.\n\nRoger Daltrey, left, and Pete Townshend of The Who perform at TQL Stadium on May 15, 2022, in Cincinnati. Amy Harris/Invision/AP\n\nSure, you still hear classic rock on mainstream radio, in your uncle’s Spotify playlists and bashed out by cover bands in bars around the world. Its best songs remain timeless.\n\nBut as a contemporary cultural force, its relevance is fading. In an increasingly diverse global music scene, it’s a genre dominated by older White dudes.\n\n“Is classic rock itself now a problematic relic from a time when white male musicians commanded a disproportionate amount of attention?” Hyden wondered in his 2018 book. “Does it deserve to fade away?”\n\nRock has long ceased being the dominant popular music genre in the US, overtaken by hip-hop, country, rap and dance-oriented pop. Outside of some college and community stations, it’s difficult to find new rock music on the radio.\n\nAs more rock legends die in the coming years, the last vestiges of an era will die with them.\n\nWill a new generation of disciples take up the flag?\n\nThere are plenty of candidates – Dave Grohl, Eddie Vedder, Thom Yorke, Trent Reznor and members of U2 and Metallica, just to name a few – but they’re all over 50. It’s hard to think of many young rock artists who can fill stadiums like McCartney and Elton John.\n\nAnd that’s ok. There’s no shortage of talented young musicians expanding the boundaries of rock before enthusiastic crowds in theaters and clubs. Good music will always find an audience.\n\nBob Dylan performing in London's Hyde Park on July 12, 2019. Dylan, now 81, is touring again this year. Dave J Hogan/Getty Images\n\n“Rock may never regain its place atop the pop music pecking order, but it’s never going to go away, either. As one generation of rock musicians ages out, there’s always another on their way up,” said Paste’s Russell, citing such emerging artists as Bartees Strange, Turnstile and Wet Leg. “What’s old can always be made new again.”\n\nRock ‘n’ roll “is a great formula for young people seeking a creative outlet, so I don’t think it will die out,” agreed Linker. “I mean, all the great old stuff is still there in our Spotify and Apple Music accounts to listen to and inspire new generations of discontented youth, which is where rock music comes from.”\n\nIn the meantime, let’s appreciate these touring rock music legends while they are still around.\n\nYes, maybe Pete Townshend’s signature windmills are getting a little creaky. Maybe Brian Wilson outsources his high notes to younger singers. And many of these artists’ concerts are overpriced.\n\nBut they are still out there night after night, doing what they love. They have given us so much.

His genius was behind such songs as \"Come Together\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Imagine\".

It's an illusion.\" —​ Playboy, 1981\n\n\"They've been trying to knock us down since we began, especially the British press, always saying, 'What are you going to do when the bubble bursts?'

And for nearly two surreal minutes on Aug. 21, as sweaty players laid in the grass, heads on helmets, the umbra swept across Nashville, the largest city in its path.\n\n“You know what struck me,” LeBeau said later, “was when just the tiniest sliver of that sun came out, you could see just like daylight. That sun is cookin’, man.”\n\nNow, surely, The Legend has seen it all.\n\nTalkin' Titans: 2017 Titans predictions and preview, plus Marcus Mariota and Raiders\n\nMore: How to watch, listen and stream the Titans game against the Raiders\n\nLeBeau, the Titans’ defensive coordinator, a Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back with the Lions, a two-time Super Bowl champion as an assistant coach with the Steelers, a former head coach of the Bengals, an innovator credited with refining the zone blitz, a man entering his 59th consecutive season in the NFL and celebrating his 80th birthday on the eve of the season opener against the Raiders on Sunday at Nissan Stadium, has seen every player in NFL history.\n\nThat’s the story, at least.\n\n“It’s a possibility,” first-round rookie cornerback Adoree’ Jackson said.\n\n“I’m probably sure he has,” laughed secondary coach Deshea Townsend, who played for LeBeau in Pittsburgh.\n\n“The room don’t like to speak of his age,” safety Da’Norris Searcy said. “We just call him ‘The Legend.’ Everybody pretty much knows he’s been around the game for so long, man. He’s seen so many plays. He’s seen so many snaps. You just keep learning from him. That’s the best thing about it.”\n\n'No choice but to believe him'\n\nThe soft-spoken LeBeau is a storyteller at heart.\n\nHe often begins with a tale, and ends up segueing into something relevant, like this summer, when he regaled his players about the time he snuck out of his dorm during training camp with the Lions.\n\n“And you have no choice but to believe him,” defensive back Kalan Reed said.\n\n“Oh, yeah. Very much so,” said running backs coach Sylvester Croom, whose locker is next to LeBeau’s. “And that’s what he does. And usually he’s not telling you something he heard. He saw it. He’s been around long enough, he saw it. So he’s telling you first-hand information.”\n\nRead more: Dick LeBeau talks Titans, Christmas traditions and more\n\nLeBeau’s wealth of knowledge and talents aren’t limited to football.\n\nHe is a music encyclopedia who plays guitar in his office.\n\nHe’s a scratch golfer with eight holes-in-one to his credit.\n\nHe’s a dancer.\n\n“Oh, yeah,” linebacker Avery Williamson said. “He’ll throw a couple dance moves out there every once in a while. You’ll have to let him show you. I can’t re-enact them. But just watch him in warmups. He’ll do a few things.”\n\nHe’s a ball of energy.\n\nBut smooth.\n\n“You ever see like an old school – I don’t want to say ‘pimp’ – but just an old school cool cat, man,” linebacker Brian Orakpo said. “He’s just very cool, calm, collected. You never see him yell. You never see him hooting and hollering. He’s just a guy that expects to get the job done, and if you don’t he’s going to tell you what you did wrong and get it next time. He demands excellence, but he’s not one of those ‘rah-rah’ get in your face-type coaches, and that’s one thing a lot of guys respect.”\n\nLeBeau is a married father of five, grandfather of five – with a sixth on the way – and a great grandfather of two. He spent Friday night golfing and will enjoy a small family gathering after the game on Sunday.\n\nIn between, on his actual birthday?\n\n“My plan is to not acknowledge it,” LeBeau said. “To paraphrase Garth Brooks’ song – it’s a good song – I’m not going to sing it because I can’t sing like him, but ‘I’m much too old to feel this damn young, man.’ I think his song is, ‘I’m much too young to feel this old.’ That’s all I’ve got to say about the birthday.”\n\nHe’ll spend the day in meetings at the Titans’ practice facility.\n\nBorn for the game\n\nLeBeau was born on Sept. 9, 1937, in a small town on the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio, and starred at halfback on offense and cornerback on defense for coach Woody Hayes at Ohio State, winning the 1957 national championship.\n\n“When he was young,” said linebackers coach Lou Spanos, who first worked with LeBeau on the Steelers’ staff in 1994, “he talked about how there used to be a local operator with the phone line, where he grew up in London, Ohio. You had to call the operator and say, ‘You’ve got to connect me to such-and-such.’”\n\nHow is he with a smartphone?\n\n“Excellent!” Spanos said. “He is on top of it. Actually, he is amazing with technology. Don’t let him tell you different. He’s amazing. That’s what makes him so special. He adjusts to the times.”\n\nLeBeau was drafted by the Browns in the fifth round in 1959 – with the 58th overall pick, which would be a second rounder today – but was cut during training camp and signed with the Lions.\n\nHe played 14 seasons in Detroit, from 1959-72, nabbing a franchise record 62 interceptions, which still rank 10th in NFL history. His 171 consecutive games at cornerback stood as an NFL record for four decades.\n\nLeBeau began his coaching career in 1973, as a special teams assistant with the Eagles.\n\n“I’ve always been on a football field for my birthday,” LeBeau said. “That’s an always. I can’t remember when it wasn’t, going back to junior high school. So that’s long enough that I can’t remember anything else but football. And that’s good. I’m a football coach. That’s what I am.”\n\nHe said his playing experience allows him to connect with players, in some cases, a quarter of his age.\n\n“Yeah, because these guys are athletes, professional athletes,” LeBeau said. “They want to get better. I’m a professional football coach and just want to help them get better. And we talk the same language, you know? I don’t try to find out what music they’re listening to or anything like that. We just talk football, and we’re talking the same language there.”\n\n‘A national treasure'\n\nLeBeau’s favorite story, one he recites for his players every Christmas Eve, from memory, is the classic poem “A visit from St. Nicholas” – better known as “Twas the Night Before Christmas” – written by Clement Clarke Moore in 1823.\n\nLeBeau began reciting it for his family in his 20s, and sharing it with his football family when he started coaching for the Bengals. Titans coach Mike Mularkey, who first worked with LeBeau in Pittsburgh, sat in the front of the team’s meeting room in 2015, LeBeau’s first season with the franchise, to watch the joy on their players’ faces.\n\n“He's an amazing man. That's all I can say about him,” Mularkey said Friday. “What an honor and privilege to work with him.”\n\nFor former players, the poem rates among the first topics they address.\n\n“And every time I hear it, even till now, it still brings tears to your body,” Townsend said.\n\n“I couldn’t have been more – I shouldn’t say been more wrong about Coach LeBeau – but I didn’t know Coach LeBeau,” Titans general manager Jon Robinson said about his initial impressions. “I had never worked with Coach LeBeau. I had just seen him in the black and yellow on the sidelines (with the Steelers), and he was just this stoic defensive playcaller who was steeped in NFL history, both as a player and a coach, and I thought he was going to be this kind of gruff guy that didn’t have much of a personality, and it couldn’t be further from the truth. He is an extremely nice guy. He’s a tough guy. Football is very important to him.”\n\nLongtime NFL reporter Peter King of Sports Illustrated’s MMQB, who first met LeBeau while a Bengals beat reporter for the Cincinnati Enquirer in 1984, called LeBeau a “national treasure” when he stopped by the Titans’ practice facility this summer.\n\n“I think it’s hyperbole,” LeBeau laughed, stepping aside for a few minutes after a recent practice to set the record straight with The Tennessean.\n\nIs his golf game overstated, too?\n\n“I’m closer to a decent golfer than I am a national treasure.”\n\nWhile we’re at it, for the record, is it true he’s seen every player who’s ever played in the NFL?\n\n“It’s almost true,” LeBeau said. “Either played against them or seen the video of them, one or the other. Bronco Nagurski to start with, and all these guys that are playing now to end up with. So you’re going back pretty far. … So I’ve seen a good many.”\n\nLeBeau said he still keeps in touch with his former teammates.\n\n“The ones of us that are left, for sure,” he said. “That’s a diminishing number. But once you’re teammates, you’re teammates for life. We talk. We talk a lot, really. Some of them are recently deceased.\n\n“The guys that I played with, you stay in touch with them. You’re a family. I don’t really like to talk about it that much. … But it’s something we all live through. That’s part of life.”\n\nHow does he deal with losing loved ones?\n\n“Same way you deal with the ups and downs of life, man,” LeBeau said. “You get up and go to work. Get it done.”\n\nReach Jason Wolf at jwolf@tennessean.com and follow him on Twitter at @JasonWolf and on Instagram and Snapchat at TitansBeat.\n\nWEEK 1: RAIDERS (0-0) AT TITANS (0-0)\n\nWhen: Noon CDT, Sept. 10\n\nTV/Radio: CBS / 104.5-FM", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2016/07/18/borgata-hosts-5-atlantic-citys-7-weekend-shows/87268586/", "title": "Borgata hosts 5 of Atlantic City's 7 weekend shows", "text": "DAVID J. SPATZ\n\nFor the Courier-Post\n\nFor anyone still wondering how Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa manages to top the monthly gaming revenue leader board, usually doubling its closest rival, one need only take a look at the casino’s entertainment lineup.\n\nBetween its two main performance venues — the adaptable 3,000-capacity Event Center and the theater-style 1,000-seat Music Box — rare is the weekend when the casino doesn’t have shows working in both rooms, often simultaneously.\n\nMORE ON THE BORGATA: Don Rickles and Regis Philbin chat at Borgata\n\nThis weekend is a perfect example of how Borgata has dominated Atlantic City's casino entertainment. Between Friday and Sunday, there are seven headliner shows in Atlantic City’s eight casinos. Borgata is presenting five of them.\n\nUnlike the early years, when Borgata focused mostly on acts that would appeal to a younger demographic, the casino has developed a entertainment formula that appeals to a broad demographic.\n\nIt strikes a balance to appeal to the wide variety of guests it attracts, everyone from seasoned citizens to kids just old enough to order a drink and try their luck at a slot machine or table game.\n\nNext week, for example, Borgata will present the last of the old-time saloon singers, Tony Bennett, just days before the living legend turns 90. In June, the casino also presented another new nonagenarian: Don Rickles, who celebrated his 90th birthday in May.\n\nOther artists scheduled between now and the end of summer include everyone from country stars Lady Antebellum, Jerry Seinfeld and Broadway actor and singer Leslie Odom Jr. to actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth and comedians Jim Gaffigan and Hannibal Buress, whose fans tend to skew younger.\n\nHere’s the weekend list of casino headliners, with some observations about each act:\n\nThe Killers, Friday, Borgata Event Center: Many critics (and fans, too) consider the Killers one of the most important rock bands of the 21st century. Formed in Las Vegas in 2001, the group is also the biggest rock act ever to come out of Nevada. The proof is in the numbers: Their four studio albums and one live album have sold nearly 25 million units, and they’ve also developed a reputation as a “killer” live act.\n\nShowtime is 8 p.m. The show is listed as sold out, but check with theborgata.com or ComcastTIX at (877) 544-8499 for last-minute availability.\n\nBobby Collins, Friday, Borgata Music Box: Don’t be deceived by his age or the fact that he once was an opening act for everyone from Frank Sinatra and Julio Iglesias to Cher and Tony Bennett. At 64, Collins’ brand of observational humor hits the target with a broad range of fans, including the younger set. A critic once observed that Collins was “a perfect fusion of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.”\n\nWorking 200 comedy dates a year, recording albums, making guest appearances on TV and hosting a VH1 comedy series sure beats his previous lines of work: Before turning to comedy, he was a high school substitute teacher prior to going to work for Calvin Klein in New York City’s garment district.\n\nShowtime is 9 p.m. Tickets are $25, available through theborgata.com or through ComcastTIX at (877) 544-8499.\n\nBoyz II Men, Saturday, Tropicana: This is more than just another gig for the “boyz” from Philly. This is more like a homecoming for Nathan Morris, Shawn Stockman and Wanya Morris. Originally formed as a quartet but now a trio, the Boyz grew up in separate Philadelphia neighborhoods but met and became friends at the Philadelphia High School for the Performing Arts, where they studied classical music and vocals arts.\n\nWhen they began singing together, they took their name from the lyric of a New Edition song. They signed with Motown and made their debut with the album “Cooleyhighharmony,” which sold a staggering 7 million copies. The fourth member of Boyz II Men, Michael McCary, left the group in 2003 because of health and contractual issues. Rather than replace him, the Boyz continued on as a trio.\n\nShowtime is 8 p.m. Tickets are $67, $77 and $87, available through ticketmaster.com or (800) 736-1420.\n\nAlice in Chains, Saturday, Trump Taj Mahal: They were initially labeled a grunge band because of their Seattle roots and their emergence around the same time as Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Nirvana. But Alice in Chains is more closely identified with the heavy-metal sound, according to founding member Jerry Cantrell.\n\n\"We're a lot of different things. I don't quite know what the mixture is, but there's definitely metal, blues, rock ‘n' roll, maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, and I never want it to,” Cantrell once told Guitar World magazine. “When we first came out we were metal. Then we started being called alternative metal. Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now … I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal.”\n\nShowtime is 8 p.m. Tickets are $28, $48 and $73, available through ticketmaster.com or (800) 736-1420.\n\nGeorge Benson, Saturday, Borgata Music Box: The jazz guitarist and singer can trace his musical lineage all the way back to a long-gone Atlantic City nightclub called the Wonder Garden. In the mid-1960s, when Benson wasn’t even old enough to legally order a drink and was still known as “Little Georgie from Pittsburgh,” he played guitar in jazz organist “Brother” Jack McDuff’s band.\n\nWhen he performs in Atlantic City, Benson has been known to reminisce about his years working the club circuit here, which was long before he created a distinctive jazz-pop sound and released songs like “This Masquerade” and his catchy take on the tune “On Broadway.”\n\nShowtime is 9 p.m. Tickets are $59 and $69, available through theborgata.com or through ComcastTIX at (877) 544-8499.\n\nJeff Beck and Buddy Guy, Saturday, Borgata Event Center: Guitarist Beck picked a pretty cool way to celebrate his 50th anniversary in the music business. Beck, 72, who’s been known to riff on a blues refrain in addition to his rock and jazz sounds, has booked a summer tour that will see him co-headline with blues guitarist and singer Buddy Guy, who turns 80 on July 30.\n\nBeck is one of many top guitarists of the 20th century who were influenced by Guy, including Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Richards and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Expect to hear some of the most familiar songs from each of their catalogs, along with some duet work and jamming when the two players are on stage together.\n\nShowtime is 9 p.m. Tickets are $65, $85 and $95, available through theborgata.com or through ComcastTIX at (877) 544-8499.\n\nHuey Lewis and the News, Sunday, Borgata Event Center: Is there such a thing as being too successful? If you’re a big fan of Huey Lewis and the News, you may be just a little disappointed by their Sunday night show. Oh, the hits will sound pretty much as you remember them from 33 years ago, when their self-produced album “Sports” — which sold 10 million copies — spun off five Top 10 singles, or nearly half the number of Top 10 hits the band has had. But there simply isn’t enough time for the band to cover all of their hits.\n\n“Let’s face it, we can’t do them all, there’s so many of them,” Lewis once said. But when they’re performing live, there’s one big advantage of having amassed so many hits: “We don’t have to do them all, but we can do enough so that people don’t realize what songs you didn’t play, and that’s pretty good.”\n\nLewis said: “We can go several nights without playing some No. 1 records. And we’ve had so many (hits) that I don’t think people rack their brains saying, ‘Oh, shoot, they didn’t do this song or that one.’ ”\n\nShowtime is 8 p.m. Tickets are $59, $69 and $79, available through theborgata.com or through ComcastTIX at (877) 544-8499.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/louisville-city-living/2021/03/11/kentucky-cocaine-bear-legend-subject-of-movie-by-elizabeth-banks/4830810002/", "title": "The true story behind Cocaine Bear, Kentucky's drug-fueled legend", "text": "This story has been updated to reflect a change in who previously owned Cocaine Bear.\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. — The story of Kentucky's favorite party animal is heading to Hollywood.\n\nOur venerable \"Cocaine Bear\" is part of the plotline for an upcoming film.\n\nThe real-life story is stranger than fiction. Back in 1985, a 175-pound black bear died from a massive cocaine overdose at the indirect hand of one of Kentucky's most notorious drug-smuggling criminals.\n\nThe now taxidermized Cocaine Bear has captured the hearts and attention of roadside travelers since he first arrived in Lexington in 2015. The black bear with just enough teeth showing to scare some children has appeared in thousands of selfies, and he's even gotten to be the guest of honor backstage at a Sturgill Simpson concert.\n\nThe circumstances of his death were originally featured in a wild three-sentence-long New York Times brief back in 1985, and now it's part of the plot of a new movie being developed and directed by actress and director Elizabeth Banks.\n\nIt's happening:'Cocaine Bear' finally has a release date. When and where you can watch, stream it\n\nWith the upcoming film in mind, now seems like as good a time as any to revisit the legend and the story of how he ended up stuffed and on display at the Kentucky for Kentucky Fun Mall at 720 Bryan Ave. in Lexington.\n\nInterestingly enough, I took a trip to Lexington on March 4, 2020, pre-COVID, to meet the bear and the small staff of retail employees dedicated to preserving his story.\n\nI waited to write that story because the coronavirus shutdown happened the following week and teasing about an attraction that wasn't open to the public didn't seem fair.\n\nBut now, it's finally time to introduce you to Cocaine Bear.\n\nIs Cocaine Bear based on a true story?\n\nHere's the hard, sad truth. This bear ate cocaine until it died.\n\nWhen a medical examiner was called in back in 1985 to look at the 175-pound body, he found every problem you'd expect from a massive overdose — cerebral hemorrhaging, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, renal failure, heart failure, stroke.\n\nCocaine Bear's stomach was so full, you couldn't have packed in more of the illicit drug if you tried.\n\nBut how did he get that way? It starts three months earlier and 200 miles to the north. It was there that Andrew Thornton II, a notorious Lexington narcotics police officer turned drug smuggler, fell to his death from a plane while on a coke-smuggling run. He just returned from dropping packages in northern Georgia.\n\nHis body was recovered in Knoxville, Tennessee, with night-vision goggles on his face and Gucci loafers on his feet. He had knives, a couple of pistols, $4,500 in cash and a duffel bag filled with about 75 pounds of cocaine worth $15 million on him too.\n\nYou may like:A jilted lover. A double homicide. Inside the Kentucky Murder Mansion's twisted love story\n\nThe two deaths are widely believed to be connected because the bear was surrounded by 40 open containers with traces of cocaine inside of them.\n\nThirty-six years later, even though he's a technically Georgia black bear, Cocaine Bear is a Kentucky legend for dying at the indirect hand of one of the commonwealth's most wanted.\n\nThe notoriety doesn't stop at his last coke-filled breaths.\n\nCocaine Bear's next 25 or so years are equally as wild.\n\nKentucky for Kentucky's bear hunt\n\nThe folks behind Kentucky for Kentucky first reached out to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations to try and find out what happened to the bear back in 2013 or 2014.\n\nThis might seem unusual for a retail store, but Kentucky for Kentucky is not your average shop. This is the same vivacious retailer that sells preserved dung from Kentucky Derby champions for $200 a jar and once tie-dyed shirts in Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.\n\nThey have a history of taking on bizarre projects that give a shot in the arm to the state's morale and culture.\n\nBack in 2011, they launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a Super Bowl commercial for the state. At one point they set up a 1-800 line so that Kentuckians, who had moved away, could call in and hear \"My Old Kentucky Home\" for the holidays. A few years ago they took it upon themselves to rebrand the state's slogan from \"Unbridled Spirit\" to \"Kentucky Kicks Ass.\"\n\nYou may like:It took 29 years, but this Kentucky man returned a long lost class ring to its owner\n\nThe bear hunt for an animal that had been dead for nearly 30 years was just another wild idea until they reached out to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations. The agency remembered the old case for its sheer absurdity.\n\nTogether they traced Cocaine Bear's past and its once coked-out insides to a medical examiner who'd looked over the bear's remains back in the 1980s.\n\nEventually, they learned Mr. Bear, as Kentucky for Kentucky co-owner Whit Hiler affectionately calls him, was taxidermized after his death and put on display at the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area in Georgia.\n\nHiler initially told us in that 2020 interview that the bear was once owned by country music legend Waylon Jennings. In a statement to USA Today, a representative for son Shooter Jennings said his father never owned a taxidermy bear. And while Fun Mall representatives have not returned calls for comment, the owners did tell the Wall Street Journal that after inheriting a stuffed bear in 2015, they created a backstory that wove real details about the dead bear \"with heavy embellishments.\"\n\nBy the time the Kentucky for Kentucky team found the bear about eight years ago, its most recent post was as a decoration in a traditional Chinese medicine shop in Reno. The team connected with the widow of the man who owned the store, and she agreed to give Cocaine Bear to the Lexington retailers, as long as they paid the $200 shipping. (The sale of one of those horse turd jars could have funded that voyage.)\n\nIt was a no-brainer for Hiler and his associates.\n\nSharing the spotlight with Sturgill Simpson\n\nChristian Phillips was running the Fun Mall's checkout the afternoon I met the bear. He's both a store clerk and witness to all travelers who flock to Lexington to see this drug-fueled legend.\n\nI'd driven more than 75 miles from Louisville to see Cocaine Bear, but that trip was short compared to many of the bear's biggest fans.\n\nSince Phillips had started working there two years before when I spoke to him in March 2020,he'd met folks from Sweden, Australia, Poland, Finland, and parts of Africa, who'd all heard about the Cocaine Bear online and wanted to see him.\n\nSince the pandemic hit Kentucky a year ago, Cocaine Bear's public appearances have been essentially non-existent.\n\nKentucky for Kentucky has been running as an online shop and curbside operation since the shutdown last spring.\n\nBut this time last year, Cocaine Bear had just returned from a quick excursion to Rupp Arena. He doesn't usually leave the store, but a few months before, Cocaine Bear received a shoutout on comedian Joe Rogan's podcast when Kentucky-born country singer Sturgill Simpson was a guest.\n\nSo when Simpson took the stage at Rupp Arena in February 2020, the Fun Mall was delighted to send Cocaine Bear backstage for the whole crew to enjoy.\n\nYou may like:End of an era. The last video rental chain in Kentucky is closing its last few stores\n\nPhillips told me that prior to the shutdown, the store welcomed a \"bear minimum\" of five Cocaine Bear fans a day. Usually, it was closer to 20 or 30 people.\n\nI circled back with Hiler after the news of the film broke this week, and he told me people are thrilled about it. His social media had been booming, and once again, interest around Cocaine Bear had taken off.\n\nLife has been pretty slow during the shutdown, he said, and they're excited to get people back into the store.\n\nThey're eager to put Cocaine Bear back on display once it's safe again, too.\n\nIt's not uncommon to have people walk in the door, make a beeline for the bear and start taking selfies. Others have found him more organically.\n\nKentucky for Kentucky has a whole line of merchandise for Mr. Bear including a \"blow globe,\" which is really a snow globe and a pun that nods to the party animal's past.\n\nIf you see enough T-shirts, stickers and hats with \"Cocaine Bear\" on them, it's hard not to ask, Phillips told me. He enjoys sharing the story.\n\nPeople devour it the same way the bear gobbled up all that cocaine. This new plug from Hollywood will only add to it.\n\nCocaine Bear has been dead for 36 years, but the story has very much taken on a life of its own.\n\nFeatures columnist Maggie Menderski writes about what makes Louisville, Southern Indiana and Kentucky unique, wonderful, and occasionally, a little weird.

Afghanistan\n\nThe FBI executed a search warrant on Monday at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there when he left the White House. The former President was at Trump Tower in New York when the search warrant was executed. In February, the National Archives previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from the resort – including some that were classified. Separately, photos have apparently revealed Trump’s habit of flushing key White House documents down the toilet. The extraordinary move to search the home of a former president comes as Trump’s legal problems continue on multiple fronts. Trump is also expected in the coming months to announce he will launch another bid for the White House in 2024.\n\n2. Gun violence\n\nVictims of the Uvalde elementary school massacre and other recent mass shootings gave first-hand descriptions of the horrors of gun violence at a House committee meeting on Wednesday. In a pre-recorded video, 11-year-old Miah Cerrillo, a fourth-grade student at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, described trying to hide behind her teacher’s desk and covering herself in blood in an attempt to survive. It marked a rare moment for Congress to hear testimony from someone as young as Cerrillo on a subject as sensitive and disturbing as gun violence. Family members of shooting victims also made passionate pleas for gun legislation. The hearing, however, clearly displayed the partisan divide in the debate on guns as Democrats urged stronger gun control, while Republicans pushed back on restrictions.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

China did not say specifically what sanctions it would levy against Pelosi and her immediate family over what it called her “egregious provocations” in visiting Taiwan, an island that China claims as its own territory.\n\nChina acted because Pelosi visited Taiwan “in disregard of China’s strong opposition and serious representations,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn another sign of deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, the White House summoned China's ambassador to the White House on Thursday to launch a formal protest over Beijing's recent aggressive actions against Taiwan.\n\nChina on Thursday launched threatening military exercises in six zones just off Taiwan’s coasts that it says will run through Sunday. Missiles also have been fired over Taiwan, defense officials told state media.\n\n\"We condemned (China's) military actions, which are irresponsible, at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability and across the Taiwan Strait,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. \"We made clear to the ambassador that Beijing’s actions are of concern to Taiwan, to us and to our partners around the world.\"\n\nChina has claimed that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan amounts to an attack by the Biden administration on Chinese sovereignty. The White House has stressed that Pelosi is the head of the legislative branch of government and that it could not stop her visit.\n\nThe White House also has said Pelosi’s visit does not signal a shift in its one-China policy, which acknowledges that Taiwan is part of China.\n\n“China has chosen to overreact and use the speaker’s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait,” Kirby told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n\nIn an effort to ease the tensions, Kirby said the U.S. would postpone intercontinental ballistic missile test scheduled for this week. Kirby said the decision to reschedule the test was intended to demonstrate “the behavior of a responsible nuclear power by reducing the risks of miscalculation and misperception.”\n\nPelosi, the first U.S. speaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years, said in Japan on Friday that China will not be able to isolate Taiwan by preventing U.S. officials from traveling there. The Chinese have tried to isolate Taiwan, Pelosi said, including most recently by preventing it from joining the World Health Organization.\n\n“They may try to keep Taiwan from visiting or participating in other places, but they will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there,” Pelosi said as she wrapped up a swing across Asia. Pelosi and five other members of Congress arrived in Tokyo late Thursday after visiting Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nChina’s announcement on Friday threatened to accelerate the friction with Washington.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said dialogue between U.S. and Chinese regional commanders and defense department heads would be canceled, along with talks on military maritime safety.\n\nCooperation on returning illegal immigrants, criminal investigations, transnational crime, illegal drugs and climate change will be suspended, the ministry said.\n\nThe Chinese military exercises launched Thursday involve its navy, air force and other departments and are to last until Sunday. They include missile strikes on targets in the seas north and south of the island in an echo of the last major Chinese military drills in 1995 and 1996 aimed at intimidating Taiwan’s leaders and voters.\n\nTaiwan has put its military on alert and staged civil defense drills, while the U.S. has numerous naval assets in the area. China also flew war planes toward Taiwan and blocked imports of its citrus and fish.\n\n'WE CAME TO TAIWAN TO LISTEN':Pelosi gives strong backing to Taiwan's democracy; US braces for Chinese military drills\n\nEarlier Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that China’s military exercises aimed at Taiwan represent a “grave problem” that threatens regional peace and security after five ballistic missiles launched as part of the drills landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone.\n\nKishida, speaking after breakfast with Pelosi and her congressional delegation, said the missile launches need to be “stopped immediately.”\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said five missiles landed on Thursday in Japan’s exclusive economic zone off Hateruma, an island far south of Japan’s main islands. He said Japan protested to China, saying the missiles “threatened Japan’s national security and the lives of the Japanese people, which we strongly condemn.”\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, attending a regional meeting in Cambodia, said China’s actions are “severely impacting peace and stability in the region and the international community, and we demand the immediate suspension of the military exercises.”\n\nJapan has in recent years bolstered its defense capability and troop presence in southwestern Japan and remote islands, including Okinawa, which is about 700 kilometers (420 miles) northeast of Taiwan. Many residents say they worry their island will be quickly embroiled in any Taiwan conflict. Okinawa is home to the majority of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact.\n\nSEE THE HISTORIC TRIP:Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan amid escalating tensions with China\n\nAt the breakfast earlier Friday, Pelosi and her congressional delegation also discussed their shared security concern over China, North Korea and Russia, and pledged their commitment to working toward peace and stability in Taiwan, Kishida said. Pelosi was also to hold talks with her Japanese counterpart, lower house Speaker Hiroyuki Hosoda.\n\nJapan and its key ally, the U.S., have been pushing for new security and economic frameworks with other democracies in the Indo-Pacific region and Europe as a counter to China’s growing influence amid rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei.\n\nDays before Pelosi’s Taiwan visit, a group of senior Japanese lawmakers, including former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, visited the island and discussed regional security with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Ishiba said Japan, while working with the United States to prevent conflict in the Indo-Pacific, wants a defense agreement with Taiwan.\n\nOn Thursday, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations issued a statement saying “there is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait.” It said China’s “escalatory response risks increasing tensions and destabilizing the region.”\n\nChina cited its displeasure over the statement for the last-minute cancellation of talks between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Cambodia on Thursday.\n\nPelosi held talks on Thursday in South Korea, also a key U.S. ally, which stayed away from the Taiwan issue, apparently to avoid upsetting China, focusing instead on North Korea’s increasing nuclear threat.\n\nIn recent years, South Korea has been struggling to strike a balance between the United States and China as their rivalry has deepened.\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi have said the United States remains committed to the so-called one-China policy, which recognizes Beijing as the government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. The administration discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from visiting.\n\nPelosi has been a long-time advocate of human rights in China. She, along with other lawmakers, visited Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1991 to support democracy two years after a bloody military crackdown on protesters at the square.\n\nAs leader of the House of Representatives, Pelosi’s trip has heightened U.S.-China tensions more than visits by other members of Congress. The last House speaker to visit Taiwan was Newt Gingrich in 1997.\n\nChina and Taiwan, which split in 1949 after a civil war, have no official relations but multibillion-dollar business ties.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/politics/liz-cheney-donald-trump-2022-election/index.html", "title": "Liz Cheney is already looking beyond 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nLiz Cheney didn’t come right out and say she expects to lose her primary next month. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/us/inside-texas-synagogue-hostage-standoff/index.html", "title": "Inside the Texas synagogue hostage standoff | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt started like most any Saturday for members of Congregation Beth Israel.\n\nFamilies of the Reform Jewish synagogue just outside Dallas-Fort Worth had gathered – in person and online – to participate in the Sabbath service, even amid the twin perils of a fresh pandemic wave and a swelling tide of attacks on Jewish people in the United States.\n\nBy day’s end, the community of faith in Colleyville, Texas, would be at the center of a global drama involving a livestreamed hostage-taking, an imprisoned terrorist icon, an elite FBI rescue team, a rabbi’s quick thinking and a final, frantic sprint to freedom.\n\nMore details may yet offer a deeper understanding of why it happened. But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/politics/biden-campaign-trail-age/index.html", "title": "This is the bar Joe Biden will have to clear in 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nJoe Biden still hasn’t made up his mind about whether or not to run for president in 2024.\n\n“Look, my intention as I said to begin with is that I would run again,” the President said last month in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes.” “But it’s just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen.”\n\nLet’s say, for the sake of argument, that Biden does decide to run for another term in two years time. The challenge before him will be simple but profound: Prove to the American people that he can campaign all over the country for the entirety of the campaign.\n\nThat’s according to the latest column from The Washington Post’s Megan McArdle, who writes:\n\n“You need only watch video from 10 years ago to see that the president now appears slower than he used to be. That doesn’t mean he’s unfit to be president; he will not be asked to resolve a foreign policy crisis by solving crossword puzzles at high speed. But whether it’s a policy problem, it is a political problem.”\n\nMcArdle’s argument – if I extrapolate it somewhat – goes like this:\n\n1. In the early primary and caucus states where a premium was put on hand-to-hand campaigning, Biden was crushed.\n\n2. He was saved by the endorsement of South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn and the strong support of Black voters in the Palmetto State.\n\n3. After that win in South Carolina, the primary campaign effectively ended because the country went into lockdown over Covid-19.\n\n4. The general election campaign, similarly, wasn’t much of a campaign. Biden held very few in-person events and the ones he did hold were with small numbers of people.\n\n5. By the time the 2024 campaign rolls around, the pandemic will be in the rearview mirror (Biden says it already is) and politics will return to normal again. Which means Biden will have to do something he hasn’t done in years – actively campaign.\n\nAgain, McArdle:\n\n“Whether Republicans nominate Trump or someone else, his opponent is going to be out there on the stump, whipping up voter enthusiasm and proving they have the stamina for the job. If Biden doesn’t follow suit, he will be conceding them an edge — especially since they will not be shy about using that fact to raise questions about his fitness.”\n\nWe know from oodles of polling that there are real and persistent questions among the electorate – including a decent-sized chunk of Democrats – about whether Biden should run again, with his age being a prime driver of those doubts.\n\nWhether you agree with McArdle or not, she raises a provocative and important point: Given Biden’s age and snafus like the one last week involving the late Rep. Jackie Walorski, people are going to be keeping a close eye on how he carries himself as a candidate in 2024.\n\nThe Point: Biden, assuming he runs in 2024, will be 81 years old on the campaign trail – the oldest person to ever seek a second term as president. (He was also the oldest person ever elected to a first term.) His ability to handle the rigors of a campaign will be a major hurdle he needs to clear in the eyes of many voters.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/04/pelosi-south-korea-taiwan-china/10233367002/", "title": "Pelosi visits South Korea, avoids public comments on Taiwan, China", "text": "Hyung-Jin Kim and Huizhong Wu\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSEOUL, South Korea – After infuriating China over her trip to Taiwan, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met South Korean political leaders in Seoul on Thursday but avoided making direct public comments on relations with Beijing and Taipei that could further increase regional tensions.\n\nPelosi, the first House speaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years, said Wednesday in Taipei that the American commitment to democracy in the self-governing island and elsewhere \"remains ironclad.\" In response, China on Thursday began military exercises, including missile strike training, in six zones surrounding Taiwan, in what could be the biggest of their kind since the mid-1990s.\n\nAfter visiting Taiwan, Pelosi and other members of her congressional delegation flew to South Korea — a key U.S. ally where about 28,500 American troops are deployed — on Wednesday evening, as part of an Asian tour that included earlier stops in Singapore and Malaysia. After South Korea, Pelosi will travel to Japan.\n\nShe met South Korean National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin Pyo and other senior members of Parliament on Thursday. After that hourlong meeting, Pelosi spoke about the bilateral alliance, forged in blood during the 1950-53 Korean War, and legislative efforts to boost ties, but didn't directly mention her Taiwan visit or the Chinese protests.\n\nPelosi in Taiwan:Pelosi gives strong backing to Taiwan's democracy; US braces for Chinese military drills\n\n\"We also come to say to you that a friendship, (the) relationship that began from urgency and security, many years ago, has become the warmest of friendships,\" Pelosi said in a joint news conference with Kim. \"We want to advance security, economy and governance in an inter-parliamentary way.\"\n\nNeither Pelosi nor Kim took questions from journalists.\n\nKim said he and Pelosi shared concerns about North Korea's increasing nuclear threat. He said the two agreed to support their governments' push for denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula based on both strong deterrence against North Korea and diplomacy.\n\nPelosi and her delegation later spoke by phone with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on the alliance, foreign policy and other issues. Yoon is on vacation this week, but critics accuse him of intentionally shunning a face-to-face meeting with Pelosi in consideration of ties with China, South Korea's biggest trading partner. Yoon's office said it had reviewed national interests and that Yoon's vacation plan had already been set up when, about two weeks ago, Pelosi's side contacted his office about a possible meeting.\n\nDuring the phone conversation, Pelosi and other members of her congressional delegation didn't bring up the Taiwan issue, and Yoon also didn't raise the matter, Yoon's office said.\n\nIn recent years, South Korea has been struggling to strike a balance between the United States and China as their rivalry has deepened. Yoon, a conservative, took office in May with a vow to boost South Korea's military alliance with the United States and take a tougher line on North Korean provocations.\n\nPelosi expected to visit North Korean border\n\nLater Thursday, Pelosi was to visit a border area with North Korea that is jointly controlled by the American-led United Nations Command and North Korea, South Korean officials said. If that visit occurs, Pelosi would be the highest-level American to go to the Joint Security Area since then-President Donald Trump visited in 2019 for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nYoon said Pelosi's visit to the JSA would demonstrate \"a strong deterrence against North Korea\" by the allies, said Kim Tae-hyo, a deputy presidential national security adviser.\n\nSouth Korean media, citing no sources, later reported that Pelosi visited the JSA but gave no further details. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul, the U.N. Command and the South Korean Defense Ministry couldn't immediately confirm the reports.\n\nSitting inside the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, a buffer created at the end of the Korean War, the JSA is the site of past bloodshed and a venue for numerous talks. U.S. presidents and other top officials have often traveled to the JSA and other border areas to reaffirm their security commitment to South Korea.\n\nAny statement critical of North Korea by Pelosi is certain to draw a furious response. On Wednesday, the North's Foreign Ministry slammed the United States over her Taiwan trip, saying \"the current situation clearly shows that the impudent interference of the U.S. in internal affairs of other countries … (is) the root cause of harassed peace and security in the region.\"\n\nChinese launch military exercises\n\nThe Chinese military exercises launched Thursday and planned to last until Sunday involve its navy, air force and other departments. They include missile strikes on targets in the seas north and south of the island in an echo of the last major Chinese military drills aimed at intimidating Taiwan's leaders and voters in 1995 and 1996.\n\nChina's official Xinhua News Agency said the exercises are joint operations focused on \"blockade, sea target assault, strike on ground targets, and airspace control.\"\n\nTaiwan has put its military on alert and staged civil defense drills, while the U.S. has numerous naval assets in the area. Taiwan's Defense Ministry called the Chinese drills \"unreasonable actions in an attempt to change the status quo, destroy the peace and stability of the region.\"\n\nChina views Taiwan as a breakaway province to be annexed by force if necessary. It considers visits to Taiwan by foreign officials as recognizing its sovereignty.\n\n\"Today the world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy,\" Pelosi said in a short speech during a meeting with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday. \"America's determination to preserve democracy, here in Taiwan and around the world, remains ironclad.\"\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi have said the United States remains committed to the \"one-China policy,\" which recognizes Beijing as the sole, legitimate government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. The administration discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from visiting.\n\nPelosi noted in Taiwan that congressional support for Taiwan is bipartisan, and she praised the island's democracy. She stopped short of saying that the U.S would defend Taiwan militarily and emphasized that Congress is \"committed to the security of Taiwan, in order to have Taiwan be able to most effectively defend themselves.\"\n\nTsai said at her meeting with Pelosi that \"facing deliberately heightened military threats, Taiwan will not back down.\"\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Wednesday that U.S. officials \"don't believe we're at the brink now, and there's certainly no reason for anybody to be talking about being at the brink going forward.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations called for calm in the Taiwan Strait, which separates mainland China and Taiwan, and urged the avoidance of any \"provocative action.\" ASEAN foreign ministers, who are meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for a regional forum, said they were concerned the situation could \"destabilize the region and eventually could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers.\"\n\nPelosi's focus has always been the same, she said, going back to her 1991 visit to Beijing's Tiananmen Square, when she and other lawmakers unfurled a small banner supporting democracy two years after a bloody military crackdown on protesters at the square.

Every newspaper and cable channel is filled with thoughts about the move, with much of that opinion tilting toward outrage over the Florida Republican governor treating people like political pawns.\n\n“It’s outrageous,” New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez said of the move. “They lure people, like human traffickers lure people, onto buses and unknowing where they’re going to. They have no concern for – they supposedly are the advocates for human life. They have no concern for the lives of these people.”\n\nDeSantis couldn’t have scripted it any better politically.\n\nThe simple fact is that DeSantis made this Martha’s Vineyard gambit solely to draw attention to himself and his opposition to the border policies of the Biden administration. It was, to be frank, a stunt. And it’s not the first time he’s done something like this.\n\nConsider:\n\n* In the spring of 2022, DeSantis’ administration rejected 41% of proposed math textbooks because they were allegedly “indoctrinating” kids. “Some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,” DeSantis said in a statement explaining the move.\n\n* At a press conference at the University of South Florida earlier this year, DeSantis scolded students for wearing masks while indoors. “You do not have to wear those masks,” he said. “I mean, please take them off. Honestly, it’s not doing anything. We’ve got to stop with this Covid theater. So if you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous.”\n\n* DeSantis revoked Disney’s special self-governance status in Florida following the company’s criticism of the state’s passage of legislation that bans the discussion of gender and sexuality among young people in public schools. “You’re a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you’re going to marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state,” said DeSantis. “We view that as a provocation, and we’re going to fight back against that.”\n\nEach of these incidents drew national headlines. Each of them drew intense criticism from the left. And each of them drew equal amounts of praise from the conservative right.\n\nWhich is exactly how the Martha Vineyard’s stunt has played out. While DeSantis was blasted by Democrats, the right ran to defend him. “DeSantis was right to send migrants to Martha’s Vineyard. We need to bring border crisis to Democrats,” read an op-ed on Fox News’ website.\n\nFor DeSantis, the outrage – on both sides – is the point. He has built a political brand on the idea of standing up to what he views as political correctness and wokeness. (DeSantis signed a bill into law earlier this year designed to “protect Floridians from discrimination and woke indoctrination.”) In order to maintain and burnish that image, he has to do even more outrageous things – like the Martha’s Vineyard move.\n\nThe fact of the matter – whether you like DeSantis or not – is that his outrage machine is humming along. Largely riding his knack for stirring controversy, he has emerged by many measures as the second-most popular Republican in the country – behind only Donald Trump. He is regarded as a heavy favorite to win a second term over his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, in November. And he is widely regarded as the only candidate who could credibly challenge Trump in a 2024 Republican primary.\n\nWhich is somewhat ironic. Because, as Trump likes to remind anyone who asks, he helped make DeSantis by endorsing him in a primary fight in 2018. And DeSantis has quite clearly modeled his approach to politics off of the ripped-from-the-headlines strategy employed by Trump.\n\nIn fact, what DeSantis is offering Republican voters amounts to Trumpism without Trump. In DeSantis, you get all the anti-wokeness that Trump built a presidential campaign and presidency on, but just without some of the more embarrassing personal foibles and tics that the former President brings with him.\n\nAnd, just like Trump, covering DeSantis provides a significant challenge for the media as well. DeSantis wants – and even courts – the scorn of the mainstream media for gambits like the one in Martha’s Vineyard. He knows that the more negative attention he gets, the better liked he is among the Republican base and the more money he can raise for his future political endeavors.\n\nNot covering someone like DeSantis – the governor of a major state and someone with national ambitions – is out of the question.

Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, was speaking to that same audience of one.\n\n“Doors have opened,” Cheney said. “New subpoenas have been issued and the dam has begun to break.”\n\nThe message to Trump was simple: We’re coming for you.\n\nOf course, it remains to be seen whether a) the January 6 committee will make a criminal referral to the Department of Justice about Trump, or b) the Department of Justice decides to criminally charge Trump (or anyone else) in connection with the riot at the US Capitol.\n\nWhile that is, quite clearly, an open question, Cheney seemed intent on ratcheting up the pressure on Trump (and his innermost circle) as the hearings are set to take a hiatus while the committee continues to gather evidence and talk to witnesses.\n\nWe’ve seen this tactic from Cheney work before. Following a committee hearing in late June, Cheney publicly urged former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to come forward and testify on the record.\n\n“Any concerns he has about the institutional interests of his prior office are outweighed by the need for his testimony,” she tweeted at the time.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Cipollone testified in a closed-door meeting with the committee. His video testimony has been used extensively by the committee in its two most recent hearings.\n\nCheney used that same bully pulpit to get Trump’s attention on Thursday night. And again, it worked.\n\n“Liz Cheney is a sanctimonious loser,” the former President posted on his Truth Social site. “The Great State of Wyoming is wise to her.” (That was one of more than 10 posts by Trump last night.)\n\nCheney’s hope here is that Trump, feeling the pressure of the committee’s ongoing investigation, slips up in some way that further exposes him – either criminally or otherwise.\n\nWe already know, thanks to CNN reporting, that Trump tried to call a member of the White House support staff who was talking to the January 6 committee. According to CNN, the staffer was in a position to corroborate part of what Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, had testified before the committee. The staffer did not answer the call and instead alerted their lawyer.\n\nWe also know that Trump is getting antsy to declare his 2024 presidential candidacy as the drip-drip-drip of the committee’s findings take their toll, and as other would-be Republican contenders – namely Florida Gov.

Women who feel the same way she does about abortion rights might not have signs in their yard or be from the same political party, but they were silently aligned at the ballot box.\n\n\"Women understand their rights are being taken away ... and if they don't act, we will be back in the 1950s,\" Quinones said. \"Regardless if women have different political beliefs or different religious beliefs, they agree they want the right to make their own choices.\"\n\nIf Kansas’ turnout is replicated nationwide in November, it would benefit Democrats, who count on the Roe reversal to improve their odds this fall as the party faces headwinds that include high consumer prices, President Joe Biden's low approval numbers and a historical record that shows midterms typically go against the sitting president's party.\n\nThe monkeypox outbreak that has infected more than 6,600 people in the United States is officially a public health emergency, the Biden administration declared Thursday. --Ella & Amy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}]}

What exactly that means is still up in the air: are they still called “tweets?” Will users have to access a new web domain? Is something besides the logo changing? Here’s what we know so far about Twitters transition to X.\n\nWhat is Twitter called now?\n\nElon Musk announced in a series of tweets his intentions to do away with all remnants of the app’s iconic bird-related imagery. Instead, the social media network formerly known as Twitter will be rebranded simply to X, a change that has already been reflected on desktop, where the spot once reserved for the blue and white bird logo has been replaced with a grey-scale letter X.\n\nWhile the mobile version of the app still sticks to the blue-and-white color scheme and features the bird image up top, official Twitter accounts, including Musk’s, have been updated to reflect the change. The company’s official handle remains @twitter, but the display username has been changed to a capital X and the profile photo to a black square featuring a white-lined X in the middle. Musk’s account also shares the same profile image and two recent posts about the logo, one calling it “Futuristic Art Deco” while another features a sort of hype-reel for the new design.\n\nTyping X.com into the search bar automatically redirects to Twitter, though Twitter.com also still leads to the same landing page.\n\nTwitter competitors:A flash in the pan? Just weeks after launch, Instagram Threads app is already faltering\n\nWhy did Elon Musk change the Twitter logo?\n\nBoth Musk and his team have offered a series of explanations for the rebranding.\n\nIn one Tweet, Musk said the “X” design served to “embody the imperfections in us all that make us unique,” while in another he pointed out his personal affinity for the letter. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino, also in posts shared by Musk, said the overhaul allows for a chance to make a fresh “big impression” and that the new brand will “go further” than Twitter to “transform the global town square.”\n\n“X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.”\n\nIn a Monday tweet, Musk provided further insight into his thoughts behind the change, saying Twitter is on its way to becoming an “everything app” for use not only in communication, but financial transactions as well. According to him, the existing name and branding do not reflect these ambitions.\n\n“Twitter was acquired by X Corp both to ensure freedom of speech and as an accelerant for X, the everything app. This is not simply a company renaming itself, but doing the same thing,” he tweeted.\n\n“The Twitter name made sense when it was just 140 character messages going back and forth – like birds tweeting – but now you can post almost anything, including several hours of video. In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world. The Twitter name does not make sense in that context, so we must bid adieu to the bird.”\n\nHow much did Elon Musk pay for Twitter?\n\nMusk purchased Twitter in October of 2022 for $44 billion. He initially agreed to the deal in April of last year before attempting to back out, claiming Twitter had misrepresented numbers thanks to spam and bots. Twitter responded not only by denying the claims but suing Musk for completion of the purchase, though the two eventually settled the dispute out of court.\n\nAccording to prior reporting by USA TODAY, Musk said he overpaid for Twitter and the platform was valued at a mere $25 billion by Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. Musk said he continued with the deal partially because he considered the app one of “great potential” whose revenue he believed he could double in three years.\n\nEven this early in acquisition, Musk alluded to the development of “X,” the “everything app” and his intentions to utilize Twitter as a piece of that puzzle. Even with these strong ambitions, however, Musk also took on Twitter’s estimated $13 billion in debt at the time of purchase.\n\nElections and Twitter:Amid Elon Musk's Twitter changes, why 2024 presidential election threats now pose bigger risk\n\nElon Musk’s son and the letter X\n\nFor those that haven’t been paying attention, Musk sort of has a thing for the letter “X.” In fact, this is not his first attempt to name a company after the single letter, as his 1999 money startup was initially called X.com before being renamed PayPal.\n\nCompany Space Exploration Technologies Corp, where Musk serves as CEO, is also more commonly known as SpaceX and car brand Tesla, where musk is also the CEO, even features an “X” car model.\n\nPerhaps his most infamous use of the letter, however, is as a name for his son with singer Grimes, whose full name was originally reported as being “X Æ A-12 Musk.\" While Grimes originally tweeted an explanation for the name, which was simply pronounced like the letter “X,” it has since been reported that the couple changed the name in order to comply with state law.\n\nWhat is a Xeet?\n\nOne of the biggest questions on everyone’s minds since the change: what are we supposed to call a “tweet” now?\n\nMany users have guessed “xeet,” a variation on the original term “tweet.” Posts alleging to be screenshots of the Twitter help center page including the term “xeet” have even circulated on the platform, though notes beneath those tweets have marked them false and a quick visit to the official help page shows only the term “tweet” and no sign of “xeet.”\n\nMusk answered a tweet (xeet? X?) asking the same question, saying simply that posts would now be called “x’s.” For those worried about grammar, Musk has yet to clarify how “tweeted,” “tweet” or other forms of the work will translate – he “xed?” She “xes?” They “x” often? What about that apostrophe in his answer?\n\nThe world does not yet know.\n\nDid Meta already trademark X?\n\nWhile Musk has already fully committed to the brand transformation, some reports have raised legal questions surrounding the use of logo and name X, as a number of other companies have already trademarked the letter for their own use.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Meta holds a trademark for an “X” logo for “online social networking services\" and \"social networking services in the fields of entertainment, gaming, and application development.” Microsoft also has an “X” registered for use in similar software and social media spaces, though both companies hold only a few of the many trademarks filed around the letter.\n\nWhile it is not uncommon for many people and companies to have trademarks on similar word, phrases, images or even letters, the existing rivalry between the brands, especially Meta and Twitter, has led some to speculate a legal battle could ensue.\n\nOther changes\n\nThe transition to “X” is the largest change Musk has announced since earlier this month when he put “temporary limits” on the number of tweets users can read based on their subscription level.\n\nInitially, Musk said verified accounts would be limited to reading 6,000 posts daily and unverified accounts would be limited to only 600. A few hours later, he amended this statement by tweeting that rate limits would increase to 8,000 tweets a day for verified accounts, 800 for unverified and 400 for new accounts. An hour after that, he changed it to a limit of 10,000 a day for verified accounts, 1,000 for unverified and 500 for new accounts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2023/07/24/new-twitter-logo-x-rebrand/70455030007/", "title": "New Twitter logo, X: Elon Musk changes from blue bird in rebrand", "text": "Elon Musk has officially changed Twitter’s logo from the iconic blue bird to a black-and-white “X” – the latest big change since he bought the company for $44 billion last year.\n\nOn Monday, Musk posted a photo of the “X” projected on Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters as the new logo appeared on the desktop version of Twitter. However, the bird is still prominent on the mobile app.\n\nMusk announced his plan to change the logo in a series of Tweets over the weekend where he revealed the new logo and asked users to design a different logo that, if \"good enough,\" would go live worldwide.\n\n“And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” Musk wrote on his Twitter account Sunday.\n\nWhat is 'X?'\n\nIn a series of tweets about the platform rebranding, Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said X will transform the \"global town square.\"\n\n“X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services and opportunities,” she wrote. \"Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.\"\n\nX.com redirects to Twitter\n\nMusk has a history of using the letter X in his career and personal life. He is the CEO of rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which is commonly known as SpaceX. And in 1999, he founded a startup called X.com, an online financial services company now known as PayPal. The x.com web domain now redirects users to Twitter.com.\n\nMusk's son, with the singer Grimes, is also nicknamed \"X.\"\n\nPolitics:Amid Elon Musk's Twitter changes, why 2024 presidential election threats now pose bigger risk\n\nTwitter changes: Musk puts cap on amount of Tweets users can read per day\n\nEarlier this month, Musk announced \"temporary limits\" on the number of tweets users are able to read \"to address extreme levels of data scraping & system manipulation,” he wrote on Twitter.\n\nMusk said verified accounts were “limited to reading 6000 posts/day,\" while unverified accounts were limited to 600 per day. But, about two hours later, he tweeted, \"Rate limits increasing soon to 8000 for verified, 800 for unverified & 400 for new unverified.\"\n\nLess than an hour later, Musk sent a subsequent tweet increasing the limits to 10,000 for verified, 1,000 for unverified and 500 for new unverified users.\n\nContributing: Joel Shannon, Mike Snider, Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-changes/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk now owns Twitter. Here's what he could change | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter spending months attempting to get out of his deal to buy Twitter, Elon Musk officially owns the hugely influential platform. Now the question is: What will he actually do with it?\n\nMusk’s takeover — which was finalized Thursday night, a source familiar with the matter told CNN — not only has the potential to create upheaval for Twitter (TWTR) employees but also for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who use the platform daily. It could also impact the upcoming US midterm elections, if Musk makes good on his promise to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform, most notably former US President Donald Trump, and limit the company’s content restrictions.\n\nIn the first weeks after agreeing to buy the company in April, and before his initial move to bail on the deal, Musk repeatedly stressed that his goal was to bolster “free speech” on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.” The Tesla CEO suggested he would rethink Twitter’s approach to content moderation and permanent bans, with potential impacts on civil discourse and the political landscape. He also talked about his desire to rid the platform of bots, even as he later made the number of bots central to his argument to abandon the deal.\n\nDuring Tesla (TSLA)’s earnings call last week, Musk acknowledged that although finalizing the $44 billion deal meant “overpaying” for the social media firm, “the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.” He added that he believes Twitter has “languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential.”\n\nMusk’s plans for boosting Twitter’s value could involve cutting down its workforce, something he’s hinted at before. Previous reporting suggested that he’d planned to cut 75% of staff, although he is said to have told Twitter staff this week that’s not the case. Either way, anxieties are running high. Musk immediately fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde.\n\nIn private and public statements over the past six months, Musk has tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting this week that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nThere have been more far-fetched suggestions, too. In one text exchange with his brother Kimbal Musk, revealed last week in court documents, the two appeared to discuss the possibility of asking users to pay for each tweet they post with small amounts of the cryptocurrency DogeCoin.\n\nNow that Musk has completed the deal, some of those theoretical changes could soon become reality. Here’s what users should know:\n\nA big shift for content moderation\n\nFor years under former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, Twitter emphasized its work to bolster “healthy conversations.” The company banned many accounts promoting abuse and spam, added labels for false or misleading information, and banned the misgendering of transgender people.\n\nUnder Musk’s ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, members of the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nMusk has said Twitter, under his leadership, would have more lenient content moderation policies. “If in doubt, let the speech exist,” Musk said in one on-stage interview in April. “If it’s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.”\n\nMusk on Thursday sought to reassure advertisers that he doesn’t plan to turn the platform into a “free-for-all hellscape” despite his promises to reduce content moderation. The remarks follow questions about whether advertisers might leave the platform for fear of their paid posts ending up alongside potentially objectionable content.\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” he said in an open letter posted to Twitter. Allowing all legal speech may not be so straight forward — content rules vary across the world and, in Europe, the new Digital Services Act imposes high moderation standards.\n\nMusk has also said he wants to make Twitter’s algorithm open source and make it more transparent to users when, for example, a tweet has been emphasized or demoted in their feed. (Leaders at Twitter have previously expressed support for moving in that direction, and the company often makes clear when it is demoting certain tweets or types of content.)\n\nUnbanning Trump and other accounts\n\nBut the most striking early change could come from who is and is not allowed on a Musk-owned Twitter.\n\nMusk has said he thinks Twitter should be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.” That could mean a long list of controversial far right figures and conspiracy theorists, among others, soon find their way back on the platform.\n\nMusk, for his part, has focused on bringing back one of Twitter’s most prominent former users: Trump.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said in May. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … But my opinion, and Jack Dorsey, I want to be clear, shares this opinion, is that we should not have perma-bans.”\n\nDorsey tweeted following Musk’s May remarks that he does “agree” there shouldn’t be permanent bans on Twitter users. “There are exceptions … but generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don’t work,” he said.\n\nTrump has said he does not want to rejoin Twitter and will instead remain on his own social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nBut if Trump were to accept a Musk offer to return to Twitter, it could restore a significant following he hasn’t had since being banned from the platform in January 2021, just as the 2024 US Presidential race ramps up. On Truth Social, Trump has only 4 million followers; on Twitter, he reached an audience of more than 88 million followers.\n\nAn owner with an erratic and controversial history on the platform\n\nAnother notable change is simply who may be making these sensitive decisions.\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era. But he has also courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has more than 100 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform, and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and has compared the now-ousted Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nMusk also previously sought to remove a Twitter account dedicated to tracking the movements of his private jet by offering to pay off the college freshman running the account (the account owner declined).\n\nThe same day he sent his letter to Twitter attempting to revive the deal, Musk was widely panned for comments he made on the platform about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He suggested making Crimea, a region Russia invaded and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, “formally part of Russia.” Most followers responded “no” to his poll and Ukraine’s Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk replied in a tweet: “F— off is my very diplomatic reply to you.” In a followup tweet, an apparently frustrated Musk seemed to blame the results of his poll on a “bot attack.”\n\nUntil now, Twitter has, at least to some extent, been accountable for its policy decisions to advertisers, shareholders and its board. But those guardrails won’t necessarily exist under Musk’s leadership.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/tech/elon-musk-twitter/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk has taken control of Twitter and fired its top executives ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk has completed his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, a source familiar with the deal told CNN Thursday, putting the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nMusk fired CEO Parag Agrawal and two other executives, according to two people familiar with the decision. Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/tech/elon-musk-twitter-subscription-business/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk has upended Twitter's business. Here's how he could fix it", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMuch of Twitter’s ad sales team has been fired or pushed out. Large companies from General Mills to Macy’s have paused advertising on the platform, with more potentially following suit after new owner Elon Musk’s decision to restore the account of former President Donald Trump and other controversial figures. And any cursory scroll of the platform will likely show you fewer big brand ads.\n\nThat would all seem like horrible news for a business that generates the lion’s share of its revenue from advertising. But Musk may not care.\n\nThe Tesla CEO has previously said he “hates advertising” and, as Twitter’s owner, professed a desire to make the company more reliant on subscription revenue than advertising dollars. Twitter has always struggled to turn its outsized influence in media, politics, and culture into a highly successful advertising business. And without needing to please advertisers, the billionaire would be freer to implement his “free speech” vision for Twitter.\n\n“I’ve always thought that a move to a subscription business would make sense for Twitter … it’s never been a great advertising platform,” said Larry Vincent, associate professor of marketing at USC’s Marshall School of Business. Twitter’s advertising business has long been smaller than that of rivals like Facebook, in part because it didn’t offer the same level of user targeting.\n\nTo successfully overhaul Twitter into a thriving subscription business would be to buck the trend of many other media properties that have struggled with the model. And Musk’s attempts right out of the gate have faltered. An updated, $8-per-month version of the Twitter Blue subscription service that allowed users to buy a verification checkmark had to be halted after just two days when it was abused to impersonate prominent people (notably Musk himself), businesses, and government agencies. Musk initially said he would relaunch the service on November 29, but on Monday suggested he might further delay it “until there is high confidence of stopping impersonation.”\n\nSome industry watchers have also questioned whether, given Twitter’s somewhat niche status as a relatively small platform used largely by members of the media, politicians and academics, such a subscription service could be widely adopted. Even if all 217 million daily users Twitter reported having at the end of 2021 signed up for Musk’s $8 per month subscription, the annual revenue would still be less than a quarter of the size of rival Meta’s.\n\nStill, some industry insiders have reason to think he can pull it off. “Twitter over the last month has been far more entertaining than Netflix and easily worth $8,” Roy Price, the founder of Amazon Studios, said in a tweet Saturday. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a tweet, “don’t underestimate” Musk. And Twitch co-founder Justin Kan tweeted that he thinks Twitter is “likely to survive just fine (and potentially thrive!)” in part because, unlike some high-profile users who have announced their departure from the platform, most regular users likely don’t care about who’s leading the platform and how.\n\nIndeed, Musk’s shift away from advertising and toward a subscription model could work if Twitter can survive having its entire revenue decimated beforehand, keep its systems up and running, avoid violating laws around copyright infringement and hate speech, and also remain in good standing with Apple and Google, which control the app stores on which Twitter depends.\n\nThe stakes to pull it off are significant for Musk. After borrowing billions of dollars to finance the Twitter takeover, Musk is up against the clock to turn what was already a struggling business into a company that can generate enough cash flow to pay back his debt. He may also risk his reputation as “a gifted and audacious entrepreneur who made Tesla work against widespread doubts and naysaying,” said Robert Bruner, professor of business administration at University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business.\n\nTwitter’s ad woes\n\nWhether he likes advertising or not, the business made up 90% of Twitter’s revenue prior to Musk’s takeover and replacing it won’t be an immediate shift.\n\nIn the wake of the chaos at Twitter in recent weeks, there has been talk of brands quitting the platform out of concern that their ads could end up next to objectionable content. But that may not be the only or even primary reason advertisers have walked away — or why attracting new ones could be tricky. Advertisers are also likely on edge about Twitter’s stability, as users and former employees raise concerns that the mass exodus of staff could leave the platform vulnerable to glitches and outages.\n\nBrands may also be miffed that many of Twitter’s ad sales employees who managed their campaigns have been fired or pushed out, including after another round of layoffs and exits Monday.\n\nLarge digital platforms “have experienced professionals out there who develop relationships with these advertisers,” Vincent said. “When you let go of a staff that was as veteran as Twitter’s and there’s no one there to respond to those [brands], you basically reduce the value of the ad platform.”\n\nBy bringing Trump and other controversial figures back to the platform, Twitter may have greater appeal to the right-leaning advertisers that do business on alternative platforms like Trump’s Truth Social. While there is a market to advertise to “people buying gold, people buying survivalist home kits, guns and weapons,” Twitter has long been known as a more politically neutral, if not somewhat left-leaning, platform and may struggle to attract such companies, said Michael Serazio, a communications professor at Boston College.\n\nLife beyond ads\n\nMusk is also going to have to contend with potential pressure from regulators, as well as the app store operators at Apple and Google, if he wants to succeed in turning Twitter’s business around. A group of US senators has already called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Musk’s Twitter over potential violations of the company’s 2011 consent decree. And Europe’s Digital Services Act may impose limits on just how free Musk’s “free speech” Twitter can be.\n\nIn an op-ed published in the New York Times last week, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, who left the company earlier this month, said the company’s failure to adhere to Google and Apple’s app store rules could be “catastrophic.” The app stores have previously removed social media apps for failing to protect their users from harmful content, and Roth suggested that Twitter had already begun to receive calls from app store operators following Musk’s takeover. Over the weekend, the head of Apple’s app store, Phil Schiller, deleted his Twitter account.\n\nMost importantly, Twitter will have to keep users invested in the platform if Musk’s subscription strategy is going to work. And it’s not just existing users — Musk will also need to attract new people to the platform, which has long struggled to break out of its niche status and grow its user base, by ensuring it’s filled with must-read content.\n\nIn the weeks since Musk took over Twitter — which was immediately followed by an uptick in hateful content — there has been much hand-waving from users about moving to other platforms, and several high-profile accounts have announced their exits, including director Shonda Rimes and model Gigi Hadid. But it’s not clear that there has been a broad drop-off in the user base; instead, Musk has claimed in tweets that platform usage is at an all-time high.\n\nSo long as Musk can keep Twitter functioning properly despite having fewer employees, many users will likely stick around, perhaps even more so following the return of controversial accounts that tend to make news with incendiary comments on the platform. Musk himself has pointed out that even as people fret about the demise of Twitter, they’re doing it on the platform itself. And the billionaire has proposed making it easier for creators to earn money on the platform, which could also drive usage.\n\nEven still, there is no guarantee that continuing to capture the online world’s attention will translate into subscription payments or other revenue growth.\n\n“Even as both Musk and Trump are driven by the gravity of the attention economy, it doesn’t mean that they’ll be able to cash in on it,” Serazio said. He said Musk likely made the decision to restore Trump’s account because “it was going to cause headlines, it was going to cause attention,” adding that “the attention won’t save Twitter … but I don’t know that [Musk] has any other strategy other than the attention economy, even if he doesn’t know how to profit from it.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/07/24/northwestern-hazing-twitter-rebrand-greece-wildfires-mondays-news/70435048007/", "title": "Northwestern hazing, Twitter rebrand, Greece wildfires: Monday's ...", "text": "New allegations of hazing at Northwestern University.

Twitter (TWTR) stock was halted twice, the second time for news pending. After the stock resumed trading, it was up more than 20%, topping $51 a share and approaching the agreed upon deal price for the first time in months.\n\nThe news comes as the the two sides have been preparing to head to trial in two weeks over Musk’s attempt to terminate of the $44 billion acquisition agreement, which Twitter had sued him to complete. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal had been set to be deposed by Musk’s lawyers on Monday, and Twitter’s lawyers had planned to depose Musk starting on Thursday.\n\nIt also follows the release on Friday of a trove of Musk’s personal text messages about the deal. The messages offered a look at the cast of Silicon Valley insiders and billionaires — from Larry Ellison to members of the Murdoch family — who contacted him to weigh in on and, in some cases, offer financing for the deal.\n\nSuch an agreement could bring to an end a contentious, months-long back and forth between Musk and Twitter that has caused massive uncertainty for employees, investors and users of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nThe ball will now be in Twitter’s court to determine how to respond to Musk’s proposal. Twitter’s board will likely agree to move forward with closing the deal, according to Josh White, assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt University.\n\n“The very public saga has certainly taken a toll on them and Twitter employees,” White said. “It is best for all parties to finish the deal and make a quick and seamless transition. I suspect it will close quickly.”\n\nHowever, Twitter may not want to hit pause on the litigation, per Musk’s proposal, until the deal is officially closed, according to Columbia Law School professor Eric Talley. The company may want to proceed with the litigation process as it negotiates with Musk, in case his offer to complete the deal falls through again.\n\n“Twitter is probably going to say, ‘look, we definitely want to engage you on this … But we’ve still got a trial on Oct 17 and until this is signed, sealed and delivered, we’ve got to get ready for trial,” Talley said.\n\nThe saga began in April when Musk revealed he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder. Over the next several months, Musk accepted and then backed out of an offer to sit on Twitter’s board, threatened a hostile takeover of the company, signed an agreement to buy the company, started raising concerns about bots on the platform, attempted to terminate the agreement, was sued by Twitter to follow through with the deal and added claims from a Twitter whistleblower to his argument.\n\nMusk initially moved to terminate the deal citing claims that the company has misstated the number of spam and fake bot accounts on the platform. Twitter claimed that Musk had breached the deal and was using bots as a pretext to exit a deal he’d gotten buyer’s remorse over after the broader market decline, which also hurt Tesla stock and, by extension, Musk’s personal wealth.\n\nThroughout the back and forth, Twitter had maintained that it planned to follow through with deal at the price and terms originally agreed upon.\n\nMany legal experts have said that Twitter has the stronger argument heading into court, and that Musk would a face a significant burden in trying to prove that the company had made materially misleading statements in its securities filings or in the deal contract.\n\nThe lawsuit was the final hurdle remaining in the way of the deal getting closed, after Twitter shareholders last month voted to approve the deal. The deal had originally been set to close this month.\n\nWith news that the deal could end up closing, attention may once again shift to what Musk’s control could mean for the social media platform.\n\nMusk has previously suggested a series of potential changes to Twitter, the most significant of which could be returning former President Donald Trump to the platform and doing away with permanent account bans. Musk has also said he wants to make Twitter more open to “free speech” and could change its content moderation policies.\n\nTwitter employees have also raised questions about what a Musk takeover could mean for benefits such as remote working and parental leave.\n\nTwitter General Counsel Sean Edgett said in a message to employees Tuesday that the company had received Musk’s letter and planned to close the deal at $54.20 per share. “I will continue to keep you posted on significant updates, but in the meantime, thank you for your patience as we work through this on the legal side,” he said, according to a copy of the message obtained by CNN.\n\nBlind, an anonymous private forum popular among Twitter employees, was abuzz on Tuesday amid reports about Musk’s reversal. Reaction on the forum was overwhelmingly negative, according to screenshots provided to CNN by a Twitter employee.\n\n“Cue the layoffs,” one comment read. Several other employees expressed fear that Musk would roll back Twitter’s benefits package, including the severance offered to departing employees.\n\n–CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/tech/elon-musk-twitter-deal-financing/index.html", "title": "The fate of Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter now comes down to the ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe countdown is now on for Elon Musk and Twitter to close their $44 billion acquisition deal by October 28 or be forced to again prepare for a trial after a judge agreed on Thursday pause the legal proceedings.\n\nWhat everyone is now waiting on: Musk needs to actually have the money to hand over.\n\nEven the world’s richest man needs a little help for an acquisition of this size. In April, Musk announced he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing for the deal, including two debt commitment letters from Morgan Stanley and other unnamed financial institutions (one for $13 billion and another for $12.5 billion, the latter of which was later reduced to $6.25 billion). Musk himself also committed approximately $21 billion in equity to fund the deal, and later raised an additional $7 billion in equity from investors such as Oracle founder Larry Ellison and cryptocurrency firm Binance.\n\nMuch of the sticking point between Musk and Twitter (TWTR) now appears to be over uncertainty around the status of those financing arrangements.\n\nMusk’s team had said in a filing earlier Thursday that there was no need to press on with the ligation because he had committed to closing the deal at the originally agreed upon terms and the banks that had committed debt financing to help him pay for it were “working cooperatively to fund the close.”\n\nTwitter — skeptical after Musk spent months trying to get out of the deal and also wanting to keep the pressure of a trial hanging over him — opposed pausing the proceedings. It raised concerns in a separate filing that an unnamed representative of one of the banks had testified Thursday morning that Musk had not yet sent a borrowing notice and “has not otherwise communicated to them that he intends to close the transaction, let alone on any particular timeline.” Twitter also said Musk should close the deal by next week.\n\nMany legal experts think Musk really is planning to close the deal this time, the most certain anyone has sounded since he first said the deal was “on hold” in May and moved to terminate the agreement in July. Many following the case think that Musk saw the writing on the wall that he was likely to lose at trial and be forced to buy Twitter anyway — spending more money and further damaging the company he would ultimately have to take over in the process.\n\n“I think Musk does intend to close the deal, and I think his reasons for not closing it this second are probably somewhat straightforward,” said Ann Lipton, associate professor of business law at Tulane Law School. The likely reasons, she said, have to do with the time it takes for Musk to finish pulling together all the previously announced financing arrangements in order to close the deal.\n\nMusk is likely trying to help Morgan Stanley market the debt to other investors before telling them to hand him the money to close the deal, according to Lipton. While Musk isn’t required to do that, it would do a favor for a bank that he’s had more than a decade-long relationship with, given the economic environment is more difficult now than when the agreements were first made.\n\nSome have speculated about whether Morgan Stanley and the other banks providing debt financing could try to walk away from the deal now because Twitter is arguably even less valuable now than when the deal was first struck, after Musk spent months making claims about its flaws and following broader social media and digital advertising market declines.\n\nBut the bank could face legal ramifications if it tries to back out of its commitment now.\n\n“The only way they could get out of it is to claim a material adverse effect and that Twitter has changed so much since they agreed to the deal that they no longer want to finance the deal,” said George Geis, professor of strategy at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.\n\nEven if the banks tried to back out, Musk may not automatically be off the hook. According to the merger agreement, Musk could in theory walk away from the deal with a $1 billion breakup payment to Twitter if his debt financing were to fall through. However, if Delaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick were to find that Musk was at fault for the financing falling through after his months of disparaging the company, he could potentially face a court order to sue Morgan Stanley to provide the funds or close the deal without it.\n\nDebt financing aside, Musk may also still need a bit more cash to fund his equity portion of the deal, which could require him to sell off more Tesla (TSLA) shares, Lipton said, and he’ll have to wait a few days to be able to do that. Tesla (TSLA) is set to report quarterly earnings on Oct. 19 and executives are typically required not to sell shares in the days prior to an earnings report. (Musk also presumably has a large stake in SpaceX, but because the company is not publicly traded, it’s not clear what it would take to liquidate them on short notice.)\n\nAnother cause for some delay: Musk could also be trying to ensure his equity partners are still on board despite all the upheaval he’s created for Twitter over the past several months. Geis said those investors may currently be asking themselves the question: “How should I balance the risk of [participating in] this deal versus the risk of losing my relationship with Musk [if I don’t]?”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/tech/elon-musk-twitter-advertising-fallout/index.html", "title": "After Elon Musk's antics on Twitter, advertisers may think twice for ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nHours before news broke on Thursday that he had completed his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, Elon Musk wrote an open letter to advertisers stressing that he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all hellscape.”\n\nBut that attempt at reassuring the advertising industry, which makes up the vast majority of Twitter’s business, was quickly overshadowed by Musk’s first days as the new owner of the platform. Some industry experts are now predicting an advertiser exodus could be coming sooner than expected.\n\nWithin the first 24 hours of his ownership, there were several reports that racist comments, hate speech and other objectionable content had increased significantly on Twitter as users tested Musk’s promise that he would allow “free speech” on the platform. Then over the weekend, Musk was widely criticized for tweeting (then deleting without providing a reason) a link to a fringe conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n“I think advertisers are bracing to leave,” said Claire Atkin, co-founder of the adtech watchdog Check My Ads. “It’s very possibly a seismic shift for marketers and advertisers.”\n\nAfter months of uncertainty about Musk’s pending acquisition, advertisers must now confront questions around how Musk will change the platform, which is already an also-ran in the digital ad space despite its outsized political influence. Musk, known as both an innovative entrepreneur and an erratic figure, has promised to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies and undo permanent bans of controversial figures, including former President Donald Trump.\n\nBrands have long been sensitive to the types of content their ads run against, an issue made more complicated by social media. Most marketers bristle at the thought of having their ads run alongside toxic content such as hate speech, pornography or misinformation. And if Twitter continues to struggle with an uptick in such content — or if Musk updates Twitter’s policies to explicitly allow some of it — companies may cease advertising there for fear of risks to their brands, or because they’re reaching a smaller audience if regular users also depart.\n\n“If you think about the money, investment and care, real care and attention that goes into connecting with consumers, and then to have your ad be published next to lies … it goes against everything a brand wants to do,” Atkin said.\n\nMusk, who has previously tweeted “I hate advertising” and indicated he wants to make the platform less reliant on it, is also confronting the reality that about 90% of Twitter’s revenue comes from advertising. In addition to the open letter to advertisers, Musk’s team spent Monday “meeting with the marketing and advertising community” in New York, according to Jason Calacanis, a member of Musk’s inner circle.\n\nIn public and private conversations with advertisers, Twitter has also stressed that its content policies have not changed following the acquisition, and Musk has said they won’t change until a new content moderation council is appointed (apparently to replace the company’s existing Trust and Safety council).\n\nBut Musk may face an uphill battle. Twitter’s digital advertising business is much smaller than those of Meta, Google and Amazon, and doesn’t have growth and user demographics of TikTok. And many brands have already reduced digital ad spending in recent months amid the economic downturn. It may not take much for brands to cut back more.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM), which competes with Musk’s Tesla (TSLA), said on Friday it would pause paying for advertising on Twitter while it evaluates “Twitter’s new direction.” CNN on Monday reached out to more than a dozen other brands that advertise on Twitter, most of which did not respond. Toyota (TM), another Tesla (TSLA) competitor, told CNN that it is “in discussions with key stakeholders and monitoring the situation” on Twitter. Ben & Jerry’s said that “at this point we have not considered taking any action.”\n\nOn Monday, advertising giant Interpublic Group advised clients to pause advertising on Twitter for the next week as it awaits more clarity on the platform’s plans for trust and safety and its capacity to carry out those plans under new owner Elon Musk, a person familiar with the situation told CNN. The guidance was sent via an internal memo to IPG employees who work with clients in its Mediabrands ad-buying arm, which include major consumer brands including Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Spotify, Unilever and more.\n\nAlso on Monday, the Global Alliance of Responsible Media, a leading consortium of advertisers and platforms, including Twitter, published an open letter to Musk, encouraging him to ensure Twitter continues to align with the group’s standards, which designate hate speech, violence, harassment and insensitive treatment of debated social issues as “not appropriate for any advertising support.” In response to the letter, Musk said in a tweet, “Twitter’s commitment to brand safety is unchanged,” and Twitter Chief Customer Officer Sarah Personette added that the company takes seriously brand safety and its partnership with the organization. (Personette tweeted on Tuesday that she resigned from the company last week.)\n\nAlso on Monday, Angelo Carusone, CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America, tweeted calling on major Twitter advertisers “to be putting pressure on Twitter right now” to better address the increase in hate and other toxic content. On Tuesday, a group of more than 40 civil society organizations, including Media Matters, the NAACP, GLAAD and the Center for Countering Digital Hate, sent an open letter to Twitter’s top advertisers calling on them to halt advertising on the platform if Musk cuts back on content moderation.\n\n“Advertisers are very sensitive to the changing landscape of social media,” said Atkin, adding that the question for Twitter is now “whether Elon Musk can continue to broker trust with advertisers or if he’s going to continue to sow uncertainty and fear.”\n\nIn response to a request for comment on this story, a Twitter representative pointed CNN to the earlier tweets by Musk and Personette and Musk’s letter to advertisers, as well as a tweet by Twitter Head of Safety and Integrity Yoel Roth noting that the platform’s policies hadn’t changed, although it was facing an uptick in hate content from mostly non-human accounts.\n\nIn a separate tweet thread Monday, Roth said that the company had since Saturday “been focused on addressing the surge in hateful conduct on Twitter.” He added: “We’ve made measurable progress, removing more than 1500 accounts and reducing impressions on this content to nearly zero.”\n\n‘A reasonable time to rethink things’\n\nOne advertising executive told CNN on Monday that dozens of their clients had reached out in recent days for guidance on the situation.\n\n“It seems like a reasonable time for advertisers to rethink things,” said David Karpf, associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. “I think advertisers are going to look at this and say, is the weak Twitter advertising product becoming a better or worse investment? And it’s going to be the same or a little worse … advertisers certainly aren’t going to start spending more on Twitter anytime soon.”\n\nThere is precedent for advertisers stepping away from platforms because of hateful content. In 2020, dozens of brands publicly signed on to the #StopHateForProfit advertiser boycott of Facebook, which called out the platform for its “repeated failure to meaningfully address the vast proliferation of hate on its platforms.”\n\nBut when it comes to Twitter, brands may have to tread carefully to avoid backlash. After GM announced its Twitter advertising pause, some users on the platform, including some right-leaning political figures, have called for a boycott of the automaker.\n\nBecause Musk has positioned himself as a “free speech” maximalist, and one with strong support among many conservative politicians, brands risk being framed as anti-free speech if they exit the platform. But brands also risk appearing to implicitly endorse hate speech and other harmful content if they stay, meaning that many may decide to quietly pause their advertising on the site without a formal announcement.\n\n“Advertisers are finding it hard to weigh in publicly on what is kind of an unwinnable position to take,” the advertising executive told CNN.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/tech/twitter-ceo-deposition-musk/index.html", "title": "Twitter CEO and Elon Musk depositions did not begin Monday ...", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk and Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal did not sit for depositions Monday as part of an ongoing merger lawsuit despite earlier scheduling notices filed in a Delaware court, marking another twist in a closely watched case about the future of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nThe testimony of both men is considered central in the litigation over Musk’s deal to buy — and then his attempt to get out of buying — Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nEarlier court filings had indicated Musk would be deposed starting on Sept. 26, while a filing Saturday said Agrawal was also due to be questioned starting Monday morning. One person familiar with the matter said Agrawal’s deposition is being rescheduled.\n\nSources familiar with the situation told CNN the dates listed in deposition notices filed with the court are not always the dates that the two sides agree to officially begin the questioning. Still, the two sides appeared to be at odds about the plans.\n\nMusk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, had flown to San Francisco Sunday expecting to take part in Monday’s deposition of Agrawal, another of the people familiar with the case told CNN. That day, Musk’s team learned of Agrawal’s rescheduling, the person said. It was not immediately clear whether a new date has been selected.\n\nTwitter declined to comment.\n\nMusk’s deposition notice dated Sept. 19 said the entrepreneur was set to testify in Delaware starting Monday morning; however, Spiro said Monday afternoon Musk was not actually scheduled to be questioned on that date.\n\nMusk is still expected to be deposed this week, one of the people familiar said.\n\nThe adjustments to the schedule come ahead of a three-hour hearing scheduled for Tuesday in which the two sides will present arguments on several outstanding discovery matters, including Musk’s team’s request for some additional account data from Twitter and a request from Twitter related to a court order requiring Musk’s team to produce information related to its expert analysis of bots on the platform. Materials gathered during discovery, such as internal documents and communications, are often used to inform the questioning during depositions, Brooklyn Law School Professor Andrew Jennings told CNN.\n\n“Depositions are a time that culminates the discovery process,” Jennings said, adding that the two sides may want to wait to complete such key depositions until they receive materials related to their outstanding discovery requests. “There may still be some back and forth on document discovery, unsettled disputes that are driving some of this.”\n\nMusk has sought to extricate himself from the merger agreement, first by claiming that Twitter’s spam account problem is far greater than it has let on, and later by citing allegations of longstanding unaddressed security vulnerabilities disclosed by the company’s former head of security, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko.\n\nThose allegations, which were also submitted to the US government under a whistleblower process, were first reported by CNN and The Washington Post last month.\n\nAgrawal’s deposition could be a chance for Musk’s team to question him about Zatko’s whistleblower allegations. Zatko led Twitter’s security team from November 2020 until he was fired in January. Twitter has previously said that Zatko’s allegations paint a “false narrative” of the company and that Musk’s claims are “factually inaccurate, legally insufficient and commercially irrelevant.”\n\nEarlier this month, leading members of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent Agrawal a letter seeking similar information, and requested responses by Sept. 26, but it is not clear whether Twitter has responded to the letter. The committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Agrawal also turned down an invitation to testify at a Senate committee hearing alongside Zatko earlier this month citing the litigation with Musk, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\nTwitter and Musk are set to go to trial over the acquisition dispute in mid-October.", "authors": ["Brian Fung Clare Duffy Donie O'Sullivan", "Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}]}

Consisting of parts of discarded rockets, spacecraft and satellites, the European Space Agency (ESA) estimates there are now 36,500 objects of space debris greater than 10cm in near-Earth orbit, along with more than 130 million smaller objects.\n\nMost of this space junk is moving up to seven times the speed of a bullet, meaning “an object no bigger than a penny could easily destroy a spacecraft”, said BBC Science Focus.\n\n“These objects pose more than just a hypothetical threat,” according to Space.com. From 1999 to May 2021, the International Space Station (ISS) conducted 29 debris-avoiding manoeuvres, including three in 2020 alone, said Nasa. This number continues to grow.\n\nEven more worryingly, said Dr Alastair Gunn in Science Focus, a “critical mass” of space junk “may be only a few decades away, where one major collision results in an uncontrollable chain reaction, causing untold damage”.\n\nThis is known as the Kessler Syndrome, named after the former Nasa scientist Donald Kessler who laid out the idea of a orbital debris chain-reaction in a seminal 1978 paper. It featured in the 2013 Oscar-winning film “Gravity” and could make space travel impossible in the future, also disrupting our complex web of satellites so crucial to global communications.\n\nWhat can be done to clean up space?\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Space.com, “private companies and national governments have been slow to act.”\n\nMost of the efforts focus on mitigation and avoidance of generating space junk in the first place but this does not address the huge amount of debris already there.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2023/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/australia/australia-plesiosaur-fossil-discovery-intl-hnk-scn/index.html", "title": "Plesiosaur: Fossil hunters in Australia discover 100 million-year-old ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe discovery of a giant 100 million-year-old marine reptile’s skeleton in Australia has been hailed by researchers as a breakthrough that may provide vital clues about prehistoric life.\n\nThe remains of the 6-meter (19 feet) tall juvenile long-necked plesiosaur, also known as an elasmosaur, were found by a trio of amateur fossil hunters on a cattle station in the western Queensland outback in August.\n\nEspen Knutsen, senior curator of palaeontology at the Queensland Museum, likened the discovery to that of the Rosetta Stone – the Ancient Egyptian block of granite rediscovered in 1799 that helped experts to decode hieroglyphics.\n\n“We have never found a body and a head together and this could hold the key to future research in this field,” Knutsen said in a statement Wednesday that confirmed the discovery, adding it could give paleontologists greater insight into the origins, evolution and ecology of the cretaceous period in the region.\n\n“Because these plesiosaurs were two-thirds neck, often the head would be separated from the body after death, which makes it very hard to find a fossil preserving both together,” he said.\n\nThe discovery was made by amateur paleontologists known as the “Rock Chicks” – Cassandra Prince, her sister Cynthia, and fellow fossil sleuth Sally, who goes only by her first name.\n\nThe skull of the 100 million-year-old plesiosaur found in Queensland, Australia.

The hair was examined for years by a team of DNA experts at the University of Adelaide, who provided the DNA information that allowed Abbott and Fitzpatrick to further narrow the field.\n\nBy March, Abbott said he had already established Webb’s name through years of painstaking work with Fitzpatrick to build a complex family tree of around 4,000 names that led to Webb, whose date of death had not been recorded.\n\n“By filling out this tree, we managed to find a first cousin three times removed on his mother’s side,” said Abbott. And on July 23, they matched DNA obtained from the hair to DNA tests taken by Webb’s distant relatives.\n\n“It’s like one of these folklore mysteries that everybody wants to solve and we did it,” said Fitzpatrick, who has investigated other cold cases including the disappearance of Amelia Earhart in 1937 and the 1948 crash of Northwest Flight 4422.\n\n“It just felt like I climbed and I was at the top of Mount Everest,” said Abbott of the moment they made the apparent DNA match.\n\nWhile the discovery appears to close the file on the Somerton man mystery, the apparent confirmation of Webb’s name raises many more questions about who he was – and how he died.\n\nIf verified, it also creates more questions about the strange clues around the case – including the final words of a Persian poem found in his fob pocket and what appeared to be wartime code scribbled in a book, that for many years prompted speculation that he was a spy.\n\nThose clues can now be reinterpreted with information from public records, but the full truth may only emerge with time as word of the man’s reported identity spreads.\n\nCode found scribbled in a book added intrigue to the mystery. Courtesy Derek Abbott\n\nWho was the Somerton man?\n\nThe Somerton man mystery began in the early hours of December 1, 1948, when beachgoers found a body lying on Somerton beach in Adelaide. The man was well-built, about 40 to 50 years old, 5 feet, 11 inches (1.8 meters) tall, and had gray-blue eyes and gingery-brown hair that was graying at the sides.\n\nHe wasn’t carrying identification, forcing police to look for other clues, according to an inquest held in the years after his death by investigators keen to close the case.\n\nIn his pockets, they found tickets that suggested he had taken the train to Adelaide Railway Station the day before, and checked in a suitcase in the station’s luggage room. The suitcase contained clothes with the labels torn off, and police told the inquest that a tailor thought his coat had US origins. Despite those clues, the case didn’t supply them with a name either, the inquest heard.\n\nForensic VR specialist Daniel Voshart created this visual representation of the Somerton man. Courtesy Daniel Voshart\n\nThe man’s fingerprints and photograph were sent around the world, including to the United Kingdom, United States, and English-speaking countries in Africa. A letter dated January 1949, signed by FBI director John Edgar Hoover, confirmed the US had found no match for his fingerprints in its files, the inquest heard.\n\nPerhaps the most baffling clues came several months after the body was found. A pathologist re-examined his clothing and found a hidden fob pocket containing a rolled-up piece of paper printed with the words “Tamam Shud,” meaning “the end” or “finished” in Persian.\n\nThey are the final words of the poem “The Rubaiyat,” by 11th century Iranian polymath Omar Khayyam, and had been torn from a book later handed in to police. An unnamed man said he found it discarded in his car on November 30, the day before the Somerton man’s death. The man had no further information, but the book supplied yet more baffling clues.\n\nPolice traced a handwritten phone number on its back cover to a woman who lived in the nearby Adelaide suburb of Glenelg. She was reportedly horrified when shown the death mask, though denied she knew the man. Near the phone number were scribbled letters that some surmised could be a secret wartime code, though all attempts to decipher it have failed.\n\nIt now appears the truth is potentially more pedestrian.\n\nWho was Carl ‘Charles’ Webb?\n\nAccording to Abbott, Webb was born on November 16, 1905 in Footscray, a suburb of Victoria’s state capital Melbourne. He was the youngest of six siblings.\n\nLittle is known about his early life, Abbott says, but he later married Dorothy Robertson – known as Doff Webb.\n\nWhen Webb emerged as the prime person of interest on the family tree, Abbott and Fitzpatrick set to work, scouring public records for information about him. They checked electoral rolls, police files and legal documents. Unfortunately, there were no photos of him to make a visual match.\n\n“The last known record we have of him is in April 1947 when he left Dorothy,” said Fitzpatrick, founder of Identifinders International, a genealogical research agency involved in some of America’s most high-profile cold cases.\n\n“He disappeared and she appeared in court, saying that he had disappeared and she wanted to divorce,” Fitzpatrick said. They had no known children.\n\nFitzpatrick and Abbott say Robertson filed for divorce in Melbourne, but 1951 documents revealed she had moved to Bute, South Australia – 144 kilometers (89 miles) northeast of Adelaide – establishing a link to the neighboring state, where the body was found.\n\n“It’s possible that he came to this state to try and find her,” Abbott speculated. “This is just us drawing the dots. We can’t say for certain say that this is the reason he came, but it seems logical.”\n\nThe information on public record about Webb sheds some light on the mysteries that have surrounded the case. They reveal he liked betting on horses, which may explain the “code” found in the book, said Abbott, who had long speculated that the letters could correspond to horses’ names.\n\nAnd the “Tamam Shud” poem? Webb liked poetry and even wrote his own, Abbott said, based on his research.\n\nWhat evidence is there?\n\nBack in 1949, when no one came forward to identify the body, it was embalmed and a plaster cast was made of the man’s face, as a physical reminder of who he was. Some hair inadvertently became trapped in the plaster preserving some DNA, while the rest of his body was buried.\n\nDecades later, in 1995, Abbott heard about the case and set about trying to unravel it.\n\nA plaster cast was made of the Somerton man's face when efforts to discover his identity failed. State Records of South Australia\n\nIn 2011, SA Police gave Abbott access to 50 hairs found embedded in the Somerton man’s mask, so scientists at the University of Adelaide could attempt to extract the DNA. Around 20 people at the university worked on the project over the years, Abbott said.\n\nCNN has reached out to the University of Adelaide for comment on Abbott’s findings.\n\nIn 2012, the university team extracted DNA from the hair showing the Somerton Man’s maternal group. Then several years later they made a “major breakthrough” to refine the halogroup further to H4a1a1a, Abbott said.\n\nBy that time, Abbott and Fitzpatrick had been working for years to re-examine clues from his body and the suitcase – anything that might shed more light on the case.\n\nThey said they used forensic genealogy to mine DNA databases to build the family tree that led to Webb, confirmed by the work on the pieces of hair.\n\n“This is probably one of the older cases that had been solved using this methodology,” said Fitzpatrick. “This hair is not only 70 years old, but it’s been in a plaster cast for 70 years.”\n\nAdelaide Cemetery Authority pall bearers carry the body of the exhumed Somerton man, May 19, 2021. MARK BRAKE/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nAbbott said he had not taken his findings to SA Police, as they were conducting a “parallel investigation.”\n\n“Their protocol is not to talk about a case until their part is done,” he said. “They will most likely approach us (University of Adelaide) after our announcement. The DNA findings are incontrovertible. “\n\nFor Fitzpatrick, there are now more questions to answer.\n\n“I’m really very interested in helping solve the mystery of how he died,” she said. “I would like to see the toxicology done. And I would like to find out what happened to Dorothy.”\n\nAbbott says they’re convinced they’ve found their man. “In anything like this, you can only be 99.999% sure that it’s right,” he said. “Strange things can happen. There can be a twist.”\n\n“Just say, hypothetically, what if this guy had a brother that was adopted out of birth that we don’t know about and it’s really his brother?” But he says that’s probably unlikely.\n\nDerek Abbott and Rachel Egan met during his search for clues to the identity of the Somerton man. Courtesy Rachel Egan\n\nDNA has also definitively put to rest speculation that the Somerton man was the grandfather of Abbott’s wife Rachel Egan, Abbott said. The couple met when his search for answers led him to her father, Robin Thomson, who seemed to share some of the same physical attributes. Abbott says finding out there was no link was “a great relief.”\n\n“It was just the tension of not knowing either way,” he said. “So it’s a relief just to know the truth.”\n\nAbbott now hopes their findings will be publicly verified, and others will build on the information to create a fuller picture of the Somerton man – now thought to be Carl “Charles” Webb – not a spy but a Victorian man who died one day alone on a beach.", "authors": ["Hilary Whiteman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/world/seagrass-australia-worlds-largest-plant-living-organism-scn/index.html", "title": "World's largest plant discovered in Australia | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe world’s largest living plant has been identified in the shallow waters off the coast of Western Australia, according to scientists.\n\nThe sprawling seagrass, a marine flowering plant known as Posidonia australis, stretches for more than 112 miles (180 kilometers) in Shark Bay, a wilderness area protected as a World Heritage site, said Elizabeth Sinclair, a senior research fellow at the School of Biological Sciences and Oceans Institute at The University of Western Australia.\n\nThat’s about the distance between San Diego and Los Angeles.\n\nThe plant is so large because it clones itself, creating genetically identical offshoots. This process is a way of reproducing that is rare in the animal kingdom although it happens in certain environmental conditions and occurs more often among some plants, fungi and bacteria.\n\n“We often get asked how many different plants are growing in a seagrass meadow. Here we used genetic tools to answer it,” said Sinclair, the author of a study on the seagrass that published late Tuesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\n“The answer definitely surprised us – just ONE! That’s it, just one plant has expanded over 180 km in Shark Bay, making it the largest known plant on Earth,” she said via email.\n\nAn aerial image of Shark Bay, including the seagrass, which appear as dark patches in the water. Angela Rossen\n\nSinclair and her colleagues took samples from 10 locations across the range of the seagrass meadow in Shark Bay in 2012 and 2019. The research team also measured the environmental conditions including depth, water temperature and salinity.\n\n“We have been studying cool water seagrasses in southern Australia for a while, to understand how much genetic diversity is in them and how connected the meadows are,” Sinclair said.\n\nThe scientists were able to sequence DNA from the seagrass samples, which revealed that it was a single plant.\n\n“The plant has been able to continue growing through vegetative growth – extending its rhizomes (rootstalks) outwards – the way a buffalo grass would in your back garden, extending runners outwards. The only difference is that the seagrass rhizomes are under a sandy seafloor so you don’t see them, just the shoots within the water column,” she said.\n\n“What was even more interesting was that it has double the number of chromosomes than in other populations we had been studying. It has 40, not the usual 20,” she added.\n\nSeagrasses inhabit marine coastlines and estuaries globally.\n\nThe study suggested that reproducing via cloning helped the seagrass meadow adapt to habitat conditions that were more extreme than where seagrass is usually found – saltier water, high levels of light and wide temperature fluctuations.\n\nThe seagrass meadow covered almost 200 square kilometers (77 square miles or 49,000 acres), Sinclair said – bigger than Brooklyn. That’s a much larger area than the Pando quaking Aspen trees in Utah, which are often described as the world’s largest plant. The clone spreads over 106 acres, consisting of over 40,000 individual trees, according to the USDA Forest Service.\n\nAt about 4,500 years old, the Shark Bay seagrass is ancient, but its age isn’t record-breaking, the researchers said. A Posidonia oceanica plant discovered in the western Mediterranean that spans up to 9.3 miles (15 kilometers) may be greater than 100,000 years old.\n\n“Individual seagrass clones may persist almost indefinitely if left undisturbed, as they rely on vegetative, horizontal rhizome expansion, rather than sexual reproduction,” Sinclair said.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/world/shuttle-challenger-nasa-discovered-documentary-crew-scn/index.html", "title": "Space Shuttle Challenger remnants discovered underwater | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nExplorers trudged the Atlantic Ocean searching for World War II artifacts lost at sea, but they stumbled on something else — a 20-foot-long piece of debris from the Space Shuttle Challenger, which was destroyed shortly after takeoff in 1986.\n\nThe History Channel and NASA revealed Thursday that the Challenger segment was discovered off Florida’s east coast during the filming of a new series called “The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters.” The series is set to premiere this month on the History Channel.\n\nThe Challenger broke apart after its launch on January 28, 1986, killing all seven crew members aboard, including a teacher was set to become the first civilian in space. TV viewers, especially students in schools across the US, watched a live broadcast of the blast in horror that morning.\n\n“NASA currently is considering what additional actions it may take regarding the artifact that will properly honor the legacy of Challenger’s fallen astronauts and the families who loved them,” the space agency said in a news release.\n\nMike Barnette, an underwater explorer who led the crew that found the shuttle artifact, remembers watching the tragedy on TV in his high school classroom. He called it “sobering” to realize that his team found a scrap from the spacecraft — the first debris to be discovered since pieces from the shuttle washed ashore in 1996.\n\n“I can almost smell the smells of that day,” Barnette told CNN in a phone interview Thursday, referring to the day the Challenger exploded. “It was just so burned into my brain.”\n\nBarnette and his team of investigators set off in March to search suspected shipwreck sites in the Bermuda Triangle, a swath of the northern Atlantic Ocean said to be the site of dozens of shipwrecks and plane crashes. The team also set its sights on one area outside the triangle, just off Florida’s Space Coast, where NASA has launched rockets since its inception.\n\nThe team was searching for a WWII-era rescue plane that mysteriously disappeared in December 1945, but a more modern object partially covered by sand on the seafloor sparked interest and further investigation from the dive team, according to the History Channel.\n\nDuring the first dive, Barnette said a storm caused the water to turn so murky it was like swimming in Guinness beer. “We had terrible visibility,” he said.\n\nThe divers carried out a second excursion in May and finally captured clear footage of the wreckage. They brought evidence of their discovery to retired NASA astronaut Bruce Melnick, a longtime friend of Barnette’s, who immediately suggested it could be detritus from the Challenger disaster.\n\nDistinctive square tiles from the Challenger tipped the explorers off, suggesting they had uncovered a large chunk of the orbiter’s underbelly. The underbelly was coated in thousands of silicon tiles protecting the shuttle from heat as it returned into the Earth’s atmosphere from space.\n\nThe team turned its findings over to NASA in August, and the space agency recently confirmed the origins of the debris after reviewing footage from the dive, according to a news release.\n\nThe final Challenger mission was set to carry seven people into space — NASA astronauts Francis “Dick” Scobee, Michael Smith, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik and Gregory Jarvis as well as Christa McAuliffe, a New Hampshire schoolteacher who was set to become the first citizen space shuttle passenger as part of a new NASA program.\n\nBut 73 seconds after takeoff from its Florida launch site, the Challenger exploded, killing everyone on board. A NASA investigation later revealed a rubber “O-ring” seal on one of Challenger’s solid rocket boosters had failed because it was exposed to unusually low temperatures while the space shuttle sat on the launchpad. It caused a leak of highly explosive gases, which ultimately led to the catastrophic explosion.\n\n“While it has been nearly 37 years since seven daring and brave explorers lost their lives aboard Challenger, this tragedy will forever be seared in the collective memory of our country. For millions around the globe, myself included, Jan. 28, 1986, still feels like yesterday,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement.\n\n“This discovery gives us an opportunity to pause once again, to uplift the legacies of the seven pioneers we lost, and to reflect on how this tragedy changed us. At NASA, the core value of safety is — and must forever remain — our top priority, especially as our missions explore more of the cosmos than ever before.”\n\nThe six-part series “The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters” premieres at 10 p.m. ET on November 22 on the History Channel.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/03/us/giant-african-snail-florida-scn-trnd/index.html", "title": "Giant African land snail: A Florida county is quarantining after a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Florida county is under quarantine due to the discovery of a fast-growing population of invasive giant African land snails.\n\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) confirmed there were giant African land snails in the New Port Richey area of Pasco County on June 23, according to FDACS’ website.\n\nThe snails pose a health risk to humans because they carry a parasite called rat lungworm, which can cause meningitis, Christina Chitty, a public information director at FDACS, told CNN.\n\nThey can produce up to 2,500 eggs per year, so the population is difficult to control.\n\nAccording to Chitty, the population in Pasco County likely originated from the illegal pet trade. Giant African land snails are illegal to own as pets in the United States. But some exotic pet owners still keep the invasive pests. If the owners discard them into the wild or accidentally lose them, they can quickly establish a foothold, feeding on over 500 different plant species and even consuming the paint and stucco off houses as a source of calcium.\n\nChitty said the department is currently investigating the population and determining how many snails are in Pasco County. The snails are native to east Africa and can grow up to 8 inches long.\n\nThe quarantine took effect June 25 and prevents residents from moving the snail or related items, like plants and soil, in or out of the designated quarantine area.

In that same year, China’s President Xi Jinping announced plans to make his nation a “global innovation hub” for AI by 2030.\n\nAnd since then, Beijing has invested “tens of billions of dollars” a year in AI tech, said Bill Drexel and Hannah Kelley in Foreign Affairs (New York). It has also leveraged its “vast espionage network to try to steal foreign corporate technology secrets”. All this has paid off. China produces “more top-tier AI engineers than any other country – around 45% more than the US”, its closest competitor; and it has overtaken the US in “publishing high-quality AI research”, accounting for some 30% of citations in major AI journals in 2021. AI has now become integral to Beijing’s “system of state surveillance, repression and control”.\n\nWhat did the papers say?\n\nAI has also become integral to China’s military strategy, said Gabriel Dominguez in The Japan Times (Tokyo). The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is preoccupied with developing its capabilities for “cognitive warfare”: using AI techniques to influence the minds and shape the decisions of its adversaries.\n\nIn particular, its focus is on using them to manipulate public opinion in Taiwan, which it could do by amassing vast databanks of detailed personal information and then using deep fakes and other forms of AI-generated misinformation to engineer a change in people’s perception of China’s intentions.\n\nRunning in parallel with this is the PLA’s deployment of AI on its own troops: more and more of its soldiers are being given smart sensor bracelets that it claims can continuously record their facial information and state of mind, and address any perceived psychological problems. There is still a fair amount of scepticism about how effective these techniques will prove to be, but Washington isn’t taking any chances – which is why it is restricting the sale of advanced chips for AI to China.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2023/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/asia-pacific/958080/indonesia-soccer-stampede-how-did-one-of-worst-stadium", "title": "Indonesia soccer stampede: how did one of worst stadium tragedies ...", "text": "Alison Hutton, professor at the University of Newcastle and an expert on crowd safety explains what led to the soccer stampede in Indonesia.\n\nAt least 125 soccer fans have died in Indonesia, and more than 300 have been injured, in what is being reported as one of the worst sports stadium tragedies in history.\n\nThe disaster happened on Saturday night at the Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang, East Java. Up to 3,000 fans reportedly streamed onto the pitch following a Premier League game in which Persebaya Surabaya defeated Javanese club Arema 3-2.\n\nDisappointed with the loss, Arema supporters threw bottles and other objects at players and officials before storming the pitch – which eventually led to a deadly stampede.

According to The Guardian, Indonesia’s chief security minister said 42,000 tickets had been issued for a stadium that holds a maximum of 38,000.\n\nIn such a densely packed venue, police’s decision to use tear gas would have only escalated an already confusing and chaotic situation.\n\nAlso, the Kanjuruhan stadium only has one exit (which is also the entry). In competitive sporting environments, crowds already have heightened emotions. So it’s not difficult to see how a frenzied crowd rushing through a single exit could lead to death and injury.\n\nThese lessons have been learnt previously with the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and the 2010 Love Parade disaster (to name a few) – where a combination of police actions, poor communication, and poor access and egress for patrons has ended in tragedy.\n\nCould this tragedy have been avoided?\n\nYes – and a few techniques can be used to ensure it does not happen again.\n\nFor example, research has shown lighting up a stadium to let the audience know the show is over can help move them out in an orderly fashion.

Given China’s numerous business interests in the region, most notably the so-called Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) focused on infrastructure projects, any kind of European pushback is unwelcome in Beijing.\n\nThen in November, Lithuania became the first country in Europe to allow self-ruled Taiwan to open a de facto embassy under the name “Taiwan.” Other such offices in Europe and the United States use the name Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, to avoid references that would imply the island’s independence from China. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said the opening of the Taiwanese Representative Office in Vilnius would “charter a new and promising course for bilateral relations between Taiwan and Lithuania.”\n\nThe move enraged Beijing, which saw it as an affront to its “One China” principle that insists Taiwan is part of China, rather than an independent sovereign territory, despite the two sides having been governed separately for over seven decades after a civil war. As a rule, those who want a relationship with China must recognize the policy diplomatically.\n\nThe lobby of the Taiwanese Representative Office is pictured on November 18, 2021. Petras Maluka/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLithuania says the new Taiwan office does not have formal diplomatic status and does not conflict with its One China policy. But Beijing reacted by immediately downgrading diplomatic relations with Vilnius. Lithuania also claimed that China has prevented Lithuanian goods from entering China, effectively creating a trade barrier. The Chinese government has repeatedly rejected these claims, blaming Lithuania for harming China’s “core interest” and sending bilateral ties to a deep freeze.\n\nTaiwan reacted by buying up Lithuanian produce that was destined for China – including 20,400 bottles of rum – and pledging to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Lithuanian industry to support the country in the face of Chinese pressure.\n\nThe spat has pulled in the European Union, which is backing member state Lithuania. Brussels sees Beijing’s treatment of Lithuania as a threat to other EU nations, many of whom have deeper economic links with China and would like to deepen them further.\n\nOn Thursday, the EU launched a case against China at the World Trade Organization, accusing Beijing of “discriminatory trade practices against Lithuania, which are also hitting other exports from the EU’s Single Market.”\n\nThe WTO case could be just the start of the EU taking a more hardline stance on China, though there are reservations about whether doing so could prompt Beijing to retaliate in the form of trade wars or canceled investments in Europe.\n\n‘China needs to learn lessons’\n\nIn 1990, Lithuania became the first member of the Soviet Union to declare independence from Moscow’s ruling Communist Party. It then joined the EU European Union and NATO in 2004 – the very organization intended to be a check on socialist expansion.\n\nIn that context, a nation like China displaying aggression in its own region, notably against Taiwan – as well as using trade as a weapon against smaller European nations – naturally alarms those who remember life under Soviet rule.\n\n“China needs to learn lessons because until now, they have been allowed to behave in a way that doesn’t adhere to our values and rules, simply because they were so wealthy,” Lithuania’s former Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius told CNN.\n\n“I don’t see that bigger EU countries would have taken it upon themselves to stand up. Maybe from Lithuania it will spread to others and in time, Europe will stand united against a country that doesn’t meet our standards,” he added.\n\nOne of the reasons Lithuanian officials may be more comfortable than some nations in taking this stance is that China is a relatively small export market for the country. Only 1.18% of Lithuania’s exports went to China in 2019 – compared with 13.1% to Russia and 3.64% to the US – though China is also one of Lithuania’s fastest growing export markets, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.\n\nFor Lithuania, this hardline stance is more than a moral mission. Officials who spoke to CNN say that by standing up to China, they also hope to send a message to Moscow.\n\nVelina Tchakarova, head of the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy, explains that Lithuania has “been under permanent Russian pressure since joining NATO. Lithuania wants to set an example within the European members that no one will succumb to autocratic regimes in Beijing and Moscow.”\n\nLithuanian officials told CNN they hoped standing up to China might set a precedent in the EU for pushing back on autocratic regimes. One senior Lithuanian diplomat said the endgame was for Europe to have more effective anti-coercion measures.\n\nBrussels recently proposed a legal mechanism that would allow the EU to respond to economic intimidation in a “structured and uniform manner” by using a “tailor-made and proportional response for each situation” which could include tariffs, restricting imports and limiting access to the EU’s internal market.\n\nBut many of the smaller EU nations are privately skeptical that their fellow member states – especially those who trade extensively with China – would back them when push comes to shove.\n\nA strong economic relationship with China is a key plank of the EU’s drive for “strategic autonomy,” a term used in Brussels to describe the EU becoming more independent from US influences as a geopolitical power. The thinking was that by partnering with Beijing economically, Europe could act as a bridge between the US and China, while not getting squashed between the two.\n\nThe building which houses the Taiwanese Representative Office is pictured in Vilnius in November 2021. Petras Maluka/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBigger member states, most notably France, have been strong supporters of the strategic autonomy drive. And while European politicians have grown increasingly uncomfortable with China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims, suppression of democracy in Hong Kong and aggression towards Taiwan, when it comes to hard cash, many European countries are not quite ready to alienate China.\n\nTchakarova believes that by “bringing China into the debate, Lithuania seeks to strengthen the US position in Europe, but also to warn Brussels and key member states (Germany and France) of the potential risks and dangers associated with bilateral relations with China in the future.”\n\nEssentially, they hope to force these countries to take a stand. So, will it work?\n\nA delicate balance\n\nSome in Lithuania think their hardline stance has already produced results. Officials point to the fact that France has backed them, along with the rest of the EU, and called on China to deescalate the situation. This is particularly significant right now, since France holds the EU’s rotating presidency and is also in the middle of a presidential election campaign. Earlier this month, Slovenia announced that it too would seek to increase trade with Taiwan.\n\nOne senior European Commission official told CNN Brussels’ position is that Lithuania has not gone against its One China policy, and that if China continues to be hostile, it must provide evidence that the policy has been breached, which Lithuanian officials are chalking up as a victory.\n\nHowever, not everyone, even in Lithuania itself, thinks the strategy has been a wholesale success.\n\nPresident Gitanas Nauseda said that while he supported opening the Taiwanese Representative Office, he thinks the name was needlessly provocative and Lithuania must now deal with the “consequences.”\n\nBeijing responded by saying acknowledging the mistake was a good start, but still believes Lithuania to have broken the One China principle.\n\nBrussels has been getting its act together on geopolitical matters lately. After years of bitter backbiting, it may be that Brexit and the pandemic have reminded EU leaders that unity in areas of mutual interest means even small nations like Lithuania can use the mechanics of the EU to stand up to one of the richest, most powerful nations on earth.\n\nWhether Lithuania’s stand – and the EU taking a stand along with it – will result in any concessions from Beijing is another matter. A recent editorial in the outspoken nationalistic state-run tabloid Global Times issued a series of steps Lithuania must take to restore relations, and warned: “no matter what tricks they play, China will never give in half an inch on issues of principle.”\n\nBut experts agreed the only chance, however remote, of forcing any concessions from China on the issue is for Europe to present a united front.\n\nBenedict Rogers, a longstanding human rights campaigner and the chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, says that while “China has shown it is very adept at divide-and-rule and able to play countries off another … when countries stand together and stand up against China together, Beijing’s bullying tactics are less effective and pressure on China can have more impact.”\n\nFor all this may seem a small spat, what’s at stake is years of work in which the EU has tried to find a way to reconcile its economic relationship with China with its duty to member states and its moral values. The question is for how much longer that balance can hold.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/politics/white-house-lobby-opec-oil-production-cuts-gasoline-prices-midterms/index.html", "title": "Inside the White House's failed effort to dissuade OPEC from cutting ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration launched a full-scale pressure campaign in a last-ditch effort to dissuade Middle Eastern allies from dramatically cutting oil production, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nBut that effort appears to have failed, following Wednesday’s crucial meeting of OPEC+, the international cartel of oil producers that, as expected, announced a significant cut to output in an effort to raise oil prices. That in turn will likely cause US gasoline prices to rise at a precarious time for the Biden administration, just five weeks before the midterm elections.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, OPEC+ oil ministers meeting in Vienna agreed to an even larger production cut than the White House had feared — 2 million barrels per day, beginning in November, according to a readout of the meeting released on Wednesday. The ministers said the cuts were necessary “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden told CNN’s Arlette Saenz on Wednesday that he was “concerned” about the cuts, which he viewed as “unnecessary.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters when asked about the move that “when it comes to OPEC, we’ve made clear our views to the OPEC members.”\n\nFor the past several days, Biden’s senior-most energy, economic and foreign policy officials were enlisted to lobby their foreign counterparts in Middle Eastern allied countries including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to vote against cutting oil production. Wednesday’s production cut amounts to the largest cut since the beginning of the pandemic and could lead to a dramatic spike in oil prices.\n\nSome of the draft talking points circulated by the White House to the Treasury Department on Monday that were obtained by CNN framed the prospect of a production cut as a “total disaster” and warned that it could be taken as a “hostile act.”\n\n“It’s important everyone is aware of just how high the stakes are,” said a US official of what was framed as a broad administration effort that is expected to continue in the lead up to the Wednesday OPEC+ meeting.\n\nThe White House is “having a spasm and panicking,” another US official said, describing this latest administration effort as “taking the gloves off.” According to a White House official, the talking points were being drafted and exchanged by staffers and not approved by White House leadership or used with foreign partners.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said, “We’ve been clear that energy supply should meet demand to support economic growth and lower prices for consumers around the world and we will continue to talk with our partners about that.”\n\nFor Biden, a dramatic cut in oil production could not come at a worse time. The administration has for months engaged in an intensive domestic and foreign policy effort to mitigate soaring energy prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That work appeared to pay off, with US gasoline prices falling for almost 100 days in a row.\n\nBut with just a month to go before the critical midterm elections, US gasoline prices have begun to creep up again, posing a political risk the White House is desperately trying to avoid. As US officials have moved to gauge potential domestic options to head off gradual increases over the last several weeks, the news of major OPEC+ action presents a particularly acute challenge.\n\nWatson, the NSC spokesperson declined to comment on the midterms, saying instead, “Thanks to the President’s efforts, energy prices have declined sharply from their highs and American consumers are paying far less at the pump.”\n\nAll hands on deck\n\nAmos Hochstein, Biden’s top energy envoy, played a leading role in the lobbying effort, which has been far more extensive than previously reported amid extreme concern in the White House over the potential cut. Hochstein, along with top national security official Brett McGurk and the administration’s special envoy to Yemen Tim Lenderking, traveled to Jeddah late last month to discuss a range of energy and security issues as a follow up to Biden’s high-profile visit to Saudi Arabia in July.\n\nFrom left to right, Amos Hochstein, Janet Yellen and Brett McGurk Handout/Anadolu Agency/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOfficials across the administration’s economic and foreign policy teams were also been involved with reaching out to OPEC governments as part of the latest effort to stave off a production cut.\n\nThe White House asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to make the case personally to some Gulf state finance ministers, including from Kuwait and the UAE, and try to convince them that a production cut would be extremely damaging to the global economy. The US has argued that in the long-run a cut in oil production would create more downward pressure on prices – the opposite of what a significant cut would be designed to accomplish. Their logic is that “cutting right now would increase risks of inflation,” lead to higher interest rates and ultimately a greater risk of recession.\n\n“There is great political risk to your reputation and relations with the United States and the west if you move forward,” the White House draft talking points suggested Yellen communicate to her foreign counterparts.\n\nA senior US official acknowledged that the administration lobbied the Saudi-led coalition for weeks to try to convince them not to cut oil production.\n\nEfforts to court Saudi Arabia\n\nWednesday’s production cut comes less than three months after President Joe Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on a trip that was driven in part by a desire to convince Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, to increase oil production which would help bring down the then-skyrocketing gasoline prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden's meeting with Saudi crown prince comes under fire 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nWhen OPEC+ agreed a few weeks later to a modest 100,000 barrel increase in production, critics argued Biden had gotten little in return.\n\nThe trip was billed as a meeting with regional leaders about issues critical to US national security, including Iran, Israel and Yemen. It was criticized for its lack of results and for rehabbing the image of the crown prince who had been directly blamed by Biden for orchestrating the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nIn the months leading up to the meeting, Biden’s top aides for the Middle East and energy, McGurk and Hochstein, shuttled between Washington and Saudi Arabia planning and coordinating the visit.\n\nOne diplomatic official in the region described the US campaign to block production cuts as less of a hard sell, and more of an effort to underscore a critical international moment given the economic fragility and ongoing war in Ukraine. Though another source familiar with the discussions told CNN it was described by a diplomat from one of the countries approached as “desperate.”\n\nA source familiar with the outreach says a call was planned with the UAE but the effort was rebuffed by Kuwait. Kuwait’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Saudi Arabia’s. The UAE embassy declined to comment.\n\nPublicly, the White House has cautiously avoided weighing in on the possibility of a dramatic oil production cut.\n\n“We are not members of OPEC+, and so I don’t want to get ahead of what could potentially come out of that meeting,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday. The US focus, Jean-Pierre said, remains “taking every step to ensure markets are sufficiently supplied to meet demand for a growing global economy.”\n\nOPEC’s effort to boost prices\n\nOPEC+ members are weighing a more dramatic cut due to what has been a precipitous decline in prices, which have dropped sharply to below $90 per barrel in recent months.\n\nHanging over Wednesday’s OPEC+ meeting in Vienna will also be the looming oil price cap that European nations intend to impose on Russian oil exports as punishment for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Many OPEC+ members, not only Russia, have expressed unhappiness with the prospect of a price cap because of the precedent it could set for consumers, rather than the market, to dictate the price of oil.\n\nIncluded in the White House talking points to Treasury was a US proposal that if OPEC+ decides against a cut this week the US will announce a buyback of up to 200 million barrels to refill its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), an emergency stockpile of petroleum that the US has been tapping into this year to help lower oil prices.\n\nThe administration has made it clear to OPEC+ for months, the senior US official said, that the US is willing to buy OPEC’s oil to replenish the SPR. The idea has been to convey to OPEC+ that the US “won’t leave them hanging dry” if they invest money in production, the official said, and therefore, that prices won’t collapse if global demand decreases.", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt Natasha Bertrand Phil Mattingly", "Alex Marquardt", "Natasha Bertrand", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/asia/the-quad-tokyo-summit-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What is the Quad? The partnership between the US, Japan ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet the leaders of India, Australia and Japan in Tokyo on Tuesday for a summit of the “Quad” nations.\n\nThe meeting comes at the end of Biden’s first trip to Asia since becoming President, a five-day visit he began in South Korea.\n\nThe Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is an informal group focused on security that dates back to the early 2000s. It has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter China’s reach and territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, North Korea’s weapons program, Taiwan, and a controversial new security deal between China and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific are among the issues likely to be discussed at the summit.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the Quad.\n\nHow did it form?\n\nThe partnership has its roots in the response to the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, when the four countries set up a “regional core group” to help relief efforts. But the Quad in its current form was created in 2007 and held its first meeting in May that year.\n\nIn a speech several months after that first meeting, Japan’s then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described his vision of a “broader Asia … an immense network spanning the entirety of the Pacific Ocean, incorporating the United States of America and Australia.”\n\nThe countries shared “fundamental values” such as freedom and democracy, and common strategic interests, he said.\n\nThe initiative fell apart in 2008 under intense pressure from China and the threat of economic retaliation, said Cleo Paskal, a non-resident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nBut it was revived in 2017 amid renewed concerns about China’s rapid rise as a global superpower and Beijing’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy.\n\nSince then, the group has grown more active, with the four heads of state holding a symbolic virtual meeting in March 2021, before then meeting in person for the first time in September that year.\n\nAt the time, a senior US official emphasized the Quad was “an unofficial gathering,” but called it “a key and critical format,” adding “we are deepening coordination on a daily basis.”\n\nA meeting of the Quad leaders at a summit at the White House on September 24, 2021. Kyodo News/Getty Images\n\nWhat does the Quad do?\n\nThough sometimes dubbed by critics as an “Asian NATO,” the Quad is not a formal military alliance – rather, it’s an informal strategic forum, featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and military drills.\n\nIt does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in NATO, like the concept of collective defense, where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all.\n\n“It’s deliberately more amorphous than that, so that it can withstand changes in political decision-making in each of the democracies, and respond in a more diffuse but effective way around things like vaccines or economics,” Paskal said.\n\nQuad members cooperate across fields including Covid-19 and natural disasters, climate change and sustainability.\n\nBut security and the goal of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” are key focuses, with the four nations frequently highlighting threats such as terrorism, disinformation and territorial disputes.\n\nAircraft carriers and warships participate in the Malabar naval exercises, attended by the US, Australia, India and Japan, in the Northern Arabian Sea on November 17, 2020. Indian Navy/AP\n\nMilitary cooperation has increased in recent years, with Australia joining the other three in the 2020 Malabar naval exercises – the first time all four members had participated in the drills since 2007.\n\nLast September, the US, the United Kingdom and Australia signed a security deal known as AUKUS that will eventually bring nuclear-powered submarines to the region – a move that set off a diplomatic firestorm with France and angered China.\n\nAnd this January, Japan and Australia signed a treaty to strengthen defense and security cooperation, with Australia saying the agreement included “an expanding agenda for the Quad.”\n\nHow does China play into this?\n\nThe Quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to China’s growing reach in the region, with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with Beijing over the past few years.\n\nThe India-China relationship has come under growing strain since May 2020 when troops from both sides were involved in a deadly clash along their disputed Himalayan border.\n\nAustralia and China have been involved in a series of trade spats since Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, while Japan and China remain at odds over disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nThe US-China relationship has also steadily deteriorated, exacerbated by a trade war, pandemic finger-pointing and military saber-rattling.\n\nThe strategic location of each of the Quad nations – at different corners of the Indo-Pacific and with China in between them – has rattled Beijing, which fears the potential for military encirclement. It has condemned the bloc as an anti-China “clique” that is emblematic of a “poisonous” Cold War mentality.\n\nA Chinese airstrip on a man-made island in the South China Sea, seen on March 20. Aaron Favila/AP\n\nExacerbating these tensions, China has reiterated its territorial claims and taken a harder line in response to perceived challenges. In recent years, China has built up its military positions in the South China Sea, despite a UN tribunal dismissing its territorial claims there. It has also ramped up threats against Taiwan – a self-governing island the Chinese Communist Party sees as part of its territory despite never having ruled it – and has sent fighter jets into its air defense identification zone.\n\n“China’s rise is now the global phenomenon that not (only) involves the neighboring nations, but also the safety of maritime security in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, all the way to the Indian Ocean,” said Ken Jimbo, a professor in the faculty of policy management at Japan’s Keio University.\n\nIn April, China announced a security pact with the Solomon Islands, sparking protests from Australia, New Zealand and the US. Many were concerned it would allow China to build a military base in the tiny Pacific nation, though the islands’ leader has said he has no intention of this happening.\n\nStill, some onlookers say the agreement makes Australia less safe and threatens to further destabilize the Solomon Islands, where the government’s close relationship with Beijing has already sparked protests.\n\n“What countries are realizing more and more is that the economic investment from China is designed to lead to a weakening of political will within those countries … which brings it more strongly into the Chinese orbit,” said Paskal, from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nWhat are the other major issues?\n\nOther issues that may come up at the summit include the security of Taiwan.\n\nA recent surge of Chinese air incursions has raised fears for the future of the democratic island. Top US intelligence officials told Congress this month that China might be attempting to build a military capable of taking over Taiwan, and the island faces an “acute” threat between now and 2030.\n\nQuad members have voiced support for Taiwan, which the US supplies with arms for self defense. On Monday, during a press conference in Japan, US President Joe Biden said the US would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force, a warning that appeared to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally held by Washington.\n\nThe White House quickly downplayed the comments, saying they don’t reflect a change in US policy.\n\nBut many analysts have drawn parallels between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan’s situation – concerns echoed by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in May, when he said peace in the Taiwan Strait was “critical” and countries must “never tolerate” forceful attempts to change the status quo in East Asia.\n\n“If Taiwan falls to China, that breaks the first island chain and compromises Japanese security,” Paskal said. “The fall of Taiwan is a deep security threat to all four Quad partners.”\n\nNorth Korea and its weapons program will also likely be on the table, said Jimbo, the Keio University professor. The country has recently stepped up its missile testing, in defiance of international law and to the alarm of Japan and the US. It has launched 15 missile tests this year so far, compared to four tests in 2020 and eight in 2021.\n\nThe war in Ukraine will be another focus, with the summit taking place exactly three months after Russia launched its invasion. Australia, Japan and the US have all taken hard stances in condemning the invasion and imposing sanctions on Moscow – leaving India the odd one out.\n\nIndia has long enjoyed friendly relations and a defense relationship with Moscow; most estimates suggest more than 50% of India’s military equipment comes from Russia. These supplies are vital, given India’s border tensions with both China and Pakistan.\n\nThough India’s position has caused “a significant amount of frustration” among the other three bloc members, Jimbo said “it also reminds us that we do not really have the luxury to lose India from the Quad – so obviously, we are going to pursue what we can agree (on) at this point together with India.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/30/sen-jack-reed-at-forefront-of-us-australia-submarine-controversy-electric-boat/69836685007/", "title": "Sen.

But the stirrings of political opposition to an endless US role in the war are growing on both sides of the aisle just two weeks before the November midterms.\n\nEven the slightest hint of a softening of American resolve could comfort Putin as the Kremlin strongman prepares to inflict a painful winter on Ukrainian civilians and Europeans reliant on Russian gas.\n\nIn what can only be described as a political debacle on Tuesday, progressive Democrats published, then withdrew, a letter initially signed in June that called on the White House to match its effort to arm Ukraine with a strong diplomatic effort to engage Russia and seek a ceasefire. This came days after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the possible next speaker, warned that Kyiv could not expect a “blank check” on aid if the GOP is in charge next year.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback McCarthy threatens to cut aid to Ukraine if GOP win midterms 02:36 - Source: CNN\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that the GOP leader was forced into a damage control operation with national security leaders in his conference and insisted he didn’t want to cut aid to Ukraine, but merely to ensure tax-payer dollars were not automatically rubber-stamped for the war. The furor over his remarks, reported by CNN’s Melanie Zanona, Kylie Atwood, Jeremy Herb and Katie Bo Lillis, shows the fine line McCarthy will have to walk on the issue if the GOP wins the majority.\n\nFor example, ex-President Donald Trump, a possible future Republican candidate, has been complaining about the cost of supporting a government locked in a struggle with his hero, Putin, and that he dragged into his first impeachment by using military aid in a coercion scheme. Trump will be a huge influence on any future Republican House majority after the midterms.\n\nEx-President Donald Trump, a possible future Republican candidate, has, meanwhile, been complaining about the cost of supporting a government locked in a struggle with his hero, Putin, and that he dragged into his first impeachment by using military aid in a coercion scheme.\n\nIt’s clear that a bipartisan consensus for aiding Ukraine still exists in Washington. But the rumblings that Biden’s hardline on Russia may not always enjoy near unanimous support came at an especially sensitive time as the West seeks to discredit Russia’s latest round of nuclear rhetoric – a warning that Kyiv could use a dirty bomb. The claims have led to high-level talks between US and Russian military chiefs and are widely being interpreted as either more scare tactics or perhaps an attempt by Moscow to create a false flag operation that could be used as a pretext for its own use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Retired general: Russia accusing Ukraine of planning a 'dirty bomb' could be a warning 01:56 - Source: CNN\n\nSeeking to highlight US and Western commitment to Ukraine amid the political chatter, Biden delivered a fresh warning on Tuesday against the use of smaller-yield nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n“Let me just say: Russia would be making an incredibly serious mistake for it to use a tactical nuclear weapon,” Biden told reporters after he was asked whether Russia was preparing to use a dirty bomb. “I’m not guaranteeing you that it’s a false flag operation yet, don’t know, but it would be a serious, serious mistake.”\n\nThe President’s comments were a reminder that the maneuvering in Washington over Ukraine aid is taking place in a critical context, with anxiety still acute over a possible escalation of the war that could spill over into direct US-Russia hostilities and put the world on a disastrous path toward a full-on nuclear escalation.\n\nThis is why signs of fraying political resolve in the United States, and in some allied nations, are so significant. They could convince Putin that a war of attrition over the winter could sooner or later cause fatigue in the West and therefore weaken Ukraine’s ability to fight.\n\nQuestions that need to be asked\n\nAnd yet some of the questions raised by those who are cautious about the US stance are relevant and important. A foreign policy operation that lines up the United States against its former Cold War foe and nuclear rival must be constantly evaluated and justified by the President, given the cost and risks.\n\nThe fact that there is no diplomatic track in the conflict – Biden has several times mused privately that he doesn’t know what Putin’s “off-ramps” might be – is worthy of discussion and, potentially, testing in contacts with Moscow. And at a time of raging inflation and economic hardship in the United States, it is incumbent on the administration and its supporters to demonstrate to American taxpayers why a war on the edge of Europe is sucking up billions in public money, even if it’s not as if Ukraine currently has the “blank check” McCarthy mentioned.\n\nThe risk, though, is that such debates still play into the hands of Putin, who has already demonstrated his capacity to exploit and widen US political divides with his election-meddling scheme in 2016 and the hold he had over Trump, even getting him to denounce US intelligence agencies in a joint news conference.\n\nSooner or later, the political jousting in Washington over how long the US should stay involved in arming Ukraine – and how much it would cost – will stumble on the critical questions that could decide the war and could be the motivation for Putin’s frequent escalation of nuclear rhetoric that raises the stakes.\n\nIs the West as dedicated as Putin, whose political survival may depend on victory or at least not losing, to prevailing in Ukraine? And is it really willing to enter into a dangerous cycle of escalation that could risk wider nuclear war to do so?\n\nPolitical drama on both sides of the aisle\n\nIt is with these questions lingering that the drama over a letter signed by 30 progressives played out on Tuesday. Most of the members did not endorse releasing the letter this week, and some said they wouldn’t have signed it now given the grave turn the war has taken in recent days. The anger over the letter caused Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to withdraw the letter, saying it was drafted months ago and released by staff without vetting.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Liberal Democrats abruptly withdraw letter on Ukraine policy amid anger 02:56 - Source: CNN\n\nThe episode did not just threaten to expose vulnerable lawmakers just two weeks before an election in which Democrats increasingly fear they will lose the House. It could give McCarthy cover in a future Congress to argue that opposition to Biden’s multi-billion dollar arms packages is not just a Republican preoccupation.\n\nAnd while the letter was withdrawn, some of its sentiments could boil up again.\n\nThe letter said that lawmakers were under no illusions about the difficulty in engaging Russia, given its “outrageous and illegal invasion of Ukraine.” But it added: “If there is a way to end the war while preserving a free and independent Ukraine, it is America’s responsibility to pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that the terms that Russia has set for any peace deal involve locking in its battlefield gains. Now that it has illegally annexed several Ukrainian regions, any preconditions that Putin would set would be impossible for Kyiv to agree to. And rolling back such positions would deal the Russian leader the defeat he is desperate to avoid. So while the idea of talking might seem appealing, it’s not clear how the US could shift the calculus of either side. And Biden has repeatedly insisted he will not negotiate over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s head, as Putin would like.\n\nOne progressive Democrat, Rep. Ro Khanna of California, told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga that he did not support the decision to pull back the letter.\n\n“I think the letter was common sense,” Khanna said. “I support making sure we arm Ukraine and provide arms to Ukraine and continue to fund it, but I also believe that the President, as he said, we are at a risk of nuclear war.”\n\n“Don’t you think our counterpart should be talking to Russia? Of course they should to be sure that it doesn’t escalate.”\n\nThere is also a risk that diplomacy at this stage could offer Putin a prize for the human carnage he perpetrated in Ukraine.\n\n“There is moral and strategic peril in sitting down with Putin too early. It risks legitimizing his crimes and handing over parts of Ukraine to Russia in an agreement that Putin won’t even honor,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut wrote in a tweet on Tuesday.\n\n“Sometimes, a bully must be shown the limits of his power before diplomacy can work.”\n\nOne thing that the drama over the Democratic letter on Ukraine did achieve was to show that while support for Ukraine is bipartisan, anxiety about the war is too, even if the skeptics are a smaller group so far.\n\nWhat a Republican House could mean for Ukraine\n\nThe prospect of a House more squarely in Trump’s ideological image after the midterm elections and of more GOP senators who share his “America First” worldview will worry the administration.\n\n“I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,” McCarthy said in an interview with Punchbowl News last week, which was seized upon by Democrats.\n\nBut it did not necessarily mean the California lawmaker was determined to cut off aid. He may simply have been creating some political room for himself in the knowledge of the sensitivity of the issue in his pro-Trump party. In theory, a speaker McCarthy would be able to pass a Ukraine funding bill by using both Republican and Democratic votes.\n\nBut whether his own position in a fractious GOP conference would allow him to do so is another matter. That’s one reason why there is growing talk in Washington that Democrats might try to pass a mammoth bill during the lame-duck Congress, which they will still control after the midterms even if the GOP wins, to carry Ukraine through next year’s fighting.\n\nMcCarthy is not the only Republican sounding skeptical notes. Ohio Republican Senate nominee J.D. Vance said he didn’t really care about what happened to Ukraine before the invasion and that the US should worry about the influx across its own southern border. (His comment has been used by Democratic opponent, Rep. Tim Ryan, who is seeking to make inroads among the state’s significant Ukrainian exile community). Vance is one of a new breed of potential GOP senators that could prove more skeptical to aiding Ukraine than the old guard of senior leaders like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and hawkish South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\nSimilar sentiments to Vance’s are often heard on conservative media. But those opinions usually discount the broader implications of the war in Ukraine. The conflict is so important because it represents more than a territorial spat on the far edges of Europe. It is a fight for democracy itself. If Ukraine falls, Russia will establish the principle that a large authoritarian nation can simply wipe a smaller neighbor off the map.\n\nThis would have grave consequences in other conflicts – for example, over Taiwan amid rising concerns China could try to take back the democratic island by force. And a Russian victory in Ukraine could directly threaten America’s NATO allies and bring the US closer to a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/world/brittney-griner-basketball-russia-detention/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner: It'll be 'very difficult' to get detained US basketball ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor days, family and friends have been clamoring for the release of two-time Olympic champion Brittney Griner after she was detained in Russia on drug charges.\n\nNow, hundreds of strangers have joined the effort as US-Russian tensions escalate amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGriner, 31, is a championship-winning player with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury and spends her offseasons playing for the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg.\n\nThe Russian Federal Customs Service said an American at Sheremetyevo Airport was carrying hash oil. Russia’s Interfax News Agency quoted a statement from the Customs Service, which did not identify the traveler by name:\n\n“As a US citizen was passing through the green channel at Sheremetyevo Airport upon arriving from New York, a working dog from the Sheremetyevo customs canine department detected the possible presence of narcotic substances in the accompanying luggage,” the statement said.\n\n“The customs inspection of the hand luggage being carried by the US citizen confirmed the presence of vapes with specifically smelling liquid, and an expert determined that the liquid was cannabis oil (hash oil), which is a narcotic substance.”\n\nThe customs agency said the arrest happened in February, but the exact date was not given. The New York Times was first to report Griner’s arrest. Her whereabouts since her arrest also remain uncertain.\n\nGriner’s ordeal comes as the Russian invasion of Ukraine is in its second week. President Vladimir Putin issued a series of threats Saturday against Ukraine and Western powers, saying the sanctions introduced on his country are “equivalent of a declaration of war.”\n\nA member of the US House Armed Services Committee said “it’s going to be very difficult” to get Griner out of Russia.\n\n“Our diplomatic relationships with Russia are nonexistent at the moment,” Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California told CNN on Monday.\n\n“Perhaps during the various negotiations that may take place, she might be able to be one of the solutions. I don’t know.”\n\nHe also noted that “Russia has some very, very strict LGBT rules and laws” – though it’s not clear whether those rules and laws might impact Griner’s case.\n\nBut the Biden administration is working on trying to get Griner out of Russia, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said after meeting with President Joe Biden on Monday.\n\n“The best news we got today was that they know about it and that she’s on the agenda,” Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents Griner’s hometown of Houston, Texas, told reporters.\n\nNoting a potential 10-year-sentence for Griner, Jackson Lee added: “We know about Britney Griner, and we know that we have to move on her situation.”\n\nHundreds petition for Griner’s release\n\nMore than 1,000 people have signed the “Secure Brittney Griner’s Swift and Safe Return to the U.S.” petition on Change.org.\n\nJournalist Tamryn Spruill, who covers women’s basketball, started the online petition Saturday.\n\n“Griner is a beloved global citizen who has used her platform since her entry into the WNBA to help others,” Spruill wrote on the petition’s web page.\n\n“Griner was in Russia for work: playing for UMMC Ekaterinburg, where in 2021 she helped the team win its fifth EuroLeague Women championship.”\n\nSpruill explained why many female professional basketball players in the US work overseas. “Like many athletes competing in the WNBA, Griner plays abroad during the WNBA offseason because her salary is exponentially higher in other countries,” Spruill wrote.\n\n“For WNBA players, that means playing abroad, while NBA rookies who haven’t played a professional game yet are handed salaries many-times higher that what title-winning, All-Star designated WNBA veterans could ever hope for,” the petition says.\n\n“These realities are not the fault of the players. They simply want to be paid their worth like their male counterparts, and they do not deserve to be entangled in geopolitical turmoil for doing so.”\n\n‘There are no words to express this pain’\n\nGriner’s wife described the agony of waiting in an Instagram post on Monday.\n\n“People say ‘stay busy.’ Yet, there’s not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you. My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by.” Cherelle Griner wrote.\n\n“There are no words to express this pain. I’m hurting, we’re hurting.”\n\nOn Saturday, she thanked supporters in a post and asked for privacy.\n\n“I understand that many of you have grown to love BG over the years and have concerns and want details,” Cherelle Griner wrote. “Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.”\n\nBut Griner’s fate remains unclear.\n\nA criminal case has been opened against the US citizen arrested, Interfax reported, citing Russia’s customs service.\n\nA spokesperson for the US State Department said the agency is “aware of reports of a US citizen arrested in Moscow.”\n\n“Whenever a US citizen is arrested overseas, we stand ready to provide all appropriate consular services,” the spokesperson told CNN on Saturday.\n\nCNN has reached out to Griner’s representative for comment.\n\nHer high school basketball coach, Debbie Jackson, remembers Griner as an athlete with determination and grit.\n\nBut Jackson told CNN she worries Griner’s case will be used for political purposes.\n\n“My biggest fear is that … she will become a political pawn,” Jackson said.\n\nPlaying in Russia for years\n\nGriner has played with Russia’s UMMC Ekaterinburg since 2015 during the WNBA offseason. In five games this season, she has averaged 13.2 points and 4.2 rebounds per game.\n\nThe star player, who won the WNBA championship with the Mercury in 2014, averaged 20.5 points and 9.5 rebounds per game last season with Phoenix.\n\nGriner is also a two-time medalist at the FIBA Women’s Basketball World Championship with Team USA.\n\nUSA Basketball, the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), the Mercury and the WNBA players’ union publicly shared their concerns for Griner.\n\nUSA Basketball, the governing body for sport in the United States, said it is “aware of and closely monitoring the legal situation facing Brittney Griner in Russia. Brittney has always handled herself with the utmost professionalism during her long tenure with USA Basketball and her safety and wellbeing are our primary concerns.”\n\nThe WNBA said Griner has its “full support,” adding its main priority is “her swift and safe return to the United States.”\n\nThe Women’s National Basketball Players Association said it is “aware of the situation in Russia concerning one of our members, Brittney Griner.”\n\n“Our utmost concern is BG’s safety and well-being,” the WNBPA said. “We will continue to closely monitor and look forward to her return to the US.”\n\nThe Phoenix Mercury said it is “closely monitoring the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia” as they remain in “constant contact with her family, her representation, the WNBA and NBA. We love and support Brittney and at this time our main concern is her safety, physical and mental health, and her safe return home.”", "authors": ["Wayne Sterling Holly Yan Emma Tucker", "Wayne Sterling", "Holly Yan", "Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/03/07"}]}

Wade put her life in danger.\n\nCNN has told the stories of several women – including one from Houston, one from central Texas and one from Cleveland – and what they had to do to obtain medically necessary abortions.\n\nNow, a woman from Austin, Texas, has come forward because she nearly died when she couldn’t get a timely abortion.\n\nThis is her story.\n\nThe loss of a ‘miracle’ baby\n\nAmanda Eid and Josh Zurawski, both now 35, met in 1991 at Aldersgate Academy preschool in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and dated in high school.\n\n“Josh always tells me he’s been in love with me since we were 4 years old,” Amanda said.\n\nThree years ago, they married in Austin, Texas, where they both work in high-tech jobs.\n\nThey tried to have a family but failed. Amanda had fertility treatments for a year and a half and finally became pregnant.\n\nAmanda Zurawski became pregnant after a year and a half of fertility treatments. Courtesy Amanda Zurawski\n\n“Very excited to share that Baby Zurawski is expected in late January,” Amanda shared on Instagram in July. The post included a picture of her and her husband in “Mama” and “Dad” hats, Amanda holding a strip of ultrasound photos of their baby girl.\n\n“The fact that we were pregnant at all was a miracle, and we were beside ourselves with happiness,” she said.\n\nBut then, 18 weeks – just four months – into her pregnancy, Amanda’s water broke.\n\nThe amniotic fluid that her baby depended upon was leaking out. She says her doctor told her the baby would not survive.\n\n“We found out that we were going to lose our baby,” Amanda said. “My cervix was dilating fully 22 weeks prematurely, and I was inevitably going to miscarry.”\n\nShe and Josh begged the doctor to see if there was any way to save the baby.\n\n“I just kept asking, ‘isn’t there anything we can do?’ And the answer was ‘no,’ ” Amanda said.\n\nTexas anti-abortion laws\n\nWhen a woman’s water breaks, she’s at high risk for a life-threatening infection. While Amanda and Josh’s baby – they named her Willow – was sure to die, she still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.\n\n“My doctor said, ‘Well, right now we just have to wait, because we can’t induce labor, even though you’re 100% for sure going to lose your baby,’ ” Amanda said. “[The doctors] were unable to do their own jobs because of the way that the laws are written in Texas.”\n\nTexas law allows for abortion if the mother “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”\n\nBut Texas lawmakers haven’t spelled out exactly what that means, and a doctor found to be in violation of the law can face loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.\n\n“They’re extremely vague,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center. “They don’t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided.”\n\nIn September, CNN reached out to 28 Texas legislators who sponsored anti-abortion legislation, asking them for their response to CNN stories about the woman in Houston and the woman in central Texas.\n\nOnly one legislator responded.\n\n“Like any other law, there are unintended consequences. We do not want to see any unintended consequences; if we do, it is our responsibility as legislators to fix those flaws,” wrote state Sen. Eddie Lucio, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year.\n\nThe Zurawskis participated in an ad for Beto O’Rourke’s unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial campaign.\n\nGoing downhill very fast\n\nAfter her water broke, Amanda’s doctors sent her home and told her to watch for signs of infection, and that only when she was “considered sick enough that my life was at risk” would they terminate the pregnancy, Amanda said.\n\n“My doctor said it could take hours, it could take days, it could take weeks,” she remembers.\n\nOnce they heard “hours,” they decided there was no time to travel to another state for an abortion.\n\n“The nearest ‘sanctuary’ state is at least an eight-hour drive,” Amanda wrote in an online essay on The Meteor. “Developing sepsis – which can kill quickly – in a car in the middle of the West Texas desert, or 30,000 feet above the ground, is a death sentence.”\n\nSo they waited it out in Texas.\n\nOn August 26, three days after her water broke, Amanda found herself shivering in the Texas heat.\n\n“We were having a heat wave, I think it was 105 degrees that day, and I was freezing cold, and I was shaking, my teeth were chattering. I was trying to tell Josh that I didn’t feel good, and my teeth were chattering so hard that I could not even get the sentence out,” she said.\n\nJosh was shocked by his wife’s condition.\n\n“To see in a matter of maybe five minutes, for her to go from a normal temperature to the condition she was in was really, really scary,” he said. “Very quickly, she went downhill very, very fast. She was in a state I’ve never seen her in.”\n\nJosh rushed his wife to the hospital. Her temperature was 102 degrees. She was too weak to walk on her own.\n\nHer temperature went up to 103 degrees. Finally, Amanda was sick enough that the doctors felt legally safe to terminate the pregnancy, she said.\n\n‘I was really scared I was going to lose her’\n\nBut Amanda was so sick that antibiotics wouldn’t stop the bacterial infection raging through her body. A blood transfusion didn’t cure her, either.\n\nAbout 12 hours after her pregnancy was terminated, doctors and nurses flooded her room.\n\n“There’s a lot of commotion, and I said, ‘what’s going on?’ and they said, ‘we’re moving you to the ICU,’ and I said, ‘why?’ and they said, ‘you’re developing symptoms of sepsis,’ ” she said.\n\nSepsis, the body’s extreme response to an infection, is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\nAmanda’s blood pressure plummeted. Her platelets dropped. She doesn’t remember much from that time.\n\nBut Josh does.\n\n“It was really scary to see Amanda crash,” he said. “I was really scared I was going to lose her.”\n\nFamily members flew in from across the country because they feared it would be the last time they would see Amanda.\n\nDoctors inserted an intravenous line near her heart to deliver antibiotics and medication to stabilize her blood pressure. Finally, Amanda turned the corner and survived.\n\n‘These barbaric laws’\n\nBut her medical ordeal isn’t over.\n\nAmanda’s uterus suffered scarring from the infection, and she may not be able to have more children. She had a surgery recently to fix the scarring, but it’s unclear whether it will be successful.\n\nThat leaves the Zurawskis scared – and furious that they might never have a family because of a Texas law.\n\n“[This] didn’t have to happen,” Amanda said. “That’s what’s so infuriating about all of this, is that we didn’t have to – we shouldn’t have had to – go through all of this trauma.”\n\nThe Zurawskis say the politicians who voted for the anti-abortion law call themselves “pro-life” – but they don’t see it that way.\n\n“Amanda almost died. That’s not pro-life. Amanda will have challenges in the future having more kids. That’s not pro-life,” Josh said.\n\n“Nothing about [this] feels pro-life,” his wife added.\n\nIn many ways, Amanda feels fortunate. She wonders whether she’d be alive today if it weren’t for her husband, who rushed her to the hospital and made sure she got the best care possible. And they have good jobs with good health insurance and they live in a big city with high quality health care.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“All of these things I had going for me, and still, this was the outcome,” she said.\n\nShe and Josh worry about women in rural areas, or poor women, or young, single mothers in states like Texas. What would happen to them, considering what happened to Amanda?\n\n“These barbaric laws prevented her from getting any amount of health care when she needed it, until it was at a life-threatening moment,” Josh said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cohen John Bonifield", "Elizabeth Cohen", "John Bonifield"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/asia/china-taiwan-invasion-scenarios-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "China has the power to take Taiwan, but it would cost an extremely ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nOn his first trip to Asia as United States President last week, Joe Biden gave his strongest warning yet to Beijing that Washington was committed to defending Taiwan militarily in the event of an attack from China.\n\nBiden’s comments, which compared a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, appeared to deviate from Washington’s decades-old policy of “strategic ambiguity” on the issue and seemingly raised the possibility of a military clash between US and Chinese forces.\n\nIt’s the third time Biden has made similar remarks since taking office and, just as on the other two occasions, they were quickly walked back by the White House – which insists its policy has not changed. However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels – bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles, many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017. Liu Chang/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nThe air war\n\nChina is likely to seek air superiority early into any conflict, analysts say, and may feel it has an advantage in the skies.\n\nFlight Global’s 2022 directory of the world’s air forces shows the PLA with almost 1,600 combat aircraft, compared to Taiwan’s fewer than 300. The directory shows the US with more than 2,700 combat aircraft, but those cover the world while China’s are all in the region.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Taiwan holds ceremony for advanced F-16V fighter jets 02:11 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the air war, China also will have learned from Russia’s failures in Ukraine – where Moscow took months assembling its ground forces yet failed to soften up the terrain for them with a bombing campaign – and is more likely to emulate the “shock and awe” bombardments that preceded the US’ invasions of Iraq.\n\n“I’m sure the PLA is learning from what they’re seeing,” Shugart said. “You can read open-source translations of their strategic documents. They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Residents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled.

China did not say specifically what sanctions it would levy against Pelosi and her immediate family over what it called her “egregious provocations” in visiting Taiwan, an island that China claims as its own territory.\n\nChina acted because Pelosi visited Taiwan “in disregard of China’s strong opposition and serious representations,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn another sign of deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, the White House summoned China's ambassador to the White House on Thursday to launch a formal protest over Beijing's recent aggressive actions against Taiwan.\n\nChina on Thursday launched threatening military exercises in six zones just off Taiwan’s coasts that it says will run through Sunday. Missiles also have been fired over Taiwan, defense officials told state media.\n\n\"We condemned (China's) military actions, which are irresponsible, at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability and across the Taiwan Strait,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. \"We made clear to the ambassador that Beijing’s actions are of concern to Taiwan, to us and to our partners around the world.\"\n\nChina has claimed that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan amounts to an attack by the Biden administration on Chinese sovereignty. The White House has stressed that Pelosi is the head of the legislative branch of government and that it could not stop her visit.\n\nThe White House also has said Pelosi’s visit does not signal a shift in its one-China policy, which acknowledges that Taiwan is part of China.\n\n“China has chosen to overreact and use the speaker’s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait,” Kirby told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n\nIn an effort to ease the tensions, Kirby said the U.S. would postpone intercontinental ballistic missile test scheduled for this week. Kirby said the decision to reschedule the test was intended to demonstrate “the behavior of a responsible nuclear power by reducing the risks of miscalculation and misperception.”\n\nPelosi, the first U.S. speaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years, said in Japan on Friday that China will not be able to isolate Taiwan by preventing U.S. officials from traveling there. The Chinese have tried to isolate Taiwan, Pelosi said, including most recently by preventing it from joining the World Health Organization.\n\n“They may try to keep Taiwan from visiting or participating in other places, but they will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there,” Pelosi said as she wrapped up a swing across Asia. Pelosi and five other members of Congress arrived in Tokyo late Thursday after visiting Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nChina’s announcement on Friday threatened to accelerate the friction with Washington.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said dialogue between U.S. and Chinese regional commanders and defense department heads would be canceled, along with talks on military maritime safety.\n\nCooperation on returning illegal immigrants, criminal investigations, transnational crime, illegal drugs and climate change will be suspended, the ministry said.\n\nThe Chinese military exercises launched Thursday involve its navy, air force and other departments and are to last until Sunday. They include missile strikes on targets in the seas north and south of the island in an echo of the last major Chinese military drills in 1995 and 1996 aimed at intimidating Taiwan’s leaders and voters.\n\nTaiwan has put its military on alert and staged civil defense drills, while the U.S. has numerous naval assets in the area. China also flew war planes toward Taiwan and blocked imports of its citrus and fish.\n\n'WE CAME TO TAIWAN TO LISTEN':Pelosi gives strong backing to Taiwan's democracy; US braces for Chinese military drills\n\nEarlier Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that China’s military exercises aimed at Taiwan represent a “grave problem” that threatens regional peace and security after five ballistic missiles launched as part of the drills landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone.\n\nKishida, speaking after breakfast with Pelosi and her congressional delegation, said the missile launches need to be “stopped immediately.”\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said five missiles landed on Thursday in Japan’s exclusive economic zone off Hateruma, an island far south of Japan’s main islands. He said Japan protested to China, saying the missiles “threatened Japan’s national security and the lives of the Japanese people, which we strongly condemn.”\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, attending a regional meeting in Cambodia, said China’s actions are “severely impacting peace and stability in the region and the international community, and we demand the immediate suspension of the military exercises.”\n\nJapan has in recent years bolstered its defense capability and troop presence in southwestern Japan and remote islands, including Okinawa, which is about 700 kilometers (420 miles) northeast of Taiwan. Many residents say they worry their island will be quickly embroiled in any Taiwan conflict. Okinawa is home to the majority of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact.\n\nSEE THE HISTORIC TRIP:Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan amid escalating tensions with China\n\nAt the breakfast earlier Friday, Pelosi and her congressional delegation also discussed their shared security concern over China, North Korea and Russia, and pledged their commitment to working toward peace and stability in Taiwan, Kishida said. Pelosi was also to hold talks with her Japanese counterpart, lower house Speaker Hiroyuki Hosoda.\n\nJapan and its key ally, the U.S., have been pushing for new security and economic frameworks with other democracies in the Indo-Pacific region and Europe as a counter to China’s growing influence amid rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei.\n\nDays before Pelosi’s Taiwan visit, a group of senior Japanese lawmakers, including former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, visited the island and discussed regional security with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Ishiba said Japan, while working with the United States to prevent conflict in the Indo-Pacific, wants a defense agreement with Taiwan.\n\nOn Thursday, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations issued a statement saying “there is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait.” It said China’s “escalatory response risks increasing tensions and destabilizing the region.”\n\nChina cited its displeasure over the statement for the last-minute cancellation of talks between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Cambodia on Thursday.\n\nPelosi held talks on Thursday in South Korea, also a key U.S. ally, which stayed away from the Taiwan issue, apparently to avoid upsetting China, focusing instead on North Korea’s increasing nuclear threat.\n\nIn recent years, South Korea has been struggling to strike a balance between the United States and China as their rivalry has deepened.\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi have said the United States remains committed to the so-called one-China policy, which recognizes Beijing as the government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. The administration discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from visiting.\n\nPelosi has been a long-time advocate of human rights in China. She, along with other lawmakers, visited Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1991 to support democracy two years after a bloody military crackdown on protesters at the square.\n\nAs leader of the House of Representatives, Pelosi’s trip has heightened U.S.-China tensions more than visits by other members of Congress. The last House speaker to visit Taiwan was Newt Gingrich in 1997.\n\nChina and Taiwan, which split in 1949 after a civil war, have no official relations but multibillion-dollar business ties.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/weather/fourth-of-july-weekend-weather-forecast/index.html", "title": "Weather forecast: Fourth of July weekend to see heavy rain, flight ...", "text": "Programming note: CNN’s annual Fourth In America special features musical performances from artists including the B-52s, Machine Gun Kelly and Pitbull, as well as fireworks shows from across the US.

On one of those plantations a continent away, 10-year-old Ima helped harvest the fruit that makes its way into a dizzying array of products sold by leading Western food and cosmetics brands.\n\nIma is among the estimated tens of thousands of children working alongside their parents in Indonesia and Malaysia, which supply 85% of the world’s most consumed vegetable oil. An Associated Press investigation found most earn little or no pay and are routinely exposed to toxic chemicals and other dangerous conditions. Some never go to school or learn to read and write. Others are smuggled across borders and left vulnerable to trafficking or sexual abuse. Many live in limbo with no citizenship and fear being swept up in police raids and thrown into detention.\n\nGirls Scouts speak out:Girl Scouts call on its cookie bakers to address child labor in Southeast Asia\n\nShopping malls:Struggle before COVID-19 and now have more empty stores. What's ahead post-pandemic?\n\nThe AP used U.S. Customs records and the most recently published data from producers, traders and buyers to trace the fruits of their labor from the processing mills where palm kernels were crushed to the supply chains of many popular kids’ cereals, candies and ice creams sold by Nestle, Unilever, Kellogg’s, PepsiCo and many other leading food companies, including Ferrero – one of the two makers of Girl Scout cookies.\n\nTwo girls' lives intersect\n\nOlivia, who earned a badge for selling more than 600 boxes of cookies, had spotted palm oil as an ingredient on the back of one of her packages but was relieved to see a green tree logo next to the words “certified sustainable.” She assumed that meant her Thin Mints and Tagalongs weren’t harming rainforests, orangutans or those harvesting the orange-red palm fruit.\n\nBut later, the whip-smart 11-year-old saw the word “mixed” in all caps on the label and turned to the internet, quickly learning that it meant exactly what she feared: Sustainable palm oil had been blended with oil from unsustainable sources. To her, that meant the cookies she was peddling were tainted.\n\nThousands of miles away in Indonesia, Ima led her class in math and dreamed of becoming a doctor. Then one day her father made her quit school because he needed help meeting the high company targets on the palm oil plantation where she was born. Instead of attending fourth grade, she squatted in the unrelenting heat, snatching up the loose kernels littering the ground and knowing if she missed even one, her family’s pay would be cut.\n\nShe sometimes worked 12 hours a day, wearing only flip flops and no gloves, crying when the fruit’s razor-sharp spikes bloodied her hands or when scorpions stung her fingers. The loads she carried, sometimes so heavy she would lose her footing, went to one of the very mills feeding into the supply chain of Olivia’s cookies.\n\n“I am dreaming one day I can go back to school,” she told the AP, tears rolling down her cheeks.\n\nChronicling child labor\n\nChild labor has long been a dark stain on the $65 billion global palm oil industry. Though often denied or minimized as kids simply helping their families on weekends or after school, it has been identified as a problem by rights groups, the United Nations and the U.S. government.\n\nWith little or no access to daycare, some young children follow their parents to the fields, where they come into contact with fertilizers and some pesticides that are banned in other countries. As they grow older, they push wheelbarrows heaped with fruit two or three times their weight. Some weed and prune the trees barefoot, while teen boys may harvest bunches large enough to crush them, slicing the fruit from lofty branches with sickle blades attached to long poles.\n\nIn some cases, an entire family may earn less in a day than a $5 box of Girl Scout Do-si-dos.\n\n“For 100 years, families have been stuck in a cycle of poverty and they know nothing else than work on a palm oil plantation,” said Kartika Manurung, who has published reports detailing labor issues on Indonesian plantations. “When I … ask the kids what they want to be when they grow up, some of the girls say, ‘I want to be the wife of a palm oil worker.’”\n\nThe AP’s investigation into child labor is part of a broader in-depth look at the industry that also exposed rape, forced labor, trafficking and slavery. Reporters crisscrossed Malaysia and Indonesia, speaking to more than 130 current and former workers – some two dozen of them child laborers – at nearly 25 companies. Their locations are not being disclosed and only partial names or nicknames are being used due to fears of retribution.\n\nDunkin' Extra Charged Coffee:New drink has 20% more caffeine\n\nThe AP found children working on plantations and corroborated accounts of abuse, whenever possible, by reviewing police reports and legal documents. Reporters also interviewed more than 100 activists, teachers, union leaders, government officials, researchers, lawyers and clergy, including some who helped victims of trafficking or sexual assault.\n\nIndonesian government officials said they do not know how many children work in the country’s massive palm oil industry, either full or part time. But the U.N.’s International Labor Organization has estimated 1.5 million children between 10 and 17 years old labor in its agricultural sector. Palm oil is one of the largest crops, employing some 16 million people.\n\nIn much smaller neighboring Malaysia, a newly released government report estimated more than 33,000 children work in the industry there, many under hazardous conditions – with nearly half of them between the ages of 5 and 11. The study was conducted in 2018 after the country was slammed by the U.S. government over the use of child labor, and it did not directly address the large number of migrant children without documents hidden on many plantations in its eastern states, some of whom have never seen the inside of a classroom.\n\nIndustry attempts at ethical sourcing\n\nMany producers, Western buyers and banks belong to the 4,000-member Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a global association that provides a green stamp of approval to those committed to supplying, sourcing, financing or using palm oil that’s been certified as ethically sourced.\n\nThe RSPO has a system in place to address grievances, including labor abuse allegations. But of the nearly 100 complaints listed on its case tracker for the two Southeast Asian countries in the last decade, only a handful have mentioned children.\n\n“It is an issue, and we know it’s an issue,” said Dan Strechay, the RSPO’s global outreach and engagement director, adding that the association has started working with UNICEF and others to educate members about what constitutes child labor.\n\nStrechay said many parents in Indonesia and Malaysia believe it’s the “cultural norm” for their kids to work alongside family members, even if it means pulling them out of school. “And that’s not OK,” he said.\n\nPalm oil is contained in roughly half the products on supermarket shelves and in almost three out of every four cosmetic brands, though that can be hard to discern since it appears on labels under more than 200 different names.\n\nAnd in a world where more and more consumers are demanding to know the provenance of the raw materials in the products they purchase, many companies are quick to issue assurances that they are committed to “sustainable” sourcing. But supply chains often are murky – especially in the palm oil industry – and developing countries that produce commodities in large volumes cheaply often do so by disregarding the environment and minimizing labor costs.\n\nA questioning Girl Scout\n\nMost people take words like “organic,” “fair trade” and “sustainable” at face value. But not Olivia. She became increasingly worried about palm oil, rifling through the kitchen cupboards in her family’s century-old farmhouse in Jonesborough, Tennessee, to inspect the ingredients printed on cans and wrappers. Then she began digging through her shampoos and lotions, trying to make sense of the scientific-sounding names she saw there.\n\nNow 14, Olivia has fired letters off to the head of Girl Scouts of the USA, demanding answers about how the palm oil is sourced for the organization’s cookies. She’s started an online petition to get it removed. And she and some other members of Troop 543 have stopped selling them.\n\nThe Girl Scouts did not respond to questions from the AP, directing reporters to the two bakers that make the cookies. Those companies and their parent corporations also had no comment on the findings.\n\n“I thought Girl Scouts was supposed to be about making the world a better place,” Olivia said. “But this isn’t at all making the world better.\"\n\nMany kids are introduced to palm oil soon after they’re born – it’s a primary fat in infant formula. And as they grow, it’s present in many of their favorite foods: It’s in their Pop-Tarts and Cap’n Crunch cereal, Oreo cookies, KitKat candy bars, Magnum ice cream, doughnuts and even bubble gum.\n\n“Let them enjoy it,” said Abang, a skinny 14-year-old who dropped out of the fifth grade to help his father on an Indonesian plantation and has never tasted ice cream. He has accepted his own fate, but still dreams of a better future for his little brother.\n\n“Let me work, just me, helping my father,” Abang said. “I want my brother to go back to school. … I don’t want him in the same difficult situation like me.”\n\nPalm oil's cycle of oppression\n\nThough many consumers aren’t familiar with it, palm oil became ubiquitous nearly two decades ago after warnings about health risks associated with trans fats. Almost overnight, food manufacturers began shifting to the highly versatile and cheap oil.\n\nIndonesia is the world’s largest palm oil producer and, with a population of 270 million, there is no shortage of strong backs. Many laborers migrate from the poorest corners of the country to take jobs that others shun, often bringing their wives and children as helpers in order to meet impossibly high daily quotas.\n\nOthers have been living on the same plantations for generations, creating a built-in workforce – when one harvester retires or dies, another in the family takes his place to hold onto company-subsidized housing, which often is a dilapidated shack with no running water and sometimes only limited electricity.\n\nIt’s a cycle that 15-year-old Jo was trying to break. Even though he had to help his family in the fields each day, heaving palm fruits high over his head and lobbing them onto trucks, his parents let him keep $6 a month to cover school fees so he could attend morning classes.\n\n“I am determined to finish high school to find a job outside the plantation,” said Jo, who toiled alongside his mother, father and grandfather. “My parents are very poor. Why should I follow my parents?”\n\nBut for many migrant children in neighboring Malaysia – which relies almost entirely on foreign workers to fill constant labor shortages – the hurdles to a brighter life seem insurmountable.\n\nMale harvesters technically are not allowed to bring their families to plantations on Borneo island, which is shared by both countries. So children often follow behind, sometimes traveling alone on illicit smugglers’ routes known as “jalan tikus,” or rat roads. The perilous border crossings to the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak can take place at night, either on foot across winding jungle paths or in packed speed boats racing without lights, sometimes colliding or capsizing in the dark.\n\nAn official estimate says 80,000 children of illegal migrants, mostly from Indonesia and the Philippines, are living in Sabah alone, but some rights groups say the true number could be nearly double that. Without birth certificates and with no path to citizenship, they are essentially stateless – denied access to even the most basic rights, and at high risk of exploitation.\n\nMalaysian child labor situation serious\n\nMigrant workers without documents are often treated “inhumanely” in Malaysia, said Soes Hindharno, an official from Indonesia’s Manpower Ministry. He said he had not received any complaints about child labor occurring in his own country, but an official from the ministry that oversees women and children’s issues acknowledged it was an area of growing concern in Indonesia.\n\nMalaysia’s Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but Nageeb Wahab, head of the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a government-supported umbrella group, called allegations of child labor very serious and urged complaints to be reported to authorities.\n\nChildren of migrant parents grow up living in fear they will be separated from their families. They try to remain invisible to avoid attracting the ever-watchful eyes of police, with some keeping backpacks with supplies ready in case they need to flee their houses and sleep in the jungle to avoid raids.\n\nMany never leave their guarded plantations, some so remote that workers must climb hills to search for a phone signal. And for those who dare to go out, trouble can come quickly.\n\nAlex was 12 when he began working 10 hours a day on a small plantation with his father, hoisting fruits so heavy his aching muscles kept him awake at night. One day, he decided to sneak off to visit his favorite aunt in a nearby village. With no passport, Alex said authorities quickly found him and carted him off to a crowded immigration detention center where he was held for a month.\n\n“There were hundreds of other people there, some my age, and also younger children, mostly with their mothers,” he said. “I was very afraid and kept thinking about how worried my mother and father must be. It made it hard to even eat or drink.”\n\nChild workers lack school, health care\n\nBut the biggest obstacles faced by Alex and other child workers in the two countries are lack of access to adequate, affordable education and medical care.\n\nSome companies in Indonesia provide rudimentary elementary schooling on plantations, but children who want to continue their studies may find they have to travel too far on poor roads or that they can’t afford it. In Malaysia, the problem is even bigger: Without legal documents, tens of thousands of kids are not allowed to go to government schools at all.\n\nIt’s such an extensive problem that Indonesia has set up learning centers to help some of its children on plantations in the neighboring country, even sending in its own teachers. But with such heavy workloads on plantations, one instructor said he had to beg parents to let their sons and daughters come for even just a half-day of classes. And many children, especially those living in remote, hard-to-reach areas, still have no access to any type of education.\n\n“Why aren’t companies playing a role in setting up schools in collaboration with the government?” asked Glorene Das, executive director of Tenaganita, a Malaysian nonprofit group concentrating on migrant issues for more than two decades. “Why are they encouraging the children to work instead?”\n\nMedical care also is woeful, with experts saying poor nutrition and daily exposure to toxic chemicals are undermining child laborers’ health and development. Many Indonesian plantations have their own basic clinics, but access may be available only to full-time workers. Travel to a private doctor or hospital can take hours, and most families cannot afford outside care. Migrant children without documents in Malaysia have no right to health care and often are too scared to seek medical help in villages or cities – even in life-threatening emergencies.\n\nMany young palm oil workers also have little understanding about reproductive health. Girls working on remote plantations are vulnerable to sexual abuse, and teen pregnancies and marriages are common.\n\nAna was just 13 when she first arrived in Malaysia, quickly learning, as she put it, that “anything can happen to the female workers there.” She said she was raped and forced to marry her attacker, but eventually managed to break free after years of abuse and return home to start a new life. Now a mother with kids of her own, she abruptly left Indonesia last year again to look for work in Malaysia.\n\nMany children do not have the option to ever leave. They are born on plantations, work there and sometimes die there. Overgrown headstones and crosses marking graves in crude cemeteries are found on some plantations near the towering palm trees.\n\nOthers, like 48-year-old Anna’s husband, are buried in community graveyards along the Indonesian and Malaysian border. A month after the palm oil harvester’s death, Anna lovingly tended his plot at the Christian site in Sabah, crammed with the bodies of hundreds of other migrants.\n\nShe said her son, whose own newborn baby was buried in the adjacent grave, had inherited his father’s job. He is the family’s main breadwinner now.\n\nThe cycle continues.\n\nAttempts at change continue\n\nOlivia is not the first Girl Scout to raise questions about the way palm oil makes its way into the beloved American cookies.\n\nMore than a decade ago, two girls in a Michigan troop stopped selling S’mores and other seasonal favorites because they worried palm oil’s expansion in Indonesia and Malaysia was destroying rainforests and killing endangered animals like orangutans.\n\nAfter they campaigned for several years, the Girl Scouts of the USA became an affiliate member of the RSPO and agreed to start using sustainable palm oil, adding the green tree logo to its roughly 200 million boxes of cookies, which bring in nearly $800 million annually.\n\nThe RSPO was created with the best of intentions and it attempts to factor in the interests of a wide array of groups, including environmental organizations, industry leaders and banks. Its mission was not to flip a switch overnight, but to encourage the mammoth palm oil industry to evolve after years of breakneck growth and little outside oversight.\n\nStill, for many food and cosmetic companies facing increased pressure from conscientious consumers, the association’s stamp of approval has become the go-to answer when questions are raised about their commitments to sustainability.\n\nMonitoring the millions of workers hidden beneath palms covering an area equal to roughly the size of New Zealand, however, is next to impossible.\n\nSome women and children on remote, sprawling plantations told the AP and labor rights groups that they are ordered to hide or stay home when sustainability auditors visit. They said only the optimal, easiest-to-reach parts of a plantation are typically showcased, with poor living and working conditions in distant areas hidden from outside eyes.\n\n“The RSPO promises sustainable palm oil. But it doesn’t mean that that palm oil is free of child labor or other abuses,” said Robin Averbeck of the Rainforest Action Network, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that has found pervasive problems on plantations, including those certified as sustainable. “It has simply become a tool for greenwashing.”\n\nWhen contacted by the AP, companies reaffirmed their support of human rights for all workers, with some noting they rely on their suppliers to meet industry standards and abide by local laws. If evidence of wrongdoing is found, some said they would immediately cut ties with producers.\n\n“We aim to prevent and address the issue of child labor wherever it occurs in our supply chain,” said Nestle, maker of KitKat candy bars. Unilever – the world’s biggest ice-cream maker, including Magnum – noted that its suppliers “must not, under any circumstance, employ individuals under the age of 15 or under the local legal minimum age for work or mandatory schooling.” There was no response from Mondelez, which owns Oreo cookies, or Cap’n Crunch parent company PepsiCo.\n\nConsumers have their own challenges in trying to buy responsibly. Those, like Olivia, who want to make sense of where their palm oil really comes from often find themselves confused, since the dense terms used to explain what makes palm oil sustainable can sometimes raise even more questions.\n\nTake Girls Scout cookies, for instance, which are made by two different U.S. bakers\n\nBoxes from both are stamped with green palm logos. The maker of Olivia’s cookies, Little Brownie Bakers in Kentucky, has the word “mixed” beside the tree, meaning as little as 1 percent of the palm oil might be certified sustainable. ABC Bakers in Virginia says “credits,” which means money is going toward promoting sustainable production.\n\nThe bakers’ parent companies – Italian confectionary brand Ferrero and Canadian-based Weston Foods – would not comment on the issue of child labor, but both said they were committed to sourcing only certified sustainable palm oil.\n\nWeston Foods, which owns ABC Bakers, would not provide any information about its palm oil suppliers, citing proprietary reasons, so the AP could not determine if its supply chain was tainted.\n\nPalm oil, the highest-yielding vegetable oil, is an important part of the two Southeast Asian countries’ economies and the governments bristle at any form of criticism, saying the industry plays an important role in alleviating poverty.\n\nThey have banned products touted as “palm oil-free” from supermarket shelves and created slogans calling the crop “God’s gift.” And when students at an international school in Malaysia were criticized last year for staging a play questioning the industry’s effect on the environment, school administrators responded with an apology.\n\nBack in Indonesia, Ima could give a very different classroom presentation about palm oil, but she has no chance. She continues to toil full time on the plantation alongside her family, even though her mother had promised she eventually could resume her studies.\n\n“Sometimes my friends ask me, ‘Why did you drop out? Why are you not at school?’” Ima said, her resentment readily apparent. “‘Because I have to help my father. If you want to replace me and help my father, then I will go to school. How about that?’”\n\nAfter learning about Ima, Olivia is even more determined to fight on. She sent letters to her customers explaining her reasons for no longer selling Girl Scout cookies, and many responded by donating money to her Southern Appalachian troop to show support.\n\nNow, Olivia is asking Girl Scouts across the country to band with her, saying, “The cookies deceive a lot of people. They think it’s sustainable, but it isn’t.\n\n“I’m not just some little girl who can’t do anything about this,” she says. “Children can make change in the world. And we’re going to.”\n\nThis story was funded in part by the McGraw Center for Business Journalism at CUNY’s Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/middleeast/iran-morality-police-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Iran's morality police have terrorized women for decades. Who are ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nA young Iranian woman was pulled off the streets of Tehran by the country’s notorious morality police and taken to a “re-education center” for lessons in modesty last week. Three days later, she was dead.\n\nThe government has strongly rejected responsibility for 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death, but the news has nonetheless galvanized thousands of Iranian women who have for decades faced the wrath of the Islamic Republic’s morality enforcers firsthand.\n\nAmini’s story has pulled Iran’s apparatus of discipline back into the limelight, raising the question of accountability and impunity enjoyed by the country’s clerical elite.\n\n“It would be hard to find an average Iranian woman or an average family who does not have a story of interaction with [the morality police and re-education centers],” said Tara Sepehri Far, a senior researcher in the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch. “That is how present they are.”\n\nThe morality police are a law enforcement force with access to power, arms and detention centers, she said. They also have control over the recently introduced “re-education centers.”\n\nThe centers act like detention facilities, where women – and sometimes men – are taken into custody for failing to comply with the state’s rules on modesty. Inside the facilities, detainees are given classes about Islam and the importance of the hijab (or headscarf), and then forced to sign a pledge to abide by the state’s clothing regulations before they are released.\n\nThe first of these establishments opened in 2019, said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, adding that “since their creation, which has no basis in any law, agents of these centers have arbitrarily detained countless women under the pretense of not complying with the state’s forced hijab.”\n\n“The women are then treated like criminal[s], booked for their offense, photographed and forced to take a class about how to wear a proper hijab and Islamic morality,” he added.\n\nIran had been dictating to women how they should dress long before the establishment of the current Islamic Republic. In 1936, the pro-Western ruler Reza Shah banned the wearing of allveils and headscarves in an effort to modernize the country. Many women resisted. Then, the Islamic regime that overthrew the Shah’s Pahlavi dynasty made the hjiab compulsory in 1979, but the rule was only written into law in 1983.\n\nA task force with all the powers of a law enforcement agency, the morality police are tasked with ensuring that the rules are followed.\n\nA number of anti-hijab movements emerge every few years in Iran, often leading to waves of arrests and persecution. These include the “Girls of Revolution Street” in 2017 , as well as this year’s brief social media protests on the country’s National Hijab and Chastity Day, which is observed annually on July 12 to promote veiling.\n\nBut disagreements have emerged on the issue of the compulsory hijab, both among citizens and within the leadership.\n\nA survey by a parliament-linked research center in 2018 showed that there has been a decrease in the number of people who believe that the government should enforce the headscarf. And a 2014 report by the Iranian Students’ News Agency showed a 15% rise in those believing that hijab should not be compulsory.\n\nThere has also been a rhetorical shift among the country’s leadership, calling for “education” and “correction” as opposed to forceful implementation of Islamic values, says the researcher, Sepehri Far.\n\nSome say that Iran is slowly nearing a tipping point as the government faces mounting discontent over a crippled economy and skyrocketing inflation caused by US sanctions.\n\nAmini’s death seems to be uniting Iranians of different mindsets, says Sepehri Far, adding that criticism over the incident is coming not just from regime opponents, but also from citizens with no previous history of dissidence, as well as those who are close to power.\n\nThousands across Iran took to the streets Tuesday night, according to witnesses and social media footage.\n\nVideos on social media showed a woman cutting her hair in protest, as the crowd chants “death to the dictator” in Kerman province in southeast Iran. In other parts of the country, demonstrators chanted “We are the children of war, come on and fight, we’ll fight back,” and “death to Khamenei.”\n\n“This time protesters aren’t only calling for justice for Mahsa Amini,” said Ghaemi. “They’re also calling for women’s rights, for their civil and human rights, for a life without a religious dictatorship.”\n\nWhile there is a sense that the regime may feel vulnerable, some question whether the current movement will expand or simply weaken in the face of a state crackdown.\n\n“Not only are these protests brutally cracked down [on] and contained each time, but there is no leadership,” said Tara Kangarlou, author of “The Heartbeat of Iran,” who grew up under the gaze of the morality police.\n\n“Growing up as a teenager, we would make sure we avoid[ed] streets that we knew the morality police vans would be parked [on] during the weekend,” said Kangarlou.\n\nShe says young Iranians have evolved within the “oppressive system” in order to live their lives, but the “average Iranian is fed up.”\n\nThe digest\n\nTunisia’s anti-terrorism police arrest former leader\n\nTunisia’s anti-terrorism police detained for one day Ali Laarayedh, a former prime minister and senior official in the opposition Ennahda party, after an investigation into allegations jihadists were sent to Syria, Reuters cited lawyers as saying on Tuesday. In the same case, police also temporarily postponed a hearing for Tunisia’s opposition leader and speaker of the dissolved parliament, Rached Ghannouchi.\n\nBackground: Last month, several former security officials and two Ennahda members were arrested on charges connected to Tunisians traveling abroad for jihad. Security and official sources estimated that around 6,000 Tunisians traveled to Syria and Iraq over the last decade to join jihadist groups including ISIS. Many were killed there while others escaped and returned to Tunisia.\n\nWhy it matters: Ennahda denies accusations of terrorism, calling the allegations a political attack on a foe of President Kais Saied. Ghannouchi, 81, has accused Saied of an anti-democratic coup since he seized most powers last summer, shutting down the parliament and moving to rule by decree, powers he has largely formalized with a new constitution ratified in a July referendum.\n\nSaudi Arabia buys pair of SpaceX astronaut seats\n\nSaudi Arabia plans to launch two astronauts to the International Space Station aboard a space capsule from Elon Musk’s SpaceX ship, according to a Reuters report.\n\nBackground: People familiar with the arrangement told Reuters that the deal was privately signed earlier this year with Houston’s Axiom Space, which arranges private missions to US spacecraft for researchers and tourists. The Saudi astronauts will ride SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule to the space station for a roughly weeklong stay early next year.\n\nWhy it matters: The Saudi astronauts will be the first of their country to travel into space on a private spacecraft. Saudi Arabia will also become the latest Gulf nation to forge ties with private US space companies, which are growing key players in diplomacy in a field long dominated by government agencies such as NASA.\n\nTurkish, Israeli leaders hold first face-to-face meeting in 15 years\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, said Lapid’s office. The meeting was the first face-to-face talks between the top leaders of the two countries since 2008.\n\nBackground: “Yesterday, I had a productive meeting with @RTEdogan,” tweeted Lapid , “the first between the President of Türkiye and Israel’s Prime Minster in nearly 15 years.” Lapid added that relations between the two countries are “key for regional stability,” as well as bringing “tangible benefits for both our countries.”\n\nWhy it matters: Relations between Israel and Turkey had been fraught for many years, mainly over the Palestinian cause. But ties have warmed of late, and in August the countries said they would restore full diplomatic links and reappoint their ambassadors.\n\nWhat’s trending\n\nToday, the people of Great Britain and the world pay tribute and bid a final farewell to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, commemorating her legacy and unwavering service.

Another user called on Salah to read up on the Queen’s history in the Arab world. “Brother do u know what this woman’s empire did to our country or shall I inform u,” tweeted another.\n\nOther users, however, jumped to Salah’s defense, saying the blowback was not justified. Egyptian sports journalist Omar Elbanouby tweeted: “Hands off Mohammed Salah… he is a professional footballer.. not a political activist.”\n\nSudanese writer Mohammed Abo Zaco called out some of Salah’s critics for hypocrisy, pointing out that it was seemingly OK for Arabs to support British football clubs and drive British cars, but not to pay respects to the Queen, who was laid to rest on Monday.\n\nEuropean football clubs are immensely popular in the Arab world, with some being owned by regional governments, including Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.

The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n“We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military’s commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, “SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.”\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX’s own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk’s Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: “F*** off.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk’s claimed peace plan for Russia’s Ukraine war by saying: “F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.”\n\n“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN’s reporting and Melnyk’s comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. “That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,” said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.”\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a “catastrophic” loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn’t dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX’s suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk’s allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he “still very much support[s] Ukraine” but fears “massive escalation.”\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn’t want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, “Russia would accept those terms,” according to a person who heard them.\n\n“Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,” the person familiar with the discussions said. “The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That’s Elon Musk. He hasn’t been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.”\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine’s infrastructure, Musk replied: “You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.”\n\n“The gall to look like heroes”\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it’s hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It’s not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,” said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “Without that they’d be really operating in the blind in many cases.”\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX’s request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has “the gall to look like heroes” while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid – or partially paid – for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units’ “exceptional utility” and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine’s new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, “The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine’s armed forces as they repel Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.”\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level – $4,500 a month – to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n“You could say he’s trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‘I don’t want to be part of this anymore,’” said the person familiar with Ukraine’s requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk’s reputation for being unpredictable, “Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,” this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter – including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he’d made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called “The Weekend,” at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they’ve had recent victories.\n\n“This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it,” he said, according to a person in the room. “Everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning. For now.”", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/04/pelosi-south-korea-taiwan-china/10233367002/", "title": "Pelosi visits South Korea, avoids public comments on Taiwan, China", "text": "Hyung-Jin Kim and Huizhong Wu\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSEOUL, South Korea – After infuriating China over her trip to Taiwan, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met South Korean political leaders in Seoul on Thursday but avoided making direct public comments on relations with Beijing and Taipei that could further increase regional tensions.\n\nPelosi, the first House speaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years, said Wednesday in Taipei that the American commitment to democracy in the self-governing island and elsewhere \"remains ironclad.\" In response, China on Thursday began military exercises, including missile strike training, in six zones surrounding Taiwan, in what could be the biggest of their kind since the mid-1990s.\n\nAfter visiting Taiwan, Pelosi and other members of her congressional delegation flew to South Korea — a key U.S. ally where about 28,500 American troops are deployed — on Wednesday evening, as part of an Asian tour that included earlier stops in Singapore and Malaysia. After South Korea, Pelosi will travel to Japan.\n\nShe met South Korean National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin Pyo and other senior members of Parliament on Thursday. After that hourlong meeting, Pelosi spoke about the bilateral alliance, forged in blood during the 1950-53 Korean War, and legislative efforts to boost ties, but didn't directly mention her Taiwan visit or the Chinese protests.\n\nPelosi in Taiwan:Pelosi gives strong backing to Taiwan's democracy; US braces for Chinese military drills\n\n\"We also come to say to you that a friendship, (the) relationship that began from urgency and security, many years ago, has become the warmest of friendships,\" Pelosi said in a joint news conference with Kim. \"We want to advance security, economy and governance in an inter-parliamentary way.\"\n\nNeither Pelosi nor Kim took questions from journalists.\n\nKim said he and Pelosi shared concerns about North Korea's increasing nuclear threat. He said the two agreed to support their governments' push for denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula based on both strong deterrence against North Korea and diplomacy.\n\nPelosi and her delegation later spoke by phone with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on the alliance, foreign policy and other issues. Yoon is on vacation this week, but critics accuse him of intentionally shunning a face-to-face meeting with Pelosi in consideration of ties with China, South Korea's biggest trading partner. Yoon's office said it had reviewed national interests and that Yoon's vacation plan had already been set up when, about two weeks ago, Pelosi's side contacted his office about a possible meeting.\n\nDuring the phone conversation, Pelosi and other members of her congressional delegation didn't bring up the Taiwan issue, and Yoon also didn't raise the matter, Yoon's office said.\n\nIn recent years, South Korea has been struggling to strike a balance between the United States and China as their rivalry has deepened. Yoon, a conservative, took office in May with a vow to boost South Korea's military alliance with the United States and take a tougher line on North Korean provocations.\n\nPelosi expected to visit North Korean border\n\nLater Thursday, Pelosi was to visit a border area with North Korea that is jointly controlled by the American-led United Nations Command and North Korea, South Korean officials said. If that visit occurs, Pelosi would be the highest-level American to go to the Joint Security Area since then-President Donald Trump visited in 2019 for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nYoon said Pelosi's visit to the JSA would demonstrate \"a strong deterrence against North Korea\" by the allies, said Kim Tae-hyo, a deputy presidential national security adviser.\n\nSouth Korean media, citing no sources, later reported that Pelosi visited the JSA but gave no further details. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul, the U.N. Command and the South Korean Defense Ministry couldn't immediately confirm the reports.\n\nSitting inside the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, a buffer created at the end of the Korean War, the JSA is the site of past bloodshed and a venue for numerous talks. U.S. presidents and other top officials have often traveled to the JSA and other border areas to reaffirm their security commitment to South Korea.\n\nAny statement critical of North Korea by Pelosi is certain to draw a furious response. On Wednesday, the North's Foreign Ministry slammed the United States over her Taiwan trip, saying \"the current situation clearly shows that the impudent interference of the U.S. in internal affairs of other countries … (is) the root cause of harassed peace and security in the region.\"\n\nChinese launch military exercises\n\nThe Chinese military exercises launched Thursday and planned to last until Sunday involve its navy, air force and other departments. They include missile strikes on targets in the seas north and south of the island in an echo of the last major Chinese military drills aimed at intimidating Taiwan's leaders and voters in 1995 and 1996.\n\nChina's official Xinhua News Agency said the exercises are joint operations focused on \"blockade, sea target assault, strike on ground targets, and airspace control.\"\n\nTaiwan has put its military on alert and staged civil defense drills, while the U.S. has numerous naval assets in the area. Taiwan's Defense Ministry called the Chinese drills \"unreasonable actions in an attempt to change the status quo, destroy the peace and stability of the region.\"\n\nChina views Taiwan as a breakaway province to be annexed by force if necessary. It considers visits to Taiwan by foreign officials as recognizing its sovereignty.\n\n\"Today the world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy,\" Pelosi said in a short speech during a meeting with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday. \"America's determination to preserve democracy, here in Taiwan and around the world, remains ironclad.\"\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi have said the United States remains committed to the \"one-China policy,\" which recognizes Beijing as the sole, legitimate government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. The administration discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from visiting.\n\nPelosi noted in Taiwan that congressional support for Taiwan is bipartisan, and she praised the island's democracy. She stopped short of saying that the U.S would defend Taiwan militarily and emphasized that Congress is \"committed to the security of Taiwan, in order to have Taiwan be able to most effectively defend themselves.\"\n\nTsai said at her meeting with Pelosi that \"facing deliberately heightened military threats, Taiwan will not back down.\"\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Wednesday that U.S. officials \"don't believe we're at the brink now, and there's certainly no reason for anybody to be talking about being at the brink going forward.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations called for calm in the Taiwan Strait, which separates mainland China and Taiwan, and urged the avoidance of any \"provocative action.\" ASEAN foreign ministers, who are meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for a regional forum, said they were concerned the situation could \"destabilize the region and eventually could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers.\"\n\nPelosi's focus has always been the same, she said, going back to her 1991 visit to Beijing's Tiananmen Square, when she and other lawmakers unfurled a small banner supporting democracy two years after a bloody military crackdown on protesters at the square.

That's nearly five hours of viewing, which is a marathon for one night.\n\nBut if you're committed to seeing them both first, there are some strategies you should consider.\n\nWhat is the 'Barbie' movie about?\n\nDirected by Greta Gerwig and co-written with Noah Baumbach, the “Barbie” movie will be the first live-action Barbie film. The movie follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) as they leave “Barbieland” and go on an adventure to the real world. At the same time Mattel CEO (Will Ferrell) is trying to put Barbie back in a box.\n\nBesides Robbie, Gosling and Ferrell, the movie will star Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, America Ferrera, Michael Cera and Issa Rae.\n\nWhat is 'Oppenheimer' about?\n\nWritten, directed and produced by Christopher Nolan, “Oppenheimer” is a biographical thriller about J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) a theoretical physicist who led The Manhattan Project that developed an atomic bomb for the United States during World War II.\n\nThe cast includes Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Jack Quaid, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Josh Peck and Devon Bostick.\n\nDon't spend an arm and a leg:How to get cheap movie tickets this summer in Phoenix\n\nThe ideal theater for 'Oppenheimer'\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan suggests that the best way to see his latest film is at a theater that runs 70mm film. Lucky for us, the Arizona Mills 18 theater located on 5000 S. Arizona Mills Circle has one of the only 70mm IMAX screens (showing films in the the highest resolution format that exists) in the state, one of only 19 in the country and 30 in the world.\n\n\"If you’re able to secure tickets, it’s a tremendous way to see 'Oppenheimer,'\" Harkins Theatres CEO Mike Bowers told The Republic.\n\nBowers said they expect to have a “record-setting” weekend coming up with the amount of presale tickets already sold. He believes that “Barbie” box office is going to be over $100 million on opening weekend nationally and “Oppenheimer” will be about $50 or $60 million.\n\nThe best theater to see 'Barbie'\n\nSeveral Harkins theaters will have “Barbie” Blowout Parties on Friday, July 19, with giveaways at 7 p.m., and cocktails and mocktails available as well.\n\nBut for major Barbie fans, on Saturday, July 22, Harkins Theatre Camelview at Fashion Square is hosting a ticketed Barbie Dream Party that includes a “Barbie” movie ticket, medium popcorn, Pink Dream cocktail, mocktail or medium drink, a “Barbie” gift, giveaways and photo ops. Tickets are $35 and gifts vary by showtimes.\n\nIf you want to see \"Oppenheimer\" in highest resolution and party with Barbie, you'll need to plan for drive time between the theaters.\n\nShould I see 'Oppenheimer' or 'Barbie' first?\n\nBowers said his strategy would be to watch “Barbie” first and then “Oppenheimer.”\n\nBowers suggested customers go to the website or the Harkins app to buy tickets for both blockbuster showings and to coordinate movie times.\n\nIf you're staying at the same theater, which is the more logistically simple plan, you'll want to have about 30 minutes to take a bathroom break, stretch your legs, grab some snacks and watch some previews before the next film, so plan your viewing accordingly.\n\nPossible showtimes that could work for your double feature at the Arizona Mills 18 Harkins on opening day, Friday, July 21 include watching \"Barbie\" at 12:00 p.m. and \"Oppenheimer\" at 2:30 p.m. or \"Barbie\" at 4 p.m. and \"Oppenheimer\" at 6:30 p.m.\n\nIf you'd like to watch \"Oppenheimer\" first you can do the 2:30 p.m. showing and then the 6 p.m. showing of \"Barbie\" or go to \"Oppenheimer\" at 6:30 p.m. and see \"Barbie\" at 10 p.m.\n\nIf you are trying to plan a double header – especially on opening day – it's essential you buy your tickets in advance as many time slots have already sold out and seats are limited.\n\n“Start looking at the showtimes right now and get in as soon as you can,” Bowers said.\n\nTo reward your movie-watching efforts, Harkins Theatres is offering a promotion called \"Mission: Barbenheimer\" where, if you see “Barbie,” “Oppenheimer” and “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\" (which opened on Friday, July 14), loyalty members will receive a five-dollar loyalty reward that can be spent on tickets or concessions.\n\nDon't miss these on the big screen:10 new movies we can't wait to watch this summer from 'Barbie' to \"The Blackening\"\n\nReach the reporter at dina.kaur@arizonarepublic.com.

The long-gestating project finally found a star in two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie (“Babylon”), who has hinted at a more subversive spin on the pink-clad heroine. A new trailer, released May 25, has given us a better idea of what the movie is about, with Barbie pondering her existence and venturing to the human world.\n\nHere’s everything we know about the eye-popping comedy, which awards pundits have already tipped as an early Oscar contender:\n\nWhat is the release date for 'Barbie' movie 2023?\n\n“Barbie” will be released July 21 in theaters. The movie is out the same day as Christopher Nolan’s similarly star-studded “Oppenheimer,” a true-life drama detailing the birth of the atomic bomb. The shared release date has sparked a variety of memes on social media, with cinephiles pitting the highly anticipated films against each other in a playful box-office rivalry.\n\nWho is in the 'Barbie' cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling? (Hint: Not Gal Gadot.)\n\nHalf of Hollywood, basically. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling lead the bunch as Barbie and Ken. Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Nicola Coughlan, Hari Nef and many more play other Barbies, while Simu Liu and Kingsley Ben-Adir are among the various Kens. Emerald Fennell and Michael Cera portray now-discontinued dolls Midge and Allan, respectively, and pop star Dua Lipa appears as a mermaid Barbie. America Ferrera and Will Ferrell help round out the cast as human characters.\n\nRobbie revealed in her new Vogue cover story that Gal Gadot was considered for a Barbie, although the \"Wonder Woman\" star couldn't commit. “Gal Gadot is Barbie energy,” Robbie said. “Because Gal Gadot is so impossibly beautiful, but you don’t hate her for being that beautiful, because she’s so genuinely sincere, and she’s so enthusiastically kind, that it’s almost dorky. It’s like right before being a dork.\"\n\nWhat is the 'Barbie' movie about?\n\nDetails about the film’s plot are being kept tightly under wraps. The initial teaser trailer, which paid homage to \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" was narrated by Helen Mirren and briefly glimpsed a sparkling dance sequence. The latest trailer follows Barbie and Ken as they venture from Barbie Land into the real world. But “whatever you think it is, it’s not that. It’s something else,” Ferrera teased in an interview with People.\n\nFerrell, who plays the Mattel CEO, called it the “ultimate example of high art and low art” in an interview with Wall Street Journal Magazine last year.\n\n“It’s a loving homage to the brand and, at the same time, couldn’t be more satirical − just an amazing comment on male patriarchy and women in society and why Barbie’s criticized and yet why every little girl still wants to play with Barbie,” Ferrell explained. “Boy, when I read it, I was like, ‘This is fantastic.' ”\n\nWho is 'Barbie' director Greta Gerwig?\n\nGreta Gerwig, the three-time Oscar-nominated director and writer of 2017’s “Lady Bird” and 2019’s “Little Women,” directs. The actress-turned-filmmaker co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime partner Noah Baumbach, having previously collaborated on 2013’s “Frances Ha” and 2015’s “Mistress America.”\n\n“We were making each other laugh and then we got to the end, and we started to make each other cry,” Gerwig said at CinemaCon last month. “He thought it was very good and was maybe wanting to direct it. And I said, ‘Step aside.’ There was a point I was so in love with it that I couldn’t imagine anyone else doing it.”\n\nWho is on the 'Barbie' movie soundtrack with Dua Lipa?\n\n\"Levitating\" singer Dua Lipa is releasing a new single from the film, \"Dance the Night,\" on Friday. On Thursday, the \"Barbie\" album Instagram account also announced the star-studded artists who will be featured on the soundtrack, including Nicki Minaj, Lizzo, Charli XCX, Haim, Tame Impala, Dominic Fike, Ice Spice, and even Gosling.\n\nRead more about Barbie:\n\n'Barbie':New footage shows Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling's dolls in the real world\n\nHow old is Barbie?A look at the Mattel doll's storied history\n\nNew Barbie has Down syndrome:Inclusive line also includes dolls with hearing aids\n\nBarbie's Dreamhouse:HGTV will make it a real-life home in new series\n\n'SNL' spoofs 'Barbie':See the clever American Girl doll parody", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/07/28/post-falsely-compares-barbie-haul-to-desantis-funds-fact-check/70476245007/", "title": "Funds raised by Ron DeSantis surpass Barbie movie's opening day ...", "text": "The claim: 'Barbie' earned more money in one day than Ron DeSantis has ever fundraised\n\nA July 25 (direct link, archive link) Facebook post shows a screenshot of a Threads post that features a photo of Florida Gov.

The social media-fueled fusion of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” brought moviegoers back to the theaters in record numbers this weekend, vastly outperforming projections and giving a glimmer of hope to the lagging exhibition business, amid the sobering backdrop of strikes.\n\nWarner Bros.’ “Barbie” claimed the top spot with a massive $155 million in ticket sales from North American theaters from 4,243 locations, surpassing “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (as well as every Marvel movie this year) as the biggest opening of the year and breaking the first weekend record for a film directed by a woman. Universal’s “Oppenheimer” also soared past expectations, taking in $80.5 million from 3,610 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, marking Nolan’s biggest non-Batman debut and one of the best-ever starts for an R-rated biographical drama.\n\nIt’s also the first time that one movie opened to more than $100 million and another movie opened to more than $80 million in the same weekend. When all is settled, it will likely turn out to be the fourth biggest box office weekend of all time with over $300 million industrywide. And all this in a marketplace that increasingly curved towards intellectual property-driven winner takes all.\n\nThe “Barbenheimer” phenomenon may have started out as good-natured competition between two aesthetic opposites, but, as many hoped, both movies benefitted in the end.\n\nThe only real casualty was “Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,” which despite strong reviews and a healthy opening weekend fell 64% in weekend two. Overshadowed by the “Barbenheimer” glow as well as the blow of losing its IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer,” the Tom Cruise vehicle added $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $118.8 million.\n\nThe 'Barbenheimer’ phenomenon:How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\n“Barbenheimer” is not merely counterprogramming either. But while a certain section of enthusiastic moviegoers overlapped, in aggregate the audiences were distinct.\n\nWomen drove the historic “Barbie” opening, making up 65% of the audience, according to PostTrak, and 40% of ticket buyers were under the age of 25 for the PG-13 rated movie.\n\nBoth “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” scored well with critics with 90% and 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, respectively, and audiences who gave both films an A CinemaScore. And social media has been awash with reactions and “takes” all weekend – good, bad, problematic and everywhere in between – the kind of organic, event cinema, watercooler debate that no marketing budget can buy.\n\n'Barbie' review:Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling dazzle in hilariously heady toy story", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/12/media/jurassic-world-dominion-box-office/index.html", "title": "'Jurassic World: Dominion' roars to big opening weekend at the box ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe end of the Jurassic era arrived with a deafening roar at the box office.\n\n“Jurassic World: Dominion,” the sixth and supposedly last film in the Jurassic Park franchise, brought in an estimated $143.3 million for its North America opening this weekend. The Universal Pictures’ film took the top spot from “Top Gun: Maverick” and represents one of the highest-grossing openings of the year so far.\n\nThe opening for “Dominion” roughly falls in line with the debut of the prior film in the series, “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,” which opened to $148 million in 2018. That’s impressive considering how different the box office marketplace is compared to just five years ago.\n\nAnother impressive feat is that the film found an audience despite some pretty awful reviews. “Dominion” notched the lowest critics score of the series on review site Rotten Tomatoes, bringing in a 30% rating.\n\nThe big weekend adds to the film’s worldwide haul of $389 million since opening overseas last week.\n\nThe Universal film, which explores a world in which dinosaurs are running amok all over Earth, is a part of one of the most successful brands in Hollywood — a franchise that has made roughly $5 billion at the global box office since 1993’s “Jurassic Park.”\n\n“Dominion” also had the added bonus of being marketed with both finality and nostalgia.\n\nUniversal billed it as the last movie of “the Jurassic era” and brought back the three stars from the original “Jurassic Park,” Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, alongside the new leads of the series, played by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard.\n\nThat appeared to be enough to get moviegoers to theaters despite the bad reviews. Yet the lack of critical acclaim may hamper those totals as the film goes forward in the weeks to come.\n\nElsewhere at the box office, “Top Gun: Maverick” is still flying high.\n\nThe film, which brings back Tom Cruise in his most iconic role as fighter pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, made an estimated $50 million domestically for its third weekend, which is just a 44% drop from last week.\n\n“Maverick,” which broke records over Memorial Day weekend and had an incredible hold on audiences in its second week, has made $747 million around the world so far.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/07/16/mission-impossible-7-tom-cruise-win-box-office/70418351007/", "title": "'Mission: Impossible 7,' Tom Cruise win box office with $80M in 5 days", "text": "Jake Coyle\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK − After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by star Tom Cruise, \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\" launched with a franchise-best $80 million for five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul for the three-day weekend, according to studio estimates.\n\nThe debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of $155 million from 70 markets. But while a $235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, \"Dead Reckoning\" couldn't approach the high-speed velocity of last summer's top film, \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\n\"Dead Reckoning Part One,\" the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, \"Fallout,\" which opened with $61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the $57.8 million \"Mission: Impossible II\" debuted with in 2000.\n\nThat puts the film's opening-weekend tally very close to the tepid launch of Disney's \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" which opened in U.S. and Canadian theaters with $82 million for five days and $60 million for the three-day weekend. Paramount had higher hopes for the action extravaganza of \"Dead Reckoning,\" which cost $290 million to make, not counting marketing expenses.\n\nThose costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. \"Dead Reckoning,\" directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets – albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way.\n\nStill, \"Dead Reckoning\" was hailed as a high point in the franchise. Critics (96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans (an \"A\" on CinemaScore) alike came away awed by the stunts and chases of the latest \"Mission: Impossible\" film.\n\nThough the coming competition of \"Barbenheimer\" − the much-anticipated debuts of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" − looms, \"Mission: Impossible\" should play well for weeks to come.\n\n\"This is a global franchise. It's going gangbusters and its going to play for a long time. Quality always wins in the end,\" says Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount.\n\n\"Dead Reckoning,\" Aronson said, met or exceeded the studio's expectations.\n\n\"In international markets, in like-for-like markets, we're 15% ahead of 'Fallout,' and that's taking China out,\" added Aronson. \"Domestically, we're over 3% ahead of 'Fallout' for the first five days. To beat its predecessor is phenomenal, especially in this environment.\"\n\nRanked:'Mission: Impossible'? We order every movie (even 'Dead Reckoning') from worst to best\n\nCruise, the so-called savior of movie theaters last year, traveled tirelessly to again pump life back into a summer box office that's been sluggish. After a splashy world premiere in Rome with a red-carpet on the Spanish Steps, Cruise and McQuarrie surprised theaters in Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and Washington D.C. in the days ahead of opening.\n\n\"Dead Reckoning\" hit theaters at a crucial mid-summer period for Hollywood, and not just because of the SAG-AFTRA strike which began Thursday. \"Mission: Impossible\" launched a week before one of the biggest box-office showdowns of the year.\n\nThough \"Dead Reckoning\" and \"Oppenheimer\" have vied for some of the same IMAX screens, each film has publicly endorsed the idea that a rising tide lifts all blockbusters. Cruise and McQuarrie in early July even bought opening-weekend tickets to both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer.\" \"Barbie\" director Greta Gerwig and \"Oppenheimer\" filmmaker Christopher Nolan reciprocated with their own gestures of support.\n\nHowever that trio of films performs over the next few weeks will do a lot to determine the fate of the summer box office.\n\n\"These are a crucial couple of weeks for the industry starting this weekend,\" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \"It's going to be a fun reinvigoration of the box office because we have had a few films underperforming. Really, the summer movie season restarts this week with 'Mission' leading into 'Barbenheimer.' \"\n\nNo other new wide release challenged \"Mission: Impossible\" over the weekend.

What exactly that means is still up in the air: are they still called “tweets?” Will users have to access a new web domain? Is something besides the logo changing? Here’s what we know so far about Twitters transition to X.\n\nWhat is Twitter called now?\n\nElon Musk announced in a series of tweets his intentions to do away with all remnants of the app’s iconic bird-related imagery. Instead, the social media network formerly known as Twitter will be rebranded simply to X, a change that has already been reflected on desktop, where the spot once reserved for the blue and white bird logo has been replaced with a grey-scale letter X.\n\nWhile the mobile version of the app still sticks to the blue-and-white color scheme and features the bird image up top, official Twitter accounts, including Musk’s, have been updated to reflect the change. The company’s official handle remains @twitter, but the display username has been changed to a capital X and the profile photo to a black square featuring a white-lined X in the middle. Musk’s account also shares the same profile image and two recent posts about the logo, one calling it “Futuristic Art Deco” while another features a sort of hype-reel for the new design.\n\nTyping X.com into the search bar automatically redirects to Twitter, though Twitter.com also still leads to the same landing page.\n\nTwitter competitors:A flash in the pan? Just weeks after launch, Instagram Threads app is already faltering\n\nWhy did Elon Musk change the Twitter logo?\n\nBoth Musk and his team have offered a series of explanations for the rebranding.\n\nIn one Tweet, Musk said the “X” design served to “embody the imperfections in us all that make us unique,” while in another he pointed out his personal affinity for the letter. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino, also in posts shared by Musk, said the overhaul allows for a chance to make a fresh “big impression” and that the new brand will “go further” than Twitter to “transform the global town square.”\n\n“X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.”\n\nIn a Monday tweet, Musk provided further insight into his thoughts behind the change, saying Twitter is on its way to becoming an “everything app” for use not only in communication, but financial transactions as well. According to him, the existing name and branding do not reflect these ambitions.\n\n“Twitter was acquired by X Corp both to ensure freedom of speech and as an accelerant for X, the everything app. This is not simply a company renaming itself, but doing the same thing,” he tweeted.\n\n“The Twitter name made sense when it was just 140 character messages going back and forth – like birds tweeting – but now you can post almost anything, including several hours of video. In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world. The Twitter name does not make sense in that context, so we must bid adieu to the bird.”\n\nHow much did Elon Musk pay for Twitter?\n\nMusk purchased Twitter in October of 2022 for $44 billion. He initially agreed to the deal in April of last year before attempting to back out, claiming Twitter had misrepresented numbers thanks to spam and bots. Twitter responded not only by denying the claims but suing Musk for completion of the purchase, though the two eventually settled the dispute out of court.\n\nAccording to prior reporting by USA TODAY, Musk said he overpaid for Twitter and the platform was valued at a mere $25 billion by Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. Musk said he continued with the deal partially because he considered the app one of “great potential” whose revenue he believed he could double in three years.\n\nEven this early in acquisition, Musk alluded to the development of “X,” the “everything app” and his intentions to utilize Twitter as a piece of that puzzle. Even with these strong ambitions, however, Musk also took on Twitter’s estimated $13 billion in debt at the time of purchase.\n\nElections and Twitter:Amid Elon Musk's Twitter changes, why 2024 presidential election threats now pose bigger risk\n\nElon Musk’s son and the letter X\n\nFor those that haven’t been paying attention, Musk sort of has a thing for the letter “X.” In fact, this is not his first attempt to name a company after the single letter, as his 1999 money startup was initially called X.com before being renamed PayPal.\n\nCompany Space Exploration Technologies Corp, where Musk serves as CEO, is also more commonly known as SpaceX and car brand Tesla, where musk is also the CEO, even features an “X” car model.\n\nPerhaps his most infamous use of the letter, however, is as a name for his son with singer Grimes, whose full name was originally reported as being “X Æ A-12 Musk.\" While Grimes originally tweeted an explanation for the name, which was simply pronounced like the letter “X,” it has since been reported that the couple changed the name in order to comply with state law.\n\nWhat is a Xeet?\n\nOne of the biggest questions on everyone’s minds since the change: what are we supposed to call a “tweet” now?\n\nMany users have guessed “xeet,” a variation on the original term “tweet.” Posts alleging to be screenshots of the Twitter help center page including the term “xeet” have even circulated on the platform, though notes beneath those tweets have marked them false and a quick visit to the official help page shows only the term “tweet” and no sign of “xeet.”\n\nMusk answered a tweet (xeet? X?) asking the same question, saying simply that posts would now be called “x’s.” For those worried about grammar, Musk has yet to clarify how “tweeted,” “tweet” or other forms of the work will translate – he “xed?” She “xes?” They “x” often? What about that apostrophe in his answer?\n\nThe world does not yet know.\n\nDid Meta already trademark X?\n\nWhile Musk has already fully committed to the brand transformation, some reports have raised legal questions surrounding the use of logo and name X, as a number of other companies have already trademarked the letter for their own use.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Meta holds a trademark for an “X” logo for “online social networking services\" and \"social networking services in the fields of entertainment, gaming, and application development.” Microsoft also has an “X” registered for use in similar software and social media spaces, though both companies hold only a few of the many trademarks filed around the letter.\n\nWhile it is not uncommon for many people and companies to have trademarks on similar word, phrases, images or even letters, the existing rivalry between the brands, especially Meta and Twitter, has led some to speculate a legal battle could ensue.\n\nOther changes\n\nThe transition to “X” is the largest change Musk has announced since earlier this month when he put “temporary limits” on the number of tweets users can read based on their subscription level.\n\nInitially, Musk said verified accounts would be limited to reading 6,000 posts daily and unverified accounts would be limited to only 600. A few hours later, he amended this statement by tweeting that rate limits would increase to 8,000 tweets a day for verified accounts, 800 for unverified and 400 for new accounts. An hour after that, he changed it to a limit of 10,000 a day for verified accounts, 1,000 for unverified and 500 for new accounts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2023/07/24/new-twitter-logo-x-rebrand/70455030007/", "title": "New Twitter logo, X: Elon Musk changes from blue bird in rebrand", "text": "Elon Musk has officially changed Twitter’s logo from the iconic blue bird to a black-and-white “X” – the latest big change since he bought the company for $44 billion last year.\n\nOn Monday, Musk posted a photo of the “X” projected on Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters as the new logo appeared on the desktop version of Twitter.

But, about two hours later, he tweeted, \"Rate limits increasing soon to 8000 for verified, 800 for unverified & 400 for new unverified.\"\n\nLess than an hour later, Musk sent a subsequent tweet increasing the limits to 10,000 for verified, 1,000 for unverified and 500 for new unverified users.\n\nContributing: Joel Shannon, Mike Snider, Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/07/24/northwestern-hazing-twitter-rebrand-greece-wildfires-mondays-news/70435048007/", "title": "Northwestern hazing, Twitter rebrand, Greece wildfires: Monday's ...", "text": "New allegations of hazing at Northwestern University.

Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2023/07/24/tiktok-text-post-how-to-use/70456390007/", "title": "TikTok text posts: How to use the app's newest feature", "text": "TikTok is experimenting with a new format on the app: text posts.\n\nThe popular video app, owned by parent company ByteDance, announced Monday that text posts will be the latest addition to TikTok's features, which include live videos, photos, duets, where other users can post their own videos side-by-side and stitches, where users can combine their videos with an original posted video.\n\nBy adding a text post option, TikTok is joining other social media platforms that already have a text feature as a mainstay, including Twitter, Facebook, Threads, Instagram Stories and Tumblr.\n\nThe feature is available to be used in the app as of Monday.\n\n\"With text posts, we're expanding the boundaries of content creation for everyone on TikTok, giving the written creativity we've seen in comments, captions and videos a dedicated space to shine,\" according to a press release from TikTok.\n\nHere's how to access text posts on TikTok:\n\nHow to create a text post on TikTok\n\nFirst, you'll need to access the camera page in the app to make a text post, where you'll have three options: photo, video and text.

How to shut down the hate, harassment\n\nHow to delete Twitter account? Step-by-step guide to permanently remove your account.\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nHow to delete Twitter data\n\nTwitter handles some 500 million to 700 million tweets a day, which adds up to roughly 12 terabytes of data every 24 hours.\n\nThat's a huge risk if that data falls into the wrong hands, Arthur Herman, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, recently wrote in Forbes – and Twitter had big data breaches before all of that information became Musk's.\n\nIn July, a breach exposed the email address and phone number of 5.4 million Twitter profiles. At that time, Twitter recommended anyone trying to stay anonymous should not link a publicly known phone number or email to their Twitter account.\n\nThen in August, whistleblower Peiter Zatko exposed what he said was lax security at Twitter, which could make the company’s data vulnerable to foreign infiltration as well as improper use and storage of user data.\n\nNow all that data – including your direct messages because they are not end-to-end encrypted – belongs to Elon Musk.\n\nThe data Twitter collects and saves includes your tweets, likes, direct messages, ad clicks, followers and those you’re following. If you’ve granted access, it can also collect information from your phone’s contact list.\n\nIf you’re concerned about your data privacy or considering leaving Twitter, here are a few things you can do:\n\nTo delete your account go to Settings → Your Account → Deactivate Your Account. This will not delete your data immediately because Twitter holds onto your data for at least 30 days in case you change your mind.\n\nBefore deleting, you may want to try a few other solutions:\n\nBack up your tweets by going to Settings → Your Account → Download an Archive of Your Data.\n\nYou can delete all your old tweets, but not through Twitter itself. Use a third-party app like Tweetdelete.net. It can also delete all your old likes. Twitter says deleted tweets are not publicly available but it’s unclear how long they’re saved on the company’s servers.\n\nIf you’ve used Twitter DMs for private conversations you want to remove, you can delete an individual message from your account, but it will still exist for the other people in the conversation.\n\nLock down your account completely so only your followers can see them:\n\nDo this by going to Settings → Privacy and Safety → Audience and Tagging, then select Protect Your Tweets. Or you can stay public but protect your account from harassment by muting and blocking certain types of profiles.\n\nGo to Settings → Privacy and Safety → Mute and Block → Muted Notifications and you can choose to mute, for example, new accounts which could be spam or bots.\n\n– Katie Wedell\n\nTrump says Twitter now in 'sane hands'\n\nFormer president Donald Trump also weighed in on the Twitter deal Friday, saying in a post on his own social media platform, Truth Social, that he considers Musk's takeover to have placed the platform in \"sane hands.\"\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nMusk will be 'digging in' on shadow bans as hate speech, slurs appear\n\nReports began surfacing early Friday that hate speech and racial epithets are flying on Twitter. Holocaust deniers were also reported on the platform.\n\nTwitter users were quick to note Friday that they were beginning to see changes in the way the platform worked and how it was removing bans on users previously limited on the site, sometimes as a direct result of tweeting Musk.\n\nIn answer to that, Musk tweeted Friday that he'll be \"digging in\" more today on lifting shadow bans and rolling back restrictions on users.\n\nFar-right commentators, including well-known YouTuber Tim Pool, also weighed in about changes.\n\nUsers who had either had their content moderated or knew people who had encountered Twitter bans or shadow bans also tweeted Musk directly asking to have those lifted and listed the names of people they felt should be brought back to the platform.\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nWhen did Elon close his deal for Twitter?\n\nMultiple news outlets reported late Thursday that, after months of legal wrangling and public acrimony, Musk had closed the deal and fired top executives including the company's CEO Parag Agrawal.\n\nTwitter chairman Bret Taylor removed that title from his Twitter bio.\n\nA deal is done?

Musk told workers at Twitter's headquarters on Wednesday \"that he doesn't plan to cut 75 percent of the staff when he takes over the company, according to people familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg wrote.\n\nTwitter employees fret ahead of deal deadline:Musk reportedly wants 75% cut to Twitter workforce\n\n-- Jessica Guynn\n\nWhat did Elon Musk buy Twitter for?\n\nMusk wound up paying his original bid price: $54.20 a share, or roughly $44 billion.\n\nAt the time of his April offer, the amount represented a 33% premium to Twitter's stock price. But the company has since been caught up in a wider drop in tech stock prices, record-high inflation squeezing investors and increasing fears of a recession.\n\nMusk has been vocal about overpaying about the purchase, although Twitter had closed at $53.70 on Thursday, a marked upswing from its lowest point of $32.65 in July.\n\n\"Although obviously myself and other investors are overpaying for Twitter right now,\" Musk recently said, \"the long-term potential for Twitter is an order of magnitude higher than its current value.\"\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nMore:Elon Musk says Twitter can't become 'a free-for-all hellscape,' should be 'warm and welcoming'\n\nWhy does Elon Musk want Twitter?\n\nThe deal gives the Tesla billionaire control of one of the world’s most powerful megaphones.\n\nIt also gives Musk access to the data of nearly 400 million users and the ability to bring back people and organizations previously banned or sidelined by Twitter, including former President Donald Trump\n\nWho will run Twitter now?\n\nFor now, it appears Musk is helming Twitter.\n\nOn Wednesday he changed his Twitter bio to \"Chief Twit\" shortly before walking into Twitter's San Francisco headquarters carrying a porcelain sink, resurrecting a meme that has been internet lore for years. \"Let that sink in,\" he tweeted.\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nTwitter deal: Why 'Chief Twit' Elon Musk brought along a sink on his visit to Twitter headquarters\n\nIs Donald Trump coming back to Twitter?\n\nNow that Elon Musk is running Twitter, the Tesla billionaire is likely to reverse a permanent ban against Trump for inciting violence during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nMusk has indicated he would allow Trump back on the social media platform where the former president had more than 88 million followers.\n\n“Would be great to unwind permanent bans, except for spam accounts and those that explicitly advocate violence,” Musk texted Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal in April, according to court filings.\n\nAt a conference in May, Musk said: “I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake.”\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nWill Trump return? Is Donald Trump coming back to Twitter now that Elon Musk bought the company?\n\nWill Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter mean more hate, extremism online?\n\nWhen Elon Musk first agreed to buy Twitter in April, he said the social media site has the potential to become “the platform for free speech around the globe” and he would unlock it.\n\nMusk, who closed the $44 billion deal after a months-long legal fight, has described himself as a “free speech absolutist” and expressed concern over the way Twitter moderates its users.\n\nNow that Musk owns Twitter, will he make good on his promise to loosen content moderation rules in the name of “free speech?”\n\nMusk said Thursday he doesn’t want the site to become “a free-for-all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences” in a message to advertisers, who analysts have said may be scared off by the Tesla CEO’s stance on free speech.\n\nExtremists cheer Musk Twitter deal: Oath Keepers trial heats up & more LGBTQ harassment\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” Musk said in a note posted on Twitter.\n\nCritics have expressed concern that Musk would allow harmful or extremist speech on the site and experts have warned that loosening content moderation could cause real-world harm.\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, have celebrated Musk's Twitter takeover, as many accuse social media platforms of routinely censoring their voices, feelings further fueled earlier this year after former President Donald Trump was permanently banned from Twitter.\n\nMusk has indicated he would let Trump, who was banned for inciting violence during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, back on the site.\n\n– Amanda Pérez Pintado\n\nThings getting nasty on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram? How to shut down the hate, harassment\n\nHow will advertisers respond to a Twitter with less moderation?\n\nElon Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” has been advocating for less content moderation on Twitter since his plans to take over the company were first announced in April.\n\n\"We want to have the perception and the reality that speech is as free as possible,\" Musk said in April at the TED2022 conference. \"Is someone you don't like allowed to say something you don't like? And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\nThe idea seems to harken back to the early days of Twitter; former CEO Dick Costolo called the site the “free-speech wing of the free-speech party” in the early 2010s.\n\nSince then, Twitter has adopted stricter policies to combat disinformation, misinformation and hate speech. The platform’s rules prohibit targeted harassment, COVID-19 misinformation and election manipulation.\n\nA different Twitter Elon Musk says Twitter can't become 'a free-for-all hellscape,' should be 'warm and welcoming'\n\nMusk’s talk about softening some of Twitter’s rules to any speech has raised red flags for advertisers.\n\nShortly after the Wall Street Journal released a report about Madison Avenue’s concerns, Musk issued a statement on Twitter saying the social media platform \"obviously cannot become a free-for-all-hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nMusk’s tweet was addressed to advertisers, the company’s primary source of revenue.\n\n“Social networks are trying to do a better job removing hateful content, content that is antisemitic, content that’s blatantly misinformation,” said Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University. “That’s something that advertisers worry about.”\n\n– Bailey Schulz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/tech/twitter-employees-ultimatum-deadline/index.html", "title": "After Elon Musk's 'extremely hardcore' work ultimatum Twitter ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAnother employee exodus appears to be underway at Twitter as many workers rejected Elon Musk’s terms for staying with the company, choosing instead to depart, according to multiple current and former employees.\n\nAs the deadline approached for Twitter employees to respond to Elon Musk’s ultimatum to commit to working in an “extremely hardcore” fashion at the company or leave, some employees appeared to publicly indicate they had chosen the latter option. On Thursday afternoon, Twitter staffers began posting the salute emoji, which has become a signal that someone is exiting the company. One Twitter employee said in a tweet that deciding to join the company was “one of the easiest decisions ever made. Deciding to leave today was 100% the opposite.”\n\nMeanwhile, an internal Slack channel at the company was filled with employees posting the salute emoji after the 5pm ET deadline, indicating they had chosen not to sign Musk’s pledge and depart the company, employees told CNN.\n\nTwitter’s remaining workforce had until 5 p.m. ET on Thursday to decide whether they wanted to be a part of the culture Musk wants to implement at the social media company, or else effectively resign, according to an email he sent to staff Wednesday.\n\nA former Twitter executive who recently exited the company described Thursday’s employee exits as a “mass exodus.”\n\nOn Thursday evening following the exits, employees remaining at the company received an email alerting them that the company’s offices will be temporarily closed and badge access will be restricted through Monday, according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN from a current Twitter employee. Musk’s team similarly shuttered offices during the mass layoffs earlier this month out of a concern for safety and an apparent fear that exiting employees could attempt to sabotage the company on their way out.\n\nTwo Twitter employees told CNN ahead of the deadline on Thursday that they planned to reject the ultimatum, citing a toxic work environment they say the billionaire has introduced. Another Twitter employee told CNN Wednesday they were still weighing the decision, saying the email from Musk “felt like a punch in the gut because no matter how you felt about wanting to stay or wanting to go, you were forced to make a decision and feel like you’re up against the time clock to make the best decision for you and your family.”\n\nThe employee added: “Those decisions are more than just 24 hours.”\n\nMusk told employees on Wednesday that his goal is to build “Twitter 2.0” and that employees who choose to stay will be required to commit to working “long hours at high intensity” and presumably agreeing to Musk’s demand for Twitter employees, who have been largely working remotely, to return to in-office work. As of midday Thursday, employees still did not have clarity on which remote-work exceptions would be granted if they decide to stay, one employee said.\n\nLater on Thursday, amid an apparent scramble by management to avoid losing too many workers to the ultimatum, Musk sent an email to staff attempting to clarify his position on remote work, according to text of the email obtained by CNN from a Twitter employee who asked not to be identified.\n\n“Regarding remote work, all that is required for approval is that your manager takes responsibility for ensuring that you are making an excellent contribution,” Musk said in the email, adding that workers would be expected to attend in-person meetings no less than once a month.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Musk sent a follow up email saying: “At risk of stating the obvious, any manager who falsely claims that someone reporting to them is doing excellent work or that a given role is essential, whether remote or not, will be exited from the company.”\n\nThe decision to issue an ultimatum came after Musk earlier this month fired half of Twitter’s staff, reducing its workforce to around 3,700 employees, and also reportedly cut many of Twitter’s contract workers. He also pushed out its top leadership and dissolved the board of directors. Musk also recently fired some employees for criticizing him in tweets or on internal Slack channels.\n\n“I don’t want to stick around to build a product that’s being poisoned from the inside and out,” said one of the employees who plans to reject the ultimatum, but requested anonymity to avoid putting the severance at risk. “Everyone has a price to a certain degree and this severance gives me some comfort into looking for a better environment in the time frame despite the economy.”\n\nThat employee said management now appears to have grown concerned about the number of people planning to depart and are “scrambling” to convince talent to stay. Twitter, which has reportedly eliminated most of its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother Twitter employee, who asked not to be quoted, shared similar concerns and said they planned to also exit the company.\n\nA recently laid off employee who remains in touch with former coworkers told CNN that everyone they had spoken to plans to reject Musk’s ultimatum and exit the company. “People can’t overlook the public mockery and firing of other employees,” the former employee told CNN. “In the same vein, they can’t overlook or feel comfortable working for someone who has handled the last few weeks in the way Elon has.”\n\n“People don’t want to sacrifice their mental health and family lives to make the richest man in the world richer,” the former employee added.\n\nBut the decision may not be so easy for others. The ultimatum comes during a difficult period for the tech industry, following mass layoffs and hiring freeze announcements at many major firms including Meta, Amazon, Lyft and others. Employees working in the United States from other countries could also risk losing their work visas if they leave the company.\n\nA fourth employee told CNN Thursday they plan to stay at the company “because change is rarely influenced from the outside.”\n\nThe shakeup likely to come as a result of the ultimatum will be the last element of the “fundamental organizational restructuring” following Musk’s takeover, he told a Delaware court Wednesday during a trial over his Tesla pay package.\n\nMusk said in the Wednesday email that the “new Twitter” will be “much more engineering-driven,” leaving some non-engineering workers questioning whether their jobs could be at risk even if they opt to stay.\n\n“There’s no assurance in this, you’re just like, ‘I might be able to advocate for myself, I might not,’” the employee who expressed uncertainty about the decision said. “What’s behind this door? You don’t know. The only door you know that’s certain is the exit door.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Oliver Darcy", "Clare Duffy", "Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/tech/twitter-chaos-musk/index.html", "title": "A day of chaos brings Twitter closer to the brink | CNN Business", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nTwo weeks after Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, the future of the company has never looked less certain.\n\nIn the past week alone, one of the world’s most influential social networks has laid off half its workforce; alienated powerful advertisers; blown up key aspects of its product, then repeatedly launched and un-launched other features aimed at compensating for it; and witnessed an exodus of senior executives.\n\nThe wild swings at Twitter only seemed to accelerate on Thursday with more executive departures, growing chaos over fake, verified accounts and an unusual public rebuke from the US government. Twitter now appears to be on the brink, a point Musk himself seemed to concede on Thursday by reportedly telling employees that bankruptcy could be on the horizon (though it’s far from the first time he’s warned about bankruptcy at one of his companies).\n\n“Quite the day!” Musk tweeted.\n\nIt’s a stunning reversal of fortunes not just for Musk, who bought the company for $44 billion, but also for a platform used by some of the most powerful people on the planet, including world leaders, CEOs, and the Pope.\n\nAn end to the disruption seemed nowhere in sight on Friday. In its latest reversal on the matter, Twitter said it would re-introduce a gray “Official” badge for select accounts to help confirm their identities. The decision came after Twitter was forced to fend off a wave of verified-account impostors this week, including some posing as former President Donald Trump, Nintendo, and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, among others. These accounts were the result of Musk’s decision to rush ahead with offering a blue check mark to any account holder willing to pay $8 a month, no questions asked, as he races to find new ways to make money from the platform.\n\nThat paid subscription service, too, was also suspended on Friday with little warning, just two days after its official launch, with the menu option to sign up for Twitter Blue suddenly disappearing from Twitter’s iOS app — the only place the add-on had been offered. It was not immediately clear when the company might restore the offering.\n\nThe gray “Official” badge has become an illustration of the whiplash users, employees, and advertisers have experienced in recent days.\n\nHours after the gray badges launched on Wednesday as a way to help users differentiate legitimate celebrity and branded accounts from accounts that had merely paid for a blue check mark, Musk abruptly tweeted that he had “killed” the feature, forcing subordinates to explain the reversal.\n\n“We’re not currently putting an ‘Official’ label on accounts but we are aggressively going after impersonation and deception,” Twitter’s verified support account tweeted on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe account’s very next tweet, a day and nine hours later, said exactly the opposite: “To combat impersonation, we’ve added an ‘Official’ label to some accounts.”\n\nTwitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the changes to the rollout of Twitter Blue or “Official” badges.\n\nThe paid verification feature’s rocky rollout attracted widespread criticism from misinformation experts who had warned it would make identifying trustworthy information much more difficult, particularly in the critical period following the US midterm elections. Even some of Musk’s fellow high-powered users of the platform had tough feedback.\n\n“@elonmusk, from one entrepreneur to another, for when you have your customer service hat on. I just spent too much time muting all the newly purchased checkmark accts in an attempt to make my verified mentions useful again,” tweeted billionaire Mark Cuban.\n\n“Bottom line is that you have a decision to make,” Cuban added. “Stick with the new Twitter that democratizes every tweet by paid accounts and puts the onus on all users to curate for themselves. Or bring back Twitter curation. One makes Twitter time and information efficient. The other is awful.”\n\nIn a Twitter Spaces event held for advertisers this week, Musk pleaded with brands to keep using the platform, after a growing number of companies paused ads, causing what Musk previously described as a “massive drop in revenue.” In the event, Musk sought to appear magnanimous in accepting responsibility for the company’s performance.\n\n“If things go wrong, it’s my fault, because the buck stops with me,” he told an audience of over 100,000 listeners.\n\nBut privately, Musk’s critics have described the billionaire as dismissive of accountability, even in the face of scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission, which publicly warned on Thursday, in a rare forward-looking statement, that it is “tracking recent developments at Twitter with deep concern.”\n\nAccording to an internal Slack message posted by a Twitter employee and viewed by CNN, Musk has shown little fear of the FTC regulators overseeing the company’s multiple, legally binding consent agreements committing it to maintaining a robust cybersecurity program and producing written privacy impact reports before launching any new products or services, a requirement that could cover Twitter Blue.\n\nThe company is already facing billions in potential fines from the FTC over alleged privacy missteps dating to before Musk’s ownership. But, the Twitter employee warned colleagues, Twitter could find itself even more legally exposed after the sudden resignation of multiple top Twitter executives charged with fulfilling the company’s FTC obligations, including its chief information security officer and chief privacy officer.\n\nForced to address the looming risk of FTC oversight, Musk reportedly struck a conciliatory tone.\n\n“Twitter will do whatever it takes to adhere to both the letter and spirit of the FTC consent decree,” Musk reportedly wrote in an email to employees Thursday evening.\n\nThe one thing Musk claims is going in his favor at Twitter is user growth, as more people tune in to watch him fumble his way through owning the company.\n\n“Twitter usage is at an all-time high,” Musk tweeted earlier this week, before adding in a follow-up tweet: “I just hope the servers don’t melt!”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/11/08/mit-report-twitter-elon-musk-users-lost/8300611001/", "title": "MIT report: Twitter lost more than 1 million users after Elon Musk ...", "text": "In the week after Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion, the social media platform lost more than 1.3 million users.\n\nMIT Technology Review reported the firm Bot Sentinel, which tracks behavior on Twitter by analyzing more than 3.1 million accounts and their daily activity, “believes that around 877,000 accounts were deactivated and a further 497,000 were suspended between Oct. 27 and Nov. 1.\"\n\nThat’s more than double the usual number, the outlet is reporting.\n\n“We have observed an uptick in people deactivating their accounts and also Twitter suspending accounts,\" Christopher Bouzy, Bot Sentinel’s founder told the outlet.\n\nHe went onto say he and Bot Sentinel calculated the numbers by looking at the proportion of users they analyze who had deactivated their accounts or been suspended after Musk took over, and then applying that percentage to Twitter’s overall user base, which stands at about 237 million “monetizable daily active users”.\n\nMusk could not immediately be reached by USA TODAY.\n\nBut on Monday night he tweeted, \"Twitter usage is at an all-time high lol.\"\n\nHe then replied to his own tweet saying, \"I just hope the servers don't melt!\"\n\nFrom Oct. 27 through Nov. 1, MIT Technology Review reported, Bot Sentinel found 11,535 accounts they were monitoring had been deactivated (someone shut down their own account).\n\nIn addition, 6,824 accounts had been suspended, which happens when Twitter removes accounts for reasons including inactivity, inauthenticity or a violation of site rules, the outlet reported.\n\n'The bird is freed':Elon Musk now owns Twitter.

Doug Ducey and the state Wednesday over shipping containers used as a makeshift wall at the border with Mexico, saying it is trespassing on federal lands.\n\nThe complaint filed in U.S. District Court for Arizona comes three weeks before the Republican governor steps aside for Democratic Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs, who has said she opposes the construction.\n\nThe government is asking for a judge to order the removal of the containers from U.S. land along the border and damages for the state's \"unlawful trespasses, including any costs and expenses incurred by the United States.\"\n\nIn addition, the lawsuit asks for \"a declaration that Arizona's use and occupancy of lands owned by the United States without the required permits or other authorization constitutes unlawful trespasses.\"\n\nThe action is the latest move in a high-profile standoff between the governor and the federal government over conditions along the nation's southern border. In a response to the federal authorities earlier in the day, Ducey's lawyer noted what they view as inaccurate claims but struck a less defiant tone on an issue they view as demanding long-overdue federal action.\n\nUS-MEXICO BORDER:Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey ordered shipping containers be used as a border wall\n\nDucey sued the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in late October, asking a judge to allow the state to continue placing shipping containers at the border near Yuma after officials with the federal agency sought to halt construction days earlier. The governor maintains Arizona has the legal authority to put the containers in gaps where the federal government, though having plans to build a barrier, has not yet done so.\n\n\"The State’s actions have substantially curtailed federal law enforcement personnel from freely accessing the border area, and Arizona’s placement of armed guards on federal land risks putting federal law enforcement officials in danger,\" the Justice Department Office of Legislative Affairs wrote in an email about its planned action obtained by The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"Arizona’s actions have also stymied federal efforts to complete construction of border infrastructure projects in certain locations.\"\n\nThe planned lawsuit will be on behalf of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Interior.\n\nC.J. Karamargin, a spokesperson for Ducey, said the governor has always wanted federal action to resolve the problem.\n\n\"The shipping containers were always a temporary solution to an ongoing problem,\" Karamargin said. \"From our perspective, the shipping container mission is a success. Not only have we plugged gaps in the border barrier but we got the federal government to do their job.\"\n\nDucey's administration has previously said it has no plans to remove the containers until a permanent solution is in place.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials have said construction is set to begin in January on the gaps near Yuma, using \"temporary mesh fencing\" and vehicle gates.\n\nIS IT ENOUGH?:White House says Biden is 'surging' resources to help migrants at border\n\nRep.

Doug Ducey’s five-month effort to close gaps along the U.S.-Mexico border with shipping containers will cost Arizona taxpayers more than $200 million.\n\nIt will cost more than $76 million to tear down the double-stacked shipping container barriers in Yuma and Cochise counties after Ducey bowed to federal pressure and agreed to remove the makeshift barriers in late December. The bill to remove the containers was first reported by Capitol Media Services.\n\nIt will cost about $57.2 million to take down the shipping containers in the Coronado National Forest in Cochise County, according to state contracts with the Florida-based emergency management company AshBritt.\n\nThe tear-down costs come on top of the initial $95 million announced for the barrier’s construction in Cochise County.\n\nSeparate costs to move shipping containers from a Sierra Vista staging area to Tucson are projected at about $9.8 million.\n\nIn August, Ducey began filling border wall gaps near Yuma, where roughly 3,000 feet were plugged with shipping containers. The project was projected to cost $6 million, but ballooned to nearly $13 million as of September, according to Ducey’s office.\n\nIt will cost roughly $9.3 million to take down the containers near Yuma. Additionally, work and transportation costs associated with Nogales-area shipping containers are estimated to ring up to about $20.5 million, per state contracts.\n\nDucey’s order led to a patchwork barrier of hundreds of hulking metal shipping containers dotting the Arizona-Mexico border, sometimes welded together with odd-shaped pieces of metal.\n\nA stack of two shipping containers was found toppled near Yuma just one day after the barrier had been completed in August. In the days after the barrier’s completion, photos and videos of people climbing the containers circulated on social media as hundreds of migrants bypassed the barrier daily near Gadsden to present themselves to Border Patrol agents and request asylum.\n\nThe millions of dollars to build, maintain and remove the shipping container barriers comes from the $335 million pot within the Arizona Border Security Fund. The money was allocated for the “construction, administration, and maintenance of a physical border fence.”\n\nGov. Katie Hobbs’ administration did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nDuring Hobbs' State of the State speech on Monday, she criticized the politicization of immigration and \"political stunts\" used to incite media attention.\n\nHobbs invited Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to visit the Arizona-Mexico border with her to meet with law enforcement, nonprofits and community leaders to discuss comprehensive immigration solutions in her remarks.\n\nMore:Wildlife advocates say Ducey's new border barrier threatens fragile Arizona habitat\n\n\"Arizona voters told us in November they don’t want or need political stunts designed solely to garner sensationalist TV coverage and generate social media posts,\" Hobbs said in her speech.\n\nThe contract to build and tear down the barriers was awarded to AshBritt without the regular bidding process. AshBritt was awarded the contract because their solution was the “most expeditious due to the emergency nature of the work,” said Megan Rose, spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Administration.\n\nIn an email, Rose said AshBritt was recommended to the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs by their emergency management partners.\n\nIn June 2021, the founder and chairperson of AshBritt, Randal Perkins, paid the Federal Election Commission a $125,000 settlement after the company contributed to America First Action, a super PAC that supports former President Donald Trump.\n\nAshBritt donated $500,000 to America First Action in 2018 while they had a contract with the Defense Department, violating a law that prohibits government contractors from contributing to political committees.\n\nAmerica First Action eventually refunded the contribution to AshBritt.\n\nWhen asked if the Department of Administration was aware of the contribution prior to awarding AshBritt the contract, Rose said the company had no active or inactive exclusions with the System for Award Management, which was checked prior to the signing of the contract.\n\nToppled containers:Gov. Ducey's shipping container barrier along border toppled\n\nCritics call border barrier a 'scar on the landscape'\n\nCritics have dismissed the shipping container effort as a “political stunt” that has wasted taxpayer dollars. Environmental advocates criticized the barrier in the Coronado National Forest, arguing that it has damaged protected lands and severed a vital migration corridor for jaguars and ocelots.\n\n“It's really tragic to think that all of this money has just been wasted and now we're going to see the scar on the landscape from this action for many, many years,” said Emily Burns, program director with the environmental group Sky Island Alliance.\n\n“It's a staggering amount of money that could have been spent on so many other things.”\n\nMore than 100 oak trees were cut down and bulldozed during the first mile of border barrier construction in the Coronado National Forest, according to Burns. The installation of shipping containers in the area significantly widened the border road and blocked wash and creek beds with sediment, she added.\n\nRobin Silver, a co-founder of the Center for Biological Diversity, similarly denounced the barrier for its harmful environmental effects and underscored how the millions of dollars could have been spent to support other state institutions. The money, Silver argued, could have been used to improve the immigration system in Arizona by facilitating asylum processing and increasing the number of immigration judges.\n\n“$200 million spent in Arizona would go a long way to really helping to alleviate some of the misery that (migrants) are experiencing,” Silver said. “They're humans, that's where we should be spending our money, not on some racist stunt.”\n\nLawsuit filed:Federal government sues over shipping container wall at border\n\nDucey's barrier project was a monthslong endeavor\n\nDucey’s decision to remove the shipping containers came about a week after the U.S. Justice Department sued him and the state of Arizona on Dec. 14.\n\nThe federal government argued in the lawsuit that the installation of shipping containers along the border damages federal lands, threatens public safety and impedes federal officials from performing their duties. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the U.S. Agriculture and Interior departments.\n\nBiden administration officials criticized the barrier as an unhelpful stunt in a virtual interview with The Arizona Republic when the lawsuit was filed.\n\n“Stacking shipping containers for a photo op isn't a serious solution or helpful,” one administration official said.\n\nThe Biden administration’s lawsuit against Ducey, a Republican, is only the latest in a convoluted battle between the former governor and the federal government over the shipping containers.\n\nIn October, Ducey filed a lawsuit that sought to allow the state to continue putting shipping containers along gaps in the border after federal agencies tried to stop their installation. Ducey’s lawsuit was the culmination of back-and-forth correspondence between state and federal officials who were arguing whether or not the containers broke the law.\n\nThat same month, Ducey ordered the installation of roughly 3,000 shipping containers along more than 10 miles of land in the Coronado National Forest south of Sierra Vista. Protesters soon halted the construction of the shipping container barrier in Cochise County as they camped out in front of construction crews for days.\n\nThe Border Patrol will start construction to close the gaps near Yuma this week with a projected completion date of summer 2023, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The gaps near the Morelos Dam will be filled with temporary mesh fencing and vehicle gates.\n\n“The safety and security of our workforce, law enforcement partners, and the local community are a top priority,” Patricia McGurk-Daniel, acting Chief Patrol Agent for the Border Patrol’s Yuma Sector, said in a written statement. “Yuma Sector is dedicated to working with our state, local, and tribal counterparts to ensure a multi layered approach to secure our nation’s borders and protect our local community.”\n\nMayorkas, the Homeland Security secretary, authorized CBP to close the gaps in the border wall near the Morelos Dam in July to address operational impacts and immediate life and safety risks.\n\nAbout two weeks later, Ducey issued an executive order that authorized the state to build border barriers on federal land, citing inaction by the Biden administration. Eleven days later, 3,820 feet of gaps were filled in with 130 shipping containers.\n\nHave a news tip or story idea about the border and its communities?

Doug Ducey says he got tired of waiting for federal authorities to fill in the holes.\n\nCrews at his direction started stacking shipping containers along portions of the border in August. Now the Bureau of Reclamation is asking the state to remove them – a request that Ducey’s office calls “unacceptable.”\n\nMeanwhile, Arizona is starting to place shipping containers along another section of the border.\n\nHere’s what we know about what’s happening, and a look at the bigger picture.\n\nStacked shipping containers are filling four border gaps so far\n\nDucey, a Republican, issued an executive order in August telling the state’s Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to use shipping containers to fill in gaps along the border. The first project: closing a 1,000-foot gap near Yuma, Arizona.\n\n“Arizona has had enough,” he said at the time. “We can’t wait any longer.”\n\nThe 8,800-pound, 9-by-40-feet containers stand about 22 feet tall when stacked, welded together and topped with four feet of razor wire, the governor’s office said, while border fencing built during the Trump administration is about 30 feet high.\n\nShortly after the project began, two shipping containers toppled. A Univision reporter who shared photos of the fallen containers said contractors in the area had told her strong winds were to blame. Ducey’s office said they suspected foul play. Since then, no similar incidents have been reported, spokesman CJ Karamargin said.\n\nBy late August, 11 days after the first shipping container project began, officials announced that 130 stacked shipping containers were filling four gaps and covering more than two-thirds of a mile along the border in Arizona’s Yuma County.\n\nThat effort, Karamargin said, cost $13 million.\n\nThis aerial photograph taken from a CBP helicopter on September 28 shows the US-Mexico border fence stopping at a mountainside near Welton, Arizona. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nA federal agency says their placement is illegal and calls it trespassing\n\nConstructing a bigger border wall was one of former President Trump’s signature priorities, and among the initiatives most criticized by his opponents. President Biden swiftly halted border wall construction once he took office.\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security has said it plans to close small gaps in the wall. And in July, the Biden administration announced a plan to fill some gaps in the border wall near Yuma.\n\nThis photo from May shows a gap along the border wall in Yuma, Arizona. This gap is one of four the state's governor filled with shipping containers in August. US Customs and Border Protection has said it plans to fill the gaps with its own project starting next year. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation cited those plans in a letter sent to Arizona officials earlier this month. The letter, obtained by CNN affiliate KYMA, asks the state to remove most of the shipping containers to make way for US Customs and Border Protection’s plans to fill in the gaps.\n\nThe letter says 80 containers were placed on Bureau of Reclamation land near the Morelos Dam and 42 were placed on Bureau of Reclamation rights of way on the Cocopah Indian Tribe’s West Reservation.\n\n“The unauthorized placement of those containers constitutes a violation of federal law and is a trespass against the United States,” said the letter from Jacklynn L. Gould, a Bureau of Reclamation regional director.\n\nGould asked Arizona officials to remove the containers and “work with Reclamation, in consultation with the Cocopah Indian Tribe, so that CBP’s project may proceed without unnecessary delay.”\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on the letter.\n\nDucey’s office says the shipping containers will stay – for now\n\nSo far Arizona isn’t backing down from the effort.\n\nThe state’s director of emergency management sent a stern response to the Bureau of Reclamation, disputing allegations that Arizona had trespassed on federal land and stating that the shipping containers would remain in place “until specific details regarding construction are provided.”\n\n“Since December 2021, numerous federal representatives have claimed that construction on the border would begin,” Allen Clark wrote. “However, to date, Arizona has not seen any action by the federal government to do so and was therefore required to take its own action.”\n\nKaramargin told CNN that state officials recently received a letter from CBP describing plans to use mesh fencing to fill the gaps, something he described as “completely unacceptable.”\n\n“From Gov. Ducey’s perspective, the idea that we would take down a temporary measure so that they can replace it with a less effective temporary measure in a nonstarter,” Karamargin said.\n\nMigrants are detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents on May 22 in Yuma, Arizona. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nA description of the project on CBP’s website states that construction will begin in early 2023, with plans to fill gaps “using a combination of barrier and mechanized bollard vehicle gates that allow for access to the riverside of the barrier.”\n\nThe fact that CBP construction isn’t slated to start until next year and the timing of the Bureau of Reclamation’s letter, he says, reveal how seriously federal officials are taking the situation at the border.\n\n“We managed to fill 3,800 feet of gap in Yuma in 11 days. … It took these guys six weeks to write a letter,” he said. “They don’t seem to have a sense of urgency about this.”\n\nUltimately, he said, Arizona wants a permanent solution to fill the gaps – an extension of the 30-foot-tall steel border barriers. And until that happens, he said, the state will continue its efforts.\n\nDucey announced the next phase of the shipping container project began this week, this time in Arizona’s Cochise County, with plans to use 2,770 containers to fill a 10.25-mile wall gap.\n\nThe cost of the project is about $95 million, Karamargin said, coming from a state border security fund.\n\nGOP governors have criticized Biden’s border policies and announced their own measures\n\nDucey has been Arizona’s governor since 2015.\n\nHe’s part of a vocal chorus of GOP governors – along with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – sharply criticizing the Biden administration’s border strategy.\n\nWith midterm elections looming, the criticism has intensified, along with these governors’ highly publicized efforts to take matters into their own hands – such as state-funded buses and flights transporting migrants north to other locations in the US. The White House has called these efforts political stunts.\n\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey, shown here in 2020, is among a group of GOP governors who've criticized the Biden administration's border policies and announced their own efforts to curb illegal immigration. Ross D. Franklin/Pool/AP\n\nAnd Arizona’s top federal prosecutor has mocked the state’s makeshift border wall.\n\n“We’re not dumping a bunch of shipping containers in the desert and calling it a wall to get cheap press,” US Attorney Gary Restaino wrote in an August tweet after a meeting between federal prosecutors and their Mexican counterparts. “It’s about developing comprehensive, data-driven strategies.”\n\nKaramargin says there was a clear reason for the governor to begin the shipping container initiative this year: a marked increase in migrants crossing the border.\n\n“None of this would be happening if the federal government took border security seriously. And clearly they are not,” Karamargin said.\n\nDoubling down on his effort, Ducey filed a lawsuit over control of land along the border this month, asking a federal judge to effectively block federal agencies’ efforts to regulate the shipping container project. Ducey argues a 60-foot-wide swath of land known as the Roosevelt Reservation should be under state control.\n\nThis aerial photo taken September 27 shows shipping containers filling a gap in the US-Mexico border wall in Yuma, Arizona. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nThe governor’s office cites numerous local officials praising the shipping container effort, and points to a Border Patrol official’s recent comment that having more gaps in the wall that migrants can cross through makes things more difficult for agents.\n\nAccording to CBP data, the agency’s Yuma sector has seen the largest increase in migrant encounters over the past year – more than 170%.\n\nIn the month after the shipping containers were placed, the number of migrant encounters in the sector increased around 5%, from 24,226 in August to 25,495 in September.\n\nThis isn’t the first time border wall efforts have faced federal opposition\n\nEfforts to erect border barriers have run afoul of federal authorities before.\n\nIn 2019 another federal body, the International Boundary and Water Commission, forced open a gate in a privately funded wall near the US-Mexico border, saying the group that built it didn’t follow proper permitting procedures.\n\nUltimately the commission filed a lawsuit, but construction was allowed to proceed.\n\nIn recent years we’ve seen numerous conflicts over border barrier construction, from lawsuits to political sparring.\n\nAnd as large numbers of migrants keep crossing, and debates rage over how to handle the situation, we’re likely to keep seeing them erupt.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

The federal government has been battling with the state ever since to get the containers removed, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe federal government is asking for the court to compel Arizona to remove all materials placed and to “compensate the United States for any actions it needs to take to undo Arizona’s actions.”\n\nThe suit, which names Ducey and two Department of Emergency and Military Affairs officials, was filed by the Department of Justice in the US District Court for the District of Arizona.\n\n“Not only has Arizona refused to halt its trespasses and remove the shipping containers from federal lands, but it has indicated that it will continue to trespass on federal lands and install additional shipping containers,” the lawsuit states.\n\nThe government claims that the temporary wall “substantially curtailed” the US Forest Service’s ability to access border areas and that the state “cut down or removed scores of trees, clogged drainages, and degraded the habitat of species listed under the Endangered Species Act” during the installation of the shipping containers.\n\nDucey’s office said in a letter sent to the Justice Department on Tuesday that the government had made a “series of unfounded and inaccurate claims” in an earlier letter stating the department’s intent to file a lawsuit.\n\n“The number one public safety risk and environmental harm has come from inaction by the federal government to secure our border,” the letter from Ducey’s office said. It added that the governor’s office has been trying to work with the federal government to fix their border wall since the Department of Homeland Security announced a plan to fill gaps in December 2021.\n\n“Arizona stands ready to cooperate with the federal government on construction of a border wall and always has been,” the letter from Ducey’s office said. Ducey’s office directed CNN to the letter when asked for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe legal spat comes as the Biden administration faces a December deadline to terminate a public health authority, known as Title 42, that took effect at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and allowed officials to turn away migrants encountered at the US southern border more than two million times. A federal judge blocked the administration’s attempts at maintaining the authority last month and set an expiration date for next Wednesday.\n\nNow, officials are preparing for an influx of migrants looking to enter the country after the long hiatus.", "authors": ["Taylor Romine"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2019/05/19/federal-judge-hears-arguments-challenge-trumps-border-emergency/3711736002/", "title": "Border wall progress: Judge could halt Trump's plan to use military ...", "text": "A federal judge in California on Friday heard arguments challenging President Donald Trump's emergency declaration that freed up $6 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOakland-based U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam will now decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction halting all construction of border barriers relying on that reprogrammed money while two lawsuits make their way through court.\n\nThree attorneys representing community and environmental groups, a collection of 20 states, and the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives argued in favor of the injunction.\n\nThey argued the Trump administration's actions pose harm to border communities and bypass Congress' authority to allocate, or deny, funds for the federal government.\n\nAn attorney from the Department of Justice, representing the Trump administration, countered that the government acted legally and that some of the plaintiffs had no standing to sue.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is representing environmental groups the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, a collection of advocacy and community groups along the U.S.-Mexico border, in the first lawsuit.\n\nThey are challenging the Pentagon's reprogramming of $3.6 billion for emergency military construction at the border and $2.5 billion for the military to build barriers for counter-drug support.\n\n\"Congress never intended and did not write ... the statute that could be used as a substitute whenever it didn't want to appropriate funds for the Department of Homeland Security, where the Department of Defense could just carry their water and take their own funds and build the wall for them,\" ACLU attorney Dror Ladin said in court.\n\nThe reallocation of funds for construction of border fencing caused harm to community groups, because it forced them to divert resources to deal with the effects of the emergency declaration, Ladin said. It also caused \"irreparable\" harm to the environment in areas where the the barriers would be built, he said.\n\nJames Burnham, a Justice Department attorney, argued that the Defense Department was able to reprogram funds because Congress did not explicitly restrict the money when it approved $1.375 billion for border wall construction in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas in a 2019 spending bill.\n\n\"If Congress had wanted to deny DOD this specific use of that transfer authority, that's something it needed to actually do in an explicit way in the appropriations process, and it didn't,\" Burnham said, adding that the House version of the 2020 budget bill included language restricting the transfer of military funds to build a wall.\n\nThe government asked Gilliam to defer decision on the legal challenge to the transfer of $3.6 billion for emergency military construction because \"there is just nothing for the court to decide yet.\"\n\nNone of those funds had been committed yet for construction, Burnham said.\n\nCalifornia and 19 other mostly blue states filed a separate lawsuit challenging the reallocation of $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to support wall construction at the border. The states say they have an interest in how that money is spent.\n\nMORE: In California, Trump claims border wall progress, tells migrants to 'turn around'\n\nBurnham said the states did not have standing to sue because they don't have direct access to apply to use those funds.\n\nPlaintiffs in the case asked the judge to issue an immediate injunction because construction is set to begin as early as May 25 under a $789 million contract the Pentagon awarded to replace 46 miles of fencing in New Mexico.\n\nThis week, the Pentagon awarded two more contracts worth $787 million to build 83 miles of fencing in Arizona and California using military funds. The day before, the Department of Homeland Security waived environmental and cultural restrictions to expedite the projects.\n\nWith guarantees from the U.S government that construction would not begin for at least 45 days, Gilliam gave plaintiffs 10 days to submit supporting documents related to the newly awarded border wall projects. He also gave the government 10 more days to respond.\n\nHave any news tips or story ideas about the U.S.-Mexico border?

Several of the projects are already in progress.\n\nBut not all 309 miles detailed in the lists would be built on the actual border. Nearly a third of the projects contain portions of secondary fencing. Those barriers are built a short distance from the international boundary to help border agents patrol their 150-foot enforcement zone.\n\nAt least one of the proposed locations in south Texas would require the construction of new 30-foot bollards in areas that previously had no barriers.\n\nJustice Department attorneys earlier this month submitted the two lists, detailed in a series of internal memorandums and letters to congressional committees, to a federal judge in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe lists are part of a lawsuit brought by several environmental groups that challenges the Trump administration for waiving certain environmental and cultural-artifact laws to expedite the border construction.\n\nSINEMA'S VIEW: Senator decries shifting Fort Huachuca funding to border wall\n\nThe $6.1 billion in diverted military funds comes from two separate pots of money authorized by Trump after his decision in February to declare a national emergency at the southwestern U.S. border.\n\nThe first pot holds $2.5 billion that the Department of Defense will use to pay for seven border wall projects totaling about 135 miles. The projects are paid for under Section 284, a provision that allows the Pentagon to build the border barriers in high-trafficking areas.\n\nThe second fund is valued at $3.6 billion and will fund a proposed 11 projects covering a length of 174 miles. The Pentagon announced last week it will cancel 128 military projects and funnel those funds to the Department of Homeland Security using Section 2808, which grants the Pentagon an emergency construction authority based on Trump's emergency declaration.\n\nThe two lists do not include the construction of new barriers along southern Texas, in areas that previously didn't have any. South Texas is the busiest crossing point along the entire southwestern border, and the one with the least amounts of border barriers.\n\nThe money to pay for nearly 95 new miles of bollard and levee walls in the Rio Grande Valley comes from $2.02 billion in funds Congress appropriated in the 2018 and 2019 budgets, as well as over $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.\n\nWhere will the barriers be built?\n\nThe locations for most of the proposed new barriers span the entire U.S.-Mexico border, but three areas feature prominently: the border northwest of Laredo, the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range in Arizona, and New Mexico's southwestern Bootheel.\n\nThose three areas account for 150 miles of the proposed border barriers and take up more than half of the $6 billion dollars in military spending diverted for border wall construction.\n\nHere are the list of proposed border wall projects, listed by state, that will be paid for using the $3.6 billion made available under Section 2808:\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nSan Diego Project 4: Valued at $67 million. It would replace 1.5 miles of primary pedestrian fencing and 2 miles of secondary fencing at a location about 3.6 miles east of the Otay Mesa port of entry. This is roughly the same area where the Trump administration built eight border wall prototypes in late 2017.\n\nSan Diego Project 11: Valued at $57 million. The project would add a total of three miles of secondary fencing on both sides of the Tecate port of entry.\n\nEl Centro Project 5: Valued at $20 million. It would add more than one mile of secondary fencing in the immediate vicinity of the Calexico West port of entry.\n\nEl Centro Project 9: Valued at $286 million. It would complement El Centro Project 5 and would extend the secondary fencing around the Calexico West port for an additional 12 miles. It would add nine miles of secondary barriers west of the port and three to the east.\n\nARIZONA\n\nYuma Project 2: Valued at $40 million. It would replace up to two miles of primary pedestrian fencing with new 30-foot bollards at the Barry Goldwater Range between Border Monument 197 and 198.\n\nYuma Project 3: Valued at $630 million. The project would replace 31 miles of existing vehicle barriers with 30-foot bollards, starting from the eastern boundary of the Barry Goldwater Range. The replacement would then extend westbound into the Cabeza Prieta Wildlife Refuge, ending at the Yuma County line.\n\nYuma Project 10/27: This previously unnamed project is valued at $527 million. It would add 31 miles of secondary fencing to the same area described in Yuma Project 3.\n\nYuma Project 6: Valued at $65 million. It would replace approximately one mile of primary fencing surrounding the Andrade port of entry, and would add two miles of secondary fencing from the port to the Colorado River.\n\nNEW MEXICO\n\nEl Paso Project 2: Valued at $476 million. It would replace 23.5 miles of vehicle barriers with 30-foot bollards in non-contiguous segments along southwestern New Mexico in the area known as the Bootheel. Two segments would replace nearly 11 miles around the Antelope Wells port of entry. A third, 13-mile segment would cover the western portions of Luna County.\n\nEl Paso Project 8: Valued at $164 million. It would replace an additional six miles of vehicle barriers with 30-foot bollards to the area west of the Antelope Wells port of entry and would complement El Paso Project 2. This project also includes six miles of secondary barriers in the same area as the primary fence.\n\nTEXAS\n\nLaredo Project 7: Valued at $1.268 billion, the most of any of the projects paid for with military funds. The project would build 52 miles of 30-foot bollards to the northwest of Laredo. The barriers would start at the Laredo-Colombia Solidarity port of entry and continue for 52 uninterrupted miles along the Rio Grande until reaching the outskirts of Del Rio.\n\nWhen will construction start?\n\nConstruction on several border replacement projects using military funds is already underway along the U.S.-Mexico border. A total of seven projects will be funded using $2.5 billion from Section 284, the provision to build barriers on high-trafficking corridors, according to Homeland Security Department information filed in court.\n\nWork has begun on three of those seven projects: one in the New Mexico desert, and two in southwestern Arizona.\n\nTHE WALL: Take a look at USA TODAY Network's Pulitzer-winning project\n\nIn New Mexico, a Texas company is working to replace 46 miles of existing vehicle barriers with 30-foot bollards under a $789 million contract.\n\nThe work began nearly 17½ miles west of the Columbus port of entry, located about 80 miles west of El Paso. It will move eastbound, past the port for an additional 35 miles, according to the information provided by Homeland Security.\n\nIn Arizona, a New Mexico construction company broke ground Aug. 22 on the replacement of the first five miles of wire-mesh fencing with 30-foot bollards near the Lukeville port of entry. The project is valued at $646 million for the construction of 63 miles in Arizona.\n\nIn October, the work will expand as part of the contract to include 38 miles along the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, where the bollards will replace existing vehicle barriers.\n\nAround that same time, the same company will begin work on nearly 20 miles of replacement fencing along several sections of Cochise County in southeastern Arizona. Crews will replace existing vehicle barriers with the 30-foot bollards.\n\nFarther west in Yuma, a Montana company began work in early September to replace five miles of vehicle barriers with 30-foot bollards along the Colorado River, a stretch that is commonly used by migrants to wade across the low water levels and turn themselves in to agents.\n\nIn all, the seven proposed projects funded by the Pentagon using Section 284 are:\n\nEl Centro Project 1: The replacement of 15 miles of existing barriers with new 30-foot bollards, starting about 10 miles west of the Calexico West port of entry.\n\nYuma Project 1: The replacement of 5 miles of vehicle barriers along the Colorado River with 30-foot bollards.\n\nYuma Project 2: The replacement of two segments of outdated pedestrian fencing totaling six miles. Two of those miles are along the Colorado River northwest of the San Luis port of entry, and the other four miles are on the Barry Goldwater Range.\n\nTucson Project 1: The replacement of 38.6 miles of vehicle barriers with 30-foot bollards along the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge to the Yuma County line.\n\nTucson Project 2: The replacement of about 5.1 miles of existing wire-mesh fencing surrounding the Lukeville port of entry, with newer 30-foot bollards.\n\nTucson Project 3: The installation of bollards in three segments along Cochise County. The first segment is 0.3 miles at the Coronado National Forest south of Sierra Vista. The second segment is 0.3 miles at the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area. The third segment is 19.2 miles east of Douglas approaching the New Mexico state line.\n\nEl Paso Project 1: The replacement of 46 miles of vehicle barriers surrounding the Columbus port of entry in New Mexico.\n\nLand jurisdiction will impact timelines\n\nIn court filings, Justice Department attorneys said the Pentagon could issue additional contracts for the proposed construction projects from Section 2808 funds as early as Oct. 3, starting with projects at the Barry Goldwater Range.\n\nThe land for these two projects are already under the jurisdiction of the military, so contracts can be awarded the earliest of the 11 projects on the list. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be responsible for issuing the contracts.\n\nOnce the contracts are awarded, construction will move quickly. According to the court records, work to clear the land would begin about 20 days after the government awards the contract.\n\n\"The earliest date on which substantial construction could occur for these projects is 40 days after contract award,\" the filing said.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS: Where is water for Arizona border wall coming from?\n\nSeven of the proposed 11 projects under Section 2808 would be built partially on public lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of Interior. The Trump administration said it anticipates it could take until April 2020 for the Pentagon \"to obtain administrative jurisdiction\" over all of the property and award contracts.\n\nBut work has already begun to transfer jurisdiction of several segments of public lands to the military.\n\nOn Wednesday, the secretary of the Interior transferred jurisdiction for five of those seven projects to the Department of the Army. The transfer includes about 560 acres of public lands along 70 miles of the international boundary, according to a news release.\n\nThe five segments of public lands transferred to the military are: San Diego Project 4 (44.73 acres), Yuma Project 3 (228 acres), Yuma Project 6 (73.3 acres), El Paso Project 2 (170 acres) and El Paso Project 8 (43 acres).\n\n\"The damages to natural resource values are a byproduct of the serious national security, drug enforcement, and other immigration challenges facing our dedicated staff along the border,\" Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a written statement. \"Construction of border barriers will help us maintain the character of the lands and resources under our care and fulfill our mission to protect them.\"\n\nTwo other projects, El Centro 5 and Laredo 1, include either private land or federal land that is not in the public domain and \"will require either purchase or condemnation,\" the filing said.\n\nEither of those processes likely will not be finalized until April 2020, according to the Justice Department attorneys.\n\nNo money for three Arizona projects\n\nEarlier this month, Justice Department attorneys notified the federal judge in Washington, D.C., that the Pentagon had found additional money from \"contract savings\" from the $2.5 billion in military funds designated for border construction under Section 284.\n\nThe original idea was to use those savings to fund an additional three border replacement projects along the Arizona border.\n\nBut according to an amended filing from Sept. 16, the Justice Department said that \"after definitizing the contracts\" for the other seven projects funded with $2.5 billion under Section 284, the Pentagon \"has determined that there are insufficient contract savings to undertake the three additional Section 284 projects.\"\n\nThese three additional projects are:\n\nYuma Project 4, which would build 1.1 miles of 30-foot bollards along the Colorado River, immediately east of the Andrade port of entry.\n\nYuma Project 5, which would replace \"ineffective\" landing mat fencing fencing with the 30-foot bollards in three non-contiguous stretches. The first two stretches are half a mile immediately west of the Andrade port of entry, and .4 miles immediately to the east. The third stretch would replace almost two miles of wire-mesh fencing with bollards along the Colorado River just west of the San Luis port of entry.\n\nTucson Project 4, which would replace 14.2 miles of vehicle barriers with bollards in an unspecified number of segments east of Nogales, along the Coronado National Forest-Huachuca district and the San Rafael Valley.\n\nThe lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's waiver authority was filed by three environmental groups, including the Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity. They also asked the federal judge for a preliminary injunction to stop construction, but the judge has yet to do so.\n\nHave any news tips or story ideas about the U.S.-Mexico border?

There were 947 COVID-19 patients in state hospitals Monday, up from 204 at the beginning of July, according to numbers from the Alabama Hospital Association. The latest number is about a third of where the state was at the peak of the pandemic, when there were 3,000 virus patients in state hospitals in January. Dr. Scott Harris, who serves as Alabama’s health officer, said he is “extremely concerned” about the rise in cases. “It’s the perfect storm of large numbers of unvaccinated people and the delta variant which is highly infectious and much more transmissible than anything we saw before,” Harris said. Dr. Don Williamson, the former state health officer who now heads the Alabama Hospital Association, said the concern is the steep upward trajectory in numbers. Williamson said the state has the solution in the form of the vaccine, but “there is not a long line of people wanting to be vaccinated.” Health officials say the latest spike is associated with the delta variant which is exploiting low immunization rates, summer crowds and the end of cautionary measures like mask wearing.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced plans to review whether a southeast Alaska wolf population merits Endangered Species Act protections. The plans are outlined in a document set to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday. The document stated that a petition from conservation groups to protect the Alexander Archipelago wolf included information indicating protections might be warranted because of potential threats associated with logging, illegal and legal trapping and hunting, climate change and loss of genetic diversity. The agency said it is initiating a status review to determine if protections are warranted. An email seeking comment was sent to an agency spokesperson Monday. The wolves are found in the coastal rainforests of southeast Alaska and British Columbia and a petition filed last year by the Center for Biological Diversity, Alaska Rainforest Defenders and Defenders of Wildlife raised particular concerns about the wolves in Alaska and on southeast Alaska’s Prince of Wales Island. In 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service determined the wolf did not warrant Endangered Species Act protections.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Civil rights leaders, including the Revs. Jesse Jackson and William Barber, were among 39 people arrested Monday after refusing to leave the Phoenix office of Democratic U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who has faced unrelenting pressure from liberal activists over her opposition to ending the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. Jackson, one of the nation’s most prominent civil rights leaders, said the U.S. is in a “civilization crisis” with “battle lines drawn,” and he urged activists to fight nonviolently for their rights. Sinema is among moderate Democratic senators who have ruled out changes to the filibuster, which she said encourages bipartisan cooperation and more lasting legislative compromises. Several hundred activists marched about a mile from a park to Sinema’s office in Phoenix’s Biltmore neighborhood, chanting “end the filibuster now.” Eliminating the filibuster would open the door for Democratic senators to enact voting rights bills and raise the federal minimum wage to $15, they said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he planned to meet with House and Senate leaders about growing calls to allow schools to require face masks as the state reported 23 more deaths from COVID-19. The Republican governor said he planned to discuss the issue Tuesday with the GOP leaders of the state House and Senate, following calls from Democratic lawmakers and others to lift a state law banning mask mandates by state and local governments. The Little Rock School Board on Monday night passed a resolution urging a change in the law so districts could decide whether to require students and employees wear masks. Arkansas’ virus cases have been surging in recent weeks, fueled by the delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. The state’s deaths rose to 6,077. The number of people hospitalized rose by 61 to 980. University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson tweeted that the hospital had 66 COVID-19 patients, surpassing the record it reached in January when it had 63.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs:Monsoonal thunderstorms drenched the Coachella Valley early Monday, bringing flooded roadways, power outages and the wettest day for Palm Springs in more than 15 months. The Palm Springs International Airport collected nearly a half-inch of rain, setting a daily record. Monday's heavy rain was the largest single-day accumulation in the city since 0.46 fell on April 8, 2020. The heavy rain also impacted Monday's morning commute as intersections saw minor flooding. In Palm Springs, Indian Canyon Drive was closed between Sunrise Parkway and Garnet for several hours because of water washing over the roadway, but the road was reopened about 3:15 p.m. Monday, with the exception of one southbound lane. Near Mecca, Box Canyon Road was closed near Interstate 10 because of debris and flooding. Across the valley, the California Highway Patrol reported a sinkhole at Dillon Road and Thousand Palms Canyon Road, with residents advised to avoid the area. The weather also left several thousand residents in the Coachella Valley without power. Southern California Edison reported power outages impacted roughly 6,800 customers in the valley at the height of the storm, but that number dropped to approximately 1,500 customers by afternoon.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The first phase of the Larimer County Jail’s multimillion-dollar expansion project has wrapped up. Larimer County commissioners and other county officials toured the completed parts of the $80 million project last week, including a new kitchen, laundry area and boiler room. Construction on the first phase of the project was completed July 9. The new kitchen is about double the size and more open than the old kitchen, which jail Capt. Bobby Moll said will make it easier for jail staff to supervise those assigned to work in the kitchen. The jail works to provide meal options to accommodate religious and dietary needs, and the extra space in the new kitchen will give workers more space for food prep, Lt. Staci Shaffer said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Dr. Manisha Juthani, an infectious disease specialist at Yale School of Medicine, was nominated by Gov. Ned Lamont to serve as the next commissioner of the Department of Public Health. Juthani will succeed Dr. Deidre Gifford, the state social services commissioner who has also been leading the health agency since the departure of Renee Coleman-Mitchell in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic. Juthani was among the doctors who signed a letter in November to Lamont urging him to prohibit indoor dining, close gyms and ban nonessential social gatherings to slow the spread of the virus. Juthani will begin the new role on Sept. 20. At a news conference, she said she was eager to work on issues including health care equity and disparities in access to treatment. She also commended the health care workers and others who have helped the state through the pandemic.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:State Rep. Gerald Brady will not seek reelection when his term ends in 2022, he said Monday. The announcement came after a week of criticism and calls for his resignation after a an email sent by Brady using an anti-Asian racial slur.was published by The News Journal. The comments from Brady came from an email exchange with an out-of-state advocate regarding legislation intended to protect sex workers. That June 27 email was intended for a private citizen Brady knows, asking if they could read and summarize the study, said Drew Volturo, spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus. Instead, Brady hit reply and emailed the original sender. In Delaware, lawmaker emails are not considered public record. The response was shared with The News Journal. Brady’s actions “make it more difficult to effectively provide the kind of representation” constituents of his district deserve, he said in a statement on Monday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:D.C. neighbors are calling for action from the city after three young men were shot on Q Street northwest Sunday afternoon, two of whom died, WUSA-TV reported. D.C. Police identified the two men killed as 22-year-old Javon Hill, Jr. and 19-year-old Tariq Riley. The third young man hit is recovering from gunshot injuries, according to police. Resident Brenda Stewart and her Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, Karla Lewis, said they had been pressing the city to do more – to be more proactive – to no avail. “I don't have any answers, I just want some solutions,\" Stewart said. \"I like to see some real masterminds in our community that can come up with some solutions.” Stewart said she's proud of her home and wants the city to take care of it. Lewis said they're working with Councilmember McDuffie's office to set up a community meeting to discuss solutions.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said “we are now in crisis mode” when it comes to dealing with soaring numbers of COVID-19 infections. Florida accounted for a fifth of the nation’s new infections last week, more than any other state, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now Orange County, the home to Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando Resort is seeing about 1,000 new cases a day, Demings said. “A thousand a day is extraordinary,” Demings said. “We are now in crisis mode … We as a community need to work together to slow this rate.” The positivity rate for the virus in the county of 1.4 million residents has tripled to 14% from about 4.3% a month ago. More than 61% of county residents have had at least one vaccination shot, and the mayor urged unvaccinated residents to get theirs as soon as possible. Demings said central Florida hospitals are approaching capacity. A medical officer at one of the state’s largest health systems said its number of COVID-19 patients is nearing a record high: 862, approaching the peak of 900 hospitalized patients with the virus in January.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah:For the first time, the Port of Savannah has moved 5.3 million 20-foot equivalent container units in a fiscal year, the Georgia Ports Authority said. That means it has grown its cargo volumes by 20% in fiscal year 2021. American companies are continuing to choose the Port of Savannah as a gateway to global trade, Gov. Brian Kemp said. Georgia’s ports are a key reason that it remains a strong state for business, the governor said. Georgia Ports Authority Executive Director Griff Lynch said the project to deepen Savannah Harbor, the Mason Mega Rail terminal and other capacity upgrades are preparing Georgia for future cargo demand. The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is now nearly 90% complete, the Ports Authority said. The project is expected to finish in December. With a high-tide depth of 54 feet, the deeper harbor will allow vessels to take on heavier loads with fewer tidal restrictions.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Kauai utility officials are installing glow-in-the-dark devices to prevent endangered nocturnal seabirds from crashing into power lines. The diverters help Newell’s shearwater, Hawaiian petrel and band-rumped storm petrel avoid power lines after dark. Kauai is considered an important breeding habitat for all of those species. The Kauai Island Utility Cooperative installed diverters on 109 power line spans last year and expects to install diverters on another 628 spans by the end of 2021, The Garden Island reported Monday. The cooperative said it is using reflective diverters that glow in the dark near residential areas, commercial districts and public roads. In remote areas, it’s using LED diverters that charge via a solar panel during the day to produce light that’s visible to birds at night. Bird diverters are estimated to be 40% to 90% effective in minimizing power-line collisions, depending on type and location.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal court has temporarily halted a northern Idaho logging project in grizzly bear habitat following a lawsuit contending the U.S. Forest Service violated environmental laws. U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled Friday in favor of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and issued a preliminary injunction on the 2,500-acre Hanna Flats Logging Project in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest. The Forest Service and Idaho Department of Lands are partnering on the project under a program called the Good Neighbor Authority intended to speed up logging and forest restoration projects on U.S. Forest Service land by allowing state officials to take care of some of the work. The Forest Service said it doesn’t have to follow certain environmental laws because the project qualifies for a categorical exclusion under the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. The act allows the Forest Service to avoid some environmental studies if an area is designated as “wildland urban interface,” an area where homes and wildland intermingle, and that can leave homes vulnerable to wildfires. The Forest Service cited Bonner County’s wildfire protection plan that designates the area as wildland urban interface in saying the logging project qualified for the categorical exclusion. However, Winmill ruled that the project does not appear to qualify for an exclusion and halted logging until it rules on the merits of the case. The U.S. Department of Justice, which represents federal agencies in court cases, didn’t immediately respond to an inquiry sent through its online portal on Monday.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city of Chicago and its police union announced they have reached a tentative contract agreement after four years of negotiations. The tentative contract is aligned with the consent decree entered into in 2019 that calls for reforms to how the Chicago Police Department operates, according to officials. The 236-page plan negotiated between Illinois and Chicago officials calls for more community policing, more data collection on how officers work and expanded training on the use of force. One provision will require officers to file paperwork each time they point a gun at someone, even if they don’t fire. The reforms in the contract includes the end to a ban on investigation of anonymous complaints and the changing of officer testimony after viewing video. In addition, officers can now be rewarded for reporting misconduct of other officers. The tentative contract calls for rank-and-file police officers to receive a 10.5% retroactive pay raise and 9.5% more through January 2025. The proposal represents an average annual increase of 2.5%.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Department of Environmental Management forecasted high ozone levels Tuesday for four regions in the central, southern and western parts of the state. The alert covered Clark and Floyd counties in southeastern Indiana; Vigo, Carroll and Tippecanoe counties in west-central Indiana; Marion, Bartholomew, Boone, Brown, Delaware, Hamilton, Hendricks, Howard, Madison and Shelby counties in central Indiana; and Daviess, Dubois, Gibson, Greene, Knox, Perry, Pike, Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh and Warrick counties in southwestern Indiana. Anyone sensitive to changes in air quality could be affected when ozone levels are high. Children, the elderly, and anyone with heart or lung conditions were advised to reduce or avoid exertion and heavy work outdoors. Ground-level ozone is formed when sunlight and hot weather combine with vehicle exhaust, factory emissions, and gasoline vapors. It can irritate lungs and can cause coughing and breathing difficulties for sensitive populations. The agency encouraged everyone to help reduce ozone by driving less; not refueling vehicles or using gasoline-powered lawn equipment until after 7 p.m.; and conserving energy by turning off lights and setting thermostats to 75 degrees or above.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The Des Moines Metropolitan Wastewater Reclamation Authority has begun sampling sewage as part of a national program to track the spread of the coronavirus and its variants. The agency announced its participation Monday, the Des Moines Register reported. Agency workers began collecting samples last week and shipping them to a national lab in Maine. The effort is being funded by the federal government and is expected to continue for eight or nine weeks. Larry Hare, manager of the southeast Des Moines sewage treatment plant, said sewage sampling can inform officials if a dangerous virus or germ is circulating in a community. “It will tell us whether we’re behind the curve or ahead of the curve,” Hare said. He said the sampling is the first time the Des Moines agency has participated in a search for a virus, but it has previously provided samples for researchers looking for opioid drug use and other information.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: One of Kansas’ largest public school districts plans to require elementary students to wear masks this fall after a health official warned that the faster-spreading delta variant would lead to widespread infections among unmasked children. The Shawnee Mission district joins the Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, schools in requiring masks for some students. But Shawnee Mission is the only district to plan on mandating masks among the six in Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, The Kansas City Star reported. Shawnee Mission’s board voted 6-1 to require masks in elementary schools but keep them optional for middle and high schools. The district has 26,000 students, making it the third-largest in Kansas behind Wichita and Olathe. Johnson County Epidemiologist Elizabeth Holzschuh warned the board that the delta variant would become widespread in classrooms of unmasked elementary-aged students. The federal government has not authorized any vaccine for children under 12.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Department for Public Health is offering a coronavirus testing program for schools to assist with safe in-person learning for the upcoming academic year, Commissioner Steven Stack said. It is limited to staff and students of Kentucky K-12 public, private and charter schools. “We’ve been given $134 million by the federal government to create a testing program for K-12 schools, public and private, throughout the entire commonwealth,” Stack said. “I urge everyone who operates a school out there to explore the options and make testing available to keep yourselves safe.” Superintendents and school administrators can learn more at govstatus.egov.com/K-12-kentucky-school-testing-program.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Officials suspended visitation and volunteer programs in Louisiana’s eight state-run prisons Tuesday to guard against the spread of COVID-19. The action came in response to a fourth surge of the disease in the state, where hospitalizations – at more than 1,200 as of Monday – have more than doubled in 10 days. The suspension is effective immediately and will be reevaluated on Aug. 16, the Department of Corrections said in a news release. “In lieu of visitation, the Department will continue to offer two free phone calls per week to ensure inmates have continued connection to family and friends during this event,” the department said. “In addition, video calling remains available for a fee.” At least two major hospital systems in the state have announced the suspension of nonemergency surgeries that might require hospital admissions as COVID-19 hospitalization numbers grow. In the New Orleans suburb of Jefferson Parish, officials held a morning news conference to again urge people to get vaccinated. Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng, accompanied by the parish coroner and doctors from two local hospital systems, said new cases are evident in areas of the parish where vaccination rates are low.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Public health authorities said a second case of a rare tick-borne infection has been located in the state. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said laboratory tests confirmed a case of Powassan virus in a resident of Knox County. A Waldo County resident who is still recovering from the virus contracted it in June. The agency said about 25 cases of the disease are reported in the U.S. every year. Maine has had 10 cases since 2010. Symptoms of the disease can include fever, headache, weakness, confusion and memory loss. Severe infection can also lead to death. The Maine CDC said residents should take precautions, such as wearing repellent and protective clothing to avoid Powassan and other tick-borne infections.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan honored deaf and blind swimmer Becca Meyers for courage in championing the disabled, after the three-time gold medalist withdrew from the Paralympics in Tokyo when told her mother couldn’t travel as her personal care assistant. Hogan presented a citation to Meyers during a news conference commemorating the 31st anniversary of the American with Disabilities Act. The certificate honored her “bravery for highlighting the issue of inequality and access for people with disabilities.” Hogan also signed an executive order declaring that Maryland will annually celebrate July as Disability Culture and Achievements Month. “Becca deserved to be able to compete, and while we’re all so disappointed for her, I got the chance to tell her just a moment before this started that I’m unbelievably proud of her for having the courage to speak up and to speak out about this injustice,” Hogan said. Meyers, 26, said the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee approved her mother to act as her assistant at all international meets since 2017 but the committee said her request to bring her mother this time was denied because of restrictions put in place by the Japanese government because of COVID-19. Meyers said she made the decision to withdraw to stand up for future Paralympic athletes, saying she didn’t want them to have to experience what she’s been through. “I hope to work with others to effect change so that no one ever feels afraid to travel with Team USA,” Meyers said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: City officials have approved an indoor mask mandate to fight an outbreak of more than 500 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the vacation haven at the tip of Cape Cod. The town’s Select Board and Board of Health unanimously voted in favor of the mandate during an emergency joint meeting Sunday. “We are entering a new stage of COVID,” Town Manager Alex Morse said. “COVID, while depressing for many of us, is not going away anytime soon.” The boards had approved an indoor mask advisory last week, but it had not adequately succeeded in slowing the spread, he said. The new cases stem from a busy Fourth of July weekend, officials have said. The indoor mask mandate will become an advisory again when positivity rates drop lower than 3% over five days. The advisory can be lifted when the positivity rate drops lower than 2%.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: Enbridge said it had retrieved an anchor that broke away from a maintenance vessel while on the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac. The mishap occurred June 21 as a contractor for the pipeline company was doing seasonal work on the underwater section of Line 5, an oil line that runs between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. The section in the straits, which connects Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, is divided into two pipes about 1,200 feet apart. The anchor was deployed about midway between them. When the crew tried to raise it, the shackle connecting it to the cable failed, Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes said. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy ordered the company to remove the anchor, which took place Sunday. A crane on a barge was used to lift the 15,000-pound object to the surface, Barnes said. Pipeline operations weren’t affected, he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nFairmont: An announcer who was fired by an Iowa racetrack after a racist rant was back behind the microphone in southern Minnesota last weekend, but he did not receive a standing ovation as promised because he was apparently uncomfortable with that plan, according to the promoter of Fairmont Raceway. Lon Oelke is the full-time announcer at Fairmont Raceway, where he worked Friday – days after the Kossuth County Speedway in Algona, Iowa, cut ties with him after he went on a racist rant this month against Black fans and athletes who kneel during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality. The Kossuth County Speedway said in a statement that its leaders “do not condone” Oelke’s comments, adding that management did not hear them during the race, but only after they gained attention on social media. “I think perhaps the whole thing is taken a little out of context with social media these days,” Fairmont track promoter Jon McCorkell told the Star Tribune, adding that he’ll “stick by my guy.”\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: The Mississippi Department of Public Safety said it wants local officials to find a larger building for the state driver’s license office in Vicksburg. The department’s director of driver services, Kevin Raymond, told Warren County supervisors Monday that the county-owned building is too small to accommodate workers and visitors, the Vicksburg Post reported. Raymond said the driver’s license office needs an additional entrance, a second bathroom, a break room and more square footage. However, he said the state doesn’t provide money for those needs. Warren County pays most expenses for the building where the driver’s license office is housed, including cleaning services and utilities. The new space being considered is in the former Outlets of Vicksburg. It would be larger, have two restrooms, multiple entrances and a large parking lot. The lot would provide space for commercial driver’s license training, and the manager of the Vicksburg driver’s license office, Rhonda Howard, said that would make a big difference. Performing a commercial driver’s license road test now requires 11/ 2 -hour round trip to Pearl.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt has sued to halt a mask mandate that took effect Monday in the St. Louis area amid a rise in COVID-19 cases that are burdening a growing number of hospitals across the state. The mandate, one of the first to be reinstated in the country, requires everyone age 5 or older to wear masks in indoor public places and on public transportation in St. Louis city and St. Louis County, even if they are vaccinated. Wearing masks outdoors is strongly encouraged, especially in group settings. But the lawsuit said the mandates are “arbitrary and capricious because they require vaccinated individuals to wear masks, despite the CDC guidance that this is not necessary.” It also questions mandating children to wear masks in school, noting they are less likely to become seriously ill. “This continued government overreach is unacceptable and unconstitutional, especially in the face of a widely available vaccine,” Schmitt said in a news release. St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones said Schmitt would not be successful in his legal challenge. She noted that he filed an unsuccessful lawsuit last year against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nation’s officials are to blame for the pandemic.\n\nMontana\n\nLivingston: Authorities in south-central Montana continued searching Tuesday for an inmate who overpowered a county jail guard, took the guard’s gun and car keys and escaped in a stolen minivan. Jordon Earl Linde, 34, is believed to have stayed in the Livingston-Shields Valley area after escaping from custody in Park County at about 11 p.m. Sunday, Sheriff Brad Bichler said in a social media post. Bichler encouraged Linde to no longer “prolong the inevitable” and turn himself in, or for anyone who has contact with him to do the same. Linde was arrested Saturday for felony drug charges and other alleged offenses. After stealing a Park County Detention Center minivan during his escape, he abandoned the vehicle and was believed to have stolen another – a gold Chrysler Town and Country minivan. Linde had a pistol and was considered armed and dangerous.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: An Omaha man has been indicted on a federal charge of bank fraud after prosecutors said he lied to get a loan through a federal program meant to help businesses struggling in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. M.A. Yah faces court next month and could get up to 30 years in prison if convicted, the office of the U.S. Attorney for Nebraska said in a news release. The indictment against Yah said he was director of The Heartland News – a nonprofit newspaper with a mission to end poverty and homelessness in the region – when he requested a Paycheck Protection Program loan of more than $100,000 for the business in April 2020. Paperwork filed by Yah said the loan was to support the newspaper’s payroll, but prosecutors said he lied about the number of employees and payroll of the nonprofit from the previous year. Reached by phone Tuesday, Yah denied the allegations, ut said he could not yet comment further on the charges. Yah said he planned to hire an attorney this week to fight the charge.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has denied environmentalists’ request for a court order temporarily blocking the government from digging trenches for archaeological surveys at a mine planned near the Nevada-Oregon line with the largest-known U.S. deposit of lithium. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du said in an 11-page ruling late Friday in Reno that four conservation groups failed to prove the trenches planned across a total of one-quarter acre would cause irreparable harm to sage brush that serves as crucial habitat for imperiled sage grouse. She said she plans to rule later this week on a request from a Nevada tribe to join the legal fight as a co-plaintiff and seek a similar restraining order based on claims the digging would disturb sacred burial grounds.Du emphasized she has placed the overall case on an expedited schedule and intends to issue a ruling on the merits by early next year. She noted any construction of the mine itself is unlikely to begin before the snow melts in the spring of 2022. Lithium Nevada Corp.’s proposed Thacker Pass mine is emerging as a key battleground in the debate over environmental trade-offs tied to President Joe Biden’s push for renewable energy. Lithium is a key component in electric vehicle batteries.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Fine-particle air pollution concentrations have reached unhealthy levels statewide for people with lung diseases and those who are active outdoors as smoke from wildfires in the West and Canada reaches the area, the Department of Environmental Services said. The department said people should take precautions by limiting prolonged outdoor exertion. Current wind patterns are transporting waves of smoke from fires in the West and parts of Canada across much of the country, including New Hampshire, the department said. The smoke plumes also diffract light, causing a hazy appearance in the sky and reducing visibility of distant objects, the department said. Sensitive individuals include children, older adults and anyone with lung disease such as asthma, emphysema, and bronchitis. The air quality is expected to improve Wednesday as the wind is forecast to move the smoke plumes out of the area.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: A $44 million federal grant announced Monday will be used to modernize, expand and reconfigure the road system at the port complex in Newark and Elizabeth, making it safer and cutting down on delays. Some of the most congested roads in New Jersey are at the port complex, where trucks roll through nonstop to pick up and drop off shipping containers at the nation’s second-busiest port. With container volume in the New York/New Jersey port system setting a record last year despite the disruptions to the global supply chain caused by the pandemic, the aging roads and interchanges in Newark figure to continue taking a beating. It’s estimated that 15,000 trucks use the roads each day at the northern access points to the port, which sit at the intersection of Interstate 78 and the New Jersey Turnpike across from Newark Liberty International Airport. The Port Authority, which operates the ports, said there were more than 400 truck accidents and three fatalities between 2005 and 2018. The grant comes from the Department of Transportation’s Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program, and will be used as part of the Port Authority’s 10-year, $176 million road network modernization project.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State education officials released updated guidance on COVID-19 case reporting, masking requirements and vaccine considerations for K-12 schools this fall. The new rules give vaccinated students more chances to take off masks. It also allows them to avoid quarantines if there’s an outbreak on campus. Schools serving only middle or high school students can choose to allow vaccinated children to go without masks in most situations. But deciding which schools can unmask won’t be easy, and could hinge on vaccination rates. Under the new guidelines, local school officials are allowed to require universal masking in any school, even among students who volunteer proof of vaccine status in the form of a card or a screenshot of a Department of Health confirmation.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Carlos Santana, LL Cool J and Barry Manilow are among the performers who will join previously announced headliners Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen and Jennifer Hudson at next month’s Central Park concert to celebrate the city’s recovery from the pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The Aug. 21 concert will be broadcast worldwide on CNN and will also include performances by Elvis Costello, Andrea Bocelli, Wyclef Jean and Cynthia Erivo, the mayor said. Patti Smith will duet with Springsteen. “This is going to be an historic, monumental moment for all New Yorkers and all Americans,” de Blasio said. “I’ll put it plainly: You’re going to want to be here.” City officials said 80% of the tickets for the concert will be free. Free and for-purchase tickets will be released to the public in batches starting Monday at www.homecoming2021.com. Proof of COVID-19 vaccination will be required for entry, de Blasio said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCurrituck: The Currituck-Knotts Island ferry service is being suspended to alleviate a staffing shortage at the Hatteras terminal, according to the N.C. Department of Transportation’s Ferry Division. In a news release, the division said the Currituck-Knotts Island route will resume its scheduled service on July 31. Earlier this year, the department said its ferry service was facing a shortage of deck hands, seamen and captains. The Virginian-Pilot reported in the spring that there is often a waiting list to get a ferry job. But this year, the service needs to fill an expanded summer schedule. Jed Dixon, deputy director of the North Carolina Ferry Division, said the pandemic prevented an annual job fair that typically helps recruit enough employees. But he said that people could simply be choosing other careers. North Carolina operates 22 ferries on seven routes, and officials said about 2 million people ride the vessels each year. In April, the ferry service said it needed roughly 20 more employees.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo:The Army has awarded a more than $13 million contract to Gast Construction Company, Inc. in Fargo to build a Remotely Piloted Aircraft operations center for the North Dakota Air National Guard’s 119th Wing. Republican U.S. Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Committee, was able to secure $17.5 million for the construction of the facility, which is needed to support new advanced technology and equipment that is crucial to the mission’s long-term success, while also preventing interruptions for the wing’s operations. The Air Guard anticipates moving into the new facility sometime in fiscal year 2023.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens: Ohio University has notified the Delta Pi chapter of Sigma Chi that it has been suspended for four years following an investigation by the school that revealed student code of conduct violations. The fraternity accepted responsibility for providing false information to school officials or law enforcement and two hazing-related counts. The suspension came about two weeks after the university found the Beta Chapter of Delta Tau Delta committed nine violations, including selling and distributing alcohol, reckless behavior and coerced consumption of alcohol. That fraternity was also suspended for four years. Members of the fraternities are prohibited from joining other frats on campus or starting their own, the school said. Both will be eligible to apply for reinstatement in 2025. Gov. Mike DeWine recently signed a measure that put in place tougher penalties for hazing at Ohio universities and colleges starting this fall. “Collin’s Law,” is named after Collin Wiant, an 18-year-old Ohio University freshman who died in 2018 after ingesting nitrous oxide at a different fraternity house, which was expelled in May 2019.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The remains of 19 bodies exhumed as part of a city search for unmarked burials from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre will be reinterred during a private ceremony Friday at Oaklawn Cemetery, city officials said. The bodies were exhumed in June and examined at an on-site laboratory by forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield, whose findings have not been made public, the Tulsa World reported. Efforts to identify the remains through records and possibly DNA are ongoing, according to the city. Stubblefield has said that the remains appeared to include men, women and children. In at least one set of male remains, a bullet was found in a shoulder. Other parts of the man’s remains showed similar signs of trauma, including to the head.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Health officials in Oregon’s most populous county said they strongly recommend that people wear masks in all indoor public spaces regardless of vaccine status. Multnomah County officials said in news release that the advisory was issued in response to COVID-19 cases increasing largely because of the highly contagious delta variant. Public Health Director Jessica Guernsey said if people don’t act, an exponential rise in cases can be expected, especially in pockets with low vaccinations. County health officials are particularly worried about the delta variant, which is roughly twice as contagious as earlier virus strains and might cause more severe illness. Eight counties in Western Washington are also recommending people wear masks in public indoor settings as are officials in Los Angeles County and San Francisco Bay Area counties.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg:Nearly 1,500 nursing home workers across Pennsylvania canceled a one-day strike Tuesday after they reached contract agreements with their employers. SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania had said that employees at 20 nursing homes were going to hold a one-day strike to draw attention to problems with the industry, such as low wages, short staffing and outdated state regulations. On Monday, the union first announced that workers had come to tentative contract agreements with Guardian Healthcare. Then late Monday afternoon, the union said workers at Priority-owned facilities had also come to preliminary agreements. “Our new agreements move us in the right direction but they are only a first step in an urgent and larger conversation about reforming our long-term care system,” said Matthew Yarnell, SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania’s president, in a statement. Workers will discuss the proposed agreements “over the next few weeks” and hold ratification votes, according to the union’s statement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are investigating a rise in the number of cases of Legionnaires’ disease in Rhode Island, the state Department of Health said. There have been 30 cases reported since June 2, the agency said in an emailed statement. Of those, 28 people have required hospitalization. The state has had an average of 10 cases per month in June and July since 2014, the agency said. No common source of exposure has been identified. “We know that Legionella bacteria grow best in complex water systems that are not well-maintained,” department Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott said in a statement. “When this water becomes aerosolized in small droplets, such as in a cooling tower, shower, or decorative fountain, people can accidentally breathe in the contaminated water. This is of particular concern now as some buildings’ water systems have been offline for a prolonged period due to the COVID-19 pandemic and are just now returning to service.” Legionella is especially a concern in buildings that primarily house people older than 65, buildings with multiple housing units and a centralized hot water system like hotels or high-rise apartment complexes. Symptoms, which typically start two to 10 days after breathing in the bacteria, can include cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle aches, and headaches.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLake Wylie: At least 80 dogs were taken out of a home because they were living in very poor conditions, deputies said. Two monkeys and a bird were also removed Monday from property in Lake Wylie, the York County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. “The smell about knocked me over. There were feces everywhere,” sheriff’s spokesman Trent Faris told reporters outside the home. The dogs were mostly smaller animals and were living inside and outside the home, deputies said. The animals have been taken to the county animal shelter to determine how healthy they are and if they can be adopted, authorities said. A man in the home was charged with ill treatment of and hoarding of animals and deputies said more charges are possible after a veterinarian examines the animals. Deputies said they found methamphetamine and several guns in the home as well. There were so many animals to examine that the York County Animal Shelter had to stop taking in other animals from the public on Monday.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board is requiring all of its employees to be vaccinated for COVID-19. The board’s CEO, Jerilyn Church, has sent a memo to staff that said those working under the Health Board banner, including the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, Oyate Health Center and the We Are Warriors EOC will be required to be fully vaccinated by Sept. 21. “In accordance with GPTLHB’s duty to provide and maintain a workplace that is free of known hazards, GPTLHB has adopted this policy to safeguard the health of our employees and their families, our relatives and visitors, and the community at large from infectious diseases that vaccinations reduce,” Church said. Currently, 74% of the Health Board’s staff has received the vaccine, according to officials. But, with numbers on the rise and the emergence of the delta variant, mandatory vaccinations for all staff is a logical next step for the organization, Church said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:An exhibit of artwork, costumes and props from The Walt Disney Co. archives is on display at the Graceland Exhibition Center. The 10,000-square-foot display, “Inside the Walt Disney Archives,” covers multiple Disney properties, ranging from Disney live action to animated films, Walt Disney’s personal effects, items from various Disney Parks and more. The exhibit premiered at D23 Expo Japan in 2018. The items are on loan to Graceland, Elvis Presley’s home in Memphis. Some items include Jack Sparrow’s compass from “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,” Mary Poppins’ original carpet bag, Wilson from “Cast Away,” Lumiere and Cogsworth props from 2017’s “Beauty and the Beast” and Congo Queen Model Boat from Disneyland’s Jungle Cruise. The exhibit will continue through Jan. 2, with special events planned through the run. Tickets are $15 for ages 11 and older and $8 for ages 5 to 10. There is no charge for children 4 and younger to visit.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A man elbowed a bailiff who was attempting to handcuff him after the man was convicted of killing a San Antonio police detective. Jurors deliberated about 25 minutes Monday before convicting Otis McKane, 40, of capital murder in the November 2016 fatal shooting of Detective Benjamin Marconi. Prosecutors were seeking the death penalty against McKane; the trial’s punishment phase was set to begin Tuesday afternoon. A bailiff was trying handcuff McKane when McKane elbowed him in the face before several officers pushed him into an adjacent room. District Attorney Joe Gonzales and defense attorney Joel Perez declined comment on the outburst. Gonzales said the bailiff was not seriously injured. Marconi was fatally shot as he sat in his patrol car during a traffic stop that did not involve McKane, authorities said. McKane, as he was being taken to jail following the shooting, told reporters that he “lashed out at someone who didn’t deserve it” because he was upset with the court system. McKane said he was angry because he had not been allowed to see his son during a custody battle.\n\nUtah\n\nKanosh: A sandstorm caused a 22-vehicle pileup on a highway that left eight people dead, including four children, authorities said. The Sunday afternoon crashes on Interstate 15 near the town of Kanosh came at the end of a holiday weekend for the state that often leads to increased highway traffic. At least 10 people were taken to hospitals, including three in critical condition, according to the Utah Highway Patrol. Ground and air ambulances were used to transport crash victims. The pileup occurred during a period of high winds that caused a dust or sandstorm that reduced visibility, the highway patrol said. Five of the eight people killed were in one vehicle, and two others were in another vehicle, according to a news release. Another fatality was in a third vehicle. I-15 remained partially shut down late Sunday. Traffic was redirected around the crash site. Roadways on Sunday were full of drivers headed home after a long weekend to celebrate a state holiday recognizing Utah history and settlers from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who trekked west in search of religious freedom.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont’s congressional delegation sent a letter to the U.S. State Department on Tuesday asking it to direct sufficient resources to work through a backlog of requests for passports and renewals. The lawmakers also wrote they are hearing from a significant number of Vermonters having trouble with the main contact number, sometimes waiting on hold for hours. Earlier this month, the State Department reported a backlog of 1.5 million requests nationwide and said that the wait for a passport is now between 12 weeks and 18 weeks, even if people pay for expedited processing. The delay is because of ripple effects from the coronavirus pandemic that caused extreme disruptions to the process at domestic issuance facilities and overseas embassies and consulates. An email was sent to the State Department on Tuesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The two leading candidates in the closely watched race for governor said they will voluntarily disclose at least some information from recent tax returns before the November election. In response to questions from the Associated Press, the campaigns of Republican Glenn Youngkin and Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe made vague pledges to release unspecified details from their tax returns, but neither said they would make the documents available in full. “Glenn Youngkin will release information from his tax returns in recent years when his latest filings are complete, before November,” said spokeswoman Macaulay Porter. Christina Freundlich, a spokeswoman for McAuliffe, said he would share a summary of recent years’ returns before the election. Although it is not required for Virginia gubernatorial candidates to disclose their returns, there is some limited precedent for doing so. The complete documents could give a more nuanced look at a candidate’s income, tax deductions and philanthropy than the state’s mandatory disclosures do.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The federal government has issued big fines against two Yakima County fruit companies for missing the annual deadline for filing forms reporting that their facilities store anhydrous ammonia. Stadelman Fruit LLC was fined $238,875 by the Environmental Protection Agency, and Hollingbery and Sons Inc. and the related Hollingbery CA and Cold Storage LLC were penalized a total of $118,200. The Capital Press reported the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act required companies that store hazardous chemicals to submit the forms by March 1 to state and local emergency planners, and the local fire department. Bud Hollingbery, president of the Hollingbery companies, said Friday his businesses have been sending in the information for years. In 2020, the employee who files the forms had a family emergency, and the forms weren’t submitted until May 12, he said. By then, according to EPA, the Hollingbery companies had committed 12 violations. Stadelman Fruit also was fined for missing the March 1, 2020, reporting deadline for its four cold-storage facilities in Zillah. Stadelman agreed to settle, but also did not admit to the allegations. Efforts to obtain comment from the company were unsuccessful.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMount Hope: A new West Virginia highway marker commemorates the Siltix Mine explosion that killed seven people. The marker was unveiled last week in Mount Hope on the 55th anniversary of the blast, the Herald-Dispatch reported. The explosion was caused by the ignition of built-up methane gas, according to the marker, which also noted that 39 miners were able to escape unharmed. The marker is sponsored by Mount Hope Heritage & Hope and the National Coal Heritage Area Authority, along with the city of Mount Hope, the West Virginia Archives and History and the state Division of Highways. More than 1,000 highway markers note significant locations across the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Milwaukee Common Council voted Tuesday to approve a $627,000 settlement with former Police Chief Alfonso Morales over his demotion last year. A federal lawsuit by Morales over his ouster would be dropped as part of the agreement. Morales has 21 days to sign off on the negotiated deal. The Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission, a citizen panel, unanimously voted to remove Morales as chief last August, claiming he failed to fulfill a list of directives. But Milwaukee County Judge Christopher Foley in December reversed the civilian commission’s decision to demote Morales to captain, which had prompted Morales to retire and sue. Foley at the time called the commission’s process “fundamentally flawed.” Under the agreement, the city and commission would not admit to any negligence or to having violated any contract or federal, state and local laws. The commission’s vote came days before an Aug. 1 deadline agreed to by both sides to resolve the matter.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Recently retired U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming died Monday at 77. Enzi had been hospitalized with a broken neck and ribs three days after a bicycle accident near Gillette on Friday. Enzi was stabilized before being flown to a hospital in Colorado. He remained unconscious and was unable to recover from his injuries, former spokesman Max D’Onofrio said. Police said they have seen no indication anyone else was nearby or involved in the accident. Enzi fell near his home about 8:30 p.m. Friday, about the time Gillette police received a report of a man lying unresponsive in a road near a bicycle. Enzi, a Republican, retired in January after four terms as senator. He previously was a state lawmaker and mayor of Gillette, where he owned a shoe store. Enzi is survived by his wife; two daughters, Amy and Emily; a son, Brad; and several grandchildren.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2018/02/08/environmentalists-head-court-effort-block-border-wall-construction/316767002/", "title": "Secure environment?

Congress used that law to allow the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to build border fencing without waiting for environmental or archaeological studies that are normally required.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club and other groups contend that authorization was limited to immediate fencing needs that Congress prescribed and ultimately completed. The government counters that the authority remains in effect whenever and wherever on the border the Homeland Security secretary determines it is necessary.\n\nMORE: How a border wall could drive the jaguar extinct\n\nCongress intended the Homeland Security waivers to apply to specific projects starting with a 14-mile fence between San Diego and Tijuana, Center for Biological Diversity attorney Brian Segee said. Congress mandated more with the 2006 Secure Fence Act and later amendments, to reach 654 miles roughly split between fencing and vehicle barriers.\n\n\"That fencing was completed long ago,\" Segee said.\n\nIf the administration continues waiving environmental laws indefinitely, he said, it will have effectively repealed those laws without congressional approval. That would violate the Constitution's separation of powers — a second claim environmentalists are making.\n\n\"Congressional intent doesn't matter for that (allegation),\" Segee said. \"Even if Congress intends to give away its lawmaking authority, it cannot under the Constitution.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice and attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment this week.

Universal Pictures currently has the top three films at the domestic box office with “F9,” “The Boss Baby: Family Business” and “The Forever Purge,” according to studio estimates Sunday. It’s the first time that’s happened for Universal since 1989, when the studio had “Sea of Love,” “Parenthood” and “Uncle Buck” topping the charts, and the first time for any studio since 2005.\n\nAs expected, the “Fast & Furious” sequel “F9” maintained the top spot in its second weekend in North American theaters. The film added an estimated $24 million over the weekend and is projected to take in $32.7 million by the end of Monday, bringing its domestic total to $125.8 million. Worldwide, “F9” will likely surpass the $500 million mark on Monday.\n\nIn second place, the animated “Boss Baby” sequel surpassed expectations opening with $17.3 million for the weekend and $23.1 million including Monday. “The Boss Baby: Family Business” features Alex Baldwin voicing the worldly toddler. And in third place, the latest Blumhouse venture, “The Forever Purge,” is expected to gross $12.8 million in ticket sales through Sunday and $15.9 million over the four-day weekend.\n\nAlthough the three films may share a studio name, they’re also all different genres with different audience bases: A PG-13 action pic, an R-rated horror and a PG-rated family film. Almost half of the audience for “The Boss Baby 2,” for example, was 12 and under, while 64% of the audience for “The Forever Purge” was in the coveted 18 to 34 range and also very ethnically diverse.\n\nWhile it’s a bit unconventional for a major studio to open two big films on the same weekend, Universal’s head of domestic distribution Jim Orr said they simply saw an opportunity and have historically had great successes on the Fourth of July weekend.\n\nLast week:'F9' roars into theaters with $70 million, smashing pandemic box-office record\n\n“This weekend is just a great glimpse of what we do constantly. which is provide theatrical audiences with a diverse slate of quality films,” Orr said. “The results speak for themselves.”\n\nThe varied slate, he said, is something the studio takes great pride in.\n\n“We have films for every single audience out there,” Orr added. “We have tremendous partners, with DreamWorks and Blumhouse, and we also have some of the biggest franchises in the industry with the Fast saga.”\n\nParamount’s “A Quiet Place Part II” landed in fourth with an estimated $4.2 million over the three-day weekend and a projected $5.6 million including Monday, bringing its total to $145.8 million in its sixth weekend. “The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard” took fifth with $3 million for the weekend.\n\nMore:‘Boss Baby 2’: Alec Baldwin talks family business, riding miracle ‘baby train’ with Hilaria\n\nAnd:Is 'The Purge' forever?

This feels like truly the first fully fledged summer weekend.”\n\nThe based-on-a-Twitter-thread film “Zola” also had a strong opening on 1,468 screens. The film about a road trip to Florida gone wrong has earned an estimated $2.4 million since Wednesday. According to studio A24, many of the New York and Los Angeles showings sold out this weekend.\n\n″‘Zola’ is disproving the notion that only blockbusters will bring people to the theaters,” Dergarabedian said.\n\nAnd despite also being available on Hulu, Questlove’s “Black Woodstock” documentary “Summer of Soul” earned $650,000 from 752 theaters. Although a somewhat modest number, Searchlight said it’s the best performing documentary of the year so far.\n\nThe successes are also notable for what they were up against outside of theaters. This was a weekend where there were quite a few at-home streaming options as well, with Amazon Prime Video’s Chris Pratt blockbuster “The Tomorrow War” among them.\n\nThe Universal films accounted for over 77% of the total projected grosses this weekend, which was the third best of the pandemic (behind last weekend’s “F9” opening and the first “Quiet Place 2” weekend), according to data from Comscore.\n\nBut the reign likely won’t continue for long.

The third installment in the \"Harry Potter\" spinoff opened to $43 million in North America, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nIt was enough to secure the film the top spot on the box-office charts, but it's also a low for the franchise. The first film had a $74.4 million debut in 2016 and the second, \"The Crimes of Grindelwald,\" opened to $62.2 million in 2018. \"The Secrets of Dumbledore,\" which opened in 4,208 locations in North America, carries a $200 million production price tag.\n\nIt's more common than not for sequels and threequels to come in lower than their predecessors, but \"Dumbledore\" also follows several franchise titles that defied that logic, including \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" \"Venom 2\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2.\"\n\nReview: Mads Mikkelsen brings Voldemort vibes to improved 'Fantastic Beasts' threequel\n\nCritics were mixed on \"Dumbledore,\" which had a 48% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. USA TODAY's Brian Truitt praised the recasting of Mads Mikkelsen as Gellert Grindelwald and the film's \"surprisingly good climax,\" noting the film \"does a decent job streamlining the busy storytelling in the third of a planned five-movie series that, to be honest, doesn’t have the clearest overarching narrative.\" AP's Jake Coyle wrote in his review that \"the purpose of these movies has never felt like much beyond keeping the Potter train running\" and that this iteration is \"a bit of a bore.\"\n\nAudiences, which were 56% female, were a little kinder, giving it a B+ on CinemaScore.\n\nThe eight Harry Potter films were responsible for over $7.7 billion in box office, while the first two \"Fantastic Beasts\" films made $1.5 billion total.\n\nThis installment stars Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Ezra Miller and Mikkelsen, who replaced Johnny Depp as Grindelwald.

The film has grossed $119.6 million to date.\n\n\"Father Stu\" opened in 2,705 locations on Wednesday.

The two holdovers topped the charts again according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nIn first place for the fifth weekend in a row was James Cameron's \"Avatar\" sequel, which added an estimated $31.1 million through Sunday. That total will likely balloon to $38.5 million by the end of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. As of Sunday, the film's domestic total now rests at $562.9 million (the 13th biggest of all time) and its global total is $1.89 billion. \"Avatar 2\" needs to pass $1.92 billion to trump \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" which is currently the sixth-highest grossing film of all time globally.\n\n“There were such huge expectations and a lot of naysayers that opening weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “But ‘Avatar,’ for a James Cameron movie, is moving at lightning speed up the domestic and global box office chart. I think he always knew this would be a $2 billion movie.\"\n\nSecond place went to Universal and Blumhouse's \"M3GAN\" which in its second weekend in theaters added $17.9 million through Sunday and an estimated $21.2 million including Monday.

Dergarabedian said that’s almost unheard of for a horror picture and shows “world-class staying power.”\n\nUniversal also claimed the third place spot with \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,\" which audiences continued to seek out in theaters even though it's currently available to rent at home. The family-friendly animated film added $13.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its domestic total to $110.3 million.\n\n\"A Man Called Otto,\" from Columbia Pictures, expanded to 3,802 theaters this weekend, adding $12.7 million through Sunday to take fourth place. Directed by Marc Forster, the adaptation of \"A Man Called Ove\" starring Tom Hanks is proving to be something of a rarity in the theatrical marketplace as an adult-targeted drama that is doing well.\n\nThe Gerard Butler action pic \"Plane,\" a Lionsgate acquisition for release in North America, rounded out the top five with a better-than-expected $10 million in its first three days. In the film, Butler plays a pilot whose crash landing on an island is only the first of his troubles. On the island, most of the passengers are taken hostage. \"Plane\" got better-than-average reviews with 75% positive from critics on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nSixth place went to the second major new offering this weekend, \"House Party,\" a reboot of Reginald Hudlin's 1990 hit that spawned several spinoffs. The film, which made $3.9 million through Sunday from 1,400 locations, was originally intended as a straight-to-HBO Max property but Warner Bros. pivoted to a theatrical release as a gesture to audiences and exhibitors hungry for new films.

It surpassed \"Frozen II's\" record for the largest animated film opening weekend.\n\nSo who takes the top spot of all time? Here’s what lifetime box office earnings have to say.\n\nWhat is the highest-grossing animated movie of all time?\n\n\"Frozen II\" is the highest-grossing animated movie with a lifetime worldwide earning of $1.45 billion. The $150 thousand-budget Disney film is the 2019 sequel to \"Frozen,\" which follows Princess Anna and her sister Queen Elsa, whose ice powers place their kingdom in perpetual winter. Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff and Josh Gad return in \"Frozen II\" to journey to an enchanted forest to discover the origin of Elsa’s magical powers.\n\nThere’s some debate as to whether \"Frozen II\" deserves the crown of highest-grossing animated film. Disney’s 2019 \"The Lion King\" remastered the original 1994 movie in hyper-realistic CGI. The film made $1.66 billion worldwide, well outpacing Frozen’s sequel.\n\nBut Disney classified the film as live-action, not animated, despite it being nominated for best animated feature at the 2019 Golden Globes. \"The Lion King\" includes one live shot in the film’s opening. Director Jon Favreau told SlashFilms he doesn’t consider it live-action or animated, saying \"to say it’s animated … is misleading.\"\n\nHaving a Studio Ghibli marathon?:Here's how many there are (in order)\n\nTop 10 highest-grossing animated movies\n\nHere are the highest-grossing animated movies of all time, according to IMDbPro’s Box Office Mojo:\n\nFrozen II (2019): $1.45 billion Frozen (2013): $1.28 billion Incredibles 2 (2018): $1.24 billion Minions (2015); $1.16 billion Toy Story 4 (2019): $1.073 billion Toy Story 3 (2010): $1.067 billion Despicable Me 3 (2017): $1.034 billion Finding Dory (2016): $1.029 billion Zootopia (2016): $1.02 billion Despicable Me 2 (2013): $971 million\n\nHigh-earning movies vary differently depending on what metrics you’re looking at. For example, Incredibles 2 is the highest-grossing animated film in the U.S. but its worldwide earnings are far less than the Frozen franchise films. Only about 33% of Frozen II’s total earnings were domestic.\n\nHere are the top animated movies ranked by their domestic box office earnings:\n\nIncredibles 2 (2018): $608 million Finding Dory (2016): $486 million Frozen II (2019): $477 million Shrek 2 (2004): $441 million Toy Story 4 (2019): $434 million Toy Story 3 (2010): $415 million Frozen (2013): $401 million Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022): $370 million The Secret Life of Pets (2016): $368 million Despicable Me 2 (2013): $368 million\n\n\"The Lion King\" (2019) totaled $543 million in domestic earnings.\n\nHighest grossing movie of all time:A list of box office record breakers\n\nJust Curious for more?

Yet, Netflix is still a media company that — thanks to its 221.6 million global subscribers — has the ability to capture the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nJust ask Kate Bush.\n\nThe English singer’s 1985 hit single, “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God),” has taken over the music charts — 37 years after its release. It’s currently No. 1 on Spotify’s Top Songs in the US, No. 5 on Billboard’s hot 100 and broke UK records after hitting No. 1 last weekend.\n\nAll because the song is being showcased in the latest season of “Stranger Things” — the streaming platform’s most popular franchise. Global streams of the song surged more than 8,700% on Spotify (SPOT) following the show’s May 27 season four premiere.\n\nThe fact that “Running Up That Hill” has become a sudden hit nearly four decades after its release represents more than just an old song catching fire on the charts. It’s a potent example of Netflix’s massive cultural power, even as the company is trying to turn itself around.\n\nRunning up the charts\n\nMax’s Song (Full Scene) | Kate Bush - Running Up That Hill | Stranger Things | Netflix\n\nOther songs have seen boosts to sales and streams thanks to being featured in prominent films and TV shows (it has happened for Queen a few times). But few tunes have been part a major plot point the way “Running Up That Hill” is in “Stranger Things 4.”\n\nThe latest season of the science fiction horror series, which takes place in 1986, not only makes the song a favorite of the character Max Mayfield, played by Sadie Sink, the tune is played during a pivotal scene and helps save her from an evil multidimensional force.\n\nA moment like that is a music supervisor’s dream because the scene becomes inextricable from the song, building a connection between content and consumer that’s “very rare,” said Serona Elton, director of the music industry program at the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music.\n\n“Having music just playing in the background is not going to have the same type of impact compared to having the music becoming a fundamental part of the scene,” Elton told CNN Business.\n\nBut none of this could have happened without Netflix’s ability to push the series to its millions of subscribers around the world. Other streaming platforms have millions of users too, but Netflix is still at the top of the hill. It also helps that “Strangers Things” is wildly popular.\n\n“Stranger Things 4 — Volume 1” debuted in May to record numbers, and has since amassed a total of 883 million hours viewed for the platform. That makes it Netflix’s most popular English-language TV show ever. It’s been No. 1 on Netflix’s English top 10 list all four weeks since it premiered.\n\nThe new season also has dominated social media since its debut, with more than 7.7 billion organic impressions across Facebook (FB), Instagram, YouTube, Twitter (TWTR) and TikTok, according to the streamer. That’s helped turn “Running Up That Hill” into a viral meme.\n\nBush recently thanked the Duffer Brothers, the show’s creators, for “Running Up That Hill’s” renewed popularity.\n\n“I’m overwhelmed by the scale of affection and support the song is receiving,” she wrote on her website. “It’s all happening really fast, as if it’s being driven along by a kind of elemental force.”\n\nUpside down, but not out\n\nKate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill,\" a song from 1985, has become a massive hit thanks to \"Stranger Things.\" Tina Rowden/Netflix\n\nNetflix’s world has been turned upside down this year after the company reported in April that it lost subscribers for the first time in more than a decade, news that shocked Wall Street and wiped out billions in Netflix market cap. The company’s stock, which was trading at $337 per share before that news, now stands at $178.\n\nIndustry experts have been wondering what steps Netflix might take to recover, spitballing ideas that include running ads, curbing password sharing and making nice with movie theaters.\n\nThe widespread influence of “Stranger Things” shows that Netflix (NFLX) may be down, but it’s not out.\n\nNetflix distribution is still remarkable in the streaming world, even as rivals are catching up, which allows the service to own pop culture with content such as “Bird Box,” “Squid Game” and “Stranger Things.” And as Netflix attempts to regain its footing after several disastrous quarters, it’s important to remember what it’s capable of.\n\nElton said that this type of exposure can help multiple constituencies.\n\nBush will likely see “increased revenues and maybe a new demographic of fans who might seek out other music of hers,” she said. As for Netflix, the song’s newfound popularity has made it “newsworthy” and “possibly could bring more people to the show itself.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the company released a new trailer for this season’s final two episodes, which will land July 1. The brief teaser highlights the show’s signature monsters and nostalgic excitement, as well as the kids of Hawkins, Indiana, bruised and battered but ready to fight on — almost like Netflix itself right now.\n\nThe song the trailer was set to? “Running Up That Hill.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/01/29/avatar-the-way-of-water-beats-force-awakens-box-office/11145743002/", "title": "'Avatar 2' bypasses 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' at box office", "text": "Lindsey Bahr\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n“Avatar: The Way of Water” claimed the No. 1 spot on the domestic box-office charts for a seventh weekend in a row with an additional $15.7 million, according to studio estimates on Sunday.\n\nIt was a quiet weekend overall, notable mostly for the Hindi language blockbuster “Pathaan” that broke into the top five and the post-Oscar nominations re-releases of films like “Everything Everywhere All At Once” and “The Fabelmans.”\n\nThe first-place North American run of \"Avatar 2\" has only been matched by the first “Avatar,” and, in the past 25 years, bested by “Titanic” (which stayed in first place for 15 weeks).

And Lukas Dhont’s Cannes-winning boyhood drama “Close” opened on four screens in New York and Los Angeles, earning $68,143.\n\nMany studios boasting best picture nominees also chose to capitalize on the buzz of Tuesday’s Oscar nominations with sizable re-releases. “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” which got a leading 11 nominations, came back to theaters in force playing on 1,400 screens where it earned another $1 million for $71 million domestically to date. Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans,” nominated for seven Oscars, also expanded to 1,962 screens in North America and took in an additional $760,000, bringing its domestic total to $16 million.

It crossed the $700 million mark in ticket sales, passing Marvel’s “Black Panther” to become the fifth highest-grossing film in North American history, and has made $1.4 billion worldwide since opening in May.\n\nIn another sign of “Maverick” staying power, the movie boasts a box office multiple of roughly 5.5, which means its current domestic haul is 5.5 times that of its opening weekend total. That’s unheard of in contemporary Hollywood, as most big films have a multiple of around 2.5.\n\nBut “Maverick” fans kept coming back to theaters throughout the summer, so much so that the film made at least one million dollars a day for 75 straight days.\n\nThat type of financial longevity not only speaks to the film’s quality — it garnered a 96% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes — but serves as an old-school success story at a time when theaters really needed one.\n\n“There are not enough adjectives to describe the importance of the box office performance of ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ to the industry, having come at a time when naysayers remained skeptical of the ability of the movie theater to draw audiences,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. “Truly a watershed event.”\n\nHollywood simply does not produce summer blockbusters like this anymore.\n\nWhile several recent movies have done quite well, like 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” and 2021’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” such releases are typically “front-loaded,” meaning they open to huge numbers on debut weekend then sputter out in the following week.\n\nA film that refuses to land\n\nDergarabedian isn’t exaggerating when he expresses how important “Maverick” has been to theater owners and Hollywood this summer: The film accounted for 13% of the overall domestic box office this year.\n\nAnd that doesn’t capture its symbolic value. “Maverick” comes at an inflection point for theaters, which are trying to return to normalcy after being devastated by the pandemic. Streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+ have also taken a stronger hold on consumers by featuring the type of big-budget productions that used to be exclusive to theaters.\n\n“Maverick,” however, demanded the biggest screens possible, and in doing so, reminded millions of viewers what it’s like to go to the movies after months — if not years — of staying away.\n\nTom Cruise and Paramount “went all in on the moviegoing experience,” Dergarabedian said. “That bet paid off big and, in the process, solidified Cruise’s position as perhaps the last true movie star while simultaneously proving that there is no substitute for the movie theater experience.”\n\nStill, the summer box office has been desolate the last few weeks, with films either being held up by production issues in Hollywood or heading directly to streaming. It’ll be a few months until two potential blockbuster sequels hit theaters, with “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” coming in November and “Avatar: The Way of Water” due in December.\n\nCan either of those films fly as high? Time will tell. But for now Hollywood and theaters are still enjoying “Maverick,” a movie that refuses to land.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}]}

Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.\n\nThey have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry, according to IRI.\n\nAs prices surge, store brands – also known as private labels, white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.\n\nBut the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.\n\nRetailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers, likewise, have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.\n\nMany leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.\n\nTrader Joe's first private brand product in the 1970s was granola. As the grocer grew, it switched to mainly its own brands. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAlthough store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands, manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit, some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.\n\nOther brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers, hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.\n\n“Most manufacturers aren’t open about it,” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.”\n\nBut there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers, produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries, Costco (COST)executives have said.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific, the maker of Brawny and Dixie, also produces store brands. So does Henkel (HENKY), the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.\n\nEight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore\n\nStore labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.\n\nMacy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills, according to Christopher Durham, the president of the Velocity Institute, a trade association for private brands.\n\nMontgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers, while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice, Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee, one of the most famous private labels of the period.\n\nEight O'Clock Coffee sold at The Great Atlantic And Pacific Tea Company (A&P) in 1949. Joe Scherschel/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock\n\nYet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears, Roebuck.\n\nIn 1925, Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later, Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench, according to Durham. Its Kenmore line, which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances, became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.\n\nThese private labels were the exception, however.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, national brands such as Jell-O, H.J. Heinz, Campbell Soup (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.\n\nMost customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands, not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed, which gave manufacturers immense leverage.\n\nAdditionally, many store brands were also considered dull, cheap knockoffs of national brands.\n\nThe low point of private label came during the 1970s, Durham said, when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer, soap, cola, beans and other staples.\n\nShopper loyalty\n\nRetailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons, including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.\n\nPrivate brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising, distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.\n\nGreat Value is Walmart's largest store brand. John Gress/Reuters\n\nIn the mid-20th century, many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades, the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now, stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not.\n\n“Forty years ago, Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now, Walmart is much bigger than P&G,” said Steenkamp, the marketing professor.\n\nToday, stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.\n\nStores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty, said Krishnakumar Davey, the president of client engagement at IRI.\n\nCostco (COST), for example, will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.\n\nCostco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products, but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one, company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nCostco generates nearly one-third of its sales from its Kirkland Signature label. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nRetailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement, while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.\n\nThe US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.\n\nAmazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.\n\nMost stores start small with their own brands. Grocers, for example, will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta, flour, sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.\n\n“You don’t start with the most difficult things,” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success, then they enter new categories.”\n\nHow to find out who makes store brands\n\nSo how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?\n\nProduct recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.\n\nLast year, for example, Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables, including private brands for Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B.\n\nJ.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year, as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle, Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.\n\nThen there are the dedicated private label manufacturers, such as Treehouse Foods (THS), which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets, big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year, for example, came from Walmart (WMT).\n\nTarget has dozens of its own brands, such as Cat & Jack, Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nJames Walser, who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009, said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.\n\nSome large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger, for example, makes about 30% of its own private products.\n\nPerhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the size of the US grocery industry.

But after seven months of rapidly rising interest rates, the central bank has hardly made a dent.\n\nThursday’s look at the September consumer price data shows we’re not much better off now than we were in March, when the Fed began its aggressive monetary tightening. Back then, overall consumer prices were up 8.5% year over year. Now, they’re up 8.2%.\n\nCore prices, which exclude volatile food and energy categories and are widely seen as a more reliable barometer of underlying inflation, hit 6.6% annually in September — their highest since 1982.\n\n“This inflation report today was an unmitigated disaster,” wrote Christopher S. Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds, a financial markets research company. “It shows whatever Fed officials are doing, it is just not working.”\n\nThe Fed has doubled down on its plans to wring inflation from the US economy by any means necessary, deploying massive interest rate hikes in the hopes of damping demand for goods and services.\n\nYet despite raising rates at an unprecedented speed, there’s little sign of prices easing up. Still, the Fed is determined to stay on its path, wagering that the US’s strong labor market can tolerate the stress of higher borrowing costs.\n\n“The Fed will see this as a license to stay aggressive,” wrote Jan Szilagyi, CEO of Toggle AI, an investment research firm.\n\nThursday’s hotter-than-expected inflation report is the last major economic snapshot Fed policymakers will take in before their next meeting at the start of November, and all but guarantees another 0.75% rate hike. Investors are now pricing in a 97% chance of a fourth-straight increase of three-quarters of a percentage point.\n\n‘Some pain’\n\nThe Federal Reserve is leaning on the most powerful weapon in its arsenal to ensure price stability: interest rates.\n\nIt’s a sledgehammer approach to solving a delicate economic puzzle.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell recently acknowledged that the broad impact of higher borrowing costs will bring “some pain to households and businesses” — a euphemistic nod to rising unemployment and a possible recession.\n\nInflicting pain now rather than letting inflation seep into the consumer psyche has become the Fed’s mantra. In minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday, Fed officials emphasized that “the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action.”\n\nIn other words, the Fed would rather crash the US economy into a recession (and potentially drag much of the global economy down with it) than wind up in an inflationary tailspin. But in the meantime, that means consumers are bearing the pain of simultaneously high prices and high borrowing costs.\n\nSoon, that pain could be compounded by job losses — or “labor market softening,” in Fed parlance.\n\nThe Fed believes the strong labor market has contributed to inflation, along with a bunch of factors far outside the central bank’s jurisdiction, such as supply chain disruptions, the war in Ukraine, and corporations that are keeping prices elevated even as their costs go down.\n\nAnd while the ideal outcome would result in minimal job losses and lower prices — the elusive “soft landing” — the likelihood of that scenario is now practically non-existent.\n\n“Rather than walking a tightrope between a ‘soft landing’ and recession…the Fed now faces the potential of killing off the economy’s job creation impetus beyond a simple rebalancing of the labor market in the name of taming inflation,” said PNC senior economist Kurt Rankin.\n\nIs the Fed losing the fight against inflation?\n\nSo far, it’s certainly not winning. But the effects of rate hikes can take months to be felt in the real economy.\n\nOr, as Fed vice chair Lael Brainard put it in a speech this week: “The moderation in demand due to monetary policy tightening is only partly realized so far.”\n\nBrainard noted that the “transmission of tighter policy” — read: pain — is most evident in the housing market. Mortgage rates, which are heavily influenced by the Fed’s key rate, have more than doubled this year.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.9% this week — the highest it’s been in 20 years. A year ago, that rate was just over 3%.\n\n“We continue to see a tale of two economies in the data,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “Strong job and wage growth are keeping consumers’ balance sheets positive, while lingering inflation, recession fears and housing affordability are driving housing demand down precipitously.”\n\nUnequal pain\n\nThursday’s disastrous CPI report cements for economists and investors a reality that millions of Americans already feel deeply as they spend more of their income on basic necessities like food and shelter. More and more people are coping with inflation by leaning on credit cards, which only get harder to pay off as interest rates climb.\n\nThe so-called “food at home index,” a proxy for grocery store prices, was up 13% last month from a year earlier. Shelter, which accounts for a third of the CPI reading, rose 6.6%, the most in more than 30 years.\n\nAnd even though mortgage rates are rising, the costs of housing are “simply brutal,” wrote RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas. “Whatever relief in core inflation that is in the pipeline… it is not flowing through to an easing in rents.”\n\nThe Fed’s rate hikes may have won the battle with core commodities prices softening, wrote Rupkey of Fwdbonds. But the Fed is “losing the war” when it comes to price hikes for the services sector.\n\n“Today’s red hot inflation report brings the economy closer than ever to recession next year,” he said.\n\nUltimately, some say the problem of pandemic-era inflation is just too complex to be fixed with the Fed’s blunt tools.\n\n“Supply chain bottlenecks, a volatile global energy market, and rampant corporate profiteering can’t be solved by additional rate hikes,” said Rakeen Mabud, chief economist of the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative policy group. “It’s time for Chair Powell and the Fed to step aside and for Congress to step in.”", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/business/railroads-say-strike-can-be-avoided/index.html", "title": "Freight railroads still believe strike can be avoided | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe trade group representing the nation’s freight railroads is confident that a strike by more than 100,000 union members can be avoided, even after rank-and-file members rejected the tentative labor deals reached earlier this fall.\n\nSo far three rail unions have rejected the proposed agreements and are set to go on strike as soon as Dec. 4. The two largest rail unions, which represent the conductors and engineers, are due to announce the results of their ratification votes on Monday. The nations’ major freight railroads negotiate together on industrywide labor contracts with each of the 12 railroad unions.\n\nIf even one union goes on strike, the other 11 would honor the picket lines and spark an industrywide strike that would shut down an estimated 30% of the nation’s freight movements, causing widespread disruptions to the nation’s supply chain and economy.\n\nBut one of the primary voices for the management side of the industry, Ian Jefferies, CEO of industry the Association of American Railroads, the industry trade group, says he is confident the railroads can still reach new deals with any union whose members rejected previous proposals, and that the new contracts would be acceptable to membership.\n\nHe points out that the Machinists’ union, one of the unions whose members initially rejected the deal, came back and ratified a slightly revised agreement, albeit with only 52% of members voting in favor.\n\n“There’s absolutely opportunities if a ratification fails the first time to sit down and come to additional agreements and put that out and get the [tentative agreement] ratified,” Jefferies told CNN in an indepth interview Thursday. He said the “best outcome” for the industry is to reach agreements that can win ratification votes across all 12 unions.\n\nBut he added that if agreements can’t be reached, the industry believes it can get quick, bi-partisan action by Congress to block or end a strike.\n\n“I don’t think it’s anyone’s goal to get Congress involved, but Congress has shown a willingness historically to intervene if necessary,” said Jefferies. He pointed to comment by Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, who “made clear on CNN less than two weeks ago that Congress would need to intervene in his opinion if voluntary agreements weren’t reached.”\n\nOne of the biggest points of contention now is sick pay. While management said provisions in existing contracts allow workers to take time off when they are sick, the unions say there are too many restrictions and penalties for workers to take sick days that many other workers take for granted. And they often aren’t paid when they can’t come to work due to illness or injury.\n\nThe unions have argued they should be allowed to strike without Congressional action to block a walk-out or order them back to work. The best way to avoid a strike, they say, is to have the railroads agree to union demands for paid sick days.\n\n“Congress should not have to intervene. The railroads should provide paid sick leave to its employees,” said the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employee Division in a statement earlier this month. That union, which represents track maintenance workers, is one of three unions whose members rejected the previous labor deals.\n\n“They have the money to do it, and it literally would cost them a penny of every dollar of record profits to provide it,” said BMWED. “It’s only 2% of what CSX, NS and UP spent so far this year in stock buybacks. It’s literally nothing to them, yet they refuse to provide it.”\n\nBut Jefferies said the railroads are only willing to reach new deals with the unions which are within framework of recommendations made by a three-member panel, known as a Presidential Emergency Board or PEB, appointed by President Joe Biden in July to hear from the two sides and come up with a compromise agreement.\n\n“Some of the unions did ask for additional sick days. And the PEB report very clearly and articulately laid out its analysis of their request and determined … their request was not appropriate and it was explicitly rejected,” Jefferies said.\n\nDespite railroad management so far rejecting union demands for paid sick days, he said is possible to reach a deal that will satisfy both union membership and management. While he wouldn’t discuss the details of proposals that might be acceptable to both sides, he said that a deal that is within the “framework” of the PEB recommendation “can take a lot of different faces.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story's headline incorrectly described the Association of American Railroads.

Starbucks said an NLRB whistle-blower alerted the company to the alleged misconduct.\n\nStarbucks has been attempting to fend off a growing unionization movement for several months now. As of Friday, the NLRB has certified votes to unionize at 199 Starbucks stores, and votes against unionizing at 36. So far, there have been election petitions at 314 stores overall.\n\nStarbucks charges that NLRB employees allowed some pro-union workers to vote in person, although it had been decided that ballots would be submitted via mail. Some workers missed the deadline to vote by mail but weren’t offered the option to vote in person, Starbucks alleged, encouraging a pro-union result.\n\nThe coffee chain also alleged that the NLRB workers gave the union information like when and how many ballots it received in the mail.\n\nAn employee in Jacksonville, Florida shows off buttons in support of unionizing Starbucks. Bob Self/Florida Times-Union/USA Today Network/Imagn\n\n“In light of these types of misconduct by NLRB personnel, we request the Board immediately suspend all Starbucks mail-ballot elections nationwide … until there has been a thorough investigation,” Starbucks said in the letter.\n\nStarbucks is asking that the results of an investigation by the board into the alleged misconduct be made public, and that “safeguards to prevent future misconduct” are put in place before moving forward. In the future, it wants elections to be held in person.\n\n“The NLRB does not comment on open cases,” said Kayla Blado, director and press secretary at the NLRB’s office of congressional and public affairs, in a statement on the letter.\n\n“The agency has well-established processes to raise challenges regarding the handling of both election matters and unfair labor practice cases,” she said. “Those challenges should be raised in filings specific to the particular matters in question.” Blado noted that any questions raised in these channels would be “carefully and objectively” considered by the board.\n\nStores voting to unionize make up just a fraction of the roughly 9,000 company-operated Starbucks (SBUX) stores in the United States. However, Starbucks (SBUX) has been taking the efforts seriously.\n\nStarbucks has made clear that it wants a direct line of communication with employees and that a union would get in the way. It has said that it can’t guarantee that workers in a union will have access to certain benefits offered to non-union employees.

The board said Friday that it is currently processing 284 unfair labor practice cases against Starbucks, which aren’t all necessarily related to election petitions.\n\nIn the letter, Starbucks noted that “the NLRB General Counsel and other Board personnel have repeatedly stated that Starbucks has committed more than one hundred ‘unfair labor practice’ violations,” but that “these statements are contradicted by the fact that the Board to date has not made any finding regarding the merits of any Starbucks violation.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/ford/2019/10/03/lincoln-aviator-suv-recall-chicago-explorer-police-interceptor/3830654002/", "title": "Lincoln Aviator owners frustrated by problems with $70K+ luxury SUV", "text": "With just 1,899 Lincoln Aviator luxury SUVs sold since their debut in August, some owners report problems ranging from the emergency brake unexpectedly taking hold while they are driving to passenger-assist alarms going off randomly and a dashboard screen that scrambles information.\n\n“When you get in, the speedometer and tachometer kind of goes berserk,” said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. “While driving, all of a sudden the digital gauge cluster seems to be having huge problems.

One customer canceled an Aviator order, concerned after reading about owner experiences on social media sites.\n\nMany of the issues appear to be linked to software, which \"now controls more and more of the systems on today's vehicles,” said Consumer Reports' Fisher, who has spent two decades reviewing products. \"Sometimes there are bugs that aren't resolved in development. Manufacturers can't rely on consumers to find these bugs as some can compromise safety.”\n\nWhile new vehicles are increasingly high tech and complicated, Fisher added, “Consumers don't expect to have problems when they purchase a new car, and the majority of consumers won't see any.”\n\nBugs, black screen\n\nA Facebook page for Aviator owners talks of challenges and offers encouragement.\n\n“The transmission slipped into neutral when we were coasting up to a red light.

He told the Free Press he has no official tie to Ford other than driving press cars to do freelance auto reviews.\n\nHe told the Free Press his Aviator steering wheel was off-center, a speaker grille on the ceiling had a clip that failed to snap into place and “it looked as if the windshield was replaced at the factory after production as the rain sensor and the windshield camera system did not work properly, which controlled other (features) on the car like the auto-high beams, lane-keep assist and road preview feature.”\n\nHe wrote, “Other than that, it has been a good vehicle thus far with about 1,200 miles on it.

Winter is coming and I want a reliable car, especially if I’m going to drive three hours each way every week for business,” she said. “The majority of cars in our family have been Fords – Tauruses, Flexes, Edge, Explorer.”\n\nWhile her dealer tried to help and has serviced her car, it eventually referred her to Lincoln corporate. Spencer said she was irritated that the company offered her a break on car payments or an extended warranty.\n\n“I start backing out of the driveway and there’s water dripping on my kids’ heads. I mean, the vehicle hadn’t been at my house 24 hours. I call the sales guy and say, ‘Bill, what the hell?’ I’m like, OK, I work in manufacturing, stuff happens. But a week goes by and I have a colleague in the passenger seat and the seat belt doesn’t work. And I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ My colleague took Uber home.”\n\nLincoln told Spencer the seat belt problem was serious and to get the vehicle back for repair. Later, when she took the kids to a pumpkin patch, “the car starts acting a little goofy. The parking brake comes on while driving. The lights are going on, then the transmission light. It says, ‘major transmission fault, you need to call.’ Then this alarm goes off. When I call the dealer, they will take the car but I needed to wait as they had no loaner cars, so I wait.”\n\nThe repair manager at Highland Park Lincoln Ford did not return messages left on his voicemail by the Free Press.\n\n“I call the dealer and say, ‘Look, this is going on.' I’m going out of town ... and I’m like, 'Look, you guys need to fix this. I don’t want this car back until you’ve done every possible thing. I’m tired of being the guinea pig,'\" Spencer said. \"I said, ‘Can I drive the car?’ They say, ‘Don’t go on any major road trips.’ So I go to the grocery store by myself. Crash assist triggers, sirens go off, all these sirens. It's scary. I am afraid of what will happen and it happens in a split second. Warning lights go off, brakes go on. I was like, oh my gosh, and I pulled over.”\n\nShe emphasized, “All this is happening within 36 hours. They pick up the car and take it and try to work on it.” For weeks, the car was in the shop to address software and other issues, she said.\n\nWhile in the shop and after scrolling Aviator owner pages on social media, Spencer called her salesman to express her frustration again. He referred her case to Lincoln corporate. A Lincoln concierge representative tried reaching Spencer while she was in Switzerland, and Spencer couldn’t call back on an 800 number. Nearly a week after she returned, the car was ready.\n\n'I can't drive it ...'\n\n“I said, ‘Lou, I've just got to know, am I done?’ Have I gone through every single problem?” Spencer asked her dealer's technician. “He said, ‘We can’t guarantee that ... I said, ‘It’s a $70,000 car and a month and a half old and you can’t guarantee it? What do I do? I can’t drive it in the middle of winter and have it malfunction.\"\n\nWhen \"Kate\" from Lincoln concierge called, she asked if Spencer loved her amazing new SUV. And Spencer was just astonished.\n\n“I’m like, look, this doesn’t work for me,” Spencer said. “I don’t want to be on the side of the road with my kids and my car has a big problem. I don’t know that I can trust my vehicle. To me, it’s not about money. It’s about security and reliability. I’m in a newly built Lincoln and I should have peace of mind.”\n\nSo Spencer is planning to talk again with Lincoln about what can be done.\n\nFor now, Fisher has a bit of advice.\n\n“Clearly it’s better to figure out problems before vehicles go to the public,” he said. “Quick recalls mean fewer vehicles to fix later. But whatever you buy, do not be the first one on your block to own one.”\n\nWhy? He said all new cars can have bugs but Ford is known for introducing a whole bunch of new technology all at once, so if things go wrong the issues cascade. Toyota, for example, eases new features into products over time. “For Ford and Lincoln, these are complete redesigns, big large changes. And Ford tends to struggle on new technology in ways that Toyota and others do not. When you put a lot of new things into a vehicle all at once, it’s a recipe for problems.”\n\nConsumer Reports, with a database of more than half a million consumer vehicles, tests and monitors more vehicles than any other entity. Its 2017 Lincoln Continental purchased for $57,761 overheated on the way back from the dealership in October 2016.\n\nLincoln officials are optimistic about the potential for Aviator.\n\nMichael Sprague, Lincoln marketing director, said about 50% of first-month Aviator sales — August — were “conquests” of owners who had owned other luxury SUVs.\n\nIn fact, Spencer switched from driving a BMW to getting an Aviator, because she wanted an American luxury vehicle, she said.\n\nMore:Ford recalls F-150, Explorer, Expedition for seats may detach in crash\n\nMore:Ford recall: 2020 Explorer, Lincoln Aviator could roll because of crucial missing part\n\n“Aviators are just beginning to arrive in dealer showrooms. We will always do what is right to ensure we provide our customers a top quality vehicle and a great luxury experience with Lincoln,” Kozleski said. “We recognize the excitement of purchasing a new vehicle and the inconvenience if a client needs to bring it back, which is why we will pick up vehicles from clients ... and provide them with a Lincoln loaner.”\n\n'As long as it takes'\n\n“It is a longstanding process at the company to make updates to pre-production models based on all-new platforms before they are shipped to dealers,\" Kozleski explained. \"If a customer has a quality concern with their vehicle, they should contact their dealer or Lincoln concierge. Our dealers know their customers best and are working to handle any concern as a luxury customer would expect.”\n\nLincoln has some Aviators “undergoing additional quality inspections at Flat Rock,” Kozleski confirmed. “There are some Explorers that were built earlier in the process that are undergoing additional quality inspections in Flat Rock. We are shipping vehicles to dealers as we complete our quality inspection process.”\n\nFord plans to ramp up its operations in Chicago while continuing to perform quality inspections in Flat Rock “as long as it takes,” Kozleski said.\n\nShe was not aware of specific experiences described by Spencer or other customers in official online public Aviator forums.\n\nKozleski encouraged the Free Press to interview a happy Aviator owners.\n\nDriving to Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nRobert Rood, 72, of Canton is a retired auto parts sales manager who paid $58,000 for his Aviator and took delivery in early August.\n\n\"I love it. I've had no problems,\" he said. \"I’ve got 9,300 miles on my vehicle. I just got back from a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert in Orange Beach, Alabama.\"\n\nBob Ventrone, 64, a financial consultant from Jacksonville, Florida, said he took delivery of his $79,000 Aviator on Sept. 9. \"I have 1,000 miles and no issues at all. The car is great.\"\n\nKozleski said Lincoln is committed to its customers and the team poured its heart into the Aviator.\n\n\"Lincoln has made really great strides in quality over the years and in fact, this year Lincoln was among the top 5 brands in J.D. Power Initial Quality Study,\" she said.\n\nLate Wednesday, Spencer was trying to stay positive.\n\n\"I am concerned and apprehensive,\" she said. \"I don’t know if the problems are finished or if I am going to be driving in the middle of I-94 and my new car breaks down.\"\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard at 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

Furthermore, Valisure shows data from the analysis of benzene by directly sampling contaminated air after spraying dry shampoo products, which suggests potential for short- and long-term inhalation exposure to high levels of benzene. The presence of this known human carcinogen in dry shampoo products that are regularly used indoors and in large volumes makes this finding especially troubling,” David Light, Valisure’s chief executive officer, and Qian Wu, Valisure’s head of global analytics, wrote in the FDA Citizen Petition.\n\nThe petition urges the FDA to “expeditiously request recalls” on the affected batches of products containing benzene and better define limits for benzene contamination in other products.\n\nThe FDA normally takes 180 days to respond to a citizen petition.\n\nIn summary, three lots of dry shampoo products from one brand contained spray with more than 100 ppm of benzene, according to the petition, and some samples tested by Valisure showed more than 10 times the FDA drug limit. The petition also mentions that Valisure has detected benzene in other commonly used products as well, including certain hand sanitizers and sunscreens.\n\nCNN contacted the brands listed in the petition and reached out to the FDA for comment but did not immediately hear back from all of them.\n\nIn a statement, Church & Dwight, the maker of Batiste hair products said: “Consumer safety is of the utmost importance. When propellants had been reported to be the source of benzene in competitors’ recalled products, we contacted our propellant suppliers and confirmed with those suppliers that the propellants used in our Batiste products do not contain benzene. We will evaluate the report at the center of the recent claims.”\n\nHaircare brand Not Your Mother’s, listed in the petition, told CNN in a statement, “The safety of our consumers is our highest priority. We are concerned about a recently published report linked to the dry shampoo category, raising questions about levels of benzene detected in propellent used in aerosol products manufactured on or before Fall 2021. This report is inconsistent with the data provided by our suppliers and the rigorous ongoing testing to ensure the safety and integrity of our products. These tests show no traceable amounts of benzene. We are committed to continuous evaluation to ensure the utmost safety and quality of all our products.”\n\nValisure’s Light said in a new release, “The detection of high levels of benzene in dry shampoos should be cause for significant concern since these products are likely used indoors, where benzene may linger and be inhaled for prolonged periods of time.\n\n“These and other issues identified by Valisure, including the detection of benzene in body spray, hand sanitizer, and sunscreen products, strongly underscore the importance of independent testing and its need to be better integrated into an increasingly complex and vulnerable global supply chain.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLast year, several deodorants and sunscreen products were recalled due to detections of benzene.\n\nBenzene is formed from both natural and man-made processes. “Natural sources of benzene include volcanoes and forest fires.

It’s General Mills.\n\nThe company has been struggling to meet demand for its refrigerated pizza and dough in the United States.\n\nTypically, General Mills likes to be able to meet customer demand 98% to 99% of the time. In other words, when shoppers go hunting for Totino’s or other brands, General Mills wants them to find what they are looking for — almost without fail.\n\nBut in the three months ended February 27, service levels for refrigerated pizza and dough dropped to the 70% range, the company noted in a presentation of its quarterly financial results Wednesday.\n\nCFO Kofi Bruce cited “acute supply shortages” that affected those categories. The situation started to improve in the last few weeks of the quarter, according to the company, but supplies are still below normal levels. General Mills expects to achieve service levels in the 80% range in the current quarter.\n\nGeneral Mills has been struggling to meet demand for its refrigerated pizza and dough. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe food giant has had a tough time meeting demand for several of its products through the pandemic, as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages curtailed normal operations.\n\nMeeting customer demand has “been a big challenge for this year,” said Jon Nudi, president of North America retail at General Mills, during an analyst call Wednesday.\n\nThe company had been facing bottlenecks within its distribution centers, but that situation has improved, Nudi said. “We’ve done a nice job staffing distribution centers up and feel good about our ability to move product now.”\n\nMore recently, the problem has been sourcing ingredients.\n\nWhen it comes to refrigerated pizza and dough, “the biggest issue we’re seeing is really raw material disruptions, ingredients coming into our plants to run our products,” Nudi explained. “Things like fats and oils and starch and packaging.”\n\nOne way that General Mills can deal with ingredient shortages is by tweaking recipes or sourcing from different suppliers. But that could require the company to change a production line or amend its labels, adding complexity to the process.\n\nThe company has been able to improve its service levels somewhat, Nudi said, but they “are still quite a bit below historical levels. We’ve got a lot more work to do, and we’ll stay very focused on that.”\n\nGeneral Mills also noted that its commodity costs are rising. Wheat prices have soared this year and high inflation has hit products across sectors.\n\n“Not only have supply chain disruptions been a challenge, but we are also facing historic levels of input cost inflation,” CEO Jeff Harmening said in prepared remarks Wednesday. “Our market basket … has been at a multi-decade high in recent months.”\n\nHarmening noted, however, that the company has not had to change its outlook for the year, and still expects its costs to be inflated by about 8% or 9%.\n\nHe noted that General Mills is “covered on certain key commodities at competitive prices” through the rest of the year, making the company less prone to extreme volatility.\n\nGeneral Mills has been raising prices to help offset inflation, passing those costs onto consumers.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/24/business/ivory-soap-curious-consumer/index.html", "title": "An iconic soap with two weird claims to fame -- \"It floats\" and it's \"99+ ...", "text": "New York CNNBusiness —\n\nWalk into a Walmart, Target, any drugstore chain in your neighborhood or a corner bodega for New York City dwellers, and chances are you’ll find an Ivory Soap bar, or a pack of 10 bars for under $5, sitting on the shelf.\n\nThis iconic cake of soap, invented almost 150 years ago, has become a part of Americana largely by advertising its two strange merits: “It Floats” and it’s “99+44⁄100% Pure.”\n\nThe original product is a no-frills, plain white, mild-scented bar soap with the name “IVORY” etched into it in script. Impressively, it has stayed exactly that way for 143 years – barring the addition of an Aloe scented variety, and is also still around.\n\nIvory soap’s longevity flies in the face of a notoriously fickle market for personal beauty products where new trends can appear and disappear in a flash.\n\nProcter & Gamble first sold Ivory Soap in 1879 with the taglines \"It Floats\" and it's \"99 and 44/100 Percent Pure.\" 369828992/Rusty - stock.adobe.com\n\nSo why has Ivory Soap stood the test of time? One theory is because of its clever advertising and branding. Ivory Soap packaging famously, and relentlessly, touts the attributes of purity and buoyancy.\n\n“That’s brilliant execution,” said David Placek, founder of Lexicon Branding, a branding expert who has helped name such popular consumer products as “Swiffer,” “Blackberry” and “Dasani.”\n\n“Just think about it. How many other soaps can you think of that tout an attribute that’s analogous to “It Floats?” said Placek. “I can’t think of another. It makes you remember it because it also makes you think about other soaps that don’t float.”\n\nBecause Ivory Soap’s taglines have remained consistent and endured for over a century and through generations of consumers, they’ve seeped into the subconscious, said Placek.\n\n“Even if you’ve not used Ivory Soap you know about it and you remember it,” he said.\n\nThe need for floating soap\n\nIvory Soap is the brainchild of Procter & Gamble. Not the huge multinational consumer brands conglomerate that it is today, but of two individuals – Harley Procter (son of P&G cofounder William Procter) and James N. Gamble (son of P&G’s other cofounder, James Gamble).\n\nIt was in the late 19th century, a period when river bathing was prevalent among large swaths of the population.

(Photo by Fotosearch/Getty Images) Fotosearch/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nAn AdAge article about Ivory Soap’s invention explained how Gamble at the time was trying to create a new type of gently formulated soap. The R&D process inadvertently created a batch of soap that was found to float because air bubbles got trapped inside.\n\nGamble, according to P&G’s website, recognized the “floating soap” could revolutionize the washing experience in more ways than one.\n\nHe initially thought the floating soap could be used both for laundry and for washing up. Over time, the soap bar primarily became a bath soap.\n\nNaming the soap was another story.\n\nAccording to P&G legend, Harley Procter came upon the word “ivory” while attending church and thought it perfectly fit the new soap’s look and feel and both men adopted “Ivory Soap” as the name.\n\nAdvertisement for Ivory Soap by the Procter and Gamble Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, 1897. (Photo by Jay Paull/Getty Images) Jay Paull/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nP&G launched the soap in 1879 hyping it not only as a soap bar that floated but for its purity.\n\nThat claim, according to the company, hinged on a study of the soap by chemistry professors at the request of the inventors. One study showed the soap had only a small amount of impurities – 56/100 of a percent – of non-soap material in it.\n\nSo they decided to play that up in Ivory Soap’s advertising, rounding it up to create its second iconic tagline – “99 and 44-100% pure.”\n\nP&G maintains that while it continues to innovate its Ivory Soap, the product is still made with a simple formula free of dyes and parabens meant to gently cleanse the skin.\n\nIt has, however, extended the brand to other products.\n\nIvory Soap Advertising Poster (Photo by Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images) Library of Congress/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nIn the 1950s, according to the AdAge article, P&G launched a light-duty dishwashing detergent under the Ivory brand, followed by liquid hand soaps in the 1980s and moisturizing body washes in 1996 with the introduction of Ivory Moisture Care. Today, the Ivory personal care portfolio also includes baby care products, hair and body washes and deodorant.\n\nIvory soap has become so iconic that in 2001 P&G donated a collection of its Ivory Soap artifacts to the Smithsonian Institution, including its earliest advertising and a bar of unused soap from the 1940s.\n\nLexicon Branding’s Placek said Ivory Soap is a product way ahead of its time. “It was ‘pure’ before pure, clean and simple products became as popular as they are with consumers today,” he said.", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}]}

Those included a lack of existing infrastructure and the region’s intense heat in the summer, when World Cup tournaments are traditionally held.\n\nIndeed, the reports even went as far as to label Qatar’s bid as “high risk,” but the country nevertheless triumphed with 14 votes to USA’s eight in the final round of balloting.\n\nAt the time, Qatar promised to make the world “proud of the Middle East” as the first country from the region to host the tournament, while then-FIFA President Sepp Blatter welcomed the prospect of football’s showpiece event going to “new lands.”\n\n“I’m a happy president when we speak of the development of football,” he said.\n\nTwelve years later, Blatter is more critical.\n\nEarlier this month, he told Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger: “Qatar is a mistake … the choice was bad.\n\n“It is too small of a country. Football and the World Cup are too big for it.”\n\nBlatter said FIFA amended the criteria it used to select host countries in 2012 in light of concerns over the working conditions at tournament-related construction sites in Qatar.\n\n“Since then, social considerations and human rights are taken into account,” he said.\n\nWith a population of three million, smaller than that of Connecticut, Qatar has invested billions in its football infrastructure in preparation for the 2022 tournament.\n\nBut questions about just how Qatar won the right to stage the World Cup continue.\n\nAs recently as March 2020, the US Department of Justice alleged that bribes were accepted by top officials as part of the voting process to elect Russia and Qatar as the tournament host for the 2018 and 2022 events – claims Russian officials denied and Qatari officials called “false” in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe DOJ has been investigating allegations of corruption in international soccer, including FIFA, for years. To date, there have been more than two dozen convictions and some cases are ongoing.\n\nA statement from FIFA in April 2020 said it “supports all investigations into alleged acts of criminal wrongdoing regarding either domestic or international football competitions and will continue to provide full cooperation to law enforcement officials investigating such matters.\n\n“FIFA is closely following these investigations and all related developments in the legal processes ongoing in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\n“It is important to point out that FIFA has itself been accorded victim status in the US criminal proceedings and senior FIFA officials are in regular contact with the US Department of Justice.”\n\nFIFA was handed victim status by US prosecutors as they viewed football’s world governing body as having been almost hijacked by a number of corrupt individuals.\n\nHuman rights criticism\n\nQatar’s human rights record has also been in the spotlight ahead of the World Cup, particularly around the welfare of migrant workers.\n\nGiven the minimal infrastructure Qatar had in place at the time it was awarded the hosting rights to the World Cup, seven new stadiums have been erected ahead of the tournament, as well as new hotels and expansions to the country’s airport, rail networks and highways.\n\nThat has placed a reliance on Qatar’s migrant workers, who account for 90% of the total workforce, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSince 2010, many migrant workers have respectively faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation, and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback FIFA president launches explosive tirade against Western critics of Qatar 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nHowever, Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) said the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” with “significant improvements” made around workers’ rights.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino also told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies that he has seen “great evolution” in Qatar’s labor reforms, and the International Labor Organization has noted reformes like a non-discriminatory minimum wage that Qatar is the first in the region to adopt.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar’s state-backed discrimination against LGBTQ people has also been criticized in the years leading up to the World Cup.\n\nSex between men is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison in the country, and a report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\n“There has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely,” the statement read.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nPerhaps the most obvious sign that this World Cup is different to most has been the decision to stage it in November and December, rather than June and July as is the norm.\n\nSweltering heat during the summer months in Qatar has necessitated the switch, although temperatures are still forecasted to rise above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) later this week.\n\nOther changes to the organization of the tournament have been rather more last-minute.\n\nOn Friday, FIFA announced that no alcohol would be sold at the stadiums, and then on Monday, captains from seven countries were warned they would receive yellow cards if they wore armbands promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination.\n\nFIFA announced earlier on Monday that it had brought forward its “No Discrimination” campaign – which also has a designated armband – adding that “all 32 captains will have the opportunity to wear this armband” during the World Cup.\n\nFIFA’s equipment regulations state that “for FIFA final competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captain’s armband provided by FIFA.”\n\nTime will tell what the legacy of this World Cup will be, but if the past few days, months, and years are anything to go by, it is likely to be complicated and controversial.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August.

They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/05/sport/mlb-lockout-explainer-baseball-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "MLB lockout: What is it? Why is it happening? When is it over? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nMajor League Baseball’s biggest stars and newest faces should be at their respective spring training camps in Florida and Arizona preparing for Opening Day on March 31. Instead, MLB ownership announced on Tuesday that it will begin canceling regular season games due to a self-inflicted lockout for the first time in 27 years.\n\n“We worked hard to avoid an outcome that’s bad for our fans, bad for our players and bad for our clubs. Our failure to reach an agreement was not due to a lack of effort by either party,” MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday following the announcement.\n\nBut what is a lockout? Why is it happening? And how long could this go on?\n\nWhat is a lockout?\n\nIt is important to note that a lockout is not the same as a strike. To be considered a strike, the players would have to impose the work stoppage; but in this case, the ownership group is the party responsible for refusing to permit the league from operating without reaching a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) – the governing document between the owners and the players.\n\nAs it’s likely that players would choose to strike without a CBA regardless of ownership’s decision, ownership can utilize a lockout as a way of gaining leverage by controlling the timing of negotiations.\n\nAs MLB Players Association (MLBPA) executive Tony Clark said: “A lockout is the ultimate economic weapon. In a $10 billion dollar industry, the owners have decided to use this weapon against the greatest asset they have: the players.”\n\nWithout a new CBA, not only will games continue to be canceled, but MLB players will also continue to be barred from their team facilities altogether.\n\nMLB commissioner Rob Manfred (second left) attends negotiations with the MLB Players' Association at the start of this week. Kyodo News/Getty Images\n\nAdditionally, no free agent signings or trades are permitted, leaving many with an uncertain future or no team at all. Until a new CBA is reached, MLB players will not receive regular payment, unless they have a previously scheduled signing bonus or deferred salary due.\n\nThe players are not the only party to suffer the consequences of an ongoing lockout. With no broadcast revenue or fans packing stadiums, owners risk missing out on hundreds of millions of dollars if the season does not get underway in a timely manner.\n\nWhile most team revenue numbers are not available to the public, the Atlanta Braves are owned by a public corporation, Liberty Media, and their 2021 earnings report shows earnings of approximately $568 million. And this doesn’t account for begrudging fan engagement and even outright protests once the league has resumed, which even Manfred admits would be a “disastrous outcome.”\n\nWhy has the lockout happened?\n\nSo what issues could cause something as unfavorable for both parties as a lockout? The largest issue comes down to money.\n\nA report by the Associated Press shows that average player salaries have declined for four consecutive years, dropping by 6.4% from $4.45 million in 2017 to $4.17M on Opening Day 2021. This is largely due to the enforcement of the competitive balance tax – more commonly known as the luxury tax.\n\nDespite not having a hard salary cap, MLB taxes any team that surpasses a certain amount in player salaries, thus imposing a de facto salary cap. In 2021, that amount was $210 million.\n\nAccording to a union official, MLB owners proposed increasing the luxury tax limit to $220 million in 2022 and maintaining that same limit for the 2023 and 2024 seasons, while the MLB Players’ Association (MLBPA) proposed a jump to a $238 million limit in 2022, increasing up to $250 million in 2024.\n\nBaseball players hold an informal training session in Mesa, Arizona, this week amid the ongoing lockout. Kyodo News/Getty Images\n\nWith teams continuing to rake in profit year after year, a stagnant luxury tax would keep player salaries at a standstill. Additionally, the MLBPA argues that the luxury tax actually discourages competition and incentivizes a reliance on younger, lower-paid players.\n\nAccording to a union official, MLB and the MLBPA also remain $55 million apart in their demands for a newly established pre-arbitration bonus pool, and $25,000 apart in minimum salary expectations. With MLB taking in an estimated $11 billion in annual revenue, negotiations over who deserves what cut remain alarmingly far apart.\n\nAre there other issues than money at play?\n\nWhile the most substantial issues come down to revenue allocation, the MLBPA has also affirmed its commitment “to promote competition.”\n\nBoth MLB and the MLBPA have agreed to changing the format of the annual amateur draft, with MLB proposing a replica of the NBA and NHL’s weighted draft lottery for the top four selections. The MLBPA wants to go a step further and expand the number of teams included in the lottery to seven to further discourage the practice of “tanking” – where a team loses games on purpose to set itself up for a better draft pick.\n\nBoth parties also agreed to an expanded postseason, but MLB is fighting for a 14-team playoff while the MLBPA prefers 12 teams.\n\nMLB and the MLBPA also expressed mutual concern over reported service time manipulation – the practice of keeping major league ready players in the minors to lengthen the amount of time a club owns their rights – but remain at a distance on how to handle it, with MLB using the introduction of a largely opposed international draft as a bargaining chip in exchange for accepting some of the MLBPA’s proposals regarding this issue.\n\nA fan in Jupiter, Florida, protests against a lockout. Kyodo News/Getty Images\n\nSo what’s next? When will there be baseball?\n\nWith both parties still miles apart on many points of negotiation, the future of the lockout – and of MLB – remains unclear. While the league described Tuesday’s offer as their “best and final offer,” it is not their “last, best offer,” which would declare a legal impasse and allow the owners to impose said offer without an agreement from the MLBPA.\n\n“Our negotiations are deadlocked right now, but that’s different than using the legal term ‘impasse,’ and I’m not going to do that right now,” Manfred said of the situation.\n\nThis could signify that MLB owners would likely return to the negotiation table with the MLBPA, but it doesn’t guarantee anything.\n\nAfter the most recent negotiations in Florida, both organizations returned to their headquarters in New York, despite Clark’s claim that the union would have stayed if MLB had.\n\nManfred responded: “We have made the last proposal, so you draw your own conclusion as to who ought to go next.”\n\nIf negotiations do not move forward “in good faith” and MLB declares an impasse, the situation will likely end up in court, with the MLBPA likely suing MLB for unfair labor practices.

He is viewed as one of Bach’s closest allies and also leads the IOC’s oversight of preparations for the postponed Tokyo Olympics.\n\nBach cited the IOC's “strict rules” which were monitored by ethics and compliance officials.\n\nStill, Brisbane's rapid selection this year blindsided officials in countries including Germany, Hungary, Indonesia and Qatar which had been in talks with Olympic officials about shaping bids.\n\nThat dialogue will continue with a “pool of interested parties” to host the Olympics in 2036 or 2040, Bach suggested.\n\nCoates told a news conference in Sydney on Friday he was “very, very pleased to get this expression of confidence.”\n\n“We didn’t know (where we stood) from both the future host commission and the executive board. Now we do,\" he said.\n\nWhile Coates said he was optimistic Brisbane would receive the necessary votes to stage the games in 11 years, he was cautious when asked if it was a certainty.\n\n“I’ve been around long enough to not predict how my IOC colleagues will vote,” he said. “Even with one candidate, you still have to go to a vote and the majority of the members still have to say yes. They haven’t said goodbye to other (potential) candidates.”\n\nAsked how Brisbane could fail to get the necessary votes, Coates said some IOC members might say “it’s too soon.”\n\n“Or some will want to be satisfied when we discuss with them that we’ve got athletes living in three villages, not the usual concept of one,” he added. “It’s now permitted. I’ve seen some from the athletes’ commission saying that the great thing about the Olympic Games is that we get all the athletes from all the teams from all the sports together. Well, they’re not going to be. And I’m sure a question will come.”\n\nThe Brisbane bid includes 32 venues, most of which already exist. The Gabba stadium, currently one of the premier venues in international cricket, will be refurbished for the 2032 Games and a so-called Brisbane Live arena is planned in a for a downtown redevelopment.\n\nThe 2024 Olympics will be held in Paris, with the 2028 Games in Los Angeles — both cities offering more stability than the troubled and often chaotic organization in Rio.\n\nAustralia last hosted the Olympics in 2000, with the popular success of the Sydney Games. Coates was heavily involved in the bid and organizing committees of those games.\n\nLawmaker Ted O'Brien, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's representative for the 2032 bid, on Friday acknowledged another milestone had been achieved.\n\n“While we’re delighted to have cleared the penultimate hurdle, we take absolutely nothing for granted as we seek endorsement of members of the IOC session in Tokyo,” O’Brien said.\n\nThe 2030 Winter Games have yet to be awarded, with Salt Lake City among potential bidders. Bach said the IOC was in talks with \"a number of interested parties” but there was no urgency to make a pick.\n\nBach also confirmed he will not visit Tokyo before mid-July, citing the quarantine periods needed to make “back and forth” trips from Switzerland which had been planned and expected.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Dennis Passa contributed from Brisbane, Australia.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/us/inside-texas-synagogue-hostage-standoff/index.html", "title": "Inside the Texas synagogue hostage standoff | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt started like most any Saturday for members of Congregation Beth Israel.\n\nFamilies of the Reform Jewish synagogue just outside Dallas-Fort Worth had gathered – in person and online – to participate in the Sabbath service, even amid the twin perils of a fresh pandemic wave and a swelling tide of attacks on Jewish people in the United States.\n\nBy day’s end, the community of faith in Colleyville, Texas, would be at the center of a global drama involving a livestreamed hostage-taking, an imprisoned terrorist icon, an elite FBI rescue team, a rabbi’s quick thinking and a final, frantic sprint to freedom.\n\nMore details may yet offer a deeper understanding of why it happened. But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/08/07/swimming-federation-to-splash-millions-on-african-strategy/48201719/", "title": "Swimming federation to splash millions on African strategy", "text": "AP\n\nTOKYO (AP) — After an Olympics of too little diversity in the swimming pool, and less on the medal podium, the sport's governing body is investing tens of millions of dollars to change that by 2024.\n\nElite training centers in Africa and scholarship programs worldwide are part of a strategy to help athletes emerge from outside the sport’s power bases. Of 105 medals won in the pool at the Tokyo Games, almost half went to Americans and Australians. Only three were won by Africans, and none of those by Black swimmers.\n\nThat picture should be different at the 2024 Paris Olympics, newly elected FINA president Husain al-Musallam told The Associated Press, pledging to make student-athletes a priority.\n\n“I believe there will be a lot of athletes coming from Africa in swimming and they will reach the podium,” al-Musallam said in an interview at the Tokyo Aquatics Center. “When you give opportunity to everybody they perform. Africans have a lack of resources, especially for aquatic sport.”\n\nOne stand-out story in Tokyo was 18-year-old Ahmed Hafnaoui of Tunisia, who won a surprise gold in the 400 freestyle.\n\nTwo years ago, Hafnaoui didn't make the 400 final at the junior world championships, but had access to a gym to build his strength for the Olympics, the FINA president said.\n\n“Without weights, it’s difficult to produce,” al-Musallam said. “I’m sure if he was doing one year of good preparation he will (set) a new world record.”\n\nFINA has identified Tunisia, Senegal and two universities in South Africa as elite training bases to place African athletes. Others will go to Europe, in Hungary and Russia.\n\nAbeku Jackson of Ghana trained for the men’s 100 butterfly at a FINA-supported base in Kazan, the 2025 world championships host city in Russia. His time of 53.39 seconds set a national record but did not advance him from the heats.\n\n“You can’t snap your fingers and put minorities (swimmers) on the podium,\" new FINA executive director Brent Nowicki said.\n\nHe pointed to FINA spending $29 million over four years on a strategy to widen and deepen swimming’s talent pool.\n\n“You will see a number of Africans and minorities student athletes competing,” predicted Nowicki, an American sports lawyer hired to help reform FINA.\n\nThe Lausanne, Switzerland-based organization has long been among the richest Olympic sports bodies but with little transparency.\n\nTo lead the change in June, al-Musallam was elected president as the only candidate despite being implicated four years ago by an American court in buying votes in soccer elections. Al-Musallam, who denies wrongdoing and has not been indicted, had been FINA's senior vice president since 2017.\n\nIn Tokyo, FINA announced a 50% rise in prize money for the 25-meter pool world championships, which will be held in Abu Dhabi in December. World records will earn $50,000 bonuses from a total pot of $2.8 million.\n\nThe previous FINA leadership’s failure to reward athletes led to the breakaway International Swimming League, and an anti-trust suit in California filed by swimmers including three-time Olympic champion Katinka Hosszú and Tokyo gold medalist Michael Andrew.\n\nThat case is ongoing, and al-Musallam said he has taken part in two online meetings with a judge seeking to reach a settlement between the parties.\n\nThe FINA president has talked with and plans to meet Matt Biondi, the American swim great who leads the new International Swimmers’ Alliance representing the sport's athletes.\n\nAl-Musallam said he did not announce having spoken with Biondi “because then I will be a showman. I am not a showman.”\n\nHe also engaged with Olympic stars in Tokyo, inviting them to go to Africa and inspire young swimmers.\n\n“I said, ‘I can give you this opportunity. I send you to Ghana. Talk to the kids in the river,’” al-Musallam said. “I want to work in the field, I’m quiet. You judge the result.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2020-tokyo-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/sport/roc-winter-olympics-beijing-russia-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "ROC at Beijing 2022: What is it and how can Russian athletes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEagle-eyed viewers watching the 2022 Beijing Games will once again notice a now familiar acronym – ROC, which stands for the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nIts significance?

NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told The Associated Press by email it’s “likely a reasonable timeline” to make that call.\n\n“I’m optimistic, but everybody has to do an effort to be there,” Tardif told the Canadian Press and others at the event. “You need to have the same rules as the other athletes. We are not a travel agency. We organize a competition.”\n\nThe league and its players’ association have agreed to participate in 2026 after skipping the past two Olympics, if they can reach a deal with the IIHF and the International Olympic Committee. The NHL did not participate in Pyeongchang in 2018 after the IOC would not pay travel- and insurance-related costs as it did on five previous occasions from 1998-2014.\n\n“If we discussed directly with the players – the players want to go – we would find a way,” Tardif said. “But it’s more complicated than that.”\n\nNHL players were set to go in 2022 before pandemic-related schedule interruptions caused them to pull out. They have not competed in the Olympics since 2014 in Sochi.\n\nThe NHL and NHLPA had planned to host a World Cup of Hockey in February 2024, but that was derailed by Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, and they announced in November that another attempt would be made to hold the event in 2025.\n\nTardif said the IIHF isn’t a fan of the World Cup taking place in February because of the potential impacts on European leagues and how close it would be to the organization’s men’s world championships held in May – which is during the NHL playoffs.\n\n“That’s a big problem for us,” Tardif said. “We prefer August, September, October.”\n\nThe last World Cup of Hockey was held in September 2016 in Toronto.

The last two men’s gold medalists struggled in pool play with Brazil needing a win in its final match in 2016 to advance to the knockout round and Russia finishing third in 2012.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nPanipak Wongpattanakit of Thailand and Vito Dell’Aquila of Italy have won the first two gold medals of the Olympic taekwondo competition in Tokyo.\n\nWongpattanakit won her first gold in dramatic fashion in the women’s 49-kilogram final, scoring two points on a body kick inside the final 10 seconds for an 11-10 victory over 17-year-old Adriana Cerezo of Spain. Wongpattanakit’s gold is only the 10th in Thailand’s entire Olympic history.\n\nDell’Aquila defeated Mohamed Khalil Jendoubi of Tunisia 16-12 in the men’s 58-kilogram final to claim his first Olympic medal. The final was another thriller that was tied 10-10 with about 15 seconds left before Dell’Aquila won with a flurry of scoring strikes.\n\nChinese veteran Wu Jingyu’s bid to become the first three-time Olympic taekwondo champion ended in the quarterfinals with a 33-2 loss to Cerezo.\n\nTaekwondo’s four-day tournament continues Sunday with British star Jade Jones’ attempt to succeed where Wu failed by winning her own third consecutive gold medal.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nAron Szilagyi of Hungary has become the first Olympic fencer to win three individual sabre gold medals after beating Luigi Samele 15-7 in the men’s final at the Tokyo Games.\n\nSzilagyi used his fast reflexes to build an early 7-1 lead and held off a brief comeback from his Italian opponent before closing out the win.\n\nSzilagyi won gold at the 2012 London Games and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. His only loss in the Olympic individual tournament came in the third round in 2008.\n\nSamele reached the final after a remarkable win in the semifinals. He came back from 12-6 down to beat Kim Junghwan of South Korea 15-12.\n\nKim took bronze with a 15-11 win over Sandro Bazadze of Georgia.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nSun Yiwen of China has beaten five-time Olympian Ana Maria Popescu of Romania 11-10 in overtime to win gold in the women’s épée fencing competition.\n\nPopescu leveled the score at 10-10 with three seconds remaining to go to overtime but Sun soon scored the winning point in the deciding period.\n\nSun completed her set of Olympic medals after winning individual bronze and team silver at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. Popescu has yet to win an individual gold medal at any of her five Olympic appearances despite often being among the favorites. She won team gold in 2016.\n\nKatrina Lehis of Estonia took the bronze by beating Russian fencer Aizanat Murtazaeva 15-8. Lehis was trailing 4-3 in the second period before winning the next five points to take a lead she never gave up.\n\n___\n\nMembers of the U.S. swimming team cheered and chanted from the stands for U.S. first lady Jill Biden, who sat across the pool and waved as swimming kicked off.\n\nWithout fans in the 15,000-seat Tokyo Aquatics Centre on Saturday, masked teams had ample room to spread out in socially distanced seats above the deck. The U.S. contingent waved tiny American flags and pounded red-white-and-blue Thunderstix, while the Germans spread their large-sized flag over two rows of seats.\n\nWaiting for the session to begin, the Americans chanted “Dr. Biden, Dr. Biden” and clapped.\n\nNone of the usual electricity that typically courses through the Olympic pool was present. Teams shouted the names of their swimmers during the race, when the sound of water splashing was easily heard and music blasted.\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden watched a 3-on-3 basketball game with French President Emmanuel Macron and hosted a softball watch party at the U.S. ambassador's residence.\n\n___\n\nNaohisa Takato has won Japan’s first gold medal at its home Olympics, beating Taiwan’s Yang Yung-wei in the men’s 60-kilogram judo final.\n\nKosovo’s Distria Krasniqi beat Japan’s Funa Tonaki in the women’s 48-kilogram final less than an hour before Takato made sure his team wouldn’t have a double heartbreak on the opening day of competition in its beloved homegrown martial art.\n\nTakato won his final three bouts in sudden-death golden score, but took the final a bit anticlimactically after Yang committed too many fouls.\n\nThe charismatic Takato’s success — and Tonaki’s heartbreaking, last-minute defeat — could provide a much-needed jolt of excitement for a nation still feeling profoundly ambivalent about these Olympics and discouraged by the scandals and coronavirus setbacks surrounding them.\n\n___\n\nDistria Krasniqi of Kosovo beat Funa Tonaki in the women’s 48-kilogram Olympic judo final, depriving host Japan of its first gold medal in its home Olympics and winning Kosovo’s second-ever Olympic medal.\n\nKrasniqi won on a throw with 20 seconds left, scoring a waza-ari and claiming a title that moved her to tears moments later.\n\nAlthough Krasniqi was the top seed, she was severely challenged by the 4-foot-10 Tonaki, who beat a series of difficult opponents to reach the final.\n\nTonaki fell agonizingly short of claiming a gold medal in Japan’s beloved, homegrown martial art. Her success would have provided a much-needed jolt of positivity for a nation still feeling profoundly ambivalent about these Olympics and discouraged by the scandals and coronavirus setbacks surrounding them.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nDistria Krasniqi of Kosovo beat Funa Tonaki in the women’s 48-kilogram Olympic judo final, depriving host Japan of its first gold medal in its home Olympics and winning Kosovo’s second-ever Olympic medal.\n\nKrasniqi won on a throw with 20 seconds left, scoring a waza-ari and claiming a title that moved her to tears moments later.\n\nAlthough Krasniqi was the top seed, she was severely challenged by the 4-foot-10 Tonaki, who beat a series of difficult opponents to reach the final.\n\nTonaki fell agonizingly short of claiming a gold medal in Japan’s beloved, homegrown martial art.

The U.S. won 2-0.\n\nShe said she was excited to watch the game and apologized for not being able to offer food or drink due to COVID protocols. She also thanked foreign service officers and their families for their service.\n\n___\n\nRussian weightlifting leader Maxim Agapitov has beaten the IOC in court to win back his right to attend the Tokyo Olympics despite his own doping ban 27 years ago.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport says it upheld Agapitov’s appeal to regain his games accreditation, which the International Olympic Committee took away this month.\n\nThe IOC had decided Agapitov should “not have a personal history linked to any anti-doping rule violation” in order to stay at the Olympics representing the International Weightlifting Federation.\n\nCAS says its three-judge panel decided it was “clearly disproportionate” to punish someone for a violation at any point in their athletic career.\n\nAgapitov’s doping case was in 1994, before he became a world champion. He’s now president of the Russian weightlifting federation and an executive board member of the troubled IWF.\n\n___\n\nThe International Surfing Association has confirmed a last-minute alternate: Carlos Munoz, who will surf for Costa Rica as the sport makes its Olympic debut.\n\nMunoz replaces Frederico Morais of Portugal, who announced Friday that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and would not travel to Japan while he quarantines at home.\n\nMunoz’s confirmation comes at the very last minute possible, as the association had set the 3 p.m. Saturday Tokyo time as the deadline for alternates to be approved.\n\nSurfers qualify by name as individuals via world tournament rankings, though each country can only have two surfers per gender.\n\nThe first alternate for Morais’ spot was Italian Angelo Bonomelli, who won't participate, though the association did not say why. Munoz was the next male surfer eligible.\n\nThe eight-day shortboard surfing competition period begins Sunday at Tsurigasaki beach.\n\n___\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and French President Emmanuel Macron have met in Tokyo as the Olympics get underway.\n\nThey welcomed the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics as “a powerful symbol of global unity” for a victory over COVID-19, according to a joint statement released by the Japanese foreign ministry.\n\nMacron attended the opening ceremony of the pandemic-delayed Olympics to represent France, the host nation for 2024.\n\nThey’ve also agreed to share Japan’s experiences for the 2024 games, which will be held in Paris.\n\nJapan has struggled to balance virus measures and preparation for the Olympics amid growing public concern about the health risks of holding the games.\n\nSuga and Macron also agreed to cooperate in a wide range of areas including defense, climate change and the economy.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nEcuador won its first cycling medal as Richard Carapaz took gold in the Olympic road race.\n\nEmbracing his nickname of “The Locomotive,” Carapaz rode away from American breakaway buddy Brandon McNulty as they approached the finish at Fuji International Speedway.\n\nHe slapped his handlebars in celebration as he crossed the line, where he was greeted by one of the few crowds allowed at the Olympics.\n\nThe chasing group rounded the corner in sight of him at the finish line, then played a game of cat-and-mouse for the other two medals. Belgian star Wout van Aert wound up edging Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia in a photo finish.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nAn San and teenager Kim Je Deok have paired up to lead South Korea to a gold medal in the Olympic debut of archery’s mixed team event at the Tokyo Games.\n\nOn a sizzling Saturday at the Yumenoshima Park Archery Field, they held off Gabriela Schloesser and Steve Wijler of the Netherlands by a tally of 5-3 to bring home yet another archery gold for South Korea. The country has now captured 14 of 17 gold medals in archery team competitions since the current format was introduced to the Olympics in 1988.\n\nWhat’s more, it was the 24th Olympic gold medal for South Korea’s archery program, matching short track speed skating for most by the country in a particular sport.\n\nAlejandra Valencia and Luis Alvarez combined for Mexico and knocked off Yasemin Anagoz and Mete Gazoz of Turkey to earn the bronze medal.\n\n___\n\nHeat and humidity are quickly becoming a major issue for players at the Olympic tennis tournament in Tokyo.\n\nThe temperature soared to 91 degrees F (33 degrees C) and the heat index made it feel like 100 F (38 C).\n\nFrench Open finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova says she wasn't feeling great, although she still routed Sara Errani of Italy 6-0, 6-1.\n\nMona Barthel struggled with 10 double-faults in a loss to Iga Swiatek as a searing sun made it nearly impossible to see the ball once she tossed it.\n\nSecond-seeded Daniil Medvedev, who also competes for ROC at the Tokyo Games, called it “some of the worst” heat he has played in after eliminating Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan.\n\n“I’m not going to lie. But you have to play,” Medvedev said. “That’s the Olympics, you go for the medal. You are not here to cry about the heat.”\n\nMedvedev suggested that organizers move all matches to the evening to avoid the heat of the day.\n\n___\n\nNovak Djokovic’s bid for a Golden Slam is alive and well following a routine 6-2, 6-2 win over 139th-ranked Hugo Dellien of Bolivia in the opening round of the Tokyo tennis tournament.\n\nThe top-ranked Serb is attempting to become the first man to win all four major tennis tournaments and an Olympic singles gold medal in the same year.\n\nSteffi Graf was the only tennis player to accomplish the Golden Slam in 1988.\n\nDjokovic’s next opponent will be 48th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany.\n\nStruff eliminated Thiago Monteiro of Brazil 6-3, 6-4.\n\n___\n\nThe youngest table tennis player in Olympics history is out of the Tokyo Games.\n\nHend Zaza of Syria lost in straight sets to Liu Jia, a 39-year-old from Austria, in a preliminary match Saturday.\n\nThe 12-year-old told Olympics.com that she was pleased with her performance and learned from the loss — and she’s hoping for another shot at the next Olympics, in Paris.\n\nZaza is from Hama, which has been heavily damaged by war.\n\nShe is the youngest athlete at the Tokyo Games.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nJavad Foroughi has become the oldest Iranian athlete to win an Olympic medal, earning gold in men’s 10-meter air pistol.\n\nForoughi set an Olympic record with 244.8 points, finishing 6.9 ahead of silver medalist Damir Mikec of Serbia. China’s Pang Wei, the 2008 gold medalist, took bronze.\n\nThe 41-year-old Foroughi surpasses Iranian weightlifter Mahmoud Namdjou, who was 38 when he took bronze at the 1956 Melbourne Games.\n\nForoughi, ranked fourth in the world, qualified fifth and immediately jumped to the lead in the finals with a series of shots in the 10-ring. He led Mikec by 4.2 points entering the final two shots and celebrated by waving his towel before kneeling on it to pray.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nHou Zhihui has won China’s second gold medal of the Tokyo Olympics with a commanding showing in the women’s 49-kilogram weightlifting category.\n\nHou lifted a total 210kg, 3kg short of her world record, to take gold ahead of Indian lifter Chanu Saikhom Mirabai on 202. It was India’s first Olympic silver in weightlifting.\n\nIndonesia took bronze as Windy Cantika Aisah lifted a total of 194kg.\n\nJourdan Delacruz of the United States was third after the snatch portion of the contest but failed on all three or her lifts in the clean and jerk.\n\n___\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion Kohei Uchimura’s Olympic career is over.\n\nThe 32-year-old Japanese gymnast, considered by many the greatest of all time, fell during qualifying on high bar and will not advance to the event finals.\n\nUchimura, the 2012 and 2016 all-around gold medalist, was midway through his set when he peeled off while doing a complicated connection. He picked himself up and finished his routine, drilling his dismount.\n\nHis score of 13.866 placed him outside of the top eight, meaning he will not make the finals. Uchimura competed as an individual, meaning he will not be part of the team final on Monday.\n\nUchimura waved to the judges and received a round of applause inside the largely empty Ariake Gymnastics Centre before quickly exiting the competition floor.\n\n___\n\nTokyo organizers say the total of Olympics-related COVID-19 cases in Japan is now 127, with one athlete added to the tally.\n\nGerman cyclist Simon Geschke’s positive test was announced Friday, one day ahead before the men’s road race. That’s a signature event on the first full day of competition at any Summer Games.\n\nAthletes account for 14 of the 127 cases in Japan since July 1. Among the new positive tests are 14 games contractors who live in Japan.\n\nDutch team officials said Saturday that rower Finn Florijn tested positive for COVID-19 and is out of the Games. Two other Dutch athletes previously tested positive. Florijn's positive test won't show up in the official tally of cases until Sunday.\n\n___\n\nChina has sprinted to the lead in men’s gymnastics qualifying, putting on a clinic inside the nearly empty Ariake Gymnastics Centre as it aims to return to the top of the sport.\n\nChina total of 262.061 — fueled by four brilliant sets on parallel bars — edged out Russia’s 261.945 in the first of three qualifying subdivisions.\n\nChina is attempting to bounce back after slipping to bronze in Rio de Janeiro five years ago and coming in second to the Russians at the 2019 world championships.\n\nReigning world champion Nikita Nagornyy of Russia has grabbed the early lead in all-around qualifying, putting together a steady 87.897, just ahead of China’s Xiao Ruoteng and Sun Wei.\n\nRussian Artur Dalaloyan also assured himself of a spot in next week’s all-around finals with a total of 85.597, remarkable considering that Dalaloyan is competing on a surgically repaired left Achilles torn at the European championships in April.\n\n___\n\nThe French Olympic Committee says some of the medical and support staff for its men’s basketball team have been forced into quarantine at the Tokyo Games because a passenger aboard their flight to Japan tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe committee didn’t say how many staff members are affected as possible contact cases. It said they have been in isolation since July 19, unable to work with the athletes. It said all of the staff members’ tests so far have been negative.\n\n___\n\nDutch team officials say rower Finn Florijn has tested positive for COVID-19 and is out of the Games. The other members of the team who are considered close contacts can stay, but will need to adjust to separate transportation and eating and sleeping arrangements.\n\nThe 21-year-old son of former Olympic gold medalist rower Ronald Florijn was competing in single sculls and had finished fourth in his heat on Friday. He was scheduled to row again Saturday in the repechage before positive test results late Friday ended his Games.\n\n“I was hopeful to improve in the rematch. Now it’s over in an instant. I can’t really say much more about it,” Florijn said.\n\nFlorijn is the fourth member of the Dutch team or staff to test positive for COVID-19. The team said earlier this week that taekwondo athlete Reshmie Oogink and a rowing team staff member tested positive and skateboarder Candy Jacobs announced on Instagram that she had tested positive.\n\nChef de Mission of TeamNL Pieter van den Hoogenband says the team is doing everything it can to curb more positive tests.\n\n___\n\nThe ban on fans for the Summer Olympics does not extend past Tokyo, and that means thousands of cycling fans have turned up at Fuji International Speedway to await the finish of the men’s road race.\n\nThe facility built in the 1960s but extensively renovated over the years has a grandstand capacity of 22,000 people. And with 50 percent capacity limitations due to COVID-19, that means up to 11,000 will be able to see the finish.\n\nTheir eagerness to see the Olympics after a year delay was clear by the way fans turned out early Saturday. They showed up nearly seven hours before riders were expected to reach the finishing circuits, and the layout of the speedway meant they would be spending all that time in the sun on a steamy day two hours southwest of Tokyo.\n\n___\n\nMEDAL ALERT\n\nChina’s Yang Qian has won the first gold medal of the Tokyo Olympics in women’s 10-meter air rifle.\n\nYang overtook Anastasiia Galashina when the Russian missed the center two rings for an 8.9 on her final shot.\n\nYang had a 9.8 on her final shot and finished with an Olympic record 251.8. Galashina finished at 251.1.\n\nSwitzerland’s Nina Christen took bronze.\n\n___\n\nAn Algerian judo athlete will be sent home from the Tokyo Olympics after he withdrew from the competition to avoid potentially facing an Israeli opponent.\n\nFethi Nourine and his coach, Amar Benikhlef, told Algerian media they were withdrawing to avoid a possible second-round matchup with Israel’s Tohar Butbul in the men’s 73 kg division on Monday. Nourine was to face Sudan’s Mohamed Abdalrasool in the opening round, with the winner facing Butbul, the fifth seed.\n\nThe International Judo Federation’s executive committee has temporarily suspended Nourine and Benikhlef, who are likely to face sanctions beyond the Olympics, which began Saturday. The Algerian Olympic committee then withdrew both men’s accreditation and made plans to send them home.\n\nThe IJF said Nourine’s position was “in total opposition to the philosophy of the International Judo Federation. The IJF has a strict non-discrimination policy, promoting solidarity as a key principle, reinforced by the values of judo.”\n\nNourine and Benikhlef attribute their stance to their political support for Palestinians.\n\n___\n\nTwo Georgian tennis players have been barred from the Tokyo Olympics after officials in their home country told them they were entered for the Games but never actually sent the paperwork.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that it had to turn away doubles players Oksana Kalashnikova and Ekaterine Gorgodze because they were never formally entered for the games, even though Georgia’s Olympic committee “informed the applicants that their application had been submitted.”\n\nWithout a formal entry for the Olympics, the court ruled that the “consequence, however unfortunate for the two athletes, can only be the dismissal of their petition.”\n\n___\n\nAustralia is without cyclist Rohan Dennis for the men’s Olympic road race, though it’s not because of a positive test for COVID-19.\n\nDennis chose to skip the race, which is taking place on a brutal course through searing heat that hardly suits his skillset, so that he can focus instead on next week’s time trial.\n\nDennis, who has won stages in each of the three Grand Tours, is also one of the best in the world in the race against the clock. He’s a two-time time trial world champion, helped Australia win team pursuit silver at the 2012 London Games and is a former world hour-record holder.\n\nHe was in medal contention at the Rio Games in the time trial, but he had a mechanical issue that required a bike change and took him out of the running.\n\n___\n\nThe entire Spanish cycling team has been cleared for the men’s road race hours before the start, ending a stressful period of limbo following a positive COVID-19 test involving a team masseuse.\n\nAlejandro Valverde, Gorka Izagirre, Ion Izagirre, Omar Fraile and Jesus Herrada were considered close contacts of the masseuse, but all returned negative test results that allowed them to make the start at Musashinonomori Park on Saturday.\n\nSpain has one of the strongest teams in the men’s road race, which will finish at Fuji International Speedway. Valverde, Fraile and Ion Izagirre in particular have skillsets that are perfectly suited for the mountainous course.\n\n___\n\nThe very first match of the Olympic beach volleyball tournament has been canceled because a Czech player tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nMarkéta Sluková tested positive earlier this week, knocking her and partner Barbora Hermannova out of the Tokyo Games.\n\nThe Czechs were supposed to be playing a team from the host country that would have been making its Olympic debut. Instead, the Japanese pair of Megumi Murakami and Miki Ishii earned the victory by default.\n\nSluková is one of at least three members of the Czech team who have tested positive since their arrival in Japan, including men’s beach volleyball player Ondřej Perušič.\n\nThe team has said it’s investigating if the outbreak of COVID-19 is linked to its charter flight to Tokyo.\n\n___\n\nGerman cyclist Simon Geschke has been ruled out of the men’s road race after testing positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe German team says Geschke initially tested positive Friday and his result was confirmed by another test later in the day.\n\nGermany says fellow riders Nikias Arndt and Maximilian Schachmann are cleared to race Saturday. The fourth rider on the team, Emanuel Buchmann, was Geschke’s roommate and was waiting overnight on the result of another PCR test for the virus. Team staff tested negative.\n\nGeschke was a stage winner on the Tour de France in 2015.\n\nThe German road race team is living in a hotel and not in the Olympic Village.\n\nGeschke says he followed the hygiene rules at the Olympics. He adds that “I feel fine physically but emotionally it’s a really terrible day for me.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/media/fox-news-liz-cheney-dick-cheney/index.html", "title": "Fox made Liz Cheney a conservative hero 10 years ago. Today she ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nVice President Dick Cheney was a hero on Fox News twenty years ago, but his daughter Rep. Liz Cheney is a villain on Fox today.\n\n“The voters are saying they’ve had enough – and that it’s time to bury the tragic Bush-Cheney era once and for all,” Fox’s 10 p.m. host Laura Ingraham said Tuesday night, around the same time Cheney conceded to Harriet Hageman in the GOP primary in Wyoming.\n\nCheney was a punching bag and punchline all across GOP-aligned media as the primary results came in. Many right-wing commentators repeated the same points they had made for months: That Cheney’s condemnation of former president Donald Trump and her collaboration with Democrats on the House select committee investigating January 6 made her an enemy.\n\nOn Fox, the tone was quite personal and bitter, and an extraordinary turn for a network that once celebrated the Cheney family dynasty. Back in 2012, Liz Cheney was even a paid Fox commentator. And when she left the network in 2013 to run for Senate in Wyoming, Sean Hannity endorsed her.\n\nBut she crossed Trump, and thus Fox’s biggest stars. On Tuesday night Tucker Carlson mocked her public stance in defense of democracy, which stemmed from Trump’s 2020 plot to overturn the election result, and derided media outlets that have taken her seriously. He predicted that she will soon “be writing a column for National Review and will be releasing a book from Simon and Schuster called ‘Democracy.’”\n\nOne hour later, Hannity opened his show by calling Cheney “the most obsessive Trump hater in the country.” He pooh-poohed talk of a potential Cheney presidential run, saying that “if she can’t win Wyoming, she’s not going to win any other red state that I can think of.”\n\nIn the 10 p.m. hour, Ingraham’s program showed about five minutes of Cheney’s concession speech, then cut away to guests who ridiculed Cheney. CNN and MSNBC aired the speech in full.\n\nFox’s coverage did include Cheney telling supporters that she could have easily won the primary – “the path was clear” – but “it would’ve required that I go along with President Trump’s lie about the 2020 election. It would’ve required that I enable his ongoing efforts to unravel our democratic system and attack the foundations of our republic. That was a path I could not and would not take.”\n\nNewsmax did not show any of Cheney’s speech. Instead, 10 p.m. host celebrated the fact that “Liz Cheney is gone.”\n\nNumerous right-wing commentators portrayed Hageman’s win and Cheney’s loss as a perfect example of democracy in action, implying that it undermines Cheney’s warnings about threats to democracy.\n\nBut unlike Trump, Cheney didn’t deny that she lost the race, or encourage people to believe she won, or incite supporters to block Hageman’s victory from being certified.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter.

As of this point in his presidency, Biden has spent more than a quarter of his time working from his home state of Delaware, either at his house in Wilmington or his Rehoboth Beach property.\n\nSome 21 months into his term, Biden has made 55 visits to Delaware, totaling some or all of 174 days as of Sunday, according to a CNN analysis of presidential schedules and a tally kept by Mark Knoller, the longtime unofficial statistician of the White House press corps. In addition, Biden has made 19 visits, or all or part of 64 days, to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland.\n\nHe has now surpassed even the getaway time of former President Donald Trump, so often criticized by Democrats for his regular departures from the White House to stay at one of his personal homes. At this point in his tenure, Trump had spent about 135 days at either his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, or his home at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump also had spent 23 days at Camp David.\n\n“President Biden is deeply proud of his roots and his family and it has been a staple of his time in public life to never lose touch with either,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said to CNN. “Presidents of the United States are constantly on the job, regardless of their location – whether they’re on a state visit overseas or just 100 miles from the White House for a short trip to Wilmington, DE. And as all Americans can agree, it’s important for leaders to avoid becoming ensconced in Washington, DC.”\n\nThe comforts of home can be a salve for the commander in chief while carrying out one of the world’s most demanding jobs. The American president is never truly “off,” and – in fact – Biden, like all presidents, has a whole remote White House apparatus that travels with him to facilitate that round-the-clock enterprise, with the most state-of-the-art capabilities, resources and technology traveling with him wherever he goes.\n\nSome argue that Biden can now lean into the normalcy of working from home, which millions of Americans had to rely on when Covid-19 forced isolation from offices and public spaces. “WFH” is not just a shorthand for being productive at the home office, it’s become a professional way of life for many.\n\n“It is 2022, not 1922. If the rest of the country can work from home, so can the president of the United States,” said Michael LaRosa, a director at a DC-based public affairs firm and former press secretary to first lady Dr. Jill Biden.\n\n“He spent (practically) every weekend in Delaware during his 36 years in the Senate, and his eight years as vice president,” LaRosa said. “This is nothing new. The Bidens have never lived in Washington, DC.” When he was a senator, Biden commuted back to Delaware almost every night by train – earning the nickname “Amtrak Joe” – and the train station in Wilmington is named for him.\n\nThe physical presence of a president is, however, meaningful for some, at least in ritual.\n\nThe statistics – 236 days away from the White House in Delaware and Maryland in less than two years on the job – are significant for the modern presidency. The job has been set in the nation’s capital near the Congress and the Supreme Court, in part for its symbolic power, for more than 220 years. Being in that power center brings a higher level of transparency thanks to the proximity to the national media, along with White House rules about press access and public records about who comes and goes.\n\nWhenever the president is actually in the Oval Office, for example, that presence is honored by the solemn watch of a stone-faced US Marine posted outside the West Wing.\n\n“A special challenge that Biden faces, because of his age, is that people will assume the worst if he’s not always visible. That is something that comes with being the oldest president in office,” said Tim Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, who notes presidents have had a “moveable Oval Office” for decades. “Perception is important in American politics.”\n\nThe optics of WFH or WFWH\n\nA president of the United States who doesn’t consider the White House his primary home does not go unnoticed by the media, or critics. But the executive mansion’s primary residents have generally found it stifling.\n\n“I always say I don’t know whether it’s the finest public housing in America or the crown jewel of the prison system,” former President Bill Clinton famously mused during a 1993 interview.\n\nKnoller, who during his 32-year career with CBS News covered the personal habits of six presidents, concurs.\n\n“It may look luxurious, but it can be suffocating to live and work there day in and out,” Knoller said.\n\nTrump’s trips to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster were fodder for op-eds and lent themselves to critics painting a portrait of a president unwilling to give up the trappings of a luxe off-duty lifestyle. And though many days were spent on the golf course – 125 or so at this point in Trump’s presidency, compared to Biden’s 19 on the links – Trump was still the leader of the free world. Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, traveled home much less frequently while in office but was frequently dinged – by Trump, among others – for the amount of golf he played.\n\n“(Ronald) Reagan and (George W.) Bush both spent lots of time at their private ranch homes,” said Knoller of two other former presidents who escaped the White House with regularity.\n\nKnoller tabulated time away for presidents, he says, because the numbers “added color to my reporting and gave insight to the president’s needs and activities.”\n\nAccording to Knoller’s count, George W. Bush spent all or part of 490 days – more than a year – at his Texas ranch during his eight years in office. Reagan spent nearly a year, all or part of 349 days, at his California ranch during his two terms. If Biden were reelected and kept up his current pace of trips to Delaware until the end of a second term in office, he would far surpass both Reagan and Bush in time away from the White House.\n\nHowever, post-pandemic culture has blurred the boundaries of what defines a workplace.\n\n“Our concept of being ‘on the job’ has shifted, and that may actually change the way we think about where our president needs to be,” Naftali said.\n\nSome of Biden’s biggest political wins came this summer, after all, when he was isolating in the residence of the White House after testing positive for Covid-19. Photos showed him tie-less, often working in the second-floor Treaty Room or reading papers with his feet up on the Truman balcony, Commander by his side.\n\nIt was a view into what Biden’s work from home life may be like when he’s in Wilmington or Rehoboth.\n\n“It’s a bit antiquated to think that because he is not physically in the White House on the weekends, that he is not working,” LaRosa said. “He never stops being President and he never stops working. Just ask the first lady.”\n\nA weekly ritual\n\nBiden has the advantage of a more normalized routine in his trips away from Washington.\n\nThe White House residence staff has by now perfected the choreography of managing, packing and planning the departure of the President and first lady most Fridays, the day, statistically, the Bidens normally split town.\n\nThe ushers know which bags are to be brought downstairs – it’s a light-pack, most of the couples’ needed belongings are already in their Delaware homes, a person familiar tells CNN. While Biden occasionally plays golf at a local course when in Wilmington, his other activities – seeing his grandchildren, taking casual social visits, going to church – don’t require multiple outfit changes.\n\nIn Rehoboth, he rides his bike and he and the first lady like to set up a big, blue umbrella on the sandy beach in front of their house and sunbathe or read in reclining chairs. Outside of swimsuits, joggers and polo shirts, it’s not a multiple-suitcase situation.\n\n“The biggest issue is usually the pets,” said the person familiar with the weekend planning for a presidential getaway to Delaware.\n\nCommander, now one year old and no longer a small puppy, and Willow, the barn cat adopted by Jill Biden, are “almost always” on the Delaware visits. While many American families leave their pets at home with caretakers for the weekend, or book them at pet-sitting facilities, the Bidens take theirs with them.\n\nThey like to be around their pets at all times – when Joe Biden was isolating at the White House with Covid-19 this summer, he was kept company by Commander; likewise, when Jill Biden had her bout with Covid, she spent the her rebound case isolation period in Rehoboth, with Willow.\n\nThe animals frequently travel to Delaware via van, with support staff, but occasionally they are in vehicles solely dedicated to their transportation, says the person. Willow, in particular, is not a fan of noisy, whirring helicopter blades, said another person familiar with the feline’s habits. In June, there was a rare sighting by White House press members of Willow in her crate, being carried by a residence staffer to Marine One for a weekend at Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Biden’s Delaware visits, of course, no matter how quick, have a significant footprint beyond those of the paws of their pets.\n\nSecret Service coordinates with law enforcement on all movements – several highway exits must close for the presidential motorcade, locals in both Wilmington and Rehoboth must at times wait on traffic patterns or be swept by agents with handheld magnetometers just to walk down the beach if one of the Bidens is there, as one neighbor of the Bidens in Rehoboth Beach told CNN.\n\nThe large presidential apparatus helps ensure that the President is able to perform his duties with the full input of his advisers, even if they’re not with him in person.\n\n“Unless we discover his being away from Washington results in him bobbling the ball as JFK did on the eve of the Bay of Pigs operation, there shouldn’t be an issue,” says Naftali, referring to Kennedy’s canceling of an air strike on a Sunday, without full consultation and full consideration, a move the former President later regretted.\n\n“But if Biden is in touch virtually and telephonically, in this era, leadership doesn’t have to involve always being physically present in Washington, D.C.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/18/politics/biden-falls-riding-bike/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden is 'fine' after falling off his bike in Delaware, White House ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden is “fine,” after falling off his bike Saturday during a ride in a state park near his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, a White House official said.\n\nNo medical attention is needed, the official added in a statement released to reporters traveling with the President.\n\n“As the President said, his foot got caught on the pedal while dismounting and he is fine.

It comes a year after the US announced a surprise US-Australia submarine partnership – upending France’s own submarine deal with Australia and infuriating French officials. The perilous relations are no small matter, given the array of major challenges facing the larger western alliance.\n\n“If you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7 … so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nIn an early sign of that diplomacy, the Elysee confirmed to CNN on Thursday a series of gifts exchanged between the world leaders and their spouses.\n\nMacron gifted his US counterpart a centerpiece from French goldsmith and tableware house, Christofle, the Elysee said. The present, crafted in 2012, is a tribute to the French transatlantic liner, the “Normandie,” which sailed with a Christofle silverware collection in the interwar period, per the Elysee.\n\nBiden was also presented with a vinyl record and CD of the soundtrack of the film “A man and a woman,” directed by Frenchman Claude Lelouch. The Elysee described the gift as a “nod to the personal history of the Biden couple” as they watched the 1966 film during their first date. The film also won France’s highest film award, the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden received two French literary works: a copy of “Madame Bovary,” by Gustave Flaubert, as well as a collection of essays written by Albert Camus, per the Elysee.\n\nFinally, Biden received two gifts from the Elysee Palace gift shop, a watch from watchmaker LIP and a jumper from the French brand Saint James.\n\nButter-poached Maine lobster and calotte of beef, shallot marmalade, are seen at the White House during a media preview of the state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron. Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Sipa USA/AP\n\nThe dinner has domestic political overtones, as well. As the Bidens roll out the red carpet for Macron and his wife Brigitte, there’s word they have two more state dinners in the works along with several other social events to come. Several people with knowledge of White House planning and operations, who spoke to CNN for this story, confirmed this State Dinner will be one of several hosted by the Biden administration in upcoming months.\n\nIt may suggest, said those familiar with the thinking around future state dinners, Biden indeed wants to run for a second term, something he has said he intends to do, but a decision that also hinges on the consent and support of his wife and extended family.\n\n“These are intricate – and expensive – events,” said one of the people, who has worked in the White House, of state dinners. “If the administration is willing to sink budget dollars into them, there’s probably a larger strategy at play.”\n\nThe guest list for Biden’s first state dinner was big from the start, made extra-large to include all of the people who have missed out on key social time with the president due to Covid-19 restrictions. Having done the mental calculations months ago as planning began, said two people familiar with the dinner’s details, the East Wing, the West Wing, the State Department and the National Security Council’s lists ballooned.\n\nAmong those attending the state dinner were celebrities and musicians, as well as top lawmakers, according to a printout of guests from the White House. Stephen Colbert, Anna Wintour and John Legend were among the invitees to rub shoulders with the likes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nTwo guests of Macron – the head designers for fashion house Oscar de la Renta, Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia – confirmed to CNN that Jill Biden wore the luxury label at the dinner.\n\nGarcia said they collaborated with the first lady for about two months on the dress, getting her input on what she wanted for the look, which included “a sense of ease.”\n\nThis first State Dinner offered the opportunity to finally make amends to VIPs and diplomats, members of Congress and deep-pocketed donors. A decision was made to hold the dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, which would allow them to comfortably seat the more than 400 guests expected to attend. (The White House is referring to the tent as a “pavilion,” as it has clear panels on the sides.)\n\nAn indoor dinner in the State Dining Room is limited by space restrictions – only about 120 guests can be accommodated. The second and last Trump administration State Dinner, for Australia, was held in the Rose Garden, which could seat approximately 200 for a formal dinner.\n\n“We’ve always expected a larger guest list as it’s the first state dinner of the Biden Administration,” Vanessa Valdivia, Jill Biden’s press secretary, told CNN.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe dinner for France was actually supposed to take place months prior, said the two people, but scheduling conflicts, including campaign trips for midterm elections, foreign travel and the wedding of Naomi Biden, meant the date was pushed back more than once. Thursday evening was ultimately where the schedules of several executive branch agencies landed with clear calendars.\n\nUnfortunately for the White House social offices and usher’s office, the final date also meant pulling off the ritual of holiday decorations and dozens of White House holiday parties in tandem with a debut State Dinner, something that has not been done before during a modern presidency. The White House calligraphers, kitchen staff, service teams and floral shop all worked to juggle the demands of overlapping, high-caliber events.\n\nAncillary kitchen space has been added with refrigeration units placed outside the White House kitchen area, as is usually the case for multiple or large social events, especially during the busy holiday party season where there can be as many as two or three receptions per day. (Three of the industrial-sized refrigerators outside earlier this week were labeled with the word “cheese,” in black magic marker – unclear whether for the French dinner, or holiday party nibbles.)\n\nFor the State Dinner, the Bidens have opted to use rental dishes, glasses, flatware, table accoutrements and linens. The venue, though on the White House grounds, does not allow for the official White House china services to be used for the dinner, said White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo. White House curators, who oversee the use of all items in the White House collection, do not count the temporarily installed tent as part of the campus – and thus the china of presidents’ past would not be part of the service.\n\nThe overall design and the floral arrangements were put together by an event planner, Jung Lee, and her company, Fete, a posh party design outfit favored by celebrities.\n\nA stage and dance floor was erected in the tent for the evening’s entertainment from singer Jon Batiste, a New Orleans native, a city Jill Biden said Wednesday is “shaped by both French and American culture.” The Macrons will visit New Orleans after Washington, before returning to France.\n\nWhite House Executive Chef Cris Comerford presents the menu during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe décor for the dinner was inspired by red, white and blue, the shared colors of the American and French flags, and “our common values: liberty and democracy, equality and fellowship,” said Biden at a preview of the table settings and menu.\n\nThe trick of a successful State Dinner format, says a former White House social secretary, is to seamlessly and organically combine elements from both the United States and the visiting country, an offering of hospitality on the side of a main course of diplomacy. But without being too hokey about it.\n\nThe flowers on the tables Thursday night were mostly roses; American Beauty varietals and Piano Roses, deep red blooms because, as Elizondo said, Emmanuel Macron likes the piano. French-made Champagne flutes were used for toasting, but filled with American sparkling wine. Tall candelabras holding blood-red candles are meant to mimic the Statue of Liberty, France’s gift to the United States. And so on.\n\nThe table setting is something the first lady has said is always her first consideration when hosting anyone for a meal, a memory from her childhood and her mother. “Even if we were only having fish sticks from the freezer, she always made our dinners feel special,” said Biden, who is expected to make remarks at the dinner.\n\n“The first lady has been involved since the beginning, it’s been important to her that the dinner reflects the warmth and approachable hospitality that the Bidens are known for,” Valdivia said.\n\nA person with knowledge of the first lady’s hands-on approach to the dinner said she was involved with all aspects of the planning, down to doing tastings of each dish and overseeing the seating chart, much like her immediate predecessor, Melania Trump, whose first state dinner also happened to be for the Macrons. Unlike the Trump dinner, the Bidens served caviar and butter-poached lobster for a first-course, Calotte of beef and watercress and sunchoke salad for the main. Trump went with goat cheese gateau with tomato jam, and a rack of lamb. Though the two dinners would share a dessert: crème fraiche ice cream.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnother common thread with Biden’s immediate predecessor is the lack of a high number of state dinners by this time in his presidency. However, for much of it, Biden has not been able due to the pandemic to host parties. Trump had a third State Dinner in the works – for the King and Queen of Spain – but canceled it as the pandemic took hold around the world.\n\nBiden is also not as inclined socially to host big events at the White House, Covid-19 restrictions or not. The first couple has notably spent most weekends away from Washington in Delaware or Camp David, and as a closely bonded family, there are few occasions where guest lists for dinners expand beyond relatives.\n\nPrevious presidents have used the White House frequently to entertain, typically with a subtext, whether political or cultural. In recent history, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted birthday parties and music concerts, bringing together celebrities and politicians for fun-filled, late nights of elbow-rubbing and bonding. The Obamas’ State Dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande in 2014 brought a star-studded guest list that included Bradley Cooper, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Stephen Colbert and Elon Musk.\n\nSinger Mary J. Blige entertained at the dinner. By contrast, Trump’s two state dinners lacked bold-faced guests and headliners, as his political leanings were often antithetical from those of mainstream Hollywood. (For the Trump State Dinner for Macron, the Washington National Opera performed, which a guest told CNN was lovely, “but it wasn’t Beyonce.”)\n\nUS President Gerald Ford dances with Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during a state dinner in Washington, DC, in 1976.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images In pictures: White House state dinners Prev Next\n\nGoing back further, presidents accumulated State Dinners as a means to help soothe icy relationships, or build support on geopolitical crises.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, for example, continued to hold State Dinners during World War II, to pull in allies. Dwight Eisenhower in 1959 hosted Nikita Khrushchev, the first State Dinner for a Soviet leader, to help quell concerns of escalating nuclear tension. Jimmy Carter was not a big party guy – the State Dinners hosted by the president and Rosalyn Carter did not include hard liquor, just beer and wine – but he had held 33 State Dinners by this time in his tenure. After the signing of the Panama Canal treaties, Carter hosted one state dinner for 18 Latin American heads of state, according to data collected by the White House Historical Association.\n\nAs time went on, guest lists for the dinners routinely grew, observed by the orders for presidential china sets, which went from accommodating about 100 people, to the most recent official set for the Obamas, which accommodated 320 people. Biden, in other words, still has the time and the space to showcase the highest form of diplomacy this country can offer another world leader. And he intends to.\n\n“There are more being planned and in the works for the future,” said one of the people with knowledge of the larger Biden State Dinner strategy. “This is just the start.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/joe-biden-first-year-in-office/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden enters the second year of his presidency looking for a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs he walked through the front gate of the White House complex last year for the first time as President, Joe Biden declared it felt like “going home.”\n\nIf the presidency seemed then like a natural fit for a 50-year creature of Washington, today its limits are leading to a reckoning over expectations and ambitions in a country as exhausted, angry and divided as ever.\n\nBiden enters the second year of his term with one of the lowest approval ratings of a modern-day president, depleted of the political capital and sense of confidence that followed him into office.\n\nA sense of normalcy returned to the White House following the whiplash of Donald Trump’s presidency, but a string of setbacks – at home and abroad – have eroded the air of competence that once surrounded a President and his team, who have spent most of their lives in government and campaigned for the job on a pledge of restoring order.\n\nOn most days since January 20, 2021, the President has arrived at the Oval Office early in the morning, peppered his team with detailed questions and tried not to think too much about the man who’d just vacated the building, leaving behind a pandemic, angry divisions and – inside a drawer of the Resolute Desk – a lengthy letter for Biden. The President has worked to make the place his own, installing his family’s furniture, ordering up chocolate ice cream bars branded with the presidential seal and returning to traditions his predecessor abandoned.\n\nThe 12 months Biden has been in office did come with major victories. He successfully guided passage of trillions in new funding to combat the coronavirus pandemic and rebuild American’s crumbling infrastructure through Congress. He has appointed more federal judges than his recent predecessors, overseen a boom in hiring, a drop in poverty and orchestrated a nationwide vaccination campaign.\n\nYet for all that, the country remains fractured and irritable. A “malaise” has sunk in as the pandemic persists, his vice president conceded in an interview this month. Americans are misbehaving on airplanes, in school board meetings and at grocery stores. So entrenched is the anger that one father felt comfortable blurting out a coded derogatory phrase about Biden when he was speaking to the President on the phone last Christmas Eve – while his own son watched on.\n\n“There are successes that he’s had, but people do not feel it and you can’t persuade people to feel better. You can’t jawbone that,” said David Axelrod, a senior adviser in former President Barack Obama’s White House and a CNN senior political commentator.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden is not actively stoking the anger. But his inaugural speech pledge to “end this uncivil war” remains unfulfilled.\n\nBiden’s trademark personal style – wielded over breakfasts in Delaware, inside caucus rooms on Capitol Hill and across the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office – hasn’t brought around holdout Democrats to some of his boldest ideas, let alone many Republicans.\n\nRELATED: Battered White House searches for a Biden comeback scenario\n\nOverseas, a full-blown conflict now looms with Moscow just six months after coming face-to-face with the Russian leader in an old villa in Geneva. And after declaring “independence from the virus” on the South Lawn in July, Biden is contemplating Covid’s permanent presence going forward.\n\nOn a personal level, just adjusting to life in the White House has been a struggle. By his own admission, Biden finds the place stifling and regularly spends three nights a week elsewhere.\n\nBlame game\n\nEven as top advisers and longtime friends of Biden try to help reset a floundering presidency, recriminations have quietly surfaced inside the West Wing about the fundamental causes of the challenges.\n\nA considerable share of finger-pointing is aimed at deep divisions among Democrats and how some top officials have sought to accommodate progressives in hopes of keeping peace inside the party.\n\n“Over the last year, the White House has allowed the left to hijack and misinterpret the rationale for Biden’s election,” said one former Democratic official in regular touch with the President, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the West Wing. “He was not elected to transform the country.”\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain, a longtime Biden adviser, is at the middle of those internal tensions. He is seen by some observers as pushing his own agenda or being too quick to side with demands from liberals, which raises expectations that ultimately lead to disappointment.\n\nWhen Democrats clinched their razor-thin majority in the Senate, following the Georgia runoff victories for Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, those expectations skyrocketed far beyond what the narrowly divided Senate has been able to deliver. The expected failure of voting rights legislation is only the latest example.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to members of the media as he leaves a meeting with the Senate Democratic Caucus to discuss voting rights and election integrity on Capitol Hill on January 13. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\n“They pushed for everything you would have thought they would have done if they had 58 or 60 Democrats,” one lawmaker told CNN, who lamented how Biden’s first year is ending with a focus on what he didn’t accomplish rather than what he did.\n\n“Either your message is wrong, or your approach is wrong. Something is wrong.”\n\nAt the center of the White House challenges, though, is Biden himself and what even many longtime admirers describe as unremarkable and uneven performances. Several members of Congress who speak with Biden frequently told CNN that his grasp of details is impressive, but how he communicates that publicly is often anything but.\n\nHeading into a tumultuous midterm election year, where Democrats are already bracing for the prospect of losing control of the House and possibly the Senate, the White House said Biden will spend more of his time communicating directly with the American people, rather than trying to negotiate deals in Congress.\n\nThat promise, however, rings familiar. The administration has repeatedly promised that Biden would spend more time on the road selling his plans, yet he has traveled less than most recent predecessors.\n\n“There should be some really significant issues that we should be able to come around and coalesce around and get done. And I think we can. I think we can get it done. And we need the President, we need the administration to lead the way. They’re in charge. The buck stops there. There is no doubt about, and we need to get things done. We’re not doing good enough,” said Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who is running for Senate in the state.\n\n“The President is the President, and there is no question that he bears some responsibility for it. But there is also Congress and the Senate, and the Republicans are MIA. They’re worthless,” Ryan said on CNN.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday hailed the legislative successes and the economic strides, despite coming into office under what she described as “an incredibly difficult circumstance.”\n\n“You don’t get everything done in the first year,” Psaki said. “The work is not done. The job is not done, and we are certainly not conveying that it is.”\n\nConfronting Covid\n\nAs his second year begins, advisers tell CNN that Covid-19 and its messy fallout is the biggest weight on Biden – the one challenge he believes could reverse his fortunes or forever damage his presidency.\n\nBiden has made significant strides, particularly in getting hundreds of millions of Americans vaccinated. But millions still refuse to get shots, a persistent source of frustration for the President.\n\n“This virus has fooled us multiple times,” one senior health official told CNN. “Nobody expected Delta to just blow us away. And then to have Omicron come out of nowhere, it’s a big, big surprise.”\n\nRELATED: Biden vowed to fix testing. But he didn’t plan for Omicron.\n\nStill, the President has maintained the same mentality throughout. He has repeatedly advised his team that while outsiders will quickly point out any of their missteps, “you should keep your head down and keep working.”\n\n“He’s not panicking. He’s not blaming anyone,” the official said.\n\nTrillions of dollars in Covid relief funds helped alleviate some of the economic stresses of the pandemic, but even Biden has admitted the influx of cash into the economy may have driven up consumer prices. Inflation triggered by a Covid-related mismatch between supply and demand remains a drag on the President’s approval ratings.\n\nPresident Joe Biden removes his mask before speaking about updated CDC mask guidance on the North Lawn of the White House on April 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBiden’s poll numbers began taking a southward turn over the summer, when it became clear his celebrations of a waning virus were premature. Mask recommendations returned, shutdowns persisted and the once-hopeful feeling disappeared. Confusing messaging from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been a source of constant irritation in the West Wing.\n\nIn other ways, the pandemic has altered the normal rhythms of executive branch life. Unable to travel as extensively as he’d once hoped, Biden has taken to conducting events from an elaborate stage-set built in a White House auditorium where participants can beam in on video-chat. He has traveled abroad only twice, a slower pace than his predecessors.\n\nOrdinarily the West Wing and its adjacent offices are a hive of activity, where at any single moment meetings could be unfolding on dozens of pressing topics. But even a year into his presidency, Covid has left some staffers still working at home. Those who are selected for a meeting with the President himself must arrive well beforehand to undergo testing by the White House Medical Unit. What once could have been a 30-minute block of a Cabinet secretary or lawmaker’s day becomes more of an ordeal.\n\n“You know what it takes to go meet with the President?” said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra last month. “It’s just a pain. And you knock out so much of your day. You’ve got to get tested, what is it, an hour and a half before you can see the President, you got to hang around there. So, the actual physical one-on-one, not as often.”\n\nCalls for a reset\n\nGrowing anxious ahead of this year’s midterm elections, many Democrats have issued various calls for a strategy reset – on Covid, the economy and communications. Some have privately questioned whether Biden – whose public schedule sometimes contains only a few events per week – is doing enough to promote his accomplishments and break through to voters.\n\nBiden’s speeches often rely on the same lengthy passages, recited verbatim from a teleprompter. When he does leave Washington, his events have tended to adopt a familiar look: a tour of a factory or plant, a speech to a group of unionized workers and up to an hour of shaking hands afterward. His top-visited state, aside from Delaware where he travels home on weekends, was Pennsylvania.\n\nAt moments, the nation’s oldest President shows his age. After he reminisced about working with noted segregationist Strom Thurmond in a speech about voting rights last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed perplexed: “None of us have a lot of happy memories about Strom Thurmond,” she said afterward.\n\nQuestions persist about whether he plans to run again in 2024. And missteps by his vice president, Kamala Harris – whose allies believe she is both underutilized as a political asset and overexposed to difficult issues – have led to deeper introspection about the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nAfter urging from party strategists, Biden has lately begun drawing sharper contrasts with Republicans and speaking out louder about the corrosive lies peddled by Trump. The President has begun staging more events meant to highlight the benefits of what he has been able to accomplish, like passing the largest public works bill in decades.\n\nPresident Joe Biden disembarks from Air Force One upon arrival at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, July 28, 2021, after traveling to Pennsylvania to speak on the economy. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHeading into the new year, the White House has drawn up executive actions on issues like police reform for Biden to act where Congress won’t.\n\nAnd White House officials and Democratic lawmakers are beginning to quietly plot a way forward on Biden’s sweeping spending agenda, including potentially splitting it into pieces.\n\nBiden has stood accused by some progressives, including his onetime rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Bernie Sanders, of failing to pursue an agenda focused on real-world economic issues. It’s a charge that stings for the President who still makes a point in meetings of asking how policy proposals will affect pipefitters and construction workers in his Pennsylvania hometown, and angrily scolds advisers for using jargon those people wouldn’t understand.\n\nHis top aides insist Biden’s achievements have been squarely focused on improving conditions for the working class.\n\n“I would not say that the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class. We have had historic successes in the first year of the Biden presidency, the passage of the American Rescue Plan, to give one example, has cut child poverty in this country almost in half,” said Susan Rice, Biden’s domestic policy adviser, last week on CNN. “We have put very important supports in the pockets of the American people at a time when the pandemic has made their economic prospects perilous.”\n\nManaging expectations\n\nIn many ways, Biden’s first year was defined by expectations getting away from him: about the trajectory of the pandemic, the durability of Trump and the ability of a governing veteran to find solutions to any of it. At junctures throughout the year, Biden appeared caught by surprise when challenges arose that, at least in retrospect, were not surprising.\n\nWhen the Taliban swiftly took control of Afghanistan in August, Biden said it happened quicker than anyone expected – despite intelligence warnings painting a grim picture following a complete American withdrawal.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pauses as he listens to a question about the bombings at the Kabul airport that killed at least 12 U.S. service members, from the East Room of the White House in August 2021. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nWhen France erupted in anger following his deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, Biden said he thought someone had given Paris a heads up that their own agreement to provide conventional subs was off – even though no one had.\n\nWhen Biden said in June that inflation would “pop up a little bit and then go back down,” he was discounting warnings from veterans of Democratic administrations of a more serious trend – one that continues six months later.\n\nAnd when testing shortages at the start of the latest Covid surge caused mile-long lines, Biden said he wished he’d thought of ordering millions more tests earlier – even though health experts have been warning for months of a looming shortage.\n\nRepeatedly appearing caught off-guard by events undercut Biden’s promise of restoring competence to government and predictability on the world stage and led to accusations he was being poorly served by his team. It belied a President who, behind the scenes, solicits a wide range of opinions on critical issues and engages a panel of advisers inside and outside government. The process has sometimes delayed critical decisions, giving the impression of indecisiveness.\n\nAfter the harrowing Afghanistan ordeal, there were calls to fire his national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Others have urged Biden to replace his Covid response coordinator Jeff Zients. After publicly sinking prospects for quick passage of the Build Back Better plan, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia vented frustration at White House staff he said drove him to his “wit’s end.”\n\nWhether Biden plans to replace anyone in the new year remains to be seen; he is a known deliberator and hasn’t executed any major personnel changes since taking office. The advisers he continues to rely upon most – chief of staff Ron Klain and senior advisers Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti – have worked for him for decades.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean there aren’t voices advocating for changes in the West Wing.\n\n“If I was down [this much] in my ratings, I’d have a new chief of staff,” one prominent Democrat who speaks regularly with Biden said.\n\nA struggle to adjust\n\nThe pandemic has not been the only factor contributing to an uneasy transition to White House life. After spending eight years haunting the West Wing, Biden had only been upstairs to the private presidential residence once during his time as vice president.\n\nWhen he moved into the executive mansion last year, staff crowded him at awkward hours, including in the early mornings. Someone was always just outside the door or walking quietly through the hallways. It was a way of life Biden wasn’t accustomed to – and did not enjoy.\n\nAttempts to make the place feel more like home had mixed results. Some of the furniture from his home in Delaware made its way to the White House. Books and family photographs adorn shelves and tables that previously held antiques from the White House collection. But the family German Shepherd Major was dispatched permanently to a friend’s house after a series of nipping incidents (a new puppy, Commander, arrived late last year).\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, look at their new dog Commander, after speaking virtually with military service members to thank them for their service and wish them a Merry Christmas, from the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOver the course of the year, Biden and the first lady requested some changes. No longer are chefs or Secret Service agents posted in the private kitchen on his third-floor residence during breakfast hours; instead, he can wander in wearing a bathrobe and pour himself a bowl of Special K cereal before lifting weights in the residence gym.\n\nWaiting for him in the morning is a notecard with his schedule for the day, which Biden marks with checks as each meeting is completed, and a stapled-together compilation of daily news clips called “The Bulletin.” He packs it all in a worn leather briefcase to carry with him downstairs to the office.\n\nA focus on the familiar has extended beyond the White House. When Biden met Putin in Geneva last summer, an aide made sure to bring along a bottle of orange Gatorade, the President’s preferred drink. And even when he is traveling, Biden places daily phone calls to his grandchildren, who remain at the center of his personal life.\n\nThe third time was a charm in Biden’s quest for the presidency, with a triumph in 2020 after falling well short in the campaigns of 1988 and 2008. The question that many of his longtime admirers raise in quiet conversations is whether Biden still approaches the job and, in fact, Washington in the same way he might have decades ago.\n\nThere’s little question that the outcome of his second year – and his ability to spark a turnaround, as many presidents before him have – will help shape how Biden answers the biggest question of all, likely by this time next year: whether he will run again in 2024.", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny Kevin Liptak Kaitlan Collins", "Jeff Zeleny", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/01/05/congressman-greg-murphy-electoral-college-objection-joint-session/4138533001/", "title": "Greg Murphy is one of several NC reps objecting Biden's Electoral ...", "text": "Congressman Greg Murphy M.D. joins several other lawmakers across the state planning to object certain Electoral College votes during a special Joint Session of Congress Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPresident Donald Trump continues to erroneously claim he won the election, and several Republican lawmakers say they plan to help fight the election results in the next step of the certification process.\n\nThe session will be held at 1 p.m. in Washington D.C. in order to certify the presidential election results. A formal count will take place of the votes cast by the Electoral College. Democratic Presidential Elect Joe Biden received 306 while President Donald Trump fell short at 232.\n\nThe Constitution requires both chambers of Congress to meet before the inauguration to count the electoral votes from every state. Though Congress is expected to certify the votes, this typically ceremonial event has drawn more attention this year because a group of Republican lawmakers have indicated they plan to contest the results.\n\nTrump has met with some members to discuss plans to object to Biden's Electoral College win. The effort is sure to fail in the Democratic-controlled House and likely in the Senate, where several Republicans led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have warned colleagues not to challenge the Electoral College vote. Several, including McConnell, have acknowledged Biden as the victor.\n\nMurphy, along with others, calls for the integrity of the country's election process to be preserved. In 2016, the argument of the popular vote versus the Electoral College was dispatched during Trump's victory as Murphy described it as the purest way to gather the pulse of what the country's needs are.\n\n\"Our founding fathers were geniuses and every region needs to have a voice. If we were to do it by popular vote, five cities would determine the fate of the nation. We wouldn't know about the breadbasket of the midwest or the Colorado Rockies telling us what is going on so this is a very good compromise rather,\" Murphy added.\n\nQuestioning the key swing states, Murphy was explicit when explaining his stance on whether or not those states violated the Constitution. He also claims executive officials and judges usurped the legislative power in order to rewrite election laws from \"thin air\".\n\nWhen it comes to Pennsylvania, Murphy said not only did the state violate the U.S. Constitution but their own constitution and accused state officials of tampering with their own voting laws.\n\n\"They allowed votes without verification. They changed the rules on how long voting would occur, many different things that they themselves literally changed and not the legislature of the state. It is very clear who determines election law, not the secretary of state and not the state board of elections.\"\n\nWhen asked about North Carolina incumbents Governor Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein's alleged efforts on similar issues during the general election and why others aren't objecting against them, Murphy explained it depends on how egregious the violations were.\n\nMurphy's accusations against the pair regards to claims of getting rid of signature verification for voting and allowing unofficial ballot drop boxes. Murphy said he won't object to North Carolina's electoral votes due to those being \"minor issues\" that were blocked during the election.\n\nSome of those minor issues include the alleged switching of ballots on voting machines and ballots being found in states overnight.\n\n\"Unfortunately multiple states, some more egregiously than others, violated that section of the Constitution. Whether objecting would change the outcome is not the question that must be addressed. It is rather, did certain states follow their constitutional duties in how they chose electors.\"\n\nMurphy believes the election itself won't be overturned due to the House of Representatives not having enough votes to do so, but what he is hopeful for is his actions will highlight what he says is an \"intentional violation of the constitution\".\n\n“Americans deserve a free, fair, and accurate election. One in which all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, have confidence in the results,\" Murphy said in a statement to the press. \"I have been quite vocal in stating that to preserve the integrity of our elections, we must fight to ensure that every voice is heard, every legal vote is counted, and every count is confirmed.\"\n\nNewly elected representative in the 11th Congressional District Madison Cawthorn, 13th District Congressman Ted Budd, Eighth District Congressman Richard Hudson and 7th District Congressman David Rouzer are others in North Carolina who have announced their intentions to object on Wednesday.\n\nThe fight during the joint session isn't only about the 2020 election but future elections as well.\n\n\"Unless we solve this problem now by objecting and calling into question the irregularities in the process this year, it will call into question the integrity of every election this nation faces moving forward. The fact that executive officials and judges in several states usurped the legislative power to rewrite election law from thin air is at best troubling and at worst seditious. It is clear these issues warrant further scrutiny,” concluded Murphy.\n\nReporter Trevor Dunnell can be reached by email at tdunnell@jdnews.com.USA Today contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/china/958331/how-strong-are-taiwans-military-defences", "title": "How strong are Taiwan's military defences? | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Thank you for honouring us for a win for the ages,” he said.\n\nThe nearly 20% margin over Democrat Charlie Crist was “epic in its scope”, said Politico. Not only because DeSantis “took Miami-Dade County – long the firewall for Democrats – but he also won relatively reliable Democratic-leaning counties such as Palm Beach and Osceola”.

On the contrary, it was seen as one of Europe’s most corrupt countries, ruled by oligarchs and riddled with graft and corruption.\n\nNo surprise then that war with Russia seems to have thrown up glorious business opportunities for several politicians and civil servants. Yet the sheer scale of the graft scandal now engulfing the Ukrainian government is still pretty staggering, said Alisa Orlova in the Kyiv Post.\n\nZelenskyy’s shake-up\n\nAt least 12 senior officials have resigned or been sacked by President Zelenskyy in a sweeping shake-up of Ukraine’s wartime leadership, among them the deputy defence minister Vyacheslav Shapovalov, who quit over allegations that he’d overseen the purchase of food for the army at inflated prices; and Zelenskyy’s deputy, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, who, at a time of extreme austerity, was seen driving around Kyiv in a luxury Porsche.\n\nThen there’s deputy infrastructure minister Vasyl Lozynskiy, who has been sacked after being arrested for allegedly taking a $400,000 kickback from a procurement tender for winter aid. Who said dodgy dealings were a thing of the past in Kyiv?\n\nSome view this crackdown as a welcome effort by Zelenskyy to “clean house” and show that the “ostentatious lifestyle” enjoyed by corrupt officials won’t be tolerated in wartime Ukraine, said Oleg Sukhov in The Kyiv Independent. Others, however, are of the view that his reshuffle is more a product of political infighting than a genuine anti-corruption drive.\n\nWhy, for example, wasn’t Zelenskyy’s “notorious” deputy chief of staff, Oleh Tatarov, on the list of departing officials? After all, he was charged with bribery in 2020 – a case only dropped when prosecutors loyal to the president effectively nixed the investigation.\n\nClearly corruption is still a systemic problem in Ukraine, said Yulia Klymenko in Ukrainska Pravda (Kyiv). Procurement contracts seem deliberately confusing, accounting trails opaque. Until these faults are corrected, there’ll always be a gang of people with their noses in the trough.\n\n‘Keeping officials under a magnifying glass’\n\nThere’s some good news in all this, said Yulia Lavryshyn on Zn.Ua (Kyiv). The war may have provided cover for crooks, but the slew of media revelations that has brought about the ousting of these officials shows that Ukraine’s free press is well capable of “keeping officials under a magnifying glass” even in the present dire circumstances.\n\nOrdinary Ukrainians are understandably furious that graft remains so prevalent in their country, said Stefan Wolff and Tatyana Malyarenko on The Conversation (Melbourne). Ukraine’s economy is being battered by the war, and while these people are feasting on public funds most people are struggling to survive.\n\nBut few hold Zelenskyy responsible for the ongoing scandals: his approval ratings remain sky high and most people back him to make good on his prewar promises to root out wrongdoing. It’s imperative he does so. Last week’s welcome news that both Germany and the US will send tanks to Ukraine was “clearly linked” to Zelenskyy’s new anti-graft initiative.

This year's hajj is taking place from Sept. 22-26.\n\nAt least 107 dead in crane collapse in Mecca's Grand Mosque\n\nOne of the other more recent disasters occurred on Jan. 12, 2006. At least 340 people were killed and 290 injured in a stampede that started when a busload of pilgrims unloaded near a ramp to the Jamaraat Bridge. Pilgrims began tripping over luggage, which resulted in a deadly crush of people rushing to carry out the devil-stoning ritual in Mina. About 2.5 million people from around the world participated in the hajj that year.\n\nIn the devil-stoning ritual, Muslim pilgrims fling pebbles at three walls in Mina. It is one of a series of ritual acts that must be performed in the hajj. After the 2006 incident, the Jamaraat Bridge and the pillars representing the devil were demolished and reconstructed. A wider, multilevel bridge was built with massive columns. Each level of the bridge now allows easier and safer access to the columns representing the devil.\n\nOther incidents:\n\n• Feb. 1, 2004: A stampede at the devil-stoning ritual left 251 pilgrims dead and 244 injured.\n\n• Feb. 11, 2003: Fourteen pilgrims died during the devil-stoning ritual.\n\n• March 5, 2001: A stampede at the devil-stoning ritual resulted in the deaths of 35 pilgrims.\n\n• April 9, 1998: At least 118 pilgrims were trampled to death and 180 injured on the Jamaraat Bridge.\n\n• May 23, 1994: A stampede at the devil-stoning ritual killed at least 270.\n\n• July 2, 1990 : A stampede inside a pedestrian tunnel leading from Mecca resulted in the deaths of 1,426 pilgrims.\n\nContributing: Jane Onyanga-Omara\n\n.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/us/missouri-amtrak-train-derailment/index.html", "title": "Amtrak train derails in Missouri: Multiple people killed and at least ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThree people are dead and at least 50 injured after an Amtrak train derailed Monday in Missouri, authorities said Monday evening.\n\nCpl.

Don’t go out.”\n\nHe said emergency responders will go, and have gone, to homes without heat and take people to warming shelters. Too many people, including residents just going out to see the massive snowfall, are going out in their vehicles and getting stuck and blocking recovery efforts, he said.\n\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted that 14 people in the county had died of exposure, three people were found in their vehicles, four had no heat, three were from “shoveling/(snow) blowing cardiac events, and three people passed away after EMS services were delayed.\n\nHe told CNN that unfortunately it appears the numbers will go up.\n\n“I am aware of additional bodies that have been recovered and are being brought to our temporary morgue,” he told The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. “We’ve had so many bodies that various hospitals are full and we’re just having to go through and determine if the individuals have died from a blizzard-related death.”\n\n“It’s just been a horrible, horrible situation,” he added.\n\nThe deadly storm comes just one month after the region was slammed with a historic snowstorm.\n\nAnd snow was continuing to fall Monday. At a morning news conference, Poloncarz noted officials expect between 8 and 12 more inches of snow to fall between Monday morning and 1 p.m. Tuesday. “This is not helpful as we’re trying to recover and clear off streets and get into areas that still have not” been plowed, he said.\n\nWhile driving bans have been lifted in some communities, one such order remains in place in Buffalo, Poloncarz said, describing the city is “impassable in most areas,” with abandoned vehicles scattered everywhere.\n\nEven emergency and recovery vehicles sent out to help have gotten stuck in the snow as rescue crews and hundreds of snowplow drivers fanned out on Christmas.

Poloncarz said in Monday’s news conference the current storm’s “ferocity … was worse than the blizzard of ’77.” The death toll in that storm was 23 people, 22 of whom died in Erie County.\n\nAnd in a news conference Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called this storm the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history.” On Monday, she requested President Joe Biden issue federal emergency declarations for Erie and Genesee counties.\n\n“I spoke with @GovKathyHochul to get an update on the extreme winter weather hitting New York,” Biden tweeted. “We stand ready to make sure they have the resources they need to get through this. My heart is with those who lost loved ones this holiday weekend. You are in my and Jill’s prayers.”\n\nHundreds of National Guard troops have been deployed to help with rescue efforts in New York. State police had been involved in over 500 rescues by Sunday, including delivering a baby, Hochul said.\n\nWhile abandoned vehicles pepper the snow-covered roadways, conditions are also difficult inside homes.\n\nSome residents have remained in their homes for more than two days, some without power in the freezing cold, Hochul said Sunday – due not to a lack of resources, but the challenges utility companies face in terms of mobility and access. As of Sunday evening, however, 94.5% of Erie County residents and 87% of Buffalo residents have had their power restored, Hochul said.\n\nAs of Monday, fewer than 10,000 customers were without power, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said in an afternoon news conference, adding temperatures in his own home dropped to 40 degrees. “We certainly understand the challenges that so many families are going through and the frustration that people are facing.”\n\nWinter storm warnings remain in effect in New York for Jefferson and Lewis counties until 1 p.m. Tuesday.

Since the start of the storm, the number of outages has at times exceeded a million customers.\n\nElectricity was not the sole utility impacted: Jackson, Mississippi, issued a boil water notice Sunday after its water system lost pressure due to line breaks “likely caused by the weather,” officials said on Facebook. The city – which just two months ago overcame a separate lengthy water crisis – distributed water to residents throughout Christmas Day.\n\nThe storm also snarled travel in the US during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday and more than 3,100 canceled on Christmas.\n\nAbout 3,800 flights into or out of US airports have been canceled as of 7 p.m. ET Monday, according to tracking site FlightAware. The total includes more than 2,500 flights canceled by Southwest Airlines, according to FlightAware.\n\nSouthwest said in a statement: “With consecutive days of extreme winter weather across our network behind us, continuing challenges are impacting our Customers and Employees in a significant way that is unacceptable.\n\n“And our heartfelt apologies for this are just beginning.”\n\nAnother 7,000 US flights have been delayed, according to FlightAware.\n\nSeparately, the Buffalo Niagara International Airport, which closed Friday due to “hazardous weather conditions” and saw 43 inches of snow, is expected to remain closed until late Wednesday morning, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority said on Twitter.

And between 2 to 6 inches are expected from parts of the US southeast to the southern and central Appalachians and western mid-Atlantic, the hurricane center said.\n\nNicole weakened to a tropical storm shortly after landfall, and then became a depression late Thursday. It’s expected to become a post-tropical cyclone over the Southeast.\n\nHere’s what to know now:\n\nResidents outside Florida should now prepare: There are nearly three million people under a tornado watch issued for southeast Georgia, eastern and southern South Carolina and portions of far southern North Carolina. “Given the uncertainty of the storm’s strength and path as it approaches South Carolina, residents need to have their personal emergency plans ready to go just in case we need to take safety precautions later in the week,” said Kim Stenson, who heads the state’s emergency management division.\n\nTens of thousands without power: More than 237,000 homes and businesses in Florida were without power late Thursday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nLow tide limits storm surge: Nicole’s peak winds coincided with low tide, limiting the storm surge and inundation on the shore. At Port Canaveral, the surge was measured at just under 6 feet around 4 a.m. ET, just after landfall. Later Thursday morning, surge was down to around 3 feet, but water levels are expected to remain high through high tide, between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.\n\nNicole's storm surge pushes Wednesday into East Boynton Beach in Florida.

King Tides is a term used to describe higher than normal tidal cycles that typically occur during a new moon or a full moon when the moon makes its closest pass to the Earth. When they coincide with bad weather including heavy rain, winds and waves, they can cause severe flooding. Because of rising sea levels, King Tides are becoming more frequent and severe.\n\nFlights canceled and schools closed: The storm’s colossal path led to the closure of many schools, colleges and universities, as well as the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the shuttering of amusement parks.

No one was killed and only a few people suffered only minor injuries in the collapse, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo to dubbed \"miraculous.\"\n\nSix of the bridge's seven lanes were reopened that evening, after the debris was removed, but the bridge's southernmost lane had a hole punctured through the road deck that took longer to repair.\n\nTHE CITATION: View the citation from OSHA to the Tappan Zee Constructors\n\nWHAT'S IN A NAME: Conservative Party says name new TZB after Brinks victims\n\nSTATE OF TRANSPORTATION: What's on tap for 2017?\n\nIn its citation, OSHA said the crane struck both the standing bridge and a cofferdam, a structure that allows construction work below the waterline, where employees were working.\n\nThe agency said the the vibratory hammer crews were using to extract and pre-position a partially driven pile came loose unexpectedly and that the capacity of the crane was lower than required.\n\nThe crane, made by Manitowoc Cranes, was the only one of its kind working on the bridge.\n\nAdditionally, the vibratory hammer had leaky hydraulic hoses, OSHA said.\n\nAccording to the citation, Tappan Zee Constructors can attempt to either adjust or contest the citation and penalty.\n\nA spokesman for the constructors said in an email Thursday that they would follow \"their process allowing for additional review.\"\n\nThe bridge project is one of the safest big construction projects in the country.\n\n\"The safety of our workers and the surrounding community is our top priority, which is why we have been recognized as one of the safest major construction projects in the country,\" wrote Tappan Zee Constructors spokesman Damien LaVera.\n\nTappan Zee Constructors also was fined $9,000 for three health and safety code violations in 2015, negotiated down from a $14,000 penalty. Two of those violations were considered serious.\n\nIt is still unclear whether or not the Thruway Authority intends to or has fined the Tappan Zee Constructors itself for the accident.\n\nAccording to the contract between the two, the state can levy heavy fines when lanes are closed, impacting traffic.\n\nFor example, if lanes shuttered on the existing bridge to facilitate new bridge construction don't open on time, Tappan Zee Constructors can be fined up to $1,500 a minute.\n\nTwitter: @coynerpeorts", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/us/hurricane-ian-florida-recovery-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Ian's death toll rises as crews in Florida go door to door in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter Hurricane Ian obliterated communities in Florida, rescue crews going door to door in search of survivors are reporting more deaths, and residents grappling with loss are facing a long, daunting recovery.\n\nAs of Tuesday, at least 109 people have been reported killed by the hurricane in the United States, with 105 of those deaths in Florida and 55 of them in Lee County.

The governor also announced the opening of the first Disaster Recovery Center – or “one-stop shop” – in Fort Myers for residents and businesses that have been affected by Hurricane Ian.\n\nLive updates: Hurricane Ian’s aftermath in Florida\n\nSome residents who were anxiously waiting to hear from their loved ones have received unimaginable news.\n\nStacy Verdream told CNN she and her brother found out Monday their uncle, Mike Verdream, died in the storm. Mike Verdream decided to ride out Hurricane Ian in Matlacha, Florida, and planned to go to his boss’ two-story home if things got too bad.\n\nStacy Verdream said she spoke with her uncle briefly on Wednesday. Her cousin spoke with him later that day and he said the water was 4 feet deep before telling her he had to go.\n\n“It was a very brief call because he said he was very scared and she’d never heard him like that, because he wasn’t that type of person. He’s always put on a brave face,” Stacy Verdream said. “But she said he sounded absolutely terrified.”\n\nThe family was unable to reach Mike Verdream because his phone was wet, his niece said. A detective told Stacy Verdream on Tuesday that her uncle was found in a canal on Friday. The condition of his body was consistent with other victims that had been recovered, Verdream said. Authorities used medical records to identify her uncle because his face was not recognizable, Verdream said. An autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\n“He was always there for me growing up, teaching me how to drive and taking me to the fair,” she said. “The cool uncle that would buy me like a dirt bike and bought the Jet ski for us to, like, go out on the lake. He just loved us to death.”\n\nA home lies in ruins Monday in the wake of Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers Beach. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nElizabeth McGuire’s family said they last spoke with her Wednesday and had been having trouble reaching her. They learned Friday that the 49-year-old had been found dead in her Cape Coral home.\n\nPolice told her family she died in her bed holding her cell phone and it looked like she died instantly, her son Andrew Chedester said.\n\nMcGuire’s mother, Susan McGuire, said the destruction of the storm “is massive.”\n\n“One hundred blizzards will not cost you what one hurricane will cost you,” said Susan McGuire, who moved to Florida from Maryland a few years ago. “My husband’s business whipped out, my daughter is dead … I never had a blizzard take anything away from me.”\n\nHomes are ‘unlivable’ on islands cut off from the mainland, with ‘alligators running around’\n\nOn Sanibel Island, now cut off from the Florida peninsula after Ian wiped out a portion of the roadway connecting them, every house shows damage, Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said.\n\n“There are a lot of places that are not livable. There are places off their foundation, and it’s very dangerous out there,” Briscoe said. “There are alligators running around, and there are snakes all over the place.”\n\nCrews have evacuated 1,000 people from Sanibel since Ian ripped through the island, Briscoe said.\n\nSanibel Mayor Holly Smith told CNN Tuesday that residents will be allowed back on the island Wednesday to assess the damage to their property, but the island is still “extremely unsafe.”\n\n“Roads are 90% clear on the island … meaning that there’s enough vehicular access that has been cut through the debris so vehicles and employees servicing the island can get through,” Dana Souza, Sanibel city manager, said.\n\nSanibel remains under a 24-hour curfew. Tomorrow, residents and business owners can access the island between 7 a.m. and 7p.m., Souza said. The National Guard will work with police to enforce checkpoints throughout the island, making sure that only those with a resident ID or hurricane pass are onsite.\n\n“We’re only allowing people who are Sanibel residents, business owners or property owners, back on the island and you must have those credentials. If you don’t have them, they will ask you to leave,” Souza said.\n\nA similar situation is playing out on nearby Pine Island, the largest barrier island on Florida’s Gulf Coast. Just days ago, it was a tranquil fishing and kayaking destination known for its small-town atmosphere. Now it’s a scene of carnage, with cracked roadways and destroyed homes.\n\nIan destroyed the only bridge to Pine Island, making it only accessible by boat or aircraft. Supplies are now being airdropped to the island by helicopter as some residents choose to stay, authorities said.\n\nCounty officials are trying to get a temporary ferry service for Sanibel, Sheriff Carmine Marceno said Tuesday. For Pine Island, work is underway to install a temporary bridge, with a goal to have it ready by the end of the week, DeSantis has said.\n\nEmergency physician Dr. Ben Abo, who joined rescuers on Pine Island, said crews are encountering residents who were in denial the storm would hit the area and are now running out of supplies.\n\n“I’m seeing a lot of despair, but I’m also seeing hope,” Abo said. “I’m seeing urban search and rescue, fire rescue, bringing hope to people that we’re going to get through this. But we have to do it in stages.”\n\nThe National Guard will also be flying power crews to Sanibel and Pine islands to start working on restoring power. It could take at least a month to restore power for some places on those islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan said Tuesday.\n\nDeSantis said Tuesday he has already visited Pine Island and will likely visit Sanibel Island Wednesday, one week after it was ravaged by Hurricane Ian.\n\n“We’re gonna have that bridge patched this week,” DeSantis said Tuesday of Pine Island. “Yesterday we had 130 (Florida Department of Transportation) trucks that were there working to get this temporary bridge fixed. It will be done this week.”\n\nDeSantis also directed the state’s transportation department to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway. A contract for the repair was awarded Tuesday with the end goal of having the causeway fully repaired by the end of the month, according to a news release.\n\nRight now, emergency repairs to the causeway will help first responders and emergency services access the barrier island to aid with recovery efforts, power restoration, and removal of debris. Long-term repairs will follow, giving residents “drivable” access to and from the mainland.\n\n“The Sanibel Causeway was affected when the land that the road was built on was washed away,” FDOT Secretary Jared Perdue said in a statement. “A bridge stability analysis will be performed, and repairs needed range from repairing bridge approaches to restoring the roadway across most of the causeway.”\n\nAt Fort Myers Beach, where storm surge and wind combined to wipe out numerous homes and businesses, it may also take a month to restore power due to damage to the electrical infrastructure,” Lee County Manager Roger Desjarlais said.\n\nFlorida Army National Guard members help Tim Tuitt, left, and John Davis as they are evacuated from Fort Myers Beach on Monday. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nAs rescue efforts continue, it’s unclear how many are still missing\n\nIt’s unclear how many people remain unaccounted for after the storm. Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said authorities are working to consolidate a list of the missing.\n\nSearch teams have been combing a 7-mile stretch of Fort Myers Beach for days, looking for anyone still in need of help. One of the teams, South Florida Task Force 2, found 150 people trapped in homes in its first 48 hours in the community, some of whom had ascended to attics to avoid floodwater, it said.\n\nOn Monday, the team still was helping people off the island town, as well as telling them where to get food and water. The team has found people who died at Fort Myers Beach, but it has not said how many.\n\nBob and Rosemary Kopsack were among those the team helped off the island Monday, after the storm ruined virtually everything inside their home. Bob Kopsack still didn’t know the fate of at least one of their friends on the island.\n\n“Our best friend, we have not been able to contact him … and he’d said he’s not leaving the island. And I hope he did,” he said. “His phone’s out. … I’ve sent the police over to his home.”\n\nIn Lee County, which includes Fort Myers and Fort Meyers Beach, more than half the schools had at least some damage from Ian – and 14% had major damage, the school district said. Schools will reopen as quickly as possible, Superintendent Christopher Bernier said, without providing a timeline.\n\nAt Fort Myers Beach Elementary, mud lined a cafeteria; damaged desks, toppled supplies and other debris were piled up in a hallway; and water marks reached nearly to the tops of doorjambs, photos released by the district showed.\n\nDebris litters Fort Myers Beach Elementary in this photo released by the school district Monday. Lee County Schools\n\nCharlotte County Public Schools will be closed until further notice, according to spokesperson Mike Riley, who said that several of their 22 schools have been damaged by the storm.\n\nRiley said the district is having all the buildings inspected to make sure everything is safe before students and staff return.\n\n“The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” he said.\n\nA Fort Myers man clung to branches for hours – and his daughters thought him lost\n\nSome residents who lost property and belongings are recounting narrow escapes.\n\nWhen Ian hit Florida’s west coast and floodwater surged through Fort Myers, Stan Pentz, 69, texted his daughter, Stephanie Downing, and told her the water was rising in his condo and he might drown. Then, he lost phone service, he told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nMore than an hour away, Downing assumed the worst. When she saw her sister the next day, “we just held each other and we just cried because we truly thought he was gone.”\n\nPentz managed to get out, however. Upon escaping his home, he was “swished away,” he recalled, and he latched onto some branches, clinging to them for hours, “with the wind blowing and the water gushing over my head. It was a long time.” After a while. the wind and water shifted and he reached the second floor of a building, where he huddled in a corner till sunrise, he said.\n\n“It just kept going and going. It wouldn’t stop and I was just thinking about my kids and my grandkids and just everybody I know, and they just kept me going in my mind,” he said.\n\nThe storm passed, and Pentz found someone to text Downing for him. Downing’s sister and brother-in-law drove down to Fort Myers and retrieved him.\n\nWhen Downing finally saw her dad, “I laid my head on his chest and I said, ‘Hey, Michael Phelps, you had a nice swim,’” she recalled as Pentz chuckled, playfully pantomiming slapping his daughter.\n\nPentz lost everything. He kicked his own submerged automobile as he swam to safety, he said. Downing said he’s now staying with her family at their Rotonda West home. A GoFundMe has raised thousands and a generous friend brought her dad some clothes and shoes. He was able to replace his cell phone and driver’s license Tuesday, Downing said.\n\n“We’re getting somewhere,” she said.\n\nMan says he moved through nearly half a mile of floodwater to rescue his mother\n\nA Naples man, meanwhile, trekked through nearly half a mile of floodwater to save his 85-year-old mother after Ian hit.\n\nJohnny Lauder, a former police officer, told CNN he sprang into action after his mother, who uses a wheelchair, called in a panic and said water was rushing into her home and reaching her chest.\n\nHe arrived at her home to find her neck-deep in floodwater, but happy to see her son.\n\n“The water was up to the windows, and I heard her screaming inside,” Lauder said. “It was a scare and a sigh of relief at the time – a scare thinking she might be hurt, a sigh of relief knowing that there was still air in her lungs.”\n\nLauder was able to bring his mother to safety as floodwaters began to recede.\n\nHospitals in Florida have been experiencing “significant pressure” on capacity since Ian hit, said Mary Mayhew, president and CEO of the Florida Hospital Association.\n\nEmergency departments have sustained damage, staffing has been impacted as many hospital workers have been displaced or lost their vehicles in the hurricane, and facilities lost reliable access to water.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}]}

The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,” Stokes wrote. The group said it is gross negligence to ignore the quarantine guidelines and threatened possible legal action.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest city plans to boost enforcement of an expanded mask mandate and restrict gathering sizes in a bid to curb coronavirus cases, officials said Friday. The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while “exercising vigorously outdoors,” the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. “Congregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. “I know we are asking a lot of you.” Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record. Saturday’s total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state’s death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/opinions/monkeypox-vaccine-distribution-das/index.html", "title": "Opinion: The problem with monkeypox vaccine distribution | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Lala Tanmoy (Tom) Das is an MD-PhD student at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City who has been barred from blood donation for being gay.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nI’ve struck out three times trying to get a monkeypox vaccine appointment in New York City.\n\nI tried and tried again, but between dwindling supplies, huge demand and difficulties with the appointment website, each time I failed.\n\nOn Tuesday, New York City Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said that 9,200 vaccination appointments were fully booked in just seven minutes after they went online last week. It should come as no surprise, then, that New York City’s health department decided to switch its two-dose vaccination strategy to a one-dose strategy. Vasan said the agency hasn’t scrapped the second shot but is focusing on first shots for now.\n\nLala Tanmoy Das Patricia Kuharic/WCMC Photography\n\nThe demand outpacing supply is a problem we could have prevented; demand was and is largely predictable as cases in the US are still mostly limited to men who have sex with men (MSM) – many of whom self-identify as gay, bisexual or transgender. And studies consistently show that LGBTQ individuals are much more likely to get vaccinated than our heterosexual peers – including getting the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThere is no doubt that there is an urgent need to fast-track the delivery and distribution of more vaccines. But, as a gay physician-in-training who has taken care of LGBT people in low-income and immigrant neighborhoods, I am worried that our current approach to rationing available vaccine reserves is not equitable and disadvantages individuals who may need it the most.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to prioritize vaccine distribution in Black and brown communities. This includes not just opening up sites in predominantly minority neighborhoods but ensuring that people who live there can access them. Latest surveillance data from the NYC Department of Health shows that non-white individuals make up a larger share of known monkeypox cases than white individuals. Additionally, 2 out of every 5 cases are outside Manhattan and Staten Island, in boroughs that are predominantly non-white. Other cities, like Atlanta, appear to have a similar racial/ethnic disparity among known cases, with Black individuals being impacted more.\n\nYet, based on what I’ve heard from Black and brown peers and patients, and corroborated by what’s being anecdotally reported on social media, people of color seem to be having a very difficult time securing vaccination appointments. As more doses become available in the future, we need to adjust our distribution strategies so that these individuals and their communities are not further stymied. Releasing anonymized sociodemographic information on who is getting the vaccines and in which neighborhoods may help ensure that minority neighborhoods are being reached.\n\nWe also need to supplement the current approach in many cities of first-come-first-served, online-only scheduling portals with pre-registration (like Washington, DC is doing) and walk-in options. As we witnessed with the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, the online, first-come-first-served system disadvantages anyone who has work or other obligations that prevent them from getting online the minute appointments are released, as well as people with unstable housing who don’t often have access to digital technology.\n\nThere are also still a fair number of MSM who prioritize anonymity and discretion over health. I’ve seen this not only in my own patient pool but in conversations with people online. Many of these individuals don’t feel comfortable with the digital traceability of online portals. We are doing a disservice to people if we don’t employ different, more discreet strategies such as walk-in appointments with no online registration.\n\nLanguage equity, too, is important when disseminating information on vaccine updates, especially in urban centers like New York, which are linguistically diverse. I know several gay men who only speak Mandarin or Portuguese and who have struggled to understand the updates released about vaccine availability. Though webpages can often be translated, cities should look into ensuring that monkeypox information and updates about vaccine availability are efficiently and accurately reaching those who are not native English speakers.\n\nFinally, current eligibility criteria encourages people with immunocompromising conditions to seek out vaccines, but they are not afforded priority in a first-come-first-served scheduling portal despite the fact that some early data indicates that those who are immunocompromised – including from uncontrolled or poorly controlled HIV – may have more serious outcomes from monkeypox. We should prioritize vaccinations for these individuals.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe monkeypox situation is rapidly evolving. In New York City, we went from one case in May to over 600 in mid-July. And even though a majority of known cases have been in adult men, Dr. Mary Bassett, commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, mentioned in a recent town hall that health authorities are starting to see cases in children. Renewed emphasis on vaccination as well as primary prevention will be critical to curbing the spread of the virus in different groups.\n\nThere is no perfect, one-size-fits all solution to vaccine distribution challenges that will cater to everyone’s needs. But it is especially important to me, as an immigrant and a physician-in-training, to be able to advocate for the needs of disadvantaged groups that I serve. I must vouch for their visibility in the public health system to help ensure that access to resources is equitable for all New Yorkers.", "authors": ["Lala Tanmoy Das"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/10/04/newser-scientist-trying-to-resurrect-king-davids-wine/16715837/", "title": "Scientist trying to resurrect King David's wine", "text": "Matt Cantor\n\nNewser\n\nIf a scientist in Israel is successful, we could someday taste the wine described in the Bible.\n\nIn 2011, Elyashiv Drori sent students throughout Israel in search of wild grapes, which were tough to find in an area that saw alcohol banned for centuries under past Muslim rulers, the BBC reports.\n\nRelying in part on tips from hikers who had sighted wild grapes, they managed to find 100 types in three years, at least 10% of which could be used in winemaking, reports JTA.\n\nDrori has tasked DNA biologist Mali Salmon-Divol with sequencing the grapes' genomes, and she expects some big revelations from that: \"You want to know what this wine looked like, which wine King David drank, white or red,\" Salmon-Divol says, and the grapes' genes will reveal that: \"We can see if it's red or white, strong or weak.\"\n\nThose grapes' DNA will be compared to that of an ancient grape she plans to sequence.

Priorities presented at the gathering will also set China’s trajectory for at least the next five years.\n\n“The delay suggests that the government believes that the 20th Party Congress is the most important thing happening in China right now and would like to avoid other information flows that could create mixed messages,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING Group, in a research note on Tuesday.\n\nOther analysts believe it could be because the data sets are not pretty.\n\n“My forecast is for a further decline of 1.2% [on a quarterly basis for China’s GDP]. This would mean China had joined the US in a technical recession,” said Clifford Bennett, Chief Economist at ACY Securities.\n\nThe delay would make sense “from an image management perspective,” he said. Some economists call two consecutive quarters of contraction a technical recession.\n\nChina’s GDP declined 2.6% in the second quarter from the previous one, reversing a 1.4% growth in the January-to-March period.

That would fall far short of the government’s full-year growth target of around 5.5%.\n\nMany international organizations, including the IMF and World Bank, have recently downgraded China’s GDP growth forecasts for this year.\n\nBennett expected the third-quarter GDP data to be released after the Party Congress.\n\n“Whenever the release occurs, we should all be prepared for some global financial market reaction if the world’s two largest economies are both in recession this year, ” he said.\n\nChina’s economy is facing mounting challenges.

Trump will be reinstated,” Musk tweeted Saturday night. “Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” Latin for “the voice of the people is the voice of God.”\n\nThe final poll results on Saturday night showed 51.8% in favor and 48.2% opposed. The poll included 15 million votes.\n\nThe much-anticipated decision from the new owner sets the stage for the former president’s return to the social media platform, where he was previously its most influential, if controversial, user. With almost 90 million followers, his tweets often moved the markets, set the news cycle and drove the agenda in Washington.\n\nTrump has previously said he would remain on his platform, Truth Social, instead of rejoining Twitter, but a change in his approach could hold major political implications. The former president announced this month that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, aiming to become only the second commander in chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms.\n\nAsked on Saturday what he thought of Musk purchasing Twitter and his own future on the platform, Trump praised Musk but questioned whether the site would survive its current crises.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what Trump said about possibly returning to Twitter 02:10 - Source: CNN\n\n“They have a lot of problems,” Trump said in Las Vegas at the Republican Jewish Coalition meeting. “You see what’s going on.

Twitter often took a light-touch approach to moderating his account, arguing at times that as a public official, the then-president must be given wide latitude to speak.\n\nBut as Trump neared the end of his term – and increasingly tweeted misinformation alleging election fraud – the balance shifted. The company began applying warning labels to his tweets in an attempt to correct his misleading claims ahead of the 2020 presidential election. And following the US Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, the platform banned him indefinitely.\n\n“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said at the time. “In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action.”\n\nThe decision followed two tweets by Trump that, according to Twitter, violated the company’s policy against glorification of violence. The tweets, Twitter said at the time, “must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks.”\n\nThe first tweet – a statement about Trump’s supporters, who he called “75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me” – suggested that “he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election,” Twitter had said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump's dilemma: Truth Social or Twitter? 05:11 - Source: CNN\n\nThe second, which indicated he did not plan to attend Joe Biden’s inauguration, could be viewed as a further statement that the election was not legitimate and could be interpreted as Trump saying that the inauguration would be a “safe” target for violence because he would not be attending, according to Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk’s decision, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming suggested on Twitter that “it’s a good time to watch” a public hearing held earlier this year by the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack.\n\n“It covers each of Trump’s tweets that day, including those that have been deleted, and features multiple Trump (White House) staff describing his inexcusable conduct during the violence,” Cheney, a notable Trump critic who serves on the select committee, tweeted Saturday.\n\nSoon after Trump’s Twitter ban, he was also restricted from Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, which could also restore his accounts as soon as January 2023.\n\nOn November 18, Musk tweeted that he had reinstated several controversial accounts on the platform, but that a “Trump decision has not yet been made.”\n\n“New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach,” he said at the time. “Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet.”\n\nMusk had previously said he disagreed with Twitter’s permanent ban policy and could also return other accounts that had been removed from the platform for repeated rules violations.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump; I think that was a mistake,” Musk said at a conference in May, pledging to reverse the ban were he to become the company’s owner.\n\nJack Dorsey, who was the CEO of Twitter when the company banned Trump but has since left, responded to Musk’s comments saying he agreed that there should not be permanent bans. Banning the former president, he said, was a “business decision” and it “shouldn’t have been.”\n\nThe Trump decision is the latest in a series of major changes Musk has made at Twitter, including pushing out its top leadership and a significant portion of its staff.\n\nMusk also launched an updated subscription service allowing users to pay to receive verification checkmarks, an indicator previously reserved for authenticated public figures, which was quickly abused and used to impersonate prominent people, businesses and government agencies. Twitter paused the service and plans to reinstate it later this month.\n\nAnd on Friday, he said he would restore the accounts of three controversial, previously banned or suspended users: Canadian podcaster Jordan Peterson, right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee and comedian Kathy Griffin.\n\nThe chaos has scared off many of Twitter’s major advertisers, who are wary of having their ads run alongside potentially objectionable content, threatening the company’s core business model. Macy’s, Volkswagen Group, General Mills and other large brands have all paused advertising, causing what Musk called earlier this month “a massive drop in revenue.” And restoring Trump to the platform is unlikely to help.\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson called on advertisers still funding Twitter to immediately stop all ad buys.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Will Twitter advertiser dollars affect Musk's promise to Trump? 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\n“In Elon Musk’s Twittersphere, you can incite an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which led to the deaths of multiple people, and still be allowed to spew hate speech and violent conspiracies on his platform,” Johnson said in a statement. “If Elon Musk continues to run Twitter like this, using garbage polls that do not represent the American people and the needs of our democracy, God help us all.”\n\nIn an apparent effort to reassure advertisers and users, Musk previously said he would implement a “content moderation council” to help set policies, and that no major content moderation decisions would be made before it was in place. There is no indication that such a group was involved in the move to restore Trump nor the other users who were returned to the platform on Friday.\n\nIn an op-ed published in the New York Times Friday, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety Yoel Roth, who left the company last week, said that despite the billionaire’s promises to involve others in key decisions, “Mr. Musk has made clear that at the end of the day, he’ll be the one calling the shots.”\n\nAny surge in traffic on Twitter due to Trump’s reinstatement could also put a technical strain on the platform that would coincide with the World Cup, which is typically one of the biggest audience events on the site.\n\n“Twitter servers being out [put] through quite the stress test by @elonmusk right now,” Sriram Krishnan, an investor who is assisting as part of Musk’s Twitter leadership team, tweeted Saturday night.\n\nMass worker exits at the company had prompted users, as well as some employees, to question whether the platform could face outages or other issues. Already, Twitter has experienced some glitches in recent days, including with its feature that allows users to download their data from the site.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Paul Leblanc", "Clare Duffy", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/europe/ukraine-russia-tensions-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Ukraine-Russia crisis: As tensions rise on the border, here's what ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nTensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop build-up near the two nations’ borders spurring fears that Moscow could launch an invasion.\n\nUkraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine – including increased weapons supplies and military training – constitutes a growing threat on Russia’s western flank.\n\nThe picture is complicated – but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nWhat’s the situation on the border?\n\nThe United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as “unusual.”\n\nAs many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine “as soon as early 2022.”\n\nSpeaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart in Kyiv on January 19, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had “ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine’s border, which it could double on relatively short order.”\n\nIn late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware – including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles – on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s latest intelligence assessment says Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, including some 21,000 air and sea personnel, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country.\n\nThe assessment came after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution.\n\nUS officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two.\n\nMany of Russia’s military bases are to the west of the vast country – the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia’s Defense Ministry has said it is conducting “regular” winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as “temporarily occupied territories,” although Russia denies it.\n\nThe front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists.\n\nRussia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. The Crimean peninsula, which lies to the south of the rest of Ukraine, is now connected by a road bridge to mainland Russia.\n\nRussian tanks take part in a military drills at Molkino training ground in the Krasnodar region, Russia, on December 14, 2021. AP\n\nWhat’s the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia?\n\nTensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended the talks – reportedly under pressure from Moscow – weeks of protests in Kyiv erupted into violence.\n\nThen, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens. First, thousands of Russian-speaking troops, dubbed “little green men” and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the Crimean peninsula. Within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate.\n\nRussian soldiers patrol the area surrounding the Ukrainian military unit in Perevalnoye, outside Simferopol, Crimea, on March 20, 2014. Filippo MonteforteAFP/Getty Images\n\nShortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kyiv, prompting months of heavy fighting. Despite Kyiv and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations.\n\nAccording to UN figures, there have been more than 3,000 conflict-related civilian deaths in eastern Ukraine since March 2014.\n\nThe European Union and US have imposed a series of measures in response to Russia’s actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting individuals, entities and specific sectors of the Russian economy.\n\nThe Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country’s east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement.\n\nUkrainian soldiers prepare to support the withdrawal of troops on February 19, 2015 in Artemivsk, Ukraine. Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images\n\nWhat’s Russia’s view?\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm.\n\nMoscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO – in terms of weaponry, training and personnel – as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia’s borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances.\n\nPutin has also said that NATO deploying sophisticated weapons in Ukraine, such as missile systems, would be crossing a “red line” for Russia, amid concern in Moscow that Ukraine is being increasingly armed by NATO powers.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in November that weapons and military advisers were already being supplied to Ukraine by the US and other NATO member states. “And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line,” he said.\n\nIf the US and its NATO allies do not change course in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that Moscow has the “right to choose ways to ensure its legitimate security interests.”\n\nWhat is Ukraine’s view?\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO if it chooses.\n\n“Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion.\n\n“Any Russian proposals to discuss with NATO or the US any so-called guarantees that the Alliance would not expand to the East are illegitimate,” it added.\n\nUkraine insists Russia is seeking to destabilize the country with the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently saying a coup plot, involving Ukrainians and Russians, had been uncovered.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that a planned coup could be part of Russia’s plan ahead of a military invasion. “External military pressure goes hand in hand with domestic destabilization of the country,” he said.\n\nTensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked.\n\nAt the same time, Zelensky’s government faces challenges on many fronts. The government’s popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy.\n\nMany people are also unhappy that the government hasn’t yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country’s east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kyiv.\n\nIn a January 19 video address, Zelensky urged the Ukrainian people to “calm down” amid mounting unease over a possible Russian invasion. “We are aware of everything, we are ready for everything,” he said, before adding that he “sincerely believes” this year “will pass without a war” with Russia.\n\nKuleba also sought to reassure Ukrainians who fear the US, its NATO allies and Russia could leave Kyiv out of discussions. “No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine is a principle that we adhere to,” he said.\n\nPro-Russian fighters arrive on February 20, 2015 in Debaltseve, eastern Ukraine. Pierre Crom/Getty Images\n\nWhat does NATO say?\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said “there will be a high price to pay for Russia” if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner.\n\n“We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,” said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses “with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia … but also in the Black Sea region,” Stoltenberg said.\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn’t have the same security guarantees as NATO members.\n\nBut Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership.\n\nHigh-stakes talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels in mid-January were “not an easy discussion,” according to Stoltenberg, who added that “differences will not be easy to bridge.” However, NATO allies and Russia “expressed the need to resume dialogue,” he said.\n\nWhat does the United States say?\n\nPresident Joe Biden told Zelensky earlier this month in a phone call that the US and its allies “will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.”\n\nBut Biden appeared to undermine that message when he subsequently suggested during a White House news conference that a “minor incursion” by Russia would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion of the country.\n\nWhile Biden vowed harsh economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the border, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur. “There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens,” he said.\n\nHis remarks prompted a swift White House clarification. “President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,” press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement.\n\nOne Ukrainian official told CNN he was “shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion” and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions. “This gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,” the official added.\n\nThe diplomatic kerfuffle came as Blinken prepared for further talks with European allies on the Ukraine-Russia crisis and to meet with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Blinken has previously warned Russia that “any renewed aggression can trigger serious consequences.”\n\nTwo defense officials told CNN on January 3 that the Defense Department has developed military options for Biden if he decides to increase capabilities in eastern Europe to further deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine. Both officials emphasized that this part of routine planning the military does and that for now, the focus remains on diplomacy and potential economic sanctions.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov held meetings in Geneva on January 10, as the US sought to de-escalate the threat of a Russian advance.\n\nThe US delivered roughly $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine in 2021, the Pentagon said, including a package of small arms and ammunition in December. The Biden administration is now weighing new options, including providing more arms to Ukraine to resist a Russian occupation, a senior US official told CNN.\n\nThe Obama administration was taken by surprise when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. US officials say they are determined not to be caught out by another Russian military operation.\n\n“Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,” Blinken said late last year.\n\nWhat other factors are at play?\n\nUnrest in the former Soviet state of Kazakhstan was unwelcome news for Putin at the beginning of 2022.\n\nDeadly protests in early January saw the Kazakh government resign, a state of emergency be declared and troops from a Russia-led military alliance deployed to help contain the unrest.\n\nBut experts have warned that Russia’s intervention is unlikely to be the end of the story. Blinken said that “once Russians are in your house, sometimes it is very difficult to get them to leave.”\n\nAnother issue revolves around energy supply. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine.\n\nKyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against an invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAnalysts and US lawmakers have raised concerns that Nord Stream 2 will increase European dependence on Russian gas and could allow Moscow to selectively target countries such as Ukraine with energy cut-offs, without broader disruption to European supplies. Bypassing eastern European countries also means those nations would be deprived of lucrative transit fees Russia would otherwise pay.\n\nIn May 2021, the Biden administration waived sanctions on the company behind Nord Stream 2, effectively giving it the green light. US officials say the move was in the interest of US national security as it sought to rebuild frayed relations with Germany.\n\nIn November, the US imposed new sanctions on a Russian-linked entity and a vessel linked to Nord Stream 2. Some US senators have called for further sanctions to be imposed to prevent Russia using the pipeline as a weapon; Ukraine too has called for tougher measures.", "authors": ["Matthew Chance Laura Smith-Spark", "Matthew Chance", "Laura Smith-Spark"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/29/economy/china-economy-2023-outlook-hnk-intl/index.html", "title": "As China abandons zero-Covid, what will the economy look like in ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nAs China moves ever closer to fully reemerging from three years of government-imposed Covid isolation and reintegrating with the world, economic expectations are high.\n\nBeijing’s recent pivot from its stringent zero-Covid strategy — which had long choked businesses — is expected to inject vitality into the world’s second-largest economy next year.\n\nCovid lockdowns and border curbs have left China out of sync with the rest of the world, disrupting supply chains and damaging the flow of trade and investment.\n\nAnd with the global economy now facing significant challenges, including energy shortages, slowing growth and high inflation, China’s reopening could provide a much-needed and timely boost.\n\nBut the process of reopening is likely to be erratic and painful, according to economists, with the country’s economy in for a bumpy ride in the first few months of 2023.\n\nChina’s historic property downturn and a potential global recession could also cause more headaches in the new year, they added.\n\nA woman crosses a street on the Bund in the Huangpu district in Shanghai on December 21, 2022. Hector Ramal/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“In the short run, I believe China’s economy is likely to experience chaos rather than progress for a simple reason: China is poorly prepared to deal with Covid,” said Bo Zhuang, senior sovereign analyst at Loomis, Sayles & Company, a Boston-based investment firm.\n\nFor nearly three years, China stuck to its zero-tolerance approach to the virus, even though the policy caused unprecedented economic damage and widespread frustration. In 2022, growth slowed sharply, company profits collapsed, and youth unemployment surged to record levels.\n\nAmid growing public unrest and financial pressure, the government abruptly changed course this month, effectively abandoning zero-Covid.\n\nWhile the easing of restrictions is a long-awaited relief for many, the abruptness of it has caught an unprepared public off guard and left them largely to fend for themselves.\n\nFew customers are seen at a shopping mall in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, China, December 26, 2022. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\n“In the initial phase, I believe the reopening may unleash a wave of Covid cases that could overwhelm the health care system, dampening consumption and production in the process,” Zhuang said.\n\nAlready, the rapid spread of infection has driven many people indoors and emptied shops and restaurants. Factories and companies have also been forced to shut or cut production because more workers are getting sick.\n\nPeople line up to receive free ibuprofen tablets for reducing fever at the flagship store of a national drugstore chain in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang province, Dec 28, 2022.

In a recent research report, HSBC economists projected a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, but 5% growth overall for 2023.\n\nProperty market\n\nChina’s haphazard reopening isn’t the only factor dragging on the economy. In 2023, experts will continue to watch how policymakers attempt to fix the country’s ailing real estate sector, which accounts for nearly 30% of its GDP.\n\nThe crisis in the industry — which started late in 2021 when several high-profile developers defaulted on their debt — has delayed or halted construction of pre-sold homes across the country. That triggered a rare protest by homebuyers this year, who refused to pay mortgages on unfinished homes.\n\nWhile Beijing has made a series of attempts to rescue the sector — including unveiling a 16-point plan last month to ease the credit crunch — statistics still paint a gloomy picture.\n\nProperty sales by value plunged more than 26% in the first 11 months of this year. Investment in the sector fell by 9.8%.\n\nAt a key policy meeting earlier this month, top leaders vowed to focus on boosting the economy next year, suggesting they would roll out new measures that improve the financial condition of the property sector and boost market confidence.\n\n“The measures announced so far are not sufficient to drive a turnaround, but policymakers have signaled that more support is on its way,” said Capital Economics analysts.\n\n“This should reassure homebuyers enough to lift sales perhaps before the middle of next year.”\n\nGlobal recession fears\n\nA potential global recession is another key concern that will shape China’s economic landscape in 2023.\n\nTrade had powered much of China’s economic growth earlier this year, as exports were boosted by rising prices of the country’s goods and a weaker currency.\n\nBut in recent months, the trade sector — which makes up around a fifth of China’s GDP and supplies 180 million jobs — has started showing cracks from a global economic slowdown.\n\nLast month, China’s outbound shipments contracted 8.7% from a year earlier, much worse than October’s 0.3% drop. That marked the worst performance since February 2020, when the Chinese economy came to a near standstill amid the initial coronavirus outbreak.\n\nCountries around the world are facing recession as policymakers continue hiking interest rates to combat surging inflation.\n\n“[China’s] exports have already reversed much of their pandemic-era boom,” said Capital Economics analysts.\n\n“But a looming global recession means they probably have further to fall over the next few quarters.”", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/business/companies-pulling-back-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Companies pulling back from Russia over the war in Ukraine | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nDozens of the world’s biggest companies have abandoned or scaled back their operations in Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe exodus affects every corner of the economy, from its vast energy riches through autos, finance, retail, entertainment and fast food, starving Russia of new investment and removing products and services that had become popular in the decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nHere’s a look at the major corporate departures.\n\nAutos\n\nFord (F) announced it was suspending its operations in Russia. The American automaker has a 50% stake in Ford (F) Sollers, a joint venture that employs at least 4,000 workers and is shared with Russian company Sollers.\n\nA Ford dealership and service center. Artyom Geodakyan/TASS/Getty Images\n\nThe company has plants in St. Petersburg, Elabuga and Naberezhnye Chelny but said it had “significantly wound down” its Russian operations in recent years. The automaker said it was “deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine,” and noted it has “a strong contingent of Ukrainian nationals working at Ford around the world.”\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) said it was halting all exports to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nGM doesn’t have a significant presence there: It sells only about 3,000 vehicles a year through 16 dealerships, according to a spokesperson. That’s out of the more than 6 million vehicles the Detroit-based automaker sells annually.\n\nToyota announced it would stop making cars in Russia or importing them to the country “until further notice, due to supply chain disruptions.”\n\nVolkswagen (VLKAF) is stopping production of vehicles in Russia and has suspended exports to the Russian market. The decision applies to the Russian production sites in Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nNissan (NSANF) has suspended the export of vehicles to Russia, adding that it “anticipates that production will stop soon at our plant in St. Petersburg.”\n\nAviation\n\nBoeing (BA) said it would suspend support for Russian airlines.\n\nA company spokesperson confirmed the aircraft maker was pausing “parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines,” and had also “suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed our office in Kyiv.”\n\nAirbus (EADSF) followed Boeing with a similar move. In a statement, the company said it has “suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare parts to the country.”\n\nBig Tech\n\nAirbnb cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet that his company was suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)’s cloud division, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, said March 8 it would halt new sign-ups for the service in Russia and Belarus. The company has already had a “long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government” and does not have data centers, infrastructure or offices in Russia, the company said in a blog post.\n\n“AWS has clear terms of service where if a customer is using AWS services to threaten, incite, promote, or actively encourage violence, terrorism, or other serious harm, they will not be permitted to use our services,” Amazon said. “Any customer we know of who is participating in this type of behavior will have their access to AWS suspended.”\n\nApple (AAPL) has stopped selling its products in Russia.\n\nThe tech giant said in a statement that it was “deeply concerned” about the Russian invasion. In response, the company has also moved to limit access to digital services, such as Apple Pay, inside Russia, and restricted the availability of Russian state media applications outside the country.\n\nA re:Store shop in central Moscow. re:Store is one of the largest Apple resellers in Russia. Vladimir Gerdo/TASS/Getty Images\n\nFacebook (FB)-parent Meta said it would block access to Russian news outlets Sputnik and RT, the Russia-backed television network infamous for promoting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda, across the European Union.\n\nThe move comes after the company received “requests from a number of governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state controlled media,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s VP of global affairs, wrote in a tweet.\n\nMeta has also said it has applied algorithmic restrictions on Russian state media that should prevent those posts from surfacing as prominently in users’ feeds.\n\nHitachi (HTHIY) said March 10 that it is pausing exports to Russia and suspending all manufacturing in the country, “with the exception of products, services and support for electrical power equipment that are indispensable to the daily lives of people,” it said.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate added that Russia accounts for just a small fraction — roughly 0.5% — of its revenue.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna said the company has suspended all business in Russia.\n\n“In Ukraine, we have been in constant touch with our local teams and continue to provide assistance that includes relocation and financial support,” Krishna said. “The safety and security of IBMers and their families in all areas impacted by this crisis remains our top priority.”\n\nIntel (INTC) said April 5 that it has suspended business operations in Russia. Earlier this year, the company said it stopped all shipments to Russia and Belarus.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) said it was suspending all new sales of its products and services in Russia. President and vice-chair Brad Smith also said the company is stopping “many aspects” of its business in Russia in compliance with government sanctions.

It comes a year after the US announced a surprise US-Australia submarine partnership – upending France’s own submarine deal with Australia and infuriating French officials. The perilous relations are no small matter, given the array of major challenges facing the larger western alliance.\n\n“If you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7 … so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nIn an early sign of that diplomacy, the Elysee confirmed to CNN on Thursday a series of gifts exchanged between the world leaders and their spouses.\n\nMacron gifted his US counterpart a centerpiece from French goldsmith and tableware house, Christofle, the Elysee said. The present, crafted in 2012, is a tribute to the French transatlantic liner, the “Normandie,” which sailed with a Christofle silverware collection in the interwar period, per the Elysee.\n\nBiden was also presented with a vinyl record and CD of the soundtrack of the film “A man and a woman,” directed by Frenchman Claude Lelouch. The Elysee described the gift as a “nod to the personal history of the Biden couple” as they watched the 1966 film during their first date. The film also won France’s highest film award, the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden received two French literary works: a copy of “Madame Bovary,” by Gustave Flaubert, as well as a collection of essays written by Albert Camus, per the Elysee.\n\nFinally, Biden received two gifts from the Elysee Palace gift shop, a watch from watchmaker LIP and a jumper from the French brand Saint James.\n\nButter-poached Maine lobster and calotte of beef, shallot marmalade, are seen at the White House during a media preview of the state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron. Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Sipa USA/AP\n\nThe dinner has domestic political overtones, as well. As the Bidens roll out the red carpet for Macron and his wife Brigitte, there’s word they have two more state dinners in the works along with several other social events to come. Several people with knowledge of White House planning and operations, who spoke to CNN for this story, confirmed this State Dinner will be one of several hosted by the Biden administration in upcoming months.\n\nIt may suggest, said those familiar with the thinking around future state dinners, Biden indeed wants to run for a second term, something he has said he intends to do, but a decision that also hinges on the consent and support of his wife and extended family.\n\n“These are intricate – and expensive – events,” said one of the people, who has worked in the White House, of state dinners. “If the administration is willing to sink budget dollars into them, there’s probably a larger strategy at play.”\n\nThe guest list for Biden’s first state dinner was big from the start, made extra-large to include all of the people who have missed out on key social time with the president due to Covid-19 restrictions. Having done the mental calculations months ago as planning began, said two people familiar with the dinner’s details, the East Wing, the West Wing, the State Department and the National Security Council’s lists ballooned.\n\nAmong those attending the state dinner were celebrities and musicians, as well as top lawmakers, according to a printout of guests from the White House. Stephen Colbert, Anna Wintour and John Legend were among the invitees to rub shoulders with the likes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nTwo guests of Macron – the head designers for fashion house Oscar de la Renta, Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia – confirmed to CNN that Jill Biden wore the luxury label at the dinner.\n\nGarcia said they collaborated with the first lady for about two months on the dress, getting her input on what she wanted for the look, which included “a sense of ease.”\n\nThis first State Dinner offered the opportunity to finally make amends to VIPs and diplomats, members of Congress and deep-pocketed donors. A decision was made to hold the dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, which would allow them to comfortably seat the more than 400 guests expected to attend. (The White House is referring to the tent as a “pavilion,” as it has clear panels on the sides.)\n\nAn indoor dinner in the State Dining Room is limited by space restrictions – only about 120 guests can be accommodated. The second and last Trump administration State Dinner, for Australia, was held in the Rose Garden, which could seat approximately 200 for a formal dinner.\n\n“We’ve always expected a larger guest list as it’s the first state dinner of the Biden Administration,” Vanessa Valdivia, Jill Biden’s press secretary, told CNN.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe dinner for France was actually supposed to take place months prior, said the two people, but scheduling conflicts, including campaign trips for midterm elections, foreign travel and the wedding of Naomi Biden, meant the date was pushed back more than once. Thursday evening was ultimately where the schedules of several executive branch agencies landed with clear calendars.\n\nUnfortunately for the White House social offices and usher’s office, the final date also meant pulling off the ritual of holiday decorations and dozens of White House holiday parties in tandem with a debut State Dinner, something that has not been done before during a modern presidency. The White House calligraphers, kitchen staff, service teams and floral shop all worked to juggle the demands of overlapping, high-caliber events.\n\nAncillary kitchen space has been added with refrigeration units placed outside the White House kitchen area, as is usually the case for multiple or large social events, especially during the busy holiday party season where there can be as many as two or three receptions per day. (Three of the industrial-sized refrigerators outside earlier this week were labeled with the word “cheese,” in black magic marker – unclear whether for the French dinner, or holiday party nibbles.)\n\nFor the State Dinner, the Bidens have opted to use rental dishes, glasses, flatware, table accoutrements and linens. The venue, though on the White House grounds, does not allow for the official White House china services to be used for the dinner, said White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo. White House curators, who oversee the use of all items in the White House collection, do not count the temporarily installed tent as part of the campus – and thus the china of presidents’ past would not be part of the service.\n\nThe overall design and the floral arrangements were put together by an event planner, Jung Lee, and her company, Fete, a posh party design outfit favored by celebrities.\n\nA stage and dance floor was erected in the tent for the evening’s entertainment from singer Jon Batiste, a New Orleans native, a city Jill Biden said Wednesday is “shaped by both French and American culture.” The Macrons will visit New Orleans after Washington, before returning to France.\n\nWhite House Executive Chef Cris Comerford presents the menu during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe décor for the dinner was inspired by red, white and blue, the shared colors of the American and French flags, and “our common values: liberty and democracy, equality and fellowship,” said Biden at a preview of the table settings and menu.\n\nThe trick of a successful State Dinner format, says a former White House social secretary, is to seamlessly and organically combine elements from both the United States and the visiting country, an offering of hospitality on the side of a main course of diplomacy. But without being too hokey about it.\n\nThe flowers on the tables Thursday night were mostly roses; American Beauty varietals and Piano Roses, deep red blooms because, as Elizondo said, Emmanuel Macron likes the piano. French-made Champagne flutes were used for toasting, but filled with American sparkling wine. Tall candelabras holding blood-red candles are meant to mimic the Statue of Liberty, France’s gift to the United States. And so on.\n\nThe table setting is something the first lady has said is always her first consideration when hosting anyone for a meal, a memory from her childhood and her mother. “Even if we were only having fish sticks from the freezer, she always made our dinners feel special,” said Biden, who is expected to make remarks at the dinner.\n\n“The first lady has been involved since the beginning, it’s been important to her that the dinner reflects the warmth and approachable hospitality that the Bidens are known for,” Valdivia said.\n\nA person with knowledge of the first lady’s hands-on approach to the dinner said she was involved with all aspects of the planning, down to doing tastings of each dish and overseeing the seating chart, much like her immediate predecessor, Melania Trump, whose first state dinner also happened to be for the Macrons. Unlike the Trump dinner, the Bidens served caviar and butter-poached lobster for a first-course, Calotte of beef and watercress and sunchoke salad for the main. Trump went with goat cheese gateau with tomato jam, and a rack of lamb. Though the two dinners would share a dessert: crème fraiche ice cream.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022.

However, for much of it, Biden has not been able due to the pandemic to host parties. Trump had a third State Dinner in the works – for the King and Queen of Spain – but canceled it as the pandemic took hold around the world.\n\nBiden is also not as inclined socially to host big events at the White House, Covid-19 restrictions or not. The first couple has notably spent most weekends away from Washington in Delaware or Camp David, and as a closely bonded family, there are few occasions where guest lists for dinners expand beyond relatives.\n\nPrevious presidents have used the White House frequently to entertain, typically with a subtext, whether political or cultural. In recent history, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted birthday parties and music concerts, bringing together celebrities and politicians for fun-filled, late nights of elbow-rubbing and bonding. The Obamas’ State Dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande in 2014 brought a star-studded guest list that included Bradley Cooper, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Stephen Colbert and Elon Musk.\n\nSinger Mary J. Blige entertained at the dinner. By contrast, Trump’s two state dinners lacked bold-faced guests and headliners, as his political leanings were often antithetical from those of mainstream Hollywood.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images In pictures: White House state dinners Prev Next\n\nGoing back further, presidents accumulated State Dinners as a means to help soothe icy relationships, or build support on geopolitical crises.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, for example, continued to hold State Dinners during World War II, to pull in allies. Dwight Eisenhower in 1959 hosted Nikita Khrushchev, the first State Dinner for a Soviet leader, to help quell concerns of escalating nuclear tension. Jimmy Carter was not a big party guy – the State Dinners hosted by the president and Rosalyn Carter did not include hard liquor, just beer and wine – but he had held 33 State Dinners by this time in his tenure. After the signing of the Panama Canal treaties, Carter hosted one state dinner for 18 Latin American heads of state, according to data collected by the White House Historical Association.\n\nAs time went on, guest lists for the dinners routinely grew, observed by the orders for presidential china sets, which went from accommodating about 100 people, to the most recent official set for the Obamas, which accommodated 320 people. Biden, in other words, still has the time and the space to showcase the highest form of diplomacy this country can offer another world leader. And he intends to.\n\n“There are more being planned and in the works for the future,” said one of the people with knowledge of the larger Biden State Dinner strategy. “This is just the start.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}]}

It’s “the Coca-Cola taste you know and love with bright elements upfront and refreshing with the finish,” she said.\n\nByte is the second beverage — after Starlight — from Coca-Cola Creations, the company’s new innovation division.\n\nThe company decided to discontinue half of its portfolio a few years ago, dropping some outdated but beloved drinks including Tab. Since then the soda giant has been focusing on promoting its core product, Coke.\n\n\"Byte\" is supposed to taste like pixels. Coca-Cola\n\nThat means coming up with creative, limited-time flavors and rolling out intriguing marketing campaigns to promote them. It also means letting customers puzzle over what some of these new flavors actually taste like.\n\nThe reaction to Starlight has been very good, according to Vlad. “We are seeing lots of discussion and speculation about its mysterious space flavor,” she said.\n\n“Our fans are intrigued — they love the playful novelty,” she added. “The abstract nature of the flavor descriptions offers an opportunity for debate and discussion.”\n\nIn other words, the weird flavors are inspiring some buzz.\n\nBeverages launched by Coca-Cola creations are also served up with marketing campaigns that cater to customers who love to be online. The push for “Starlight,” for example, featured a holographic concert by pop star Ava Max which could be accessed by a QR code on the drink’s label.\n\nWith “Byte” it’s all about gaming.\n\nAppealing to gamers\n\n“Byte” existed online before it did in real life: The product appeared globally in late March on an island in the video game Fortnite. The island, named Pixel Point, was created by Coca-Cola and its partner PWR, which creates virtual experiences within Fortnite.\n\nPlayers who arrive at Pixel Point can play different games, including one which takes place inside a classic glass Coke bottle.\n\nOnce customers get their hands on a can of Byte in the real world, they’ll be able to play an augmented reality game by scanning the pixelated label with their phones.\n\nBeverage brands have long been advertising directly to gamers, but with more companies jumping on the bandwagon, the competition is heating up.\n\n“We believe it’s important to be present in the spaces where gamers play,” Vlad said, noting that “Coca-Cola has long supported the gaming community.” The company has a partnership with video game developer Riot Games.\n\nUS customers can buy Byte online starting May 2 while supplies last.

It’s not about to tell you what’s in its new limited-time flavors, either.\n\nOver the past several months, Coca-Cola has rolled out a number of curious products: Coca-Cola Starlight, Byte and Dreamworld. For each of the limited-time flavors, the beverage company offered high-concept descriptions of an experience, rather than specific flavors. For Coke, the mystery is the point.\n\n“We’re engaging with people,” said Selman Careaga, global category president of Coca-Cola Trademark, which includes Coke drinks but not other Coca-Cola products like Fanta, Sprite or others. “They’re interacting with us, and they’re trying to guess what’s in it.”\n\nGetting people talking is an important marketing strategy for Coke, especially if it can spark interest among young consumers.\n\nRecently, Coca-Cola has been “really trying to encourage consumers to debate” over their products, noted Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. When the company unveiled its new Coke Zero recipe, for example, it encouraged customers to decide whether it was the “best Coke ever.” And it’s been selling mystery Fanta flavors as part of its “What the Fanta?” campaign.\n\nStarlight is inspired by space. Billy F Blume Jr/Shutterstock\n\nConversations around product flavors put brands front-of-mind for consumers. Coca-Cola (KO) wants people who engage in these discussions, or see them online, to think about Coke when they walk into a store, noted Stanford. And it’s especially important for the beverage company to create chatter around its marquee brand, which it has prioritized after slashing underperforming brands.\n\nPlus, these products aren’t just out-there Coke flavors. Each comes with a dedicated online experience. Together, they’re designed to capture the attention of a coveted demographic: Gen Z.\n\nCotton Candy, Creamsicles or Bubblegum?\n\nInstead of a traditional flavor like “vanilla” or “cherry,” Coca-Cola provided each product with its own vague description, and let fans fill in the blanks.\n\nThe company described Starlight as having “notes reminiscent of stargazing around a campfire, as well as a cooling sensation that evokes the feeling of a cold journey to space.” Byte “invites you to explore what pixels might taste like,” and Dreamworld is somehow even more conceptual, promising consumers that they will “experience the familiar Coca-Cola taste now with a surprising and unexpected flavor from a dream world.”\n\nYouTubers reviewing the product groaned over the cheesy advertising, but still tried to puzzle out the taste, encouraging commenters to weigh in.\n\nGuesses were all over the map: Some thought that Starlight tastes like cotton candy, funnel cake or S’mores. After trying Byte, some guessed blueberry or grapefruit. People said that Dreamworld tasted of mango, peach or orange. Or maybe cough syrup.\n\nSome brands roll out mystery flavors, but reward customers with a reveal. Mountain Dew has made a tradition of releasing a secret VooDew flavor, and eventually telling customers what it is. Coca-Cola’s Fanta flavors will be unveiled, as well.\n\nBut Starlight, Byte and Dreamworld’s flavors are staying in the vault, said Careaga.\n\n“In a way, [it’s] like our secret formula,” he said. And in this case, the flavors aren’t really the point.\n\nTargeting Gen Z\n\nCoca-Cola didn’t share sales figures for these products. But it is pleased with the results so far, said Careaga. Efforts like the mystery flavors have contributed to sales growth in Coke drinks overall, he said. Trademark Coke grew 7% in the second quarter.\n\nThe beverages were developed to fit into the broader themes of space, computing and dreams, respectively. But the flavors themselves? Not so important.\n\n“It’s really not so much about the taste of the product, but really around the experiences that we create,” he said. Those experiences are often virtual, intending to capture a younger audience that spends lots of time online.\n\nEach of the limited-time flavors was launched among a slew of digital experiences. To name a few: Starlight’s can featured a QR code that granted customers access to a holographic Ava Max concert. Byte was launched in Fortnite, and Dreamworld customers could buy virtual merchandise for their online avatars.\n\nWhat is important, however, is that every Coke product tastes like a Coke.\n\n“The R&D team does a great job [of] developing these new flavors, which are Coca-Cola based, but then we kind of play a little bit with the taste.” Careaga said. “Without a doubt, it’s a Coca-Cola product.”\n\nDeveloping new Coke flavors can be risky if they stray too far from the signature flavor, Stanford noted.\n\n“When you create these formulas that could be hit or miss, you’ve got to be very careful,” Stanford said. “The longevity of the brand has been all about that very unique Coke taste,” he added. “You want to make sure you don’t undermine that long-term message.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/business/coke-new-flavor/index.html", "title": "Coca-Cola Starlight: Coke's new flavor is out of this world | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nCoke’s new flavor is out of this world.\n\nAt least, that’s the idea behind Coca-Cola Starlight, a new limited-edition version of the classic soda that comes in regular and zero sugar.\n\nAfter deciding to discontinue half of its portfolio a few years ago, getting rid of outdated but beloved drinks including Tab and Odwalla, the soda giant has been focusing on promoting its core product, Coke. Starlight is the first beverage from Coca-Cola Creations, a new innovation platform.\n\nUnlike “cherry” or “vanilla,” it’s not immediately clear how “starlight” is supposed to taste. So Redditors who spotted images of the new product online a few months ago shared some theories about the new drink’s flavor. Some say they spotted the mysterious new product on retailer websites ahead of the official launch, slated for next week.\n\nOne guessed raspberry, because “a quick Google search says that space tastes like raspberries.” (Astronomers do think that the center of the galaxy may taste like raspberries and smell like rum, according to a 2009 Guardian article. Delicious! And not a bad idea for Coca-Cola, which is launching spiked versions of its drinks left and right.) More recently, a YouTuber who tried the product noted after-tastes of “chocolate [and] graham cracker.” That led another Redditor to guess that the flavor is “s’mores.”\n\nCoca-Cola Starlight is a new limited-time product. courtesy of Coca-Cola\n\nOn Thursday, Coca-Cola finally cleared up the mystery. Sort of. The company’s explanation is … well, see for yourself: Starlight is “inspired by space” has “notes reminiscent of stargazing around a campfire, as well as a cooling sensation that evokes the feeling of a cold journey to space,” the company said in a release.\n\nSo yeah, maybe s’mores?\n\nAlso, it’s red. Or in the company’s words, “Coca-Cola Starlight combines great Coca-Cola taste with a dash of the unexpected, including a reddish hue.”\n\nTo this reporter, after tasting a sample of the zero-sugar version provided by the company, that last sentence just about sums it up. The beverage did not taste like space travel or sitting around a campfire. It did, however, taste like a sweeter version of Coca-Cola. And it is definitely red.\n\nStarlight is getting the full Coca-Cola Creations promotional treatment, which includes a digital marketing campaign featuring pop singer Ava Max.\n\nCoke’s new marketing strategy\n\nLast year, Coca-Cola launched a new brand platform called “Real Magic.” The idea is to take a slightly different approach to marketing Coke — one that tries to reach new consumers by focusing on gaming and music, among other things. Coca-Cola Creations, which will introduce new limited-time “products and experiences across physical and digital worlds,” is part of that platform.\n\n“When we launched ‘Real Magic,’ we wanted to connect with and celebrate the experiences that bring joy to young people today, and that has taken us to an exciting new territory,” Oana Vlad, senior director of global brand strategy at Coca-Cola, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nFor Coca-Cola, reaching young consumers is essential because interest in soft drinks has been declining for years. Exciting new campaigns and mysterious products could be a way to get potential new customers to pay attention.\n\nSo what does that entail? In the case of Starlight, it means a holographic concert by Ava Max, who has also performed in the gaming platform Roblox. The concert can be accessed via a QR code on the Starlight label. Plus, the sparkly packaging and that reddish hue.\n\nBut not everything about Starlight is new. It’s also a nod to when Coca-Cola actually sent a can of Coke to space in the 1980s. But that one just tasted like Coke.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated to reflect that Coca-Cola Starlight comes in both zero-sugar and regular varieties.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/business/ketchup-popsicle-frenchys-canada-trnd/index.html", "title": "The newest, weirdest summer treat is a ketchup-flavored popsicle ...", "text": "1.

He noted that he’s been surprised by the number of “golden ticket” themed applications and the elaborate videos of entire families offering to share the tasting duties and salary.\n\nBut Hejazi also sees the attraction. “Imagine your best memories around candy, and having that every day at work,” he said.\n\nCandy Funhouse, based outside of Toronto, is headed by a quartet of 20- and 30-something siblings who grew up in the area and whose parents owned donut shops and a local restaurant.\n\n“My brother Mo, a candyhead, founded it in 2018 and my mother was employee no. 2,” said Hejazi, adding that he and a younger sister and brother later joined the firm.\n\nThe family hoped to differentiate their company from other highly successful online and brick-and-mortar competitors such as Mars, Hershey and Amazon with a “weird” mix of products, no minimum orders — “we’ll sell one lollipop” — and a strong push on social media.\n\nSales in 2021, boosted substantially by the pandemic, were “just under $15 million.

Over the years Dr Pepper has found success as a quirky alternative to Coke and Pepsi.\n\nToday, Dr Pepper is hardly a scrappy underdog — it’s the hero brand in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) which, along with Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP), make up the three largest soda companies in the $37 billion US market, as measured by NielsenIQ in retail and convenience stores.\n\nAnd recently, Dr Pepper has been gaining ground on its competitors, even as the overall soda market goes flat.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper is the third-largest soda maker in the country. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper soda grew its dollar share by 9% from 2003 to 2021, compared to a 26% drop in the carbonated soft drinks category overall, according to Keurig Dr Pepper, citing IRI and the Beverage Digest factbook. Today, Dr Pepper is the fourth most popular soda in the country after Coke, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.\n\n“Over the past 20 years, carbonated soft drinks have been declining in volume,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “One of the bright spots … has been Dr Pepper.”\n\nFounded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper was the first in a wave of 19th-century upstart soda companies. (It dropped the period in the 1950s for design reasons.) The little brand rose to prominence in the latter half of the 20th century and helped shape the soda industry, all while cultivating its reputation as an outsider.\n\nThe early days of Dr Pepper\n\nThe drink was invented by Charles Alderton, a pharmacist at a drug store owned by Wade Morrison, who is credited with patenting the drink and naming it.\n\nLegend has it that Morrison named the beverage after one Charles Pepper, the father of a woman he loved, hoping that the gesture would facilitate a match. That’s the tale on the Dr Pepper website. But Joy Summar-Smith, associate director of the Dr Pepper Museum in Waco, said there are several origin stories, and this one doesn’t hold up.\n\n“By the time [Morrison] came across Dr. Pepper he was married and he had a son,” said Summar-Smith.\n\nCoca-Cola was created in 1886. Pepsi was invented in the 1890s, but got its name in 1898.\n\n“The soft drink industry itself, as a whole, was still really trying to figure itself out in the late 1800s, early 1900s,” Summar-Smith said. “Each town had their own soft drink manufacturing facility.”\n\nCoca-Cola established itself most quickly, aided by its invention of the coupon, which offered free samples of its new beverage. Pepsi positioned itself as a less expensive competitor to Coke.\n\nAds for Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola on a store in North Carolina, in April 1938. John Vachon/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nWhile Coke and Pepsi were making waves, Dr Pepper “just didn’t push it that hard,” said Tristan Donovan, author of “Fizz: How Soda Shook Up the World.”\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Dr Pepper encouraged customers to drink a Dr Pepper three times a day, at around 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., to keep their energy up. While successful, the campaign never focused on the product’s unique, non-cola flavor.\n\nIn the 1950s, Dr Pepper branded itself “the friendly Pepper-Upper,” once again focusing on the rush of energy you could get from any can of soda.\n\nThen, everything changed.\n\nNot a cola\n\nIn the early 20th century, national bottlers that worked with with Coke or Pepsi shied away from Dr Pepper, fearing they would run afoul of agreements that barred them from partnering with a competitor. As a result, Dr Pepper had little national distribution, focusing primarily on Texas and nearby states.\n\nIn the 1960s, PepsiCo sued Dr Pepper for trademark infringement. Dr Pepper countered, accusing Pepsi of denying the beverage entry to its distribution platform. In 1963, a judge ruled for the bottler, opening the door to the product’s national expansion.​​\n\nDr Pepper “pulled off a legal coup that gave it the necessary leg up: It argued effectively in a US District Court that Dr Pepper was not a cola,” a 1984 article in D Magazine explained. Or as the Federal Trade Commission put it, “the suit opened up PepsiCo and Coca-Cola bottlers to Dr Pepper and its sales rose immediately.”\n\nWith new-found access to the whole country, the brand “started promoting [itself] much more heavily,” said Donovan, the author of “Fizz.”\n\nThrough the 1970s, Dr Pepper marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor, a shift that D Magazine said “fleshed out an identity for Dr Pepper that may be its most formidable asset.” In 1977, the company launched its “Be a Pepper” campaign, encouraging people to identify as Dr Pepper drinkers.\n\nThe \"Be a Pepper\" campaign ran from 1977 to 1983. Courtesy Keurig Dr Pepper\n\nToday, Dr Pepper advertises itself as a treat, using a pint-sized mascot called Lil’ Sweet in its commercials. Another campaign, Fanville, is set in a fictionalized world where people are obsessed with college football and also Dr Pepper, positioning the beverage as a cult favorite.\n\nAfter Dr Pepper established itself as an alternative to mainstream colas, it launched on a path that ultimately made it part of the country’s third-largest soft drink maker, Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nDr Pepper hits the scene\n\nDuring the wave of mega-mergers in the 1980s, Coca-Cola tried to scoop up Dr Pepper.\n\nIn 1986, soon after PepsiCo announced its intention to purchase 7Up, Coca-Cola said it had agreed to acquire Dr Pepper. The plans would have made Coke and Pepsi the most formidable players in the market by far, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.\n\nBut both Coke’s and Pepsi’s deals were blocked, as the FTC decided the beverages were similar enough to pose a possible antitrust threat.\n\nA whirlwind series of mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs ensued. Dr Pepper and 7Up merged in the late 1980s. Over the years, Cadbury Schweppes took stakes in the combined company and, eventually, full ownership of the brands. In 2008 Cadbury spun off its North American beverage division to create the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. A decade later, Keurig Green Mountain merged with that company, creating Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nBottles of Dr. Pepper move down a production line at the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant in Utah. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper, soda giant\n\nToday, KDP still trails behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but it’s narrowing the gap.\n\nBy volume, Coca-Cola controlled about 40% of the US retail market in the first nine months of 2022, followed by PepsiCo with about 29% and Keurig Dr Pepper with roughly 25%, according to Beverage Digest’s data.\n\nCompared to the year before, PepsiCo’s share fell by 1%, while Keurig Dr Pepper’s ticked up. And over the years, the Dr Pepper brand has been gaining momentum while some of its competitors struggle. That might be because of consumers’ increasing interest in flavored soft drinks, said Stanford, the publication’s editor.\n\nThere are other advantages to existing outside of the cola dichotomy. Food-service providers typically have an agreement with either Coke or Pepsi for its soda fountains, and one fountain won’t feature products made by the other. But the fountains often offer Dr Pepper, making it a widely available choice.\n\n“Dr Pepper is the number one most differentiated trademark in beverage — not just soft drinks, but in beverage,” said Derek Dabrowski, general manager of juices, mixers and sauces at KDP. People reach for Dr Pepper when they want a treat, he added. That’s “where we have been winning.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2022/07/23/titanium-dioxide-food-skittles-lawsuit-health/10106708002/", "title": "Skittles was sued for containing titanium dioxide. Plenty of other ...", "text": "In a lawsuit filed last week, a consumer alleged that Skittles were \"unfit for human consumption\" because the rainbow candy contained a \"known toxin\" – an artificial color additive called titanium dioxide.\n\nIn a statement sent to USA TODAY on Sunday, Justin Comes, vice president of research and development for Skittles maker Mars Wrigley North America, said the company couldn't comment on pending litigation – but that its use of titanium dioxide and \"all Mars Wrigley ingredients are safe and manufactured in compliance with strict quality and safety requirements established by food safety regulators, including the FDA.\"\n\nTitanium dioxide is used in a wide range of food products and consumer goods – from candy to sunscreen and house paint. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintains that the regulated use of titanium dioxide, specifically as a color additive in food, is safe under some restrictions.\n\nHowever, some experts and food regulators in other countries disagree – pointing to potential, serious health consequences and rising concerns about the additive. Starting August 7, for example, the use of titanium dioxide in food will be banned in the European Union.\n\nHere's what you need to know about titanium dioxide:\n\nCustomer sues Mars:Skittles are 'unsafe' for consumers, lawsuit charges, because they contain 'a known toxin'\n\nWhat is titanium dioxide? Why is it used in food products?\n\nTitanium dioxide, or TiO2, sometimes referred to as E171, is an inorganic, solid substance used in a wide range of consumer goods including cosmetics, paint, plastic and food, according to the American Chemistry Council.\n\nIn food, titanium dioxide is often used as an artificial color additive. Tasha Stoiber, senior scientist at the consumer health nonprofit Environmental Working Group, says titanium dioxide can generally be thought of as a \"paint primer\" – it often goes on a hard-shelled candy like Skittles before the color is added to give it a \"uniform shine.\"\n\nTitanium dioxide \"can also be found in dairy products to make them whiter and brighter … like frosting or cottage cheese,\" Stoiber told USA TODAY, adding that the additive is used in other products – such as food or beverage instant mixes – as an anti-caking agent.\n\nPhthalates on the fast-food menu:Chemicals linked to health problems found at McDonalds, Taco Bell\n\nTitanium dioxide is used in an enormous range of food products, which can feel jarring when looking at some of its other uses.\n\n\"It's sort of ironic, maybe ironic is the wrong word, that the ingredient in paint that makes your kitchen shiny also makes your Hostess cupcakes shiny,\" Environmental Working Group's senior vice president of government affairs Scott Faber added.\n\nIs titanium dioxide dangerous? Has it been linked to any health issues?\n\nWhile the FDA maintains that the regulated use of titanium dioxide is safe, the European Food Safety Authority and some other experts warn of potential, serious health risks.\n\nMost notably, a European Food Safety Authority safety assessment published in May 2021 pointed to genotoxicity concerns, as suggested by previous research. Genotoxicity is the ability of chemicals to damage genetic information such as DNA, which may lead to cancer.\n\n\"After oral ingestion, the absorption of titanium dioxide particles is low, however they can accumulate in the body,\" Maged Younes, chair of the European Food Safety Authority's expert Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings, said in a May 2021 statement.\n\nCan cancer patients skip post-surgery chemo? New research says some may be able to.\n\nThe authority did not identify a safe amount of titanium dioxide that could be consumed.\n\nMatthew Wright, chair of the authority's working group on titanium dioxide, noted that \"the evidence for general toxic effects was not conclusive,\" but that the panel couldn't rule out genotoxicity entirely. There were also some current data limitations and the assessment \"could not establish a safe level for daily intake of the food additive,\" he stated.\n\nWhat other candies and food contain titanium dioxide?\n\nIt's hard to determine the total amount of food products that have titanium dioxide because federal regulations don't require all producers to list its use on ingredient labels, but the list of foods containing the substance certainly doesn't end with Skittles.\n\nOf the products that include the additive in their labels, Thea Bourianne, senior manager at data consultant Label Insights, told Food Navigator USA in May 2021 that more than 11,000 products in the company's database of U.S. food and beverage products listed titanium dioxide as an ingredient. Non-chocolate candy led those numbers at 32%. Cupcakes and snack cakes made up 14%, followed by cookies at 8%, coated pretzels and trail mix at 7%, baking decorations at 6%, gum and mints at 4% and ice cream at 2%.\n\nFood recalls:Some Jif peanut butter products recalled over salmonella outbreak concerns\n\nIn addition to Skittles, other candies that contain titanium dioxide include Nice! mints, Trolli sour gummies and Ring Pops, according to Environmental Working Group.\n\nOther food products that list titanium dioxide are Lucerne cottage cheese, Beyond Meat's chicken plant-based tenders, Great Value ice cream and Chips Ahoy! cookies.\n\nWhat is the FDA limit for titanium dioxide?\n\nThe FDA's Code of Federal Regulations allows for the legal, regulated use of titanium dioxide in food products, under some restrictions.\n\n\"The FDA continues to allow for the safe use of titanium dioxide as a color additive in foods generally according to the specifications and conditions, including that the quantity of titanium dioxide does not exceed 1% by weight of the food,\" the FDA said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nThe FDA first approved the use of titanium dioxide in food in 1966, following its 1960 removal (along with the removal of other color additives) from the agency's original \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" list. In 1977, titanium dioxide joined the list of color additives that are exempt from certification, which means \"titanium dioxide\" doesn't have to be listed on the packaging of every product it's used in, Faber noted.\n\n\"There are many uses of titanium dioxide that we don't know about because they were made exempt from being on the package in 1977,\" said Faber, who added that \"nothing much has changed\" since – other than the FDA approving some other uses of the color additive, such as expanding the use of mica-based pearlescent pigments (prepared from titanium dioxide) as color additives in distilled spirits over recent years.\n\nFDA guidelines:Americans are eating too much salt. So the FDA wants food manufacturers to cut back on sodium.\n\nFaber argued there hasn't been enough change in these federal regulations in the decades following the FDA's approval of titanium dioxide – especially as others increasingly point to potential health consequences.\n\n\"What titanium dioxide is really emblematic of ... is the failure of FDA to look back at these old decisions and ask whether its decisions that were made in this case ... 56 years ago (in the 1966 approval) still hold up,\" he said.\n\nIn its statement to USA TODAY, the FDA maintained that, in all post-approvals for food additives, \"our scientists continue to review relevant new information to determine whether there are safety questions and whether the use of such substance is no longer safe under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\"\n\nWhen asked about the recent Skittles lawsuit, the FDA said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nIs titanium dioxide illegal in other countries?\n\nThough the regulated use of titanium dioxide in food products is legal in the U.S. and Canada, it's banned in some other countries, notably throughout Europe. In May 2021, the European Food Safety Authority announced that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered safe as a food additive.\"\n\nFollowing six months of phasing out the additive, titanium dioxide will be completely banned in the European Union starting August 7. France had previously banned the use of titanium dioxide in food starting in January 2020.\n\nHow can I tell if a product has titanium dioxide in it? How can I avoid the ingredient?\n\nSome food products will include titanium dioxide on their nutrition label. But again, it can be hard to tell for those who don't list the ingredient.\n\nIf you want to avoid titanium dioxide, Stoiber and Faber urge consumers to try and avoid processed foods as best as you can.\n\n\"By reducing processed foods in your diet, you can reduce the likelihood of not only eating titanium dioxide but eating other chemicals of concern,\" Faber said, noting that consumers can also call their elected representatives urging them to support increased food safety legislation and take action with organization alliances like Toxic Free Food FDA. \"America, once again, is falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to chemical safety.\"\n\n\"We're not only just concerned about titanium dioxide, there's a whole host of other food additives that also have known harmful health risks associated with them as well,\" Stoiber added.\n\nHealthy eating:Don't focus on 'good' or 'bad' food.

Really.\n\nThe company’s new “instabowls” look like traditional single-serve bowls — little tubs of cereal, designed to be eaten dry or with milk. But the instabowls also contain milk powder. When you add cold water and stir, the milk rehydrates and voila: instant milk and cereal.\n\nThis is the “first time that we’re able to give consumers the opportunity to have a milk and cereal experience without having milk readily available,” said Chris Stolsky, marketing director at Kellogg. “This can go with you wherever.”\n\nThe bowls come in four varieties: Frosted Flakes, Raisin Bran Crunch, Froot Loops and Apple Jacks. They are rolling out at select Walmart stores and available nationally at Walmart.com, and cost $1.98 per bowl.\n\nFrosted Flakes and Apple Jacks Insta-bowls. Danielle Bronner/CNN\n\nCereal sales had stagnated for years but got a boost during the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, US ready-to-eat cereal sales surged to over $9 billion, up 9% from 2019, according to data from NielsenIQ. The bump was short-lived, however. In 2021, sales fell 7% to $8.4 billion — still above 2019 sales, but below the pandemic surge.\n\nAnd earlier this year, Kellogg announced that it was splitting into three separate businesses. The largest business includes Kellogg’s snack brands, with North American cereal and plant-based foods spun off into two smaller, discrete companies. The separation will take effect by the end of next year.\n\nIntroducing a more portable cereal option may help keep some of that pandemic momentum going, especially as more consumers opt for snacks rather than sit-down meals, or once again eat breakfast outside of their homes.\n\nKellogg’s has been looking for a way to create milk-and-cereal bowls for over two years, said Stolsky, adding that consumers were interested in to-go products even before the pandemic.\n\nBut it took a while to figure out how to transform the milk powder into liquid quickly, a crucial innovation.\n\nAdd water, BYO spoon\n\nSome powdered milks take a lot of stirring, or even shaking, to resemble liquid milk, Stolsky noted. You can’t really do that with cereal. And the longer it takes to fully rehydrate the milk, the soggier the cereal becomes. Before it could make Instabowls a reality, Kellogg’s needed something that would rehydrate swiftly and easily.\n\nInstabowls use “a proprietary process that essentially evaporates the water off but leaves the milk components there,” Stolsky said. “So when you add the water back, it’s the same great taste, same great nutrition that you get with a regular amount of milk.”\n\nI tried the Raisin Bran Crunch bowl, provided by Kellogg’s. Peeling back the lid revealed the cereal, topped with the milk powder. I added water to the fill line and after some stirring, the powder turned into milk, as promised.\n\nTo me, the rehydrated milk tasted a little strange, but that could be because I typically eat cereal with almond milk. My husband tried the Froot Loops bowl, and said he wouldn’t have known the milk was rehydrated. To him, it just tasted like sweet cereal milk.\n\nThose who want a plant-based option should “hang tight,” said Stolsky. The company is “exploring” non-dairy powders, he said, adding that rehydrating is “a little more difficult when you’re using non-dairy … we need a little bit more time to work through that so the experience is the same.” Kellogg’s also made the choice to sell the bowls without spoons to reduce waste.\n\nEventually, the company plans to make the product available at more retailers. But it wants to make sure that people understand the concept first.\n\n“We are really doing a test market with Walmart,” Stolsky said. The limited test will help the company “better understand” how to introduce the new product to consumers.\n\n“It’s very strange, right? That you’re going to add water to it,” he said. “We want them to be able to understand,” the product, and that “the magic is in the bowl.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/padres/2022/07/01/padres-city-connect-jerseys-unveiled-pink-green-and-gold-uniforms/7790496001/", "title": "Padres' City Connect jerseys unveiled: Pink, green and gold uniforms", "text": "The San Diego Padres unveiled their new Nike City Connect Series uniforms on Friday.\n\nThe Padres' new jerseys pay homage to the team's \"binational fanbase\" with colors that represent the coastal community.\n\n“Two cities, two cultures, one home team,” said Manny Machado, Padres third baseman, in the team’s release video.\n\nThe jerseys are also a nod to the landscapes and artwork of the city and the Baja Peninsula.\n\nCITY CONNECT: Ranking all of MLB's special-edition jerseys\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\nThe jersey release video features narration from legendary skateboarder and Padres fan Tony Hawk.\n\nThe Padres, who are in second place in the NL West entering Friday, will debut the uniforms on July 8 and wear them for every subsequent Friday home game.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}]}
