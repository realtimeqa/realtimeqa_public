The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,” Stokes wrote. The group said it is gross negligence to ignore the quarantine guidelines and threatened possible legal action.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest city plans to boost enforcement of an expanded mask mandate and restrict gathering sizes in a bid to curb coronavirus cases, officials said Friday. The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while “exercising vigorously outdoors,” the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. “Congregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. “I know we are asking a lot of you.” Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record. Saturday’s total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state’s death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve, teacher sick day: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/us/inside-texas-synagogue-hostage-standoff/index.html", "title": "Inside the Texas synagogue hostage standoff | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt started like most any Saturday for members of Congregation Beth Israel.\n\nFamilies of the Reform Jewish synagogue just outside Dallas-Fort Worth had gathered – in person and online – to participate in the Sabbath service, even amid the twin perils of a fresh pandemic wave and a swelling tide of attacks on Jewish people in the United States.\n\nBy day’s end, the community of faith in Colleyville, Texas, would be at the center of a global drama involving a livestreamed hostage-taking, an imprisoned terrorist icon, an elite FBI rescue team, a rabbi’s quick thinking and a final, frantic sprint to freedom.\n\nMore details may yet offer a deeper understanding of why it happened. But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/31/pumpkin-surgeons-wild-exhibit-white-house-groundskeeper-news-around-states/50888775/", "title": "Pumpkin surgeons, 'Wild' exhibit: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Descendants of the steamship owner responsible for illegally bringing 110 African captives to America aboard the last U.S. slave ship have ended generations of public silence, calling his actions more than 160 years ago “evil and unforgivable.” In a statement released to NBC News, members of Timothy Meaher’s family – which is still prominent around Mobile – said what Meaher did on the eve of the Civil War “had consequences that have impacted generations of people.” “Our family has been silent for too long on this matter. However, we are hopeful that we – the current generation of the Meaher family – can start a new chapter,” said the statement, which came amid the release of “Descendant,” a new documentary about the people who were brought to the United States aboard the slave ship Clotilda and their families. The film was acquired by Netflix and Higher Ground, the production company of Barack and Michelle Obama. The Meaher family has started meeting with leaders of the community in and around Africatown, the community begun by the Africans in north Mobile after they were released from slavery in 1865, the statement said. Clotilda Descendants Association President Jeremy Ellis said the organization had been in contact with the Meaher family by email, and members hope for face-to-face talks.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Alaskans want results, not “partisan political rhetoric,” as she faced Donald Trump-backed Republican rival Kelly Tshibaka in a televised debate Thursday. Tshibaka questioned the value of Murkowski’s seniority and said it’s time for a change. Murkowski “cannot accomplish in the next six years what she hasn’t been able to accomplish in the last 21 years,” Tshibaka said. Murkowski, who has held the seat since late 2002 and is the most senior member of Alaska’s congressional delegation, said the race is about “who can best deliver for Alaska.” She pointed to and defended her record. The debate, held less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 ranked-choice election, also included Democrat Pat Chesbro, who has significantly trailed Murkowski and Tshibaka in fundraising. The other candidate on the ballot, Republican Buzz Kelley, who finished fourth in the August primary, last month suspended his campaign and endorsed Tshibaka. Trump, who came to Alaska in July for a rally with Tshibaka and Sarah Palin, whose U.S. House run he’s endorsed, participated in a tele-rally for Tshibaka last week. He called Murkowski “one of the worst senators even imaginable,” criticizing her for voting for the “insane impeachment” and for opposing Brett Kavanaugh’s U.S. Supreme Court nomination.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal judge refused Friday to bar a group from monitoring outdoor ballot boxes in Maricopa County – where watchers have shown up armed and in ballistic vests – saying to do so could violate the monitors’ constitutional rights. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi said the case remained open, and the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans could try again to make its argument against a group calling itself Clean Elections USA. A second plaintiff, Voto Latino, was removed from the case. Liburdi concluded that “while this case certainly presents serious questions, the Court cannot craft an injunction without violating the First Amendment.” The judge is a Trump appointee and a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization. Local and federal law enforcement have been alarmed by reports of people, some masked and armed, watching 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County and rural Yavapai County as midterm elections near. Some voters have complained of voter intimidation after people watching the boxes took photos and videos and followed voters. “Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with any evidence that Defendants’ conduct constitutes a true threat,” the judge wrote. “On this record, Defendants have not made any statements threatening to commit acts of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Students from Northside High School have made bed frames for children in need. The city’s school district, Rotary Club of Fort Smith, the Community Rescue Mission, and the Sleep in Heavenly Peace organization joined forces on the hand-crafted bed construction project. According to SHP, 3% of children ages 3-17 nationwide do not have a bed in which to sleep. On Friday, 25 students from Northside’s construction class put their knowledge and skills to work in an effort to build beds for needy children. The SHP organization will deliver 30 new beds, along with mattresses and bedding, to area homes. “This project gives our students a chance to serve their community while enhancing their skill set,” Fort Smith Public Schools Superintendent Terry Morawski said. Fort Smith Rotary Club volunteer member Ken Colley said his group was “very excited” to lend a hand. “No kid should sleep on the floor in our town,” Colley said. “Studies have shown that if a child has a good night’s sleep, they will be much more apt to stay alert in the classroom and be able to focus and remember what they learn.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A man who spent more than 38 years behind bars for a 1983 murder and two attempted murders has been released from prison after long-untested DNA evidence pointed to a different person, the Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday. The conviction of Maurice Hastings, 69, and a life sentence were vacated during an Oct. 20 court hearing at the request of prosecutors and his lawyers from the Los Angeles Innocence Project at California State University, Los Angeles. “I prayed for many years that this day would come,” Hastings said at a news conference Friday. “I am not pointing fingers. I am not standing up here a bitter man, but I just want to enjoy my life now while I have it.” “What has happened to Mr. Hastings is a terrible injustice,” District Attorney George Gascón said in a statement. “The justice system is not perfect, and when we learn of new evidence which causes us to lose confidence in a conviction, it is our obligation to act swiftly.” The victim in the case, Roberta Wydermyer, was sexually assaulted and killed by a single gunshot to the head, authorities said. Her body was found in the trunk of her vehicle in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. A suspect identified through DNA testing last year had died in prison in 2020, according to state officials.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,100 homes and businesses in suburban Denver last winter caused more than $2 billion in losses, making it by far the costliest in Colorado history, the state insurance commissioner said. Commissioner Michael Conway provided the updated estimate this month during a meeting with residents who lost homes to the so-called Marshall Fire in Boulder County and other Colorado wildfires in recent years, The Denver Post reports. The Boulder County fire broke out unusually late in December following months of drought and is blamed for at least one death. Official estimates released days after the fire put the losses at more than $500 million. Experts say the winter grassland fire that blew up along Colorado’s Front Range was rare, but similar events will be more common in the coming years as climate change warms the planet, sucking the moisture out of plants, and as suburbs grow in fire-prone areas. Conway said additional insurance claims and assessments of the scope of rebuilding from the wildfire prompted the new estimate. “We’re estimating now it will be $2 billion in claims if not more,” he told residents. Investigators have yet to determine what caused the Dec. 30 fire, which was fed by winds up to 100 mph and raced from the Rocky Mountain foothills eastward through unincorporated Boulder County and into the cities of Superior and Louisville.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: As part of his campaign to win over blue state voters, the Republican candidate for governor, Bob Stefanowski, is trying to capitalize on any lingering resentment over safety precautions taken at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the businessman pledged never to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for schoolchildren, joining Republicans who made similar promises after a national panel advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add the shots to lists of recommended vaccinations for kids and adults. Stefanowski has complained that the state’s old mask mandate in schools, which ended in most districts in late February after campuses were allowed to reopen for in-person learning with masks in August 2020, lasted too long. In his proposed “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” he said families shouldn’t be “forced by the government to vaccinate or mask their children without any recourse to object.” “It’s up to the person. They should have the choice,” Stefanowski said. Stefanowski’s opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for “public or private employees or anyone else” is in line with other Republicans who have campaigned this election season on promises to protect individual liberty in public health.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden returned to his home state to cast his ballot for the midterm election Saturday afternoon. He was joined by his 18-year-old granddaughter Natalie, a first-time voter. The two arrived at the Shipyard Shops polling location on the Wilmington Riverfront at 4:15 p.m., a few hours after the president watched Natalie Biden’s field hockey game at St. Andrew’s in Middletown. The two of them walked through the doors of the polling place hand in hand after greeting a constituent leaving the building. Secret Service and local police officers were posted outside as the Bidens voted, drawing the attention of others who had come to vote early. They took photos and posted on social media, surprised to see the president there. When the Bidens emerged from the voting booths, White House staff said Joe and Natalie Biden placed “I Voted” stickers on each others’ shirts. The president then gave his granddaughter a kiss on the cheek. Joe and Natalie Biden join the more than 17,800 Delawareans who had voted either by mail or in person as of Friday afternoon, according to the Delaware Department of Elections. A department spokesperson said the official count would be updated Monday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chief White House groundskeeper as of this month has spent 50 years serving the families – and many of their pets – who have called the mansion home. Dale Haney’s chief responsibility in his post that has spanned 10 presidencies is to care for the vast lawns, colorful flower gardens, hundreds of trees, thousands of shrubs and burgeoning vegetable garden on 18 acres of property surrounding the White House. He also picks out the official White House Christmas tree every year. To honor Haney, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, surprised Haney last Monday by planting an elm tree on the south grounds. Biden said visitors in future years are “going to be looking at this tree and asking, ‘Who’s Dale?’ ” Haney, 70, joked that he “might still be here.” But Haney is perhaps better known to many at the White House, from staff to Secret Service officers, as the keeper of the president’s pets. “He’s like the whisperer,” said Anita McBride, who was a young aide in the correspondence office in Ronald Reagan’s administration when she first met Haney. These days, Haney is often seen walking Commander, Biden’s German shepherd. Haney started at the White House in 1972 and said he originally planned to work there for just two years.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: An evacuation order has abruptly forced out residents of a 14-story oceanfront building on the same avenue where a condominium collapse killed nearly 100 people last year. The city posted an unsafe structure notice Thursday evening at the Port Royale condominium, Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said in an email. A structural engineering report prompted the evacuation of the 164-unit structure, which is in the process of undergoing a required recertification. An engineer discovered that a main support beam identified for repair 10 months ago had shifted, and a crack in the beam had expanded, and other structural supports may need repair as well, the report said. One resident, renovation contractor Marash Markaj, who lived in the building for more than six years, said the damage extends beyond a single support beam. “I’ve seen the issues for many years,” Markaj told the Associated Press. He said he tried to report the issues – including cracks in a column and water standing in the garage area for weeks at a time – to the building management and to the city’s building department. “I was never able to get a response,” he said, adding that he was feeling “unsafe” living in the building and with the way the building’s maintenance was handled.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A man and his family “have faced threats of violence and live in fear” since the movie “2000 Mules” falsely accused him of ballot fraud during the 2020 election, according to a federal lawsuit. The widely debunked film includes surveillance video showing Mark Andrews, his face blurred, depositing five ballots in a drop box in downtown Lawrenceville, a suburb northeast of Atlanta. A voiceover by conservative pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza says: “What you are seeing is a crime. These are fraudulent votes.” In fact, a state investigation found, Andrews was dropping off ballots for himself, his wife and their three adult children, who all live at the same address. That is legal in Georgia, and a state investigator said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Andrews. D’Souza’s film uses research from the Texas-based nonprofit True the Vote and suggests that ballot “mules” aligned with Democrats were paid to illegally collect and deliver ballots in Georgia and four other closely watched states. An Associated Press analysis found that it is based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. State and federal officials have repeatedly confirmed that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election that could have changed the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A former U.S. defense contractor in Hawaii accused with his wife of living for decades under stolen identities of dead babies will get a new attorney, a federal judge ruled Thursday. According to prosecutors, Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison are the real names of the couple who have been fraudulently living for decades under stolen identities, Bobby Fort and Julie Montague. Prosecutors say Primrose spent more than 20 years in the Coast Guard, where he obtained secret-level security clearance. The couple have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, false statement in a passport application and aggravated identity theft. Assistant Federal Defender Max Mizono filed a motion this month asking to withdraw as Primrose’s attorney, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. During a telephone hearing Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Rom Trader granted the request after a private conversation with Mizono and Primrose. Prosecutors have suggested the case is about more than identity theft. A search of the couple’s home in Kapolei, a Honolulu suburb, turned up Polaroids of them wearing jackets that appear to be authentic Russian KGB uniforms, an invisible ink kit, documents with coded language and maps showing military bases, prosecutors said. Attorneys for the couple have said they are not Russian spies.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court says it will not reconsider the clemency case of a terminally ill man who is facing execution for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors near McCall. The high court made the decision Friday in Gerald Ross Pizzuto Jr.’s case. The decision means the state remains free to seek a death warrant for Pizzuto. Once issued, the warrant would set his execution by lethal injection in the next 30 days. Deborah A. Czuba, the head of the Federal Defender Services of Idaho’s capital case unit, said in a statement that the Idaho Supreme Court decision was disappointing. “There is still time for Gov. Brad Little to accept the recommendation of his parole commissioners and let Mr. Pizzuto die a natural death in prison,” Czuba said. “If not, our hope is that the State will have enough grace to wait at least until after the Thanksgiving and Christmas season before making Department of Correction employees participate in a needless and traumatizing execution during the holidays.” Pizzuto has spent more than three decades on death row and was originally scheduled to be put to death in June 2021. He asked for clemency last year because he has terminal bladder cancer, heart disease, diabetes and decreased intellectual function.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A mountain lion that roamed residential neighborhoods in the state capital was sedated Friday and taken to a sanctuary that houses big cats, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources said. The young male cat was tranquilized by staff with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services branch and sent to the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Center Point, Indiana, the state agency said. IDNR wildlife experts, Illinois Conservation Police, the USDA and the Springfield Police Department determined the animal had entered areas of the city where he would be a threat to people or property. The animal, which was fitted last year with a GPS collar by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, had wandered to Illinois from Nebraska. It arrived in Springfield on Wednesday, and IDNR warned residents not to disturb it while the agency tracked its movements. The DNR asked people to leave the mountain lion alone because the animals are a protected species in Illinois, and it’s illegal to kill them unless they pose an imminent threat to person or property. Its appearance in Springfield marks the second time in recent weeks a mountain lion has been detected in Illinois. The DNR said a mountain lion was struck and killed Oct. 16 by a vehicle along Interstate 88 in DeKalb County.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A fifth grade teacher in northwestern Indiana charged with felony intimidation after authorities say she told a student she had a “kill list” of students and staff has agreed to stay away from the school. Angelica Carrasquillo, 25, of Griffith, signed a no-contact order Friday without objection when she appeared wearing a green jail uniform in Lake Superior Court, The Times of Northwest Indiana reports. Judge Kathleen Lang affirmed Carrasquillo’s not guilty plea to one felony count of intimidation. Carrasquillo was being held with a bond set at $20,000 surety or $2,000 cash. Court documents say Carrasquillo communicated “a threat to commit murder” on Oct. 12. Once officials at the school where she was employed, St. Stanislaus in East Chicago, learned of the threat, they immediately confronted her and escorted her from the building, the Diocese of Gary said in a message to parents. When Carrasquillo was asked why she wanted to kill herself and others, she reportedly told school officials: “I’m having trouble with my mental health, and sometimes the kids do not listen in the classroom. I also have trauma caused when I went to high school.” But Carrasquillo also allegedly told school officials that “she was only joking about it all.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge should allow a law passed in 2018 that bans most abortions to take effect, three years after the measure was ruled unconstitutional, lawyers for Gov. Kim Reynolds argued Friday. Chris Schandevel, a lawyer for the Republican governor, said Judge Celene Gogerty should set aside a 2019 permanent injunction that prevented Iowa from enforcing a law that would block abortions once cardiac activity can be detected. That is usually around six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they’re pregnant. Schandevel said the injunction rests entirely on an Iowa Supreme Court 2018 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion under the state constitution and cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 and 1973 that established abortion rights nationally. All three cases were overruled this year by more conservative courts, and given that, Reynolds’ lawyers argued the judge should reverse the injunction and let the 2018 law take effect. Rita Bettis Austen, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, countered that there is no precedent or legal support in Iowa for a judge to reverse a final judgment entered three years ago. The judge said she would issue a ruling soon.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Voters are being asked to reduce the authority of the governor and other state officials and give legislators a bigger say in how the state regulates businesses, protects the environment and preserves residents’ health. A proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the Nov. 8 ballot would make it easier for the Republican-controlled Legislature to overturn regulations written by state agencies and boards – those under the control of the governor but also others in the executive branch of state government. At issue are rules as varied as which shots are required for children attending school and how often hotels must clean guest rooms. Business groups and advocates of smaller government view the measure as reining in unelected bureaucrats. But in the fall campaign’s final weeks, abortion rights advocates have begun warning that it is another attempted power grab by far-right legislators. The November vote comes three months after voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to eliminate state constitutional protections for abortion and give lawmakers authority to more tightly regulate or ban the procedure. Those who oppose the regulation amendment have repurposed the “vote no” yard signs from the abortion vote for their fall campaign.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools has received the largest gift in its history, according to the district, with plans to invest the funds in some of the city’s most disadvantaged schools. A total of $20 million was put forward by philanthropist MacKenzie Scott for Louisville’s public school district, officials said at a press conference Thursday. The money will go toward “direct financial support for JCPS,” district officials said in a release. JCPS Superintendent Marty Pollio said the gift came following an interview with a consulting firm that represents several unnamed philanthropists. Three months later, he said, Scott’s team called to tell him about the planned donation to JCPS. “We also promised this community that we would fund the schools in an appropriate way so that the families in this community would have equity in selection,” Pollio said at the event at the Academy @ Shawnee in Louisville’s West End. “You can’t go to a high-poverty school across America and see something like this.” Pollio said the $20 million influx in cash will help address growing inequity in supplemental funding – cash that schools receive through parent-teacher associations, athletic events, booster clubs and alumni associations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Roads: Authorities are looking for a stolen sign marking a centuries-old tree that inspired author Ernest Gaines. The Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office said the historical marker identifying the “Miss Jane Pittman Oak” was stolen recently, and the parish government is offering a $500 reward for information leading to its recovery or the thief’s arrest, news outlets report. The tree itself, believed to be about 400 years old, served as partial inspiration for “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” which gained widespread notice for the internationally acclaimed, award-winning author. The book describes a first-person narrative of a fictional 110-year-old woman born into slavery. Historians have said Gaines regularly walked past the oak tree, which sits along Louisiana Highway 16 in Lakeland, a village in the parish, on his way to the grocery store. In 2008, state officials considered cutting down the oak because its low-hanging branches posed a potential threat to passing cars. But the state ultimately relented amid pushback from Gaines and other activists, opting instead to trim the branches. Tips leading to an arrest or recovery of the marker should be directed to the sheriff’s office at 225-694-3737. Gaines, who died in 2019 at age 86, will be depicted on a stamp next year, the U.S. Postal Service announced last week.\n\nMaine\n\nHallowell: The Maine Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a pair of energy projects that would generate enough wind power for up to 900,000 homes along with construction of a new transmission corridor to get the electricity to the regional power grid. The PUC was required by law to choose the projects to boost transmission capacity and renewable energy in Aroostook County. It chose LS Power Base for a 345-kilovolt transmission project and Longroad Energy’s King Pine for a wind generation project, but it didn’t rule on how how much of the cost would be borne by Maine ratepayers. Together, the net cost of the projects is $1.8 billion over a 30-year period, but they would benefit the state, officials said. An influx of energy into the regional grid would “place downward pressure on electricity prices, benefitting consumers in Maine and throughout New England,” said PUC Chair Philip L. Bartlett II. It’s a similar to the proposed 145-mile transmission line that would be a conduit for 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid, but it would serve a different purpose. State voters rebuked the New England Clean Energy Connect last November, and work was halted pending the outcome of a lawsuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Two legislators have called for an independent review of the state Department of Natural Resources’ handling of repeated complaints against the former manager at Gunpowder Falls State Park. A Baltimore County grand jury indicted former longtime manager Michael Browning last Monday on charges that include rape and assault. The Baltimore Sun reports that state Sen. Sarah Elfreth and Del. Eric Luedtke called for the review in a letter to Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, Maryland’s secretary of natural resources. “The behavior and lack of accountability described is inexcusable and requires prompt action by the Department to address the issues raised and ensure that a similar situation never happens again,” the letter says. Baltimore County Police arrested Browning, 71, in September and charged him with sexually assaulting a former park employee. According to charging documents, the woman told police she met Browning as a teenager while attending a youth club his wife ran before working with Browning at the park. Police wrote in charging documents that the two had a yearslong consensual relationship. The woman told police that she tried to end the relationship and that Browning raped her 10 to 15 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Police and school officials are trying to figure out how a 7-year-old child managed to bring a loaded gun to school. Police responded to UP Academy Holland in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood about 3:30 p.m. Thursday for a report of a student with a firearm, police said in a statement on the department’s website. Responding officers confiscated the weapon. No injuries were reported. “I’m speechless. I don’t have the words. This is truly devastating,” Boston Public Schools Superintendent Mary Skipper said in a statement. “We have to ask ourselves how a very young student becomes in possession of and gains access to a firearm.” Mayor Michelle Wu pledged to hold the person who allowed the child access to the gun accountable. “No child should be near a weapon, much less directly endangered at such a young age,” she said. No additional information was released. “The Boston Police Department is focused on the proliferation of guns in our city and keeping access to them away from the youngest among us needs to be a priority for everyone,” Police Commissioner Michael Cox said. The school has about 770 students from kindergarten through fifth grade, according to its website. Police are still investigating.\n\nMichigan\n\nWyandotte:There’s nothing sweet about bringing home a cockroach, so trick-or-treating is off limits in a suburban Detroit neighborhood. Officials in Wyandotte said a cockroach infestation has been confirmed at a vacant home after a tip from a trash hauler. The pests have been moving to other homes. Sidewalks will be closed Monday night on a portion of 20th Street. City engineer Greg Mayhew said a Halloween ban will prevent “further roach migration.” Officials don’t want the bugs hitching a ride on costumes. The city is trying to exterminate the roaches, but “it will take some time,” Mayhew said. Walking the street could help kill the cockroaches, but their eggs still could spread and survive, City Council member Todd Hanna said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Election officials held a public demonstration of voting machines Friday as part of an effort to maintain public trust and transparency in election systems that have drawn coordinated attacks from ex-President Donald Trump and others. Minneapolis Director of Elections and Voter Services Katie Smith showed election judges from around the city how to test the voting equipment: Turn on the tabulator machine, feed the pre-marked set of test ballots into the machine, print off the results, and make sure the results exactly match the ballots. More than two dozen people tested the tabulator machines and assistive voting devices – which help voters zoom in, print and read their ballots with Braille, if needed – at the demonstration at the city’s election and voter services building. Smith said the public accuracy test, which is required under state law, is important because it lets members of the public see their votes are going to be correctly and accurately counted on election night. Around the country, some voters have expressed skepticism about election systems since Trump and others have falsely claimed that widespread voter fraud led to President Joe Biden being elected. After nearly two years, no evidence has shown that voting machines were manipulated to steal the 2020 election or that there was any widespread fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nMound Bayou: The tiny, all-Black town of Mound Bayou became a safe haven for Emmett Till’s mother as she traveled to Mississippi to testify in the murder trial of two white men who lynched her son in 1955. Hundreds of people – a good portion of Mound Bayou’s 1,500 residents – turned out Thursday evening to watch the movie “Till.” The feature film went into wide release across the U.S. over the weekend after being in limited release since Oct. 14. “This place, this city, is very sacred to the story of Emmett Till,” one of the filmmakers, Keith Beauchamp, told the mostly Black audience in the gymnasium/auditorium of Mound Bayou’s John F. Kennedy High School. The screening happened days after a bronze statue of Till was unveiled about 50 miles away in Greenwood. Beauchamp is one of the producers and writers of “Till,” which largely focuses on Mamie Till-Mobley’s reaction to the loss of her only child and her evolution into a civil rights leader. Mound Bayou was founded by formerly enslaved people in the cotton-growing Mississippi Delta in 1887 as a freestanding community where Black people could thrive amid the hostility of the Jim Crow era.\n\nMissouri\n\nFlorissant: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed testing inside a school closed amid concerns of radioactive contamination, and sampling of soil outside the school has begun, Corps officials said Friday. A suburban St. Louis school board voted last week to close Jana Elementary School in Florissant after testing by a private firm found levels of radioactive isotope lead-210 that were 22 times the expected level on the kindergarten playground. It also found high levels of polonium, radium and other material inside the school, which sits along Coldwater Creek, contaminated decades ago with Manhattan Project atomic waste. The Corps said in a news release that radiation detection instruments were used to scan surfaces inside the school. Sampling of soil outside the school is expected to go on for another two weeks, the Corps said. The agency plans to sample at least 45 spots, with depths ranging from 15 to 28 feet below the surface. Preliminary test results are expected in November. The approximate 400 students at Jana Elementary are taking virtual classes for the next month, then will be reassigned to other schools. Coldwater Creek was contaminated in the 1940s and 1950s when waste from atomic bomb material manufactured in St. Louis got into the waterway near Lambert Airport, where the waste was stored. The result was an environmental nightmare that resulted in a Superfund declaration in 1989.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two conservation groups have filed a lawsuit against the state and its wildlife management agency, alleging it illegally set hunting and trapping policies and quotas intended to reduce the gray wolf population by making it easier to kill the predators. WildEarth Guardians and Project Coyote filed the lawsuit Thursday in District Court in Helena asking for the new laws and resulting increased quotas to be overturned. Montana’s Republican-controlled Legislature in 2021 passed bills that allowed the state to reduce the wolf population, authorize additional hunting methods, allow extended hunting seasons, allow an individual to kill up to 20 wolves, and allow private parties to offer bounties for hunting or trapping wolves. The conservation groups allege management decisions are being made based on a wolf plan that was created in 2002 and was amended to use a new wolf population model without following state rulemaking procedures and without public participation. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks does not comment on pending litigation, spokesperson Greg Lemon said Friday. Montana officials authorized the killing of 450 wolves during the winter of 2021-22 but ended up shutting down hunting near Yellowstone National Park after 23 wolves from the park were killed, all but five in Montana.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Dueling lawsuits have been dropped by a former candidate for governor and a fellow Republican state lawmaker who accused him of groping her at a political function several years ago. Charles W. Herbster, who lost his bid in May to become the GOP nominee for governor despite an early endorsement from ex-President Donald Trump, sued state Sen. Julie Slama for defamation after she told the Nebraska Examiner that, in 2019, Herbster reached under her skirt and groped her at the Douglas County Republican Party event when she was 22. Slama was one of eight women who accused Herbster of unwanted groping, but Slama was the only one to go on the record with her name. Herbster denied the allegations and painted them as a politically motivated attack. Slama quickly countersued, accusing Herbster of sexual battery. The competing lawsuits had largely stalled in the months since being filed, with both sides seeking delays. Online court records show that both sides on Wednesday submitted motions to dismiss their lawsuits with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled. On Thursday, the judge granted the motion. Neither the motion nor the judge’s order addressed why the parties sought to dismiss their respective lawsuits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A rural county roiled by voting machine conspiracy theories stopped its unprecedented effort Friday to hand-count ballots cast in advance of Election Day. But Nye County officials vowed to reshape their plan and seek another go-ahead from the Nevada Supreme Court, after justices ruled late Thursday that counting methods used last week violated rules they set to prevent the county from allowing early disclosure of election results. “Yesterday’s Supreme Court order requires us to make some changes to our hand count process,” Nye County officials said in a statement issued Friday that promised to “resume as soon as our plan is in compliance with the court’s order and approved by the secretary of state.” Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada said they stood ready to challenge any effort to restart the hand tallies this week and don’t believe there’s any hand-counting scenario that would pass legal muster. The civil rights advocacy group accused Nye County officials of failing to prevent public release of early results before polls close to in-person voting Nov. 8. It argued that reading candidates’ names aloud from ballots within hearing distance of public observers violated the court rule.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Democratic U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster and Republican challenger Robert Burns frequently took jabs and interrupted one another over COVID-19 funding, drug addiction treatment and abortion rights during their first debate Friday for New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District seat. Burns said many companies are suffering now because of reckless government spending. “My opponent here talks about the need for the federal government to help build businesses ... I built my business without the help of the federal government,” said Burns, who runs a quality control and pharmaceutical safety company in Bedford. “That’s not true when you consider the Paycheck Protection loan that you took,” Kuster said. Burns responded: “That was 10 years later.” Kuster expressed her support for suboxone medication to treat opioid addiction, saying it is helping her own brother. Burns said statistics have shown that isn’t true and accused her campaign of being funded by its manufacturers. Burns, who says he is pro-life and supported the overturn of Roe v. Wade, was asked to clarify his proposal to form “panels” that would require a second and third opinion when a woman, in his words, is “being forced to have an abortion.” Burns said “probably misspoke a little bit” in his use of the word “panel” and said he was referring to the mental health of the mother.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Borough: A “significant” piece of historic artwork depicting George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth may be sold by the Monmouth County Historical Association for millions of dollars, drawing opposition from historians who claim the MCHA museum would lose a valuable piece of history. Titled “Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth,” the painting by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze, a legendary German artist, dates to 1857. It recreates Washington’s involvement in the historic battle that occurred in June 1778. “I think it would be pathetically tragic to sell one of the key pieces of the association’s major collection,” said Joe Hammond, a former curator of the MCHA museum and one-time director of the association. “It is a regional collection of national significance, and the painting of Washington rallying the troops at Monmouth is one of the most significant.” But with a price tag that could reach tens of millions of dollars, MCHA officials contend it is worth investigating a potential sale. The new interest is likely the result of a recent multimillion-dollar sale of another Washington painting by Leutze. His famed “Washington Crossing the Delaware” piece fetched more than $45 million in May, according to Christie’s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The FBI confirmed Friday that it is investigating a report from a Santa Fe-based environmental advocacy group that it received mail containing antisemitic imagery and a suspicious powdery substance inside. FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said in an email that the substance was tested and determined not to be harmful. Further details were not being released in order to protect the integrity the investigation, he said. Conservation Voters New Mexico Executive Director Demis Foster said the group received an envelope Wednesday in the mail that included a brown, powdery substance inside along with a torn-up political flier that the group distributed in support of a Democratic state House representative who is running for reelection. The mail included a reference to the Nazi Party, a swastika and other antisemitic symbols, Foster said. She said first responders including police evacuated the building, and an employee who opened the mail was released unharmed from a hospital after undergoing observation. Foster said she and her employees are working remotely as a precaution, while continuing their advocacy for environmental causes and endorsed political candidates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, who fought poverty and racism and skillfully navigated New York’s power structure as pastor of Harlem’s historic Abyssinian Baptist Church, died Friday at age 73, the church announced. “The Butts Family and entire Abyssinian Baptist Church membership solicit your prayers for us in our bereavement,” the church said on its website. No cause of death was given. Butts began serving as a youth minister at Abyssinian in 1972 and was senior pastor there for more than 30 years. He also served as president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury, on Long Island, from 1999 to 2020. His post at Abyssinian gave Butts one of the most prominent pulpits in the U.S. The church traces its roots to 1808 when a group of Black worshippers who refused to accept segregation at the First Baptist Church of New York City left to form their own congregation. The church’s current home on 138th Street in Harlem is a massive Tudor and Gothic revival structure dedicated in 1923 and designated a city landmark in 1993. Earlier pastors at Abyssinian included Adam Clayton Powell Sr. and his son Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The two North Carolina Supreme Court seats up for election in November have taken on extra significance as the outcome could flip the court’s partisan makeup during a period of political polarization. Registered Democrats hold a 4-3 advantage on the court, but Republicans would retake the majority for the first time since 2016 should they win at least one race. The seats carry eight-year terms, so barring unplanned retirements, Republicans would be assured of keeping the upper hand for at least 41/ 2 years if successful. Outside groups are spending big to influence the races. In the two largest television markets alone, two super PACs have committed spending roughly $3 million on ads, according to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. In keeping with nonjudicial elections this year, ads have focused on crime and abortion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state auditor said Thursday that an examination of North Dakota’s electoral systems conducted in response to voter concerns found that they are “incredibly secure.” Auditor Josh Gallion said he undertook the review in response to concerns nationally that false claims of election fraud and conspiracies are threats to democracy. “We looked at any potential weaknesses in the election system of our state that could be exploited by someone with nefarious intent,” Gallion said. “The determination after extensive review from our contractor was that our election systems are incredibly secure across our state.” The review found six vulnerabilities to the state’s election system but all were labeled “low risk,” Gallion said. The report identified the vulnerabilities as the the ability for a voter to cast multiple ballots, identity theft of deceased voters, stuffing or discarding valid absentee ballots, equipment tampering, and absentee ballot fraud. Gallion said his office received many inquiries from residents and others about North Dakota’s election security following the 2020 election, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud. One inquiry came from MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who has echoed lies that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The first major retrospective of artist Maurice Sendak’s work since his 2012 death – and the largest and most complete to date – opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. Most people today know Sendak as the creator of children’s book classics such as “Where the Wild Things Are” and “In the Night Kitchen.” A new exhibition of his work looks at that reputation and a less well-known side of his immense output: his work as a designer for opera, theater, film, and television. “We wanted people to understand that Maurice was actually a serious artist,” said Lynn Caponera, executive director of the Maurice Sendak Foundation in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Though most knew him as an illustrator and picture book artist, “they didn’t see beyond the fact that he did a lot more than that,” she said. “Wild Things are Happening” opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. It’s the first major retrospective of Sendak’s work since his 2012 death and the largest and most complete to date. The exhibit takes its name from a 1990s advertising campaign Sendak did for Bell Atlantic that featured Wild Things characters promoting “a fast, dependable Internet service.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nBroken Arrow: The deaths of eight family members – including six children found in a burning Oklahoma home – are being investigated as a murder-suicide, authorities said Friday. Police are trying to determine whether both adults were involved in the killings. The children, who ranged in age from 1 to 13, were the victims, Broken Arrow Police Chief Brandon Berryhill said during a news conference. He did not provide their identities, ages or explain their relationships to one another except to say they were family members believed to be living in the home. Police said both adults who live in the home were considered “primary suspects” because they were found dead in the front of the home while the children were all found in a bedroom, where the fire was contained. A police spokesman declined to say whether authorities believe the two adults were both responsible for the killings or whether it could be just one of them. “It’s because investigators are still trying to piece together what happened with eight people dead,” police spokesman Ethan Hutchins said in an email to the Associated Press. Hutchins also said police would not be able to identify the dead adults until the medical examiner’s office has completed its work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials in the Trump administration compiled extensive intelligence dossiers on people who were arrested, even for minor offenses, during Black Lives Matter protests in Oregon. Initial drafts of the dossiers even included friends of the subjects as well as their interests, but those were later removed and replaced with a note that they would be made available upon request, according to an internal review by the Department of Homeland Security. The dossiers, known by agents as baseball cards, were previously normally compiled on non-U.S. citizens or only on Americans with “a demonstrated terrorism nexus,” according to the 76-page report. It was previously released last year but contains new revelations based on extensive redactions that were removed by the Biden administration. Ben Wizner, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s free speech, privacy and technology project, said the report indicates leaders of the Department of Homeland Security wanted to inflate the risk caused by protesters in Portland. The city became an epicenter of sometimes violent demonstrations in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer. But many protesters, including women belonging to a “Wall of Moms” ad hoc group and military veterans, were peaceful.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Authorities say they have recovered a gun believed to have been thrown off a bridge by a suspect after a shooting that injured six people, one critically, outside a church where a funeral was being held. Pittsburgh Public Safety officials said a river rescue team working off the McKees Rocks Bridge on Sunday morning was able to locate a firearm matching the description of the firearm used in Friday’s shooting outside Destiny of Faith Church. Officials said the weapon found had a bullet in the chamber and had been reported stolen in Shaler Township. Nineteen-year-old Shawn Davis of McKees Rocks and a 16-year-old Pittsburgh youth are both charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons counts in the noontime gunfire Friday outside the church where a funeral was being held for a man killed in a shooting earlier this month. The service was being livestreamed, and the video showed several people screaming and ducking for cover. It wasn’t clear if any shots went into the church. One person was taken to a hospital in critical condition while four other shooting victims were listed as stable. A sixth person injured trying to escape was also treated.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Backed by Brown University, Vartan Gregorian Elementary School has opened a hands-on, interactive classroom meant to help students explore science, technology, engineering, art and math in a fresh new space. Three groups of fourth and fifth graders were assigned a challenge Friday to figure out a way to raise a tiny flag using three machines and six chain reactions – without electricity. After a couple of false starts, fifth grader Noelle Ingle’s team propelled a tiny ball down a ramp, which struck a series of matchbox cars, which raised a card-size version of the Brown University flag. The room erupted in cheers. The Rube Goldberg machine was the first experiment in Gregorian’s new STEAM lab. Brown University spent approximately $200,000 renovating the dingy third grade classroom, installing new windows, floors and a sink and buying new furniture, including ricochet stools that allow students to wiggle while seated. The university also purchased whiteboards, a smart television and a microscope with up to 1,200x magnification. The shelves are already filled with robot and model car kits, magnetic play tiles and Legos. Brown has had a decades­long partnership with the elementary school, named after Vartan Gregorian, Brown’s larger-than-life president, who served from 1989 to 1997 and died April 15.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials are scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution that would restrict children from accessing public library books and electronic materials that are “promoting sexuality.” Local news outlets report the proposed Greenville County Council measure would direct trustees of the Greenville County Library System to order books and electronic materials removed from the county’s 12 libraries. The resolution also orders the library trustees to report “how such books ever found their way into the children’s sections of our public libraries” and to say how they will prevent them returning. As is true nationwide, controversies over materials dealing with LGBTQ and racial themes have been roiling South Carolina schools and public libraries for a year, particularly in the heavily Republican Upstate region. A large number of opponents spoke against restricting books during a Greenville County Council meeting in September, saying it targets books with LGBTQ themes. “These materials are not innately sexualized, they are not innately about sex, they are just about who we are and those should continue to exist,” Tyler Prescott of the Upstate LGBTQ+ Chamber of Commerce told councilors then. Republican Councilor Joe Dill, who is sponsoring the resolution, said in September that the county needs to also consider other people who are offended.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two critically endangered red wolves have arrived at the Great Plains Zoo from facilities in Texas and Washington. There are fewer than two dozen red wolves living in the wild, the zoo said in a press release, making them the most endangered canid species in the world. The wolves’ placement at zoo is part of a species survival plan, which aims to breed pairs with the greatest possible genetic diversity. “With only around 20 individuals remaining in the wild, the survival of the red wolf species is contingent the concerted help of accredited zoos and conservation partners with species survival breeding and reintroduction plans,” CEO Becky Dewitz said in a statement. “Weare grateful and dedicated to helping save the red wolf from extinction.” The male and female wolves are still getting used to each other and their new habitat, so the path by their enclosure will be blocked for ZooBoo, which takes place this Friday through Sunday. The zoo asks patrons respect the barricades as the wolves adjust.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Historical Commission is taking applications for awards to honor people or groups that work to study and preserve the state’s heritage. The commission said Thursday that its Certificates of Merit are presented each May, during National Preservation Month. The deadline for submissions is Dec. 31. Patrick McIntyre, State Historic Preservation Officer and executive director of the commission, said the awards program “highlights people and organizations for the work they do in the areas of publication, commemoration, and education regarding our state’s unique history and heritage.” “For 47 years our awards program has offered an opportunity to give thanks and recognition to those working to champion and revitalize Tennessee’s historic places,” McIntyre said. Applications can be found on the commission’s website.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state police chief said Thursday that his department “did not fail” Uvalde during the hesitant law enforcement response to the Robb Elementary School shooting, as a Republican congressman joined angry parents of some of the 19 children killed in the May attack in calling for him to resign. Col. Steve McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, acknowledged mistakes by officers while several Uvalde families confronted him in Austin over multiple outrages: why police waited more than 70 minutes before entering the fourth-grade classroom and killing the gunman, false and shifting accounts given by authorities, and records that remain withheld more than five months later. But McCraw defended his agency, and during a meeting of the state’s Public Safety Commission, made the case that failures uncovered to date did not warrant his removal while saying he was not shirking from accountability. Uvalde families bristled and asked how DPS could not have failed, given that troopers were among the first on the scene. “I can tell you this right now, DPS as an institution, right now, did not fail the community,” McCraw said. “Plain and simple.” Significantly, Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales said for the first time after the meeting that McCraw should also lose his job, becoming the first major figure in the GOP to call for a change at the top of Texas’ state police force.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Jordan: U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens and Democratic challenger Darlene McDonald agreed on none of the issues addressed Friday in their only debate before the midterm elections, with each largely echoing their party’s talking points on inflation, abortion and infrastructure spending. In an untelevised debate in the basement of a suburban real estate office with an audience of only campaign staff and half a dozen reporters, the Utah Republican blamed Democrats and President Joe Biden for fentanyl being imported across the U.S.-Mexico border, racial division and inflation. Owens accused Democrats of pushing critical race theory – an academic framework that connects the country’s history, including the legacy of slavery, to contemporary racism – and said that it’s destroying the country’s social fabric. “One thing that the Biden administration has accomplished is that they’ve given us a common purpose again,” Owens, one of two Black Republicans in the U.S. House, added. “We now share in what’s called misery, as a people.” McDonald, who is also Black, countered that Owens was spreading falsehoods to drum up fear – about both the nature of protests against police brutality and the idea that critical race theory was being taught in K-12 schools.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A man charged with the 1989 stabbing deaths of his in-laws in the town of Danby after modern DNA techniques linked him to the crime pleaded not guilty Friday during a court hearing. The arraignment of Michael Louise in Vermont Superior Court in Rutland came two days after he was returned to Vermont from New York to answer charges in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73. He had been scheduled for arraignment Thursday but the hearing was delayed 24 hours. Louise entered the pleas and then was ordered held without bail, said Vermont State Police spokesperson Adam Silverman, who monitored the hearing remotely. Louise, 79, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later after the couple was found dead in their Danby home in September 1989. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, but there was not enough to charge him, police said in an affidavit filed in the case. Louise told conflicting stories about whether he had traveled to Vermont from his home in Liverpool, New York, on Sept. 13, 1989, the day the Peacocks were believed to have been killed. Their bodies were discovered Sept. 17 after neighbors went to check on the couple.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The U.S. Coast Guard, a crew of scientists and others launched an air and sea mission to rescue 13 people, including a child, from a fishing vessel just moments before it sank in darkness early Friday in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia, authorities said. The 115-foot Tremont fishing vessel collided with the 1000-foot Panamanian-flagged container vessel MSC Rita, about 60 miles from shore, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Tremont sent out a mayday call that it was taking on water and sinking with 13 people aboard that was received by watchstanders with Coast Guard Sector Virginia, officials said. That call was also heard by Atlantis, a 274-foot ship operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Massachusetts, at about 1:45 a.m., WHOI said in an email to The Associated Press. The captain of the Atlantis contacted the Coast Guard and motored 8 miles west to the fishing vessel. The Coast Guard launched an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew and an HC-130 Hercules airplane crew from its air station in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the Coast Guard said. It also dispatched a motor lifeboat crew from its station in Chincoteague, on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, and diverted the Coast Guard Cutter Rollin Fritch to assist.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: The city’s dress code ordinance saying bikini baristas must cover their bodies at work has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court. The decision in a partial summary judgment last week came after a lengthy legal battle between bikini baristas and the city of Everett over the rights of workers to wear what they want, the Everett Herald reports. Everett is about 30 miles north of Seattle. U.S. District Court in Seattle found Everett’s dress code ordinance violated the Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. and Washington state constitutions. The Court found that the ordinance was, at least in part, shaped by a gender-based discriminatory purpose, according to a 19-page ruling signed by U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez. It is difficult to imagine, the court wrote, how the ordinance would be equally applied to men and women in practice because it prohibits clothing “typically worn by women rather than men,” including midriff and scoop-back shirts, as well as bikinis. Bikini baristas were “clearly” a target of the ordinance, the court also ruled, adding that the profession is comprised of a workforce that is almost entirely women.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Local chefs and surgeons put their carving skills to the test for the Huntington Children’s Museum Pumpkin Carving Contest at The Market’s outdoor patio in downtown Huntington. Jessica McCormick, of Huntington, brought her two children, 10-year-old Iris and 4-year-old Oscar, to the event on Tuesday, which also featured the Marshall Nutrition Program, a dance floor with a fog machine, and other contests and events for kids. “They loved this event last year, and they love checking out the carved pumpkins, too,” said McCormick, who is the vice president of the museum’s board of directors. “We have been waiting for a children’s museum in Huntington since Iris was a baby. I hope everyone will get involved and donate to such a great cause.” Drew Hetzer, of Backyard Pizza and Raw Bar and The Peddler, was one of the local dining legends competing in the contest that also included Jonathan Patterson of Le Bistro and Jordan Hagy of La Famiglia. “I’m sticking with a pizza theme, but with a Halloween twist on it,” Hetzer said. Participating surgeons included doctors Ashleigh Clickett, Courtney Crain, Michael Gentile, Farzad Amiri and Ben Moosavi. “I will attempt carving a breastfeeding mother with a baby,” said Clickett, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist at Valley Health. “Cutting a pumpkin is a lot different than human skin, so it will be much different. I just want to have fun with it and help a great cause at the same time.” Votes for the best pumpkin can be made with donations to Huntington Children’s Museum online at givebutter.com/hcmpumpkin.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court is refusing to block a lower court’s ruling prohibiting voters who already submitted an absentee ballot from voiding it and voting again, a rarely used practice known as ballot spoiling. The 2nd District Court of Appeals decided Thursday against hearing an appeal of a Waukesha County circuit court judge’s ruling this month in favor of a conservative group founded by prominent Republicans. That ruling required the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to rescind its guidance that allowed the spoiling of ballots that had already been cast. Voters who obtained an absentee ballot, but have not yet voted and want to obtain a new one, can still do that. The elections commission held an emergency meeting Friday, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, and unanimously voted to rescind the guidance issued in August detailing how an already cast ballot could be spoiled. Very few voters have actually spoiled their absentee ballots after voting in recent elections, data provided by the elections commission to the Associated Press shows. In the August primary, just 3,519 people cast a new ballot after spoiling their original one, less than 0.3% of all votes cast, the data shows.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Three wolves shot and killed in the state are drawing attention across the border. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials believe the animals may have belonged to their state’s closely watched North Park wolf pack. The North Park pack, which often crosses into Wyoming where hunting wolves is legal, gained notoriety last year after birthing Colorado’s first known litter of pups in 80 years. Travis Duncan, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, said in an email that the agency cannot yet confirm whether the slain wolves were in the North Park pack but will continue to monitor the animals “if and when they are next seen in the area.” Duncan added that at least two wolves were seen Friday in northern Colorado. In Colorado, killing a wolf can bring a $100,000 fine and up to a year in prison. But once all four paws are across the border into Wyoming, wolves are in the state’s “predator zone” where anyone can legally hunt the animals without a license. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The difference in state laws could impede Colorado’s planned reintroduction of wolves that was narrowly approved by voters in a controversial 2019 ballot initiative. The introduction is planned for 2023 on the sparsely populated Western Slope.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/china/china-covid-restrictions-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China eases some of its Covid restrictions, in significant step toward ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChina announced sweeping changes to its national pandemic response on Wednesday, the clearest and most significant sign yet that the central government is moving away from its strict zero-Covid approach that prompted protests across the country.\n\nIn a statement reported by state broadcaster CCTV, China’s State Council unveiled 10 new guidelines that loosen some restrictions – most notably, allowing home quarantine and largely scrapping the health QR code that has been mandatory for entering most public places.\n\nLocal governments had already taken steps this week that indicated a possible change in direction – including some major cities loosening requirements on Covid testing.\n\nBut this is the first official change in Covid policy on a national level – a notable turnaround by Beijing, which for the past three years has insisted that unwavering restrictions are the only effective way to stamp out the highly transmissible virus.\n\nHere are some of the biggest changes.\n\nQR codes scrapped\n\nPeople shopping at a supermarket in Urumqi, China, on December 5. CNS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince early in the pandemic, China has used health codes on mobile phones to track individuals’ health statuses. The color of these codes – in red, amber or green – decides whether users can leave their homes, use public transport and enter public places, or potentially need to quarantine.\n\nUnder the guidelines released Wednesday, people will be able to enter most places without showing a negative test result or their health code – a significant step after nearly three years of disruption to people’s daily routines and livelihoods.\n\nOnly a few exceptions will still require these checks, including nursing homes, medical institutions and secondary schools. Businesses can now determine their own prevention and control policies, the report added.\n\nHome quarantine allowed\n\nIn another massive change, asymptomatic Covid patients or those with mild symptoms will be allowed to quarantine at home instead of being taken to a government facility, unless they choose otherwise.\n\nPatients whose condition deteriorates will be transferred to hospital for treatment, the report said. Close contacts can also quarantine at home.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Chinese residents have described the chaos and stress of going into quarantine camps, many saying it was unclear when they would be allowed to leave, and others complaining of crowded or poor conditions.\n\nIn several cases, health workers reportedly killed the pets of those taken to government quarantine, citing health risks – triggering outrage on Chinese social media each time. Others criticized the policy after reports earlier this year of elderly residents being forced out of their homes in the middle of the night for transport to quarantine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Man dragged out of home after allegedly refusing to go to quarantine facility 00:59 - Source: CNN\n\nLimits on lockdown\n\nThe new guidelines also urge authorities to “ensure the normal functioning of society and basic medical services,” saying areas that aren’t designated high-risk should not restrict people’s movements or close businesses.\n\nLockdowns are only allowed in “high-risk areas,” and even then, should be “promptly” lifted if no new cases are found for five consecutive days, it said. It added that authorities are forbidden from blocking fire escapes, apartment or building entrances, and other gates, so residents can still evacuate and seek medical attention if needed.\n\nThis particular guideline comes at a particularly sensitive time, with China still reeling from a wave of rare public protest in late November and early December, that had been triggered by a deadly fire in the far western Xinjiang region. Public fury had swept the nation after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nDuring the protests, thousands across the country took to the streets to call for an end to lockdowns and other zero-Covid measures – with some voicing broader grievances against censorship and the ruling Communist Party’s authoritarian leadership.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Chilling': Protester tells CNN what the atmosphere is like in China 03:57 - Source: CNN\n\nVaccination plan\n\nThe State Council on Wednesday also emphasized the need to accelerate Covid vaccination among the elderly, saying all locations should be “administrating as many vaccinations as possible.”\n\nWhile the Omicron variant is milder than previous strains and China’s overall vaccination rate is high, experts say even a small number of severe cases among vulnerable and under-vaccinated groups like the elderly could overwhelm hospitals if infections spike across the country of 1.4 billion.\n\nMore than 86% of China’s population over 60 are fully vaccinated, according to China’s National Health Commission. That leaves around 25 million who have not received any shot, according to a comparison of official population figures and November 28 vaccination data. But booster rates are lower, with more than 45 million of the fully vaccinated elderly yet to receive an additional shot.\n\nFor the most at-risk over 80 age group, around two-thirds were fully vaccinated, but only 40% had received booster shots as of November 11, according to state media.\n\nDomestic travel\n\nThe rules also make domestic travel within China easier, with cross-regional travelers no longer needing to provide a negative test result or their health code – or test upon arrival.\n\nThese former requirements, as well as other travel restrictions such as provincial border closures and provincial train and bus suspensions, have made domestic travel difficult over the last few years.\n\nFor the many in China who left their hometowns to find work in other cities and provinces, that meant being separated from family for long stretches – or being stranded far from home without an income during snap lockdowns.\n\nResidents line up for Covid tests in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China on December 1. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nIn recent days, some social media users have pointed out that Lunar New Year is just a month away – the country’s biggest annual holiday, a time when people typically travel home to gather with family, akin to the American Thanksgiving.\n\nFor some, the prospect of mass nationwide travel has raised concern of the virus spreading once more. Others, long fatigued with the toll of zero-Covid, greeted the news with relief.\n\n“I haven’t been home for Chinese New Year for two years now, I’m crying,” one person said on Weibo. Another wrote: “It’s been a long time. Welcome home.”\n\nMedicine, schools, and monitoring\n\nA few other guidelines are also likely to ease the transition away from zero-Covid toward a less disruptive model.\n\nFor instance, schools without Covid outbreaks are now asked to carry out “normal offline teaching activities,” and to reopen on-campus facilities such as cafeterias, libraries and sports venues. Schools with Covid cases can continue “normal teaching and living,” as long as they designate certain “risk areas” with control measures.\n\nThe guidelines also emphasize the need to make medicine widely accessible, dropping restrictions that previously made it difficult to buy cold and fever medication in pharmacies. Since early in the pandemic, China has required a prescription and negative Covid test to buy these.\n\nPerhaps reflecting public concern that the relaxation in rules could cause a surge in cases, residents have rushed to drug stores, with reports last week that cold and fever medicines were flying off shelves.\n\nThe State Council also urged doctors and local medical institutions to continue closely monitoring the health situation of key populations, including the risks posed to elderly or immunocompromised residents.\n\nSome experts have warned that a broader reopening inevitably brings health risks, especially to those vulnerable groups.\n\n“The key risk when countries decide to move away from a zero-Covid policy is really the strain this will exert on the health care system,” said Ruklanthi de Alwis, deputy director for the Centre for Outbreak Preparedness at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/22/sequoia-toll-daffodil-project-ferret-release-news-around-states/49419721/", "title": "Sequoia toll, Daffodil Project, ferret release: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A television station has donated thousands of items including historic footage from the civil rights era to the Alabama Department of Archives and History, which will make the material available to the public. WSFA-TV in Montgomery announced it had given the agency materials dating to the 1950s, including footage from news conferences by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., coverage of the Freedom Riders in 1961 and original film from the “Stand in the School House Door” by then-Gov. George C. Wallace in 1963. The video also includes scenes from a visit to the NASA center in Huntsville by the President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson in 1962 and special reports on the death of former University of Alabama football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant in 1983. As the TV station was planning to switch locations, managers determined it wasn’t practical to move the large numbers of delicate film reels and boxes full of video and other items. Steve Murray, the state archives director, said archivists had long suspected the WSFA studios held valuable content for historical preservation, and his department jumped at the opportunity to add to its collection when a phone call came in late 2019.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Members of the Biden administration have launched a series of events aimed at exploring the Arctic’s potential to act as a “living laboratory of clean energy innovation.” Officials participating in the online event, billed as “ArcticX,” spoke of the challenges faced by remote communities in Alaska’s Arctic region, such as high energy costs and impacts from climate change. During the event’s broad discussions, they said they see opportunities for sustainable or renewable energy systems. Wednesday’s meeting was the first of four planned online events, with an in-person gathering set for May in Alaska. Among the speakers was U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Offices that fall under the department co-hosted the event. “We hope to combine the world-class expertise of our national labs, of our 17 national labs, with the know-how that Arctic communities have developed over centuries of innovation in the far north so together we can get new technologies out of the lab and into the field and onto the market and support communities in taking control of their own clean energy future,” Granholm said. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable sources accounted for about 30% of Alaska’s electricity generation in 2019. Many rural communities rely largely on diesel electric generators for power.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Motor Vehicle Division failed to notify more than 34,000 drivers that their licenses had been suspended, revoked or canceled and also lagged for months in alerting prosecutors. The MVD notified county attorney’s offices around the state of the problem Wednesday, saying in an email that notices weren’t mailed “beginning in late 2020 and ending in March.” A glitch with the agency’s mailing process was the cause. “When MVD discovered this issue in February 2021, the first step was to understand what caused the problem, the extent of customers affected and how to resolve the problem,” MVD spokesman Doug Parcey said in an email. “Once those were known, the affected customers were immediately notified.” Some prosecutors learned about the issue from defense attorneys. Potentially thousands of drivers might have been arrested and prosecuted or paid hefty fines because they unknowingly drove with a suspended license. Prosecutors in Maricopa and Pinal counties have already flagged more than 1,000 cases. Municipal and justice courts will also have to review cases involving suspended licenses. “Our first priority is to look at convictions,” said Rachel Mitchell, acting division chief of the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office. “We are focusing on prison. … It is certainly scary for me as a prosecutor.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State lawmakers on Friday delayed a vote on whether to allow state-run health care facilities to require employees to get COVID-19 vaccines – a move officials say is needed to protect millions of dollars in federal funding. The Arkansas Legislative Council voted to delay considering the requests by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs for an exemption from a state law banning vaccine requirements by government entities. The law conflicts with a federal COVID-19 vaccine requirement for health care workers issued by President Joe Biden’s administration that’s set to take effect in January. A group of Republican-led states, including Arkansas, have asked a federal judge to block its enforcement. UAMS could lose $600 million in Medicare and Medicaid funding and another $100 million in federal contracts if it doesn’t comply with the federal rule, Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson told the panel. Patterson said the exemption was needed to ensure that the university’s workers are in compliance with the federal requirement and that funding isn’t threatened. The panel did not set a date for considering the exemptions. But legislative leaders said they hoped to meet before Dec. 5.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of giant sequoias this year, leading to a staggering two-year death toll that accounts for up to nearly a fifth of Earth’s largest trees, officials said Friday. Fires in Sequoia National Park and surrounding Sequoia National Forest tore through more than a third of groves in California and torched an estimated 2,261 to 3,637 sequoias, which are the largest trees by volume. Nearby wildfires last year killed an unprecedented 7,500 to 10,400 giant sequoias that are only native in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range. Losses now account for 13% to 19% of the 75,000 sequoias greater than 4 feet in diameter. Blazes so intense to burn hot enough and high enough to kill so many giant sequoias – trees once considered nearly fireproof – put an exclamation point on climate change’s impact. A warming planet that has created hotter droughts combined with a century of fire suppression that choked forests with thick undergrowth have fueled flames that have sounded the death knell for trees dating to ancient civilizations. “The sobering reality is that we have seen another huge loss within a finite population of these iconic trees that are irreplaceable in many lifetimes,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the parents of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after police stopped him on the street and put him in a neck hold two years ago, the city and family attorneys announced Friday. A federal magistrate judge accepted terms of the settlement after a mediation session, said Qusair Mohamedbhai, an attorney for McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain. Outside court, Sheneen McClain said she was glad to have the agreement finalized but noted the work of fighting for justice for her son just makes her miss him more. “The money is just the world’s way of saying, ‘We’re sorry,’ but it’s not going to help me heal the hole in my heart,” she said. The settlement amount was agreed to in July but not officially disclosed until now because of a dispute between McClain’s parents about how the wording of the agreement could affect their dispute over how the money should be divided. Sheneen McClain said Elijah’s father, LaWayne Mosley, was not involved in raising him. How the money will be divided will be addressed separately. In a statement, Mosley did not address the dispute but said he hoped the settlement would send a message to police. “I hope Elijah’s legacy is that police will think twice before killing another innocent person,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPlymouth: Officials believe nearly 40 drug overdoses across the state since July may be linked to marijuana laced with the powerful opioid fentanyl and are warning the public about the potential danger. State health officials said marijuana seized in Plymouth after an overdose in early October tested positive for fentanyl at the state crime lab. “This is the first lab confirmed case of marijuana with fentanyl in Connecticut and possibly the first confirmed case in the United States,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement Thursday. Officials had been investigating reports of people across Connecticut who overdosed and were revived with naloxone but denied using opioids. They told authorities they only smoked marijuana. There were 11 such overdoses in July, nine in August, nine in September and 10 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 26. No deaths were reported. Brian Foley, an aide to state public safety Commissioner James Rovella, said the state crime lab will now be testing all marijuana that police submit for fentanyl. An estimated 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in a recent one-year period – a never-before-seen milestone that health officials say is tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and a more dangerous drug supply.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In October, as the state allocated $78 million in federal money to health care facilities struggling with staffing shortages, hospitals received $25million total – only about one-third of what they requested. Health care workers, who have been fighting the coronavirus for nearly two years, have said they’re burned out and exhausted. Some chose to leave the hospital bedside or the profession entirely. Others declined financial incentives of several hundred dollars offered to fill shifts, citing mental health reasons. Many are jumping ship to other hospitals in Delaware or the Philadelphia area because health systems are providing hefty signing bonuses and significant increases in pay. Hospitals are also relying on travel nurses, who work in three-month shifts, to fill the gaps. Travel nurses can make twice as much or more what permanent hospital nurses take home in pay. ChristianaCare requested $40 million in federal aid, according to documents provided by the governor’s office. Instead, the state’s largest hospital and private employer received $12 million, the biggest sum any health system received. ChristianaCare, like others, continues to offer $10,000 signing bonuses for a number of open nursing positions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser’s decision to ease mask requirements in the nation’s capital has sparked a public debate about timing, with the majority of the D.C. Council pleading with her to reconsider. It’s a localized debate that reflects a broader national dynamic in the country’s coronavirus-mitigation stance, with some leaders and businesses pushing for more normalcy after the successful reopening of schools and others preaching caution against reckless pre-winter moves. Starting Monday, masks will no longer be required in many indoor spaces in D.C. They must still be worn in multiple settings, including schools, libraries, public transportation, ride-share vehicles, and group-living facilities like nursing homes, dorms and jails. Private businesses will still be able to require customers to wear masks. Bowser has cautiously hailed the step as a “shift in where we are with the pandemic,” saying the return of the mask mandate earlier this year helped blunt the late-summer surge of the delta variant. The nation’s capital originally lifted its indoor mask requirement for fully vaccinated individuals in May but reinstated it in late July as cases began to rise again. According to D.C. Health Department statistics, the current seven-day average of new cases is higher than it was in May but still well below the late-summer delta-variant peak.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed work on a $339 million Everglades restoration project aimed at cleansing water runoff before it flows into a troubled river. Corps and local officials held a ceremony Friday for the 12,000-acre project in Martin County known officially as the C-44 Reservoir and Stormwater Treatment Area. It’s a key part of a broader effort to restore the vast Florida Everglades. The reservoir will capture, store and clean fertilizer-laden runoff from farms and development before it is routed into the St. Lucie River and ultimately the Indian River Lagoon. Both have been plagued by harmful algae blooms and other long-term problems associated with water pollution that threatens wildlife and human health. “I think it’s huge” for the east coast, said Chauncey Goss, chair of the South Florida Water Management District. “Not only symbolically, but it’s also going to be taking water, cleaning it up and helping to get rid of some of these discharges, which is really the goal of all of this.” The project can store 19.7 billion gallons of water, according to state water managers. It will use plants such as cattails to suck up about 35 metric tons of phosphorus every year before the water makes its way into the St. Lucie River.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCumming: Leaders with Forsyth County Schools, Congregation Beth Israel and the OneForsyth Council have planted 500 daffodil bulbs outside the school district’s new Forsyth County Arts and Learning Center as part of the Daffodil Project, a worldwide initiative aiming to plant the flowers all over in honor of each of the 1.5 million children who died during the Holocaust. Thanks to the partnership, Forsyth County will now be home to 500 of those daffodils, which will bloom in the spring on Holocaust Remembrance Day. FCS Superintendent Dr. Jeff Bearden, Rabbi Levi Mentz with Congregation Beth Israel and OneForsyth Council Chair Kristin Cook all gave opening remarks at a Nov. 8 ceremony before county and school district leaders began planting each of the bulbs. Cook said she was proud to be there, speaking on behalf of OneForsyth, the Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce’s diversity initiative, and modeling their guiding principles of uniting, celebrating and promoting inclusion in the county. “Our hope is that, by continuing to support events like these, we will all grow to appreciate the unique identities that embody us all,” Cook said. Metz said he was overjoyed to see the project coming to Forsyth County, his involvement feeling personal to him and his family since his grandfather was a survivor of the Holocaust.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is considering additional protections for waters off the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. NOAA announced the proposal to designate oceanic areas of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which is already one of the largest protected natural areas in the world, as a national marine sanctuary on Friday. The agency opened the plan to public comment through January. The designation would build on existing protections meant to maintain marine habitats and wildlife. The new rules would apply only to oceanic areas, not the islands that are already part of the monument. “Papahānaumokuākea’s ecosystems are increasingly under pressure from threats such as marine debris, invasive species, and climate change,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state of Hawaii and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs currently co-manage the monument. Papahānaumokuākea is larger than all other U.S. national parks combined and is home to endangered Hawaiian monk seals, green sea turtles, seabirds and extensive coral reef ecosystems. The area is home to many species found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: If anyone has a good idea on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon, the U.S. government wants to hear about it. NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab on Friday put out a request for proposals for a fission surface power system. NASA is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to establish a sun-independent power source for missions to the moon by the end of the decade. “Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,” Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. If the effort is successful in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next objective would be Mars. NASA says fission surface power could provide sustained, abundant power no matter the environmental conditions on the moon or Mars. “I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,” Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement. The reactor would be built on Earth and then sent to the moon.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new store at the Illinois State Museum will feature products from the state, along with themed souvenirs, specialty foods and toys. The Shop opened to the public Saturday. Families were invited to attend an opening event in their flannel and fleece pajamas. The store is located in the first floor of the Illinois State Museum, which owns and operates the Shop to fund programs and research. Cinnamon Catlin-Legutko, the museum’s director, called the opening an important moment in the museum’s return to operations. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner’s administration shut down the museum in 2015 during an ongoing budget impasse. It reopened the following year but since then has seen closures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The museum was established in 1877 and has branch facilities in Lewistown and Lockport.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A renewed push for the state to join more than two-thirds of states with some form of legalized marijuana use appears to face the same roadblock from Statehouse Republicans who have opposed such a step for many years. Legislative Democrats and the state Democratic Party united last week in urging approval of marijuana legalization during the legislative session that starts in January, arguing that it could benefit those wanting to use it for medical purposes, create new jobs and become an additional state tax revenue source. The Republican-dominated Legislature has not taken any action on bills submitted over the past decade for allowing medical marijuana or removing criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug, even as recreational marijuana sales have won approval in Michigan and Illinois and as medical use is allowed in Ohio. Legalization advocates haven’t yet changed the minds of legislative leaders, who reject arguments that Indiana is losing money to neighboring states and point to pot still being illegal under federal law. “I think when you make the argument about having that substantial a public policy change just because you’re trying to chase dollars makes no sense to me, so I’m in the same place I’ve been,” Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: A city park will now be named Ioway Creek Park to align with the creek’s name change earlier this year. The Ames City Council voted unanimously last week to change the name of Squaw Creek Park to Ioway Creek Park. In February, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names changed the name of Squaw Creek, a 42-mile-long tributary of the South Skunk River, to Ioway Creek, as the original name is considered derogatory to Native Americans. The Ames Tribune reports that an Indigenous teen, Fawn Stubben, pushed for the change in the 1990s, but the proposal wasn’t considered until Ames resident Jasmine Martin applied to the federal board in 2019. The Ames City Council and Story County Board of Supervisors both voted in support of the change. The current name honors the Ioway, an Indigenous tribe that once lived in parts of Iowa. Creek sign names have since been adjusted around Ames, but there were still remnants of the former name, including Squaw Creek Drive. The street was renamed Stonehaven Drive as part of the meeting’s consent agenda. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Friday formally declared “squaw” a derogatory term and said she is taking steps to remove it from federal government use and to replace other derogatory place names.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Next year, the state will start requiring employers, individuals and health insurance companies to pay some costs associated with coronavirus testing. The state Department of Health and Environment announced Friday that it will start phasing out free screening tests for people who aren’t showing COVID-19 symptoms or haven’t potentially been exposed. The agency said it expects the policy to begin in March 2022. The department said it can’t sustain having public health agencies cover the cost of all testing indefinitely. The agency said it initially allocated $141 million in federal funds to make coronavirus tests available and support commercial and university labs to expand processing and sampling capacity. But the department said infections from the delta variant depleted the funds faster than expected. “Testing has become an increasingly important way in which those who choose to be unvaccinated may still be able to work, attend events, and travel,” Ashley Goss, the department’s acting secretary, said in a statement. The changes will mainly affect programs used by employers to test 10% of their workers on a regular basis and programs by community organizations to offer free rapid tests.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city has received a perfect 100 score from the Human Rights Campaign, a national civil rights organization, for its laws, policies, services and programs to protect and support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. The city received a total score of 106 for additional steps it has taken over the past few years to benefit the LGBTQ community. It’s the highest ranking of any city in Kentucky, though Louisville has received a perfect score for several years. A 100 is considered a perfect score, but cities can earn up to 122 additional points for programs and services. “We’ve worked hard to create an atmosphere welcoming all people,” Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said. “That hard work has resulted in the highest score received by a Kentucky city.” It’s the first time since the rankings began eight years ago that Lexington has earned a perfect score. In 2020, it received a 95 out of 100. Lexington received high marks despite Kentucky not having a statewide LGBTQ nondiscrimination law. The Human Rights Campaign evaluated more than 506 cities across the country. Other evaluated Kentucky cities include Berea, Bowling Green, Covington, Frankfort, Morehead and Owensboro. Covington’s score was 96. The lowest-scoring Kentucky city was Owensboro with 18.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State lawmakers on Friday lambasted Louisiana’s temporary housing program enacted after Hurricane Ida, saying it continues to move too slowly to help people living in damaged homes and tents since late August. “We’re moving at a snail’s pace. It’s just unbelievable,” said Sen. Mike Fesi, a Houma Republican who represents Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, which were among the hardest hit by Ida. The state has spent $90 million in federal disaster aid on more than 2,000 trailers to provide temporary shelter to residents in southeastern Louisiana. Half have been placed on residents’ properties and other community housing sites, and 653 families have moved into the trailers so far, the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness told lawmakers. The program has received near-constant criticism about the time it’s taking to place trailers since Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration launched the Hurricane Ida Sheltering Program on Oct. 4. That critique spilled over into Friday’s meeting of the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, as the homeland security agency asked lawmakers to approve $500 million in authority to spend federal disaster recovery aid. Director Casey Tingle defended the housing program, telling lawmakers: “We have a brand new program that’s never been done before.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The developer of a $1 billion electric transmission line is suspending construction at the request of the governor after she certified election results Friday in which residents firmly opposed the project. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills had urged New England Clean Energy Connect Transmission LLC to stop construction on the 145-mile project until legal challenges are resolved. Thorn Dickinson, president and CEO of NECEC, said work will be temporarily halted until a judge rules on a request for a preliminary injunction in its lawsuit contending the referendum was unconstitutional. “This was not an easy decision. Suspending construction will require the layoff of more than 400 Mainers just as the holiday season begins,” Dickinson said in a statement Friday evening. Mills supports the project but said she also supports “the rule of law that governs our society and the will of the people that informs it.” Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the project would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid. That’s enough electricity for 1 million homes. Critics said the project is damaging the woods and changing the character of a part of western Maine with little if any benefit for its residents.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: With sailboats taking over Carroll Creek, a unique holiday tradition has returned to downtown Frederick for its sixth year. About two dozen sailboats were launched in the creek Saturday as part of the annual Sailing Through the Winter Solstice project. Volunteers rushed about Saturday morning, lowering the boats off the banks of the creek into the water. Some volunteers had the unenviable task of wading through the water on the chilly November morning to ensure the boats were anchored in place. Peter Kremers, who co-founded and serves as the chair of the event, said there were about 25 sailboats in and around the creek this year. Now in its sixth year, the project has quickly grown into a beloved part of the holiday season in the city. This year’s event has more sailboats than ever. “We started with one boat in ’16,” Kremers said of the project’s speedy growth. “I think last year we had maybe 19 in the water; this year we have 22 boats in the water and three on land.” The sailboats will stay on Carroll Creek until March, each fitted with lights and decorations to brighten up the dark nights of winter. But the goal isn’t just to make the downtown look nice. The project also helps raise a significant amount of money for a number of local charities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A 48-foot white spruce chosen as the city’s Christmas tree has arrived from Nova Scotia as part of a decades-old tradition. This year’s tree was donated by L’Arche Cape Breton, a nonprofit that provides homes and work for people with disabilities. The 60-year-old tree was on the nonprofit’s property on Canada’s Cape Breton Island. A police escort brought the tree to Boston Common on Thursday, WCVB-TV reports. Nova Scotia donates a tree to Boston every year as a token of gratitude for relief efforts by Bostonians after a munitions ship exploded in Halifax Harbor in 1917, killing or injuring thousands of people. It will be lit Dec. 2. For Massachusetts residents buying a Christmas tree locally, finding the perfect one may prove difficult this year. Tree sellers are expecting one of their busiest and most challenging seasons yet, The Boston Globe reports. Last year, with many people cooped up at home during the pandemic, everyone wanted a tree – sometimes more than one, the National Christmas Tree Association said. Many local Christmas tree farms cut and sold trees they normally would have left in the ground. That means some sellers this year have fewer, shorter trees.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Pure Michigan is marketing the state’s upcoming winter season in an advertising campaign running in key regional and state markets. The Still Pure Michigan campaign is expected to run through the end of February and use broadcast and connected television, online video and digital ads, and social media, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. said. Much of the focus of the tourism and marketing campaign will be on travel and shopping. Advertising spots will run in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Lansing, Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, Traverse City, Cadillac, Marquette and Alpena. They also will be seen in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Kentucky. This year’s total winter advertising budget tops $3 million. The launch of the Pure Michigan campaign comes just ahead of the opening of many of Michigan’s ski resorts for the year, according to the MEDC. “As winter approaches, adventure awaits us in the form of downhill skiing, fat-tire biking or snowshoeing epic backcountry landscapes,” Travel Michigan Vice President Dave Lorenz said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Farmers across the state who grow about 45 million turkeys annually will benefit from higher prices this year, according to agriculture experts. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture said the price of turkeys has steadily increased as demand has risen following a year when there were fewer family gatherings, and restaurant traffic was down due to the coronavirus pandemic. “USDA is actually predicting this year to be a record-high price for turkeys,” said Tim Petry, a livestock marketing economist with the North Dakota State University Extension Service. “From a price standpoint, these are the best prices they’ve seen for a number of years. So, you know, that’s good news for producers.” The good news on prices is tempered somewhat by rising costs to raise the birds on more than 500 farms in the state, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Higher prices for corn and soybeans to feed the turkeys are cutting into profits, growers said. “Those are our two biggest ingredients, and and those prices were substantially higher than last year or past years,” said Jessica Westbrock, the president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. While turkey prices are up 17 cents a pound from last year, Petry said consumers are still likely to find bargains, as many stores sell turkeys below cost.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi School Boards Association is joining a handful of other states in breaking ties with the National School Board Association after the nonprofit sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking for federal support investigating harassment and threats of violence against school board members. Mississippi School Boards’ leadership wrote this week in a letter explaining the decision that the National School Boards Association’s “inflammatory language and the request for federal agencies to intervene in our communities, was just one in a series of lapses in governance.” It said Mississippi will end its relationship with the nonprofit NSBA on June 30, 2022, the end of the term for which the Mississippi School Boards Association has paid its dues to the national organization. Mississippi will then work with school board associations in other states to form a new organization that “will provide services to its member state school boards associations which are requested by and tailored to each member state school boards associations’ unique needs.” Local school boards across the country have become political battlegrounds over issues such as COVID-19-related mask rules, the treatment of transgender students, and how to teach the history of racism and slavery in America.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A couple who gained fame after waving guns at protesters near their home in 2020 are seeking to keep their law licenses by arguing their actions were justified because they were defending their property from a violent and threatening mob. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who are both lawyers, made that claim in response to a complaint asking the Missouri Supreme Court to suspend their licenses. The demonstrators went past the McCloskeys’ home June 28, 2020, at the height of racial injustice protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The couple, who were eating dinner on the patio with their daughter, responded by waving two weapons at the protesters. No shots were fired, and no one was hurt. Their actions gained praise from conservatives, including then-President Donald Trump. Mark McCloskey is now a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. They contend in their legal response that the demonstrations “involved significant unlawful and violent conduct,” KCUR reports. The response cites a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association finding nearly 89% of protests in St. Louis in June 2020 involved unlawful activity, and 11% involved some level of violence. Still, special prosecutor Richard Callahan has said his investigation determined the protesters near the McCloskeys’ home were peaceful.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Biden administration on Friday said it will consider new measures to protect greater sage grouse, a bird species once found across much of the West that has suffered drastic declines in recent decades due to oil and gas drilling, grazing, wildfires and other pressures. The announcement of a range-wide evaluation of habitat plans for greater sage grouse came after the Trump administration tried to scale back conservation efforts adopted when Biden was vice president in 2015. A federal court blocked Trump’s changes. But Biden administration officials said the attempt set back conservation efforts – even as the chicken-sized bird’s habitat was further ravaged by wildfires, invasive plants and continued development. U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said he believed Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning – a former aide to the lawmaker – would pursue a collaborative, balanced approach that will keep sage grouse from becoming an endangered species. But Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines criticized the action, saying states should be given deference to manage wildlife and federal lands kept open for energy exploration and grazing. Daines said state and local conservation efforts needs to be protected from “federal overreach,” while Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for Gianforte, said Montana already has a plan that balances conservation and rural economies.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s unemployment rate fell to a mere 1.9% last month – the lowest any state has reached since data collection began in 1976, according to labor statistics released Friday. The October rate reported by Nebraska’s labor department and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics marked the first time any state’s unemployment rate dropped below 2%. Spokespeople for both agencies confirmed that Nebraska’s rate is the country’s lowest on record. Nebraska has maintained its status as the state with the lowest rate through much of the pandemic. Its 1.9% rate for October was down slightly from the September rate of 2%. Nebraska Labor Commissioner John Albin said total nonfarm employment has risen by more than 30,000 from October of last year. The state reported 1,031,001 filled jobs in October, which was 10,718 more than the previous month. Nebraska has struggled with a chronic worker shortage since even before the pandemic, and it has driven up wages and made it difficult for employers to hire and expand. Earlier this month, the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry released a survey of its members in which 92% said finding skilled workers was a top priority.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A big southern Nevada sewage pumping facility failed last year, spewing an estimated 500,000 gallons of wastewater and leaking into a creek that leads toward the Lake Mead reservoir on the Colorado River, a television station investigation found. Officials want to spend $40 million to rehabilitate the Clark County Water Reclamation District wastewater lift station, where the January 2020 spill was blamed on a corroded underground pipe, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reports. Most of the spilled sewage was vacuumed up from land outside the Whitney Lift Station, KLAS-TV reports, citing documents, photos and emails obtained with a public records request. But an estimated 10,000 gallons – about enough water to fill an average kidney-shaped backyard swimming pool – went into a nearby creek that feeds the Las Vegas Wash. The wash flows to Lake Mead, the drought-stricken reservoir that provides about 90% of the Las Vegas-area drinking water supply. The Whitney Lift Station is one of 24 similar facilities operated by the reclamation district, which was formed in 1956 to reclaim wastewater from unincorporated Clark County, the largest jurisdiction in the Las Vegas area. The district treats nearly 106 million gallons of wastewater per day, according to its website.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers accepted $22.5 million in federal COVID-19 vaccine funding Friday that has sparked intense debate and angry protests for the past two months. The Joint Fiscal Committee had tabled a request from the Department of Health and Human Service in September to spend the money to hire new workers to promote the vaccines and help providers comply with the state’s new vaccine registry system. Meanwhile, the Executive Council, which approves state contracts, initially rejected the money before reversing course earlier this month. On Friday, three Republicans joined the committee’s three Democrats in voting to accept the money. Four Republicans voted no, with some citing concerns that language in the grant would require the state to follow future federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. “The action we take today will be historic,” said Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren. “It will be historic because we will either reject the notion of subservience to government coercion, or it will be historic because we accede to that notion and violate the most fundamental premises of freedom upon which our state and nation were founded and which are imperiled as never before in our nation’s history.” Giuda predicted the vote would become a campaign issue next year. At least one audience member agreed, shouting at Sen. Chuck Morse, R-Salem: “Treason! You will never get elected again, Morse! You’re done!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The decades­long odyssey to find the remains of Jimmy Hoffa, a tenacious leader of the Teamsters union, apparently has turned to land next to a former landfill that sits below an elevated highway in the Garden State. The FBI obtained a search warrant to “conduct a site survey underneath the Pulaski Skyway” last month, said Mara Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Detroit field office. She didn’t indicate whether anything was removed. The FBI’s disclosure is another turn in a mystery that has gripped law enforcement for more than 45 years. Hoffa was last seen July 30, 1975, when he was to meet with reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano at a restaurant in suburban Detroit. The focus now is in Jersey City, below a four-lane bridge where the sound of cars and trucks doesn’t stop. Wild overgrown brush thrives in the gritty industrial area, and green dumpsters abound. No one nearby at Interstate Waste Services offered a comment. “I’ve been assured that the body hasn’t been dug up yet,” journalist Dan Moldea said, referring to the FBI’s work in October.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Internet problems continue to slow down many students in the state, but a pilot project using TV signals to transmit computer files may help. On Thursday, state public education officials distributed devices to eight families in Taos that allow schools to send them digital files via television. The boxes the size of a deck of cards allow digital television receivers to connect with computers using technology called datacasting. Many rural areas of New Mexico are too far from internet infrastructure such as fiber cables and cell towers but do get TV reception. In October, local broadcasting affiliates of New Mexico PBS finished testing the technology to make sure they could set aside bandwidth not taken up by TV show broadcasts and dedicate it to broadcast downloadable digital files. The pilot program in Taos relies on a broadcast from northern New Mexico PBS affiliate KNME, while two others are planning to roll out pilot programs in the cities of Silver City and Portales. Remote learning during the pandemic highlighted the digital divide for New Mexico students, many of whom had to learn using paper packets while their peers could participate in virtual lessons via video chat.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The New York Assembly’s investigation into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s conduct in office concluded the Democrat’s administration misrepresented how many nursing home residents died of COVID-19, according to a lawmaker who reviewed the committee’s still-secret report. Assembly Member Phil Steck was among the Assembly Judiciary Committee members who were able to review a copy of the approximately 45-page report Thursday and Friday in advance of its public release, possibly as soon as this week. The report, compiled by the New York City law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, covers a wide array of allegations of misconduct by Cuomo, including sexual harassment claims and the participation of his staff in writing his book on the coronavirus pandemic. Other topics include the Cuomo administration’s manipulation of data on COVID-19 deaths as presented to the public. Gaps in the state’s statistical accounting of fatalities include the administration’s decision to exclude from its nursing home death totals thousands of patients who died after being transferred to hospitals. The Davis Polk investigators confirmed press reports that the state Department of Health wanted to include those hospital deaths in the state’s nursing home fatality count.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A bear cub wandering around a neighborhood with a jug stuck on its head is running free in the forest again thanks to wildlife biologists and some observant residents. Wildlife biologists with the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission spent two days searching for the bear cub, according to a news release. The commission said the bear likely got stuck while going through some trash and was wandering around an Asheville neighborhood. District Biologist Justin McVey got the initial report about the bear Monday night. Commission officials reached out to the public to help identify its location. McVey said a combination of responses to a message posted to NextDoor by the commission and direct calls to biologists, local residents led personnel directly to the bear cub. The bear was anesthetized before the jug was taken off its head. Biologists performed a health check before relocating it to a remote area in western North Carolina.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library has agreed to take a controversial equestrian statue of the 26th president that has stood on the steps of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City since 1940. The bronze statue, designed by James Earle Fraser, was commissioned by the Board of Trustees of the New York State Roosevelt Memorial in 1929. The library opening next year in Medora will be getting it as a long-term loan. The statue, which depicts the former president on horseback with a Native American man and an African man flanking the horse, has been the subject of years of criticism that it symbolizes colonial subjugation and racial discrimination. Objections grew more forceful after the death of George Floyd sparked a racial reckoning and a wave of protests across the U.S. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to remove the statue in 2020, calling it “problematic,” which drew an angry response from President Donald Trump, who tweeted: “Ridiculous, don’t do it!” With the support of members of the Roosevelt family, the North Dakota library will establish an advisory council composed of representatives of Indigenous and Black communities, historians, scholars and artists to “guide the recontextualization” of the statue.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law a map of new congressional districts Saturday that will be in effect for the next four years, despite objections from Democrats and voting rights groups. DeWine said in a statement that, compared with other proposals from House and Senate lawmakers from both parties, the Senate legislation he signed “makes the most progress to produce a fair, compact, and competitive map.” The redistricting measure cleared the Legislature along party lines with House approval Thursday after a breakneck sprint through both chambers, amid praise from majority Republicans. Democrats blasted the Republican-led mapmaking process as unfair, partisan and cloaked in secrecy. The Senate approved the bill Tuesday, only about 16 hours after the new map was released. The nonpartisan Princeton Gerrymandering Project gave the map an F grade. The new law creates at most three safe Democratic districts out of 15 new U.S. House seats in a state where voters are split roughly 54% Republican, 46% Democratic. Populous Cuyahoga and Hamilton counties – home to Cleveland and Cincinnati, respectively – are divided three ways each. Franklin County, home to Columbus, is divided two ways, and the western Cleveland suburbs in Lorain County are part of a district that stretches to the Indiana border, a nearly 3-hour drive.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s building code commission has undermined the efforts of its own committee tasked with reviewing energy conservation standards by shooting down proposed changes and completing a takeover of the committee itself. Last week’s actions leave green building in Oklahoma a dozen years behind, stuck in 2009, standing pat with current minimum standards, said Kelly Parker, chairman of the committee whose months of work was spurned. The committee started its work in May as part of a state-mandated code review every six years to update the state’s modified versions of various building codes. But committee members had not seen the commission’s recommendations on energy conservation until they were presented Tuesday. Commission Chairman Cary Williamson, Ardmore’s fire chief, wondered why and argued that the energy committee, effectively shut down in October, should have been allowed to do its job. Commissioner Kyle Lombardo, an architect with Rees Associates, complained that he was not given time to review the complex, technical recommendations, which will go to state lawmakers next year. The Oklahoma Uniform Building Code Commission further eroded efforts to make home construction in the state more environmentally friendly, Parker said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A man who was protesting outside the city’s federal courthouse when a federal law enforcement officer shot him in the face with a “less lethal” impact munition is suing in federal court. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the lawsuit filed by Donavan LaBella calls the unnamed officer’s actions “unprovoked, unjustifiable, and unlawful.” LaBella’s injury July 11, 2020, was captured on video and shared widely. The video depicts then-26-year-old LaBella holding a speaker over his head, pointed at the courthouse. Federal officers turn on a bright light, and then an officer fires a less lethal munition striking LaBella. Like other protesters who have tried suing federal law enforcement agencies over injuries at protests for racial justice, LaBella’s attorneys have struggled to identify the officers. The lawsuit names “John Does 1-10″ as unknown federal law enforcement officers, believed to be with the U.S. Marshals Service, present or responsible for shooting LaBella. Desiree LaBella, Donavan’s mother, said the people responsible for injuring her son need to be held accountable. “As much as we wish it didn’t have to come to this, he’s irreparably damaged,” she said. He now suffers from a debilitating, permanent frontal lobe brain injury that has negatively altered the course of (his) life,” the lawsuit says.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Frozen vials labeled “Smallpox” that were discovered in a freezer at a vaccine research facility in the state “contain no trace of virus known to cause smallpox,” federal health officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that testing showed the vials contain “vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine,” and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox. The CDC had said Monday that the vials “were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker” who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer. The CDC said no one was exposed to the contents. Mark O’Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County. It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. The CDC said it was “in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization” about the findings. Smallpox is a deadly, infectious disease that plagued the world for centuries and killed nearly a third of the people it infected. Victims suffered scorching fever and body aches, followed by spots and blisters that would leave survivors with pitted scars.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority is getting a $900,000 federal boost to develop plans for a high-capacity transit corridor to connect Central Falls to Warwick via Providence, according to the state’s congressional delegation. The corridor was one of five goals included in RIPTA’s Transit Master Plan for the next 20 years. The planning grant could enable RIPTA to complete the preliminary work needed to eventually bring a bus rapid transit or light rail project to the region. The $900,000 planning grant is made available through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity grant program, for capital investments in surface transportation that will have a significant impact on or directly benefit areas of persistent poverty. The state’s congressional delegation and RIPTA CEO Scott Avedisian have scheduled a news conference for Monday at the agency’s Chafee Transportation Center in Providence to discuss the study and its potential impacts.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSeneca: One of the most wanted fugitives in the United States apparently died about four months ago in a South Carolina home about 16 years after he was first wanted in San Diego for sexually assaulting children, investigators said. Frederick Cecil McLean, 70, died of natural causes in July, but his body wasn’t found until Nov. 6, when someone asked deputies to check on a neighbor who hadn’t been seen in a while, Oconee County Coroner Karl Addis said. McLean has been on the U.S. Marshal Service’s 15 Most Wanted list since 2006, a year after the San Diego Sheriff’s Department issued arrest warrants for sexual assaults on a child and determined he was a high risk to continue attacking girls. One girl was assaulted more than 100 times before she turned 13, marshals said in a statement. McLean had been living in South Carolina for 15 years, going by the name of James Fitzgerald, marshals said. “The discovery of Frederick McLean’s body marks an end to the manhunt, but the investigation continues,” U.S. Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis said. Investigators are now trying to determine if anyone helped McLean avoid being found by police. They have determined he used several other aliases and also lived in Anderson, South Carolina, and Poughkeepsie, New York.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMcIntosh: The work of two wildlife management agencies has resulted in the release of 28 endangered black-footed ferrets on the South Dakota side of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which straddles the Dakotas. The push behind the effort by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is twofold: to maintain control of black-tailed prairie dogs in an area of the reservation used primarily for grazing and to save from extinction the black-footed ferret, considered the most endangered mammal in the U.S. They are yellowish-buff in color and weigh 11/ 2 to 2 pounds. The forehead, muzzle and throat are white, and the feet are black. They have a black mask around the eyes that is well-defined in young ferrets. The ferrets were released Oct. 20 in prairie dog towns between McIntosh and Bullhead, said Michael Gutzmer, ecologist with New Century Environmental, the Nebraska company that provides biological services to the tribe, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Prairie dogs make up 90% of the black-footed ferrets’ diet. The ferrets live in prairie dog burrows, and each eats a prairie dog about every three days, said Seth Gutzmer, biologist on the Standing Rock project and Michael Gutzmer’s son. The ferrets were considered extinct in the wild in 1987.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Friends and associates of slain rapper Young Dolph handed out Thanksgiving turkeys at a neighborhood church Friday, two days after he was gunned down in broad daylight inside his favorite bakery. Known for acts of charity in his hometown, the hip-hop artist and label owner had helped organize the event at St. James Missionary Baptist Church and was going to participate before he was fatally shot Wednesday. Undaunted, members of his music label, Paper Route Empire, along with church volunteers and community activists, distributed dozens of turkeys, stuffing mix and cranberry sauce to people driving past the church. It was the type of event Young Dolph, who grew up in the Castalia neighborhood where the church is located, has been organizing for years, often without the reporters and cameras present Friday. Before the event, volunteers spoke quietly among themselves or sat in solemn reflection as his music played outside the church on the sunny afternoon. Label employee Bee Bee Jones, 38, helped hand out the food, honoring his friend of 30 years. “When I hear his music, I just break down,” Jones said. “The truth in all of it, and where he came from, that’s what really gets to me sometimes. This is what he would want us to do right here, still keep on giving. He came from nothing, but he wanted to make sure everybody got some.”\n\nTexas\n\nBig Spring: A pickup truck heading the wrong way on a West Texas highway slammed into a bus carrying members of a high school band, killing three people, officials said Friday. Two students from the bus were critically injured in the late Friday afternoon crash on Interstate 20 in Big Spring, about 250 miles west of Fort Worth, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The bus from Andrews High School was headed to a football game with 25 students aboard when it was hit by the wrong-way truck, which burst into flames, killing the truck’s driver, said DPS Sgt. Justin Baker. One of the adults from the bus was also pronounced dead at the scene, he said. A third adult and two students were airlifted to University Medical Center in Lubbock, 95 miles north of the crash site. The adult died at the hospital, and the two students were listed in critical but stable condition, Baker said. Other students were taken to the Scenic Mountain Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries, he said. The football playoff game between Andrews and Springtown in Sweetwater was postponed.\n\nUtah\n\nBeaver County: Climate change has been making droughts more frequent and intense and limiting Utah farmers’ ability to grow crops. In the past two years, a growing number of farmers have signed up for a state program that helps fund projects to increase their water use efficiency, KUER-FM reports. Among them is Trent Brown, a longtime rancher and farmer in Beaver County who’s also the county assessor, since farming doesn’t pay all the bills. It’s a family tradition: His father and grandfather were ranchers and farmers and worked government jobs, too. Brown finished the switch from growing alfalfa to grass five years ago to save water, but it wasn’t enough to overcome this summer’s drought. Earlier this year, he used a grant from the state’s Water Optimization Program to replace the cement in a ditch that brings water from the nearby Manderfield Reservoir to him and other farmers in the valley. “The concrete ditch was put in in the ’60s, and it was just falling apart, failing,” he said. “We were losing a lot of water. We figure probably 20%.” Utah established the Water Optimization Program in 2020. It got $3 million in state funding that year and another $3 million in 2021. During the latest round, the program got 81 applications totaling $10.6 million – more than triple the money available to spend, according to the program’s director, Jay Olsen.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Captain Snowpants; Yo Bro, No Snow; Plow-A-Tron 6,000; and Jennifer Snowpez are among the names that will be on some of the state’s snowplows this winter. Vermont school students participated in the state transportation department’s Name a Plow contest to come up with names for the plows serving their communities. The entries ranged from “creative and clever to cute and silly,” the agency said. Participating schools got a visit from their newly named plows last week. One child was so upset she had missed the visit from the snowplow named Super Snow Storm that the driver and plow will visit again, said Amy Tatko, spokesperson for the Vermont Agency of Transportation. The full list of the Vermont names – including Snowbegone Kenobe, Plowy McPlowFace, Brr-rito and Steve – can be found on the transportation department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order Thursday aimed at improving how the state receives and evaluates input from tribal nations when making decisions about permits related to environmental, historical or cultural resources. The order directs four agencies to draft their own policies within 90 days for working with tribal nations before a permit is approved or denied. The Northam administration said this would help Virginia identify and understand concerns from tribal nations before finalizing permits, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The directive applies to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Historic Resources, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Northam’s executive order also directs the secretary of the commonwealth to appoint an ombudsman who can work with both state agencies and tribal nations. Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin will take office a month before Northam’s deadline and could potentially cancel the executive order. The Youngkin transition team didn’t immediately respond to the Times-Dispatch’s requests for comment.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: As lawmakers prepare for a new legislative session to craft and pass a supplemental budget, they’ll have more money to work with thanks to a steady increase of state revenues over the past year. Updated numbers by the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council released Friday show that projected revenue collections for the 2021-2023 budget cycle are $898 million above what had been originally forecasted in September. And projections for the next two-year budget cycle that ends in mid-2025 increased by more than $965 million. Revenues for the current budget cycle that ends mid-2023 are now projected to be $60.2 billion. And projected revenues for the next two-year budget cycle that starts July 1, 2023, are projected to be about $64 billion. Steve Lerch, the chief economist and executive director of the council, said compared to the first forecast this year in March, overall revenues increased $3.6 billion for the current biennium and $4.1 billion for the next. Republican legislative members of the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council said in response to the strong growth, tax cuts should be part of any final plan. Democratic budget writers said nothing is off the table but expressed caution.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBramwell: A 128-year-old church collapsed suddenly in the middle of the night Thursday, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Bramwell’s historic Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, which has stood since 1893, caved in about midnight, Mayor Louise Stoker told the paper. The church’s original congregation included many of the town’s first residents, Stoker said. The Independent Bible Church later occupied the building before donating it to the town, which had been planning to conserve the historic structure. “I’ve been in dialogue with a preservation contractor,” Stoker said. “This week, in fact, we had sent him photos.” Workers clearing the debris noted things that could be saved such as large wooden beams and the old church bell. Some of the church’s Queen Anne-style stained glass windows were also mostly intact. Stoker said the town council will discuss what to do next, but it’s possible that a portion of the building that didn’t collapse will have to be taken down. Standing outside the church Friday, she pointed out six circular stained glass windows in the remaining structure. “Not one of them has a broken piece,” she remarked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: As the state kicked off its 170th deer gun season Saturday, some hunters were feeling ill-equipped for the second straight year. A nationwide ammunition shortage due to the supply chain issues affecting other products has left hunters searching far and wide for ammo in the first place and then shelling out more money if they do find it. Randy and Tiffani Rogness, who own Paddock Lake Sporting Goods in Salem, had empty ammunition shelves Friday. When a new supply is delivered, it lasts two to three hours, even with a one-box limit per customer, they said. “We search everywhere. We’ve ordered so much, and it’s just not coming in,” Tiffani Rogness said. One of the nation’s biggest ammunition manufacturers, Vista Outdoor in Anoka, Minnesota, said it’s “ramping production ahead of schedule at its Remington facility to meet unprecedented demand.” The price of almost any caliber ammunition is double what it was a year ago. Manufacturers say the pandemic created new gun buyers, along with more hunters looking for something to do outside, WISN-TV reports. More than 570,000 deer hunters from around the world are expected to try their luck in this year’s nine-day season, Department of Natural Resources officials said. Wisconsin has more than 7 million acres of land open for hunting.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: For the past four months, people have been protesting the presence of sexual education and LGBTQ books in the children’s and teen sections of the Campbell County Public Library. The movement, part of a national trend, is being led by the Wyoming chapter of MassResistance, a national group headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, that prides itself on “pro-family activism.” The local chapter was formed in July. Since then, the group has worked to get its message out to the community that the library is actively corrupting the youth with its books, the Gillette News Record reports. “It’s been hard on the library staff,” said library director Terri Lesley. “It’s been a long time, and I’m very proud of them for how well they’re doing, how well they’re holding up. It’s not easy to be in the middle of a big controversy.” MassResistance’s goal is to protect “the traditional family, school children, and the moral foundation of society.” It believes in marriage between a man and a woman and that people are not born homosexual. Library board member Charlie Anderson said he’s been called names, and Lesley said she and some of her staff have received angry emails and letters, some from out of state. Lesley said she’s also received a lot of support, which has helped balance out the calls for her resignation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2017/11/21/delaware-things-to-do-thanksgiving-weekend-plus-christmas-shows/866578001/", "title": "Here's what's going on Thanksgiving weekend and holidays in ...", "text": "Entering a fourth season, it looks like Wilmington has a new holiday tradition on its hands.\n\nWith cold air pushing in and Thanksgiving dinners hitting tables, that means the city's Riverfront Rink is about to be swarming with families looking for an outdoor skate session.\n\nThe timing couldn't be better for the opening weekend of the ice skating rink, which was erected in recent weeks at the summertime site of the Constitution Yards Beer Garden on the Riverfront.\n\nWith extra family in town, folks are looking for group activities, especially after polishing off Aunt Virginia's pumpkin pie following that overflowing turkey dinner.

Rolling Stone described the book and movie as “stuffed with antisemitic tropes.”\n\nIn a fraught post-game press conference after the Nets lost to the Indiana Pacers on Saturday, Irving defended his decision to post a link to the documentary.\n\n“In terms of the backlash, we’re in 2022, history is not supposed to be hidden from anybody and I’m not a divisive person when it comes to religion, I embrace all walks of life,” he said.\n\n“So the claims of antisemitism and who are the original chosen people of God and we go into these religious conversations and it’s a big no, no, I don’t live my life that way.”\n\nSeveral organizations have condemned Irving’s tweet, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the NBA, the Brooklyn Nets, and Nets’ owner Joe Tsai.\n\n“I’m disappointed that Kyrie appears to support a film based on a book full of anti-semitic disinformation,” Nets owner Joe Tsai tweeted Friday night.\n\n“I want to sit down and make sure he understands this is hurtful to all of us, and as a man of faith, it is wrong to promote hate based on race, ethnicity or religion.”\n\nTsai added, “This is bigger than basketball.”\n\nJoe Tsai attends the game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Indiana Pacers last year. Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n\nIrving said in the press conference that he “respects what Joe [Tsai] said,” but claimed that he had not tweeted something harmful.\n\n“Did I do anything illegal? Did I hurt anybody, did I harm anybody? Am I going out and saying that I hate one specific group of people?”\n\n“It’s on Amazon, a public platform, whether you want to go watch it or not, is up to you,” Irving said. “There’s things being posted every day. I’m no different than the next human being, so don’t treat me any different.”\n\nCNN has asked Amazon for comment but, at the time of publication, had not received a response.\n\nAt the same time, Irving acknowledged his “unique position” to influence his community, but said “what I post does not mean that I support everything that’s being said or everything that’s being done or I’m campaigning for anything.”\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, in a tweet on Friday called Irving’s social media post “troubling.”\n\n“The book and film he promotes trade in deeply #antisemitic themes, including those promoted by dangerous sects of the Black Hebrew Israelites movement. Irving should clarify now.”\n\nKyrie Irving during the Indiana Pacers game on Saturday. Elsa/Getty Images\n\nThe Nets also spoke out against the star guard’s tweet.\n\n“The Brooklyn Nets strongly condemn and have no tolerance for the promotion of any form of hate speech,” the team said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“We believe that in these situations, our first action must be open, honest dialogue. We thank those, including the ADL (Anti-Defamation League), who have been supportive during this time.”\n\nThe NBA issued a statement saying, “Hate speech of any kind is unacceptable and runs counter to the NBA’s values of equality, inclusion and respect.\n\n“We believe we all have a role to play in ensuring such words or ideas, including antisemitic ones, are challenged and refuted and we will continue working with all members of the NBA community to ensure that everyone understands the impact of their words and actions.”\n\nRolling Stone, meanwhile, said the movie and book include ideas in line with some “extreme factions” within the Black Hebrew Israelite movement that have expressed antisemitic and other discriminatory sentiments.\n\nDuring the press conference, Irving was also asked about his decision to share a video created by far-right talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who was recently ordered to pay nearly $1 billion in damages to Sandy Hook families for his lies about the massacre.\n\nIrving clarified that he did not agree with Jones’ false claims that the Sandy Hook shooting was staged but stood by sharing Jones’ post in September “about secret societies in America of occults,” that Irving believed to be “true.”", "authors": ["Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/tech/twitter-unbanned-users-returning/index.html", "title": "The mass unbanning of suspended Twitter users is underway | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThousands of previously banned Twitter users, including members of the far-right and users sharing blatant misinformation, have begun to have their accounts restored to the platform, according to an independent analysis.\n\nThe mass restoration of accounts comes after new owner Elon Musk said late last month that he would offer “general amnesty” to many who had been removed from the platform. In following through on that commitment, however, Musk risks further alienating other users and advertisers, and exacerbating concerns among watchdog groups about the rise of hate speech on the platform under his ownership (a fact Musk has attempted to refute).\n\nAmong those recently unbanned are a range of large and small accounts, including users promoting NFTs and cryptocurrencies, users tweeting about sports, many users tweeting in languages other than English, as well as both users that appear to be left-leaning and pro-Trump, according to observations by CNN.\n\nBut the restored accounts also include far-right figures such as Andrew Anglin, a self-professed white supremacist who founded the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, and Patrick Casey, who is associated with the far-right group “America First” and was subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee for his involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nA number of accounts restored in recent days, including many with thousands of followers, used their first tweets in years to thank Musk for allowing them back on the platform, according to a review of their posts by CNN. Some also quickly began sharing conspiracy theories about issues such as Covid-19 and the 2020 US Presidential election.\n\nA data set of many of the unbanned accounts compiled by researcher and software developer Travis Brown, who worked for Twitter for a year in 2014 and last year began a project tracking hate speech on the platform, shows dozens of users who have had their bans reversed are using QAnon-related phrases or hashtags in their account bios. The dataset was built using Twitter’s API and a tool Brown had originally built to observe and track high-profile Twitter suspensions.\n\nThe accounts that have been restored includes “a really strange mix of accounts” that includes apparent far-right extremists and QAnon adherents, but also, for example, a Miley Cyrus fan account that has been repeatedly suspended and appears aimed mostly at growing a large following, Brown said.\n\nBut Brown added that other accounts he has observed as part of his hate speech tracking project have yet to be reinstated, raising questions about the criteria Twitter is using to restore previously banned accounts, although it’s possible Musk’s reinstatement process will take time. Many users on Twitter have also raised questions about Musk’s move last week to again suspend Kanye West, who has made numerous antisemitic comments, while restoring the accounts of other white supremacists and Neo-Nazis. In another instance, Musk tweeted that he would not restore Alex Jones’s account because of a personal preference.\n\n“I’ve found it really hard … to generalize about how and why certain accounts are allowed back,” Brown said.\n\nTwitter, which has made substantial cuts to its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment and questions on the number of previously banned accounts restored or its process for doing so.\n\nMusk said last month that he would begin restoring most previously banned accounts to the platform, after having polled his Twitter followers about whether to offer “general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.” The poll, which garnered more than three million votes, finished with more than 72% voting in favor of the proposition. It is not clear how Musk and Twitter’s remaining staff are sorting out which accounts were banned for spam or illegal activity.\n\nThe new Twitter owner had already begun to restore the accounts of some prominent, controversial users that had previously been banned or suspended from the platform, most notably former President Donald Trump, as well as conservative Canadian podcaster and all-beef diet promoter Jordan Peterson and the right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee.\n\nSome of the accounts restored in the latest wave have already raised concerns from civil rights groups. The Anti-Defamation League on Monday described as “deeply disturbing” Twitter’s decision to allow Anglin back on the platform.\n\n“The return of extremists to the platform has the potential to supercharge the spread of extremist content and disinformation, and this in turn could lead to the increased harassment of users,” Yael Eisenstat, vice president of ADL’s Center for Technology and Society said in a statement to CNN. “Musk’s actions to date show that he is not committed to a transparent process that incorporates the best practices we have learned from civil society groups.”\n\nBefore taking over Twitter, Musk said he disagreed with the platform’s policy of permanent bans, which were typically doled out only after a user had received a number of “strikes” for repeatedly violating Twitter’s policies, including those against Covid-19 or civic integrity misinformation.\n\nShortly after acquiring the company, Musk said he would create a “content moderation council” prior to making major changes, but there is no evidence such a group was ever formed or involved in the decisions to bring back violative accounts. Instead, Musk has appeared to make the decisions himself.\n\nMusk and Twitter have repeatedly stressed that the platform’s rules have not changed, despite restoring accounts that had repeatedly violated its rules and ceasing enforcement of the company’s policy prohibiting Covid-19 misinformation. In a blog post last month, Twitter said that its trust and safety team “remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.” Content that violates Twitter’s rules, it added, will be demoted on the platform.\n\nYoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety who left the company following Musk’s takeover, criticized the billionaire Twitter owner’s top-down approach to content decisions in an interview with journalist Kara Swisher last month, suggesting that the platform had started to be run by “dictatorial edict rather than by a policy.” He also raised concerns about layoffs that hit Twitter’s safety teams.\n\nRestoring additional, previously banned accounts could exacerbate several big issues Twitter is currently facing. It could further alienate Twitter’s advertisers, many of whom have fled the platform in the wake of the chaos since Musk took over and out of fear that their ads could end up running alongside objectionable content. Musk has said the departure of key Twitter advertisers in recent weeks has led to a “massive drop in revenue” for the company.\n\nAds for major brands, including Kia, Amazon, Snap and Uber, have already begun to appear alongside tweets from reinstated accounts such as Anglin’s, according to reporting from the Washington Post and observations by CNN. (Kia told CNN it “continues to monitor the evolving Twitter environment and work closely with their teams on advertisement placement and usage.” The other brands did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.)\n\nIt could also draw more attention from Apple, which Musk previously tweeted had threatened to remove Twitter from its app store. Musk later said that the concern had been resolved following a meeting with Tim Cook, but Apple has previously shown a willingness to remove social media platforms from its app store over concerns about their ability to moderate hate speech and other potentially harmful content. Getting booted from Apple’s app store would be detrimental to Twitter’s business by making it harder for the iPhone maker’s more than one billion global customers to access the app, and difficult if not impossible for iPhone users to receive app updates.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/us/inside-texas-synagogue-hostage-standoff/index.html", "title": "What it was like inside the Colleyville, Texas, synagogue during the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt started like most any Saturday for members of Congregation Beth Israel.\n\nFamilies of the Reform Jewish synagogue just outside Dallas-Fort Worth had gathered – in person and online – to participate in the Sabbath service, even amid the twin perils of a fresh pandemic wave and a swelling tide of attacks on Jewish people in the United States.\n\nBy day’s end, the community of faith in Colleyville, Texas, would be at the center of a global drama involving a livestreamed hostage-taking, an imprisoned terrorist icon, an elite FBI rescue team, a rabbi’s quick thinking and a final, frantic sprint to freedom.\n\nMore details may yet offer a deeper understanding of why it happened. But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}]}

I understand that globally, everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus and seeing, hopefully, an end soon to this virus.”\n\n‘I take Covid very seriously’\n\nIn the interview, Rajan asked Djovokic about the sequence of events leading up to the Australian Open and how it was suggested that “it was convenient” how the player’s positive Covid case happened in time for him to be granted a medical exemption.\n\n“I understand that there is a lot of criticism, and I understand that people come out with different theories on how lucky I was or how convenient it is,” he said. “But no-one is lucky and convenient of getting Covid. Millions of people have and are still struggling with Covid around the world. So I take this very seriously, I really don’t like someone thinking I’ve misused something or in my own favour, in order to, you know, get a positive PCR test and eventually go to Australia.”\n\n‘The reason why I was deported’\n\nDjovokic was “really sad and disappointed” with the way the whole saga ended in Australia. He said his vaccine status was not the reason why he was deported, but the possibility the situation would create an anti-vax sentiment down under.\n\n“What people probably don’t know is that I was not deported from Australia on the basis that I was not vaccinated, or I broke any rules or that I made an error in my visa declaration,” he said. “All of that was actually approved and validated by the Federal Court of Australia and the Minister for Immigration. The reason why I was deported from Australia was because the Minister for Immigration used his discretion to cancel my visa based on his perception that I might create some anti-vax sentiment in the country or in the city, which I completely disagree with.”\n\n‘The price that I’m willing to pay’\n\nRafael Nadal’s victory in Melbourne was the Spaniard’s 21st career grand slam title – he is now one ahead of his “big three” rivals, Djokovic and Roger Federer. When asked by Rajan if he would pull out of major events such as Wimbledon and the French Open because of his vaccine stance, Djokovic said that’s “the price that I’m willing to pay”.\n\nDjokovic hopes that vaccination requirements in certain tournaments would change as he wants to play “for many more years”. However, he would forego the chance to become statistically the greatest male tennis player of all time because he felt so strongly about the situation, the BBC reported. He said: “The principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Uk", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Mike Starling", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/tennis/955355/back-on-court-what-next-novak-djokovic-australia", "title": "Back on court: what next for Novak Djokovic in Australia? | The Week", "text": "Novak Djokovic has finally made his way to a tennis court in Australia. This morning the men’s world No.1 had his visa cancellation overturned after winning a courtroom battle.\n\nThe Serbian, 34, was refused entry to the country on Thursday and spent four nights in a detention hotel. Djokovic, who has not publicly revealed his vaccine status, flew Down Under after he was granted a medical “exemption permission”. However, Australian Border Force officials said he had failed to provide evidence to meet the entry requirements and his visa was subsequently cancelled.\n\nThis morning Judge Anthony Kelly of the Federal Circuit Court “quashed” the visa cancellation and ordered the Australian government to pay legal costs and release the player from detention within half an hour, The Guardian reported.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

According to a transcript of an interview revealed in court, he had told border officials he was unvaccinated and had been infected with Covid twice. Judge Kelly stated that the decision to cancel the visa was “unreasonable”.\n\nAfter winning his appeal, the 20-time grand slam champion returned to the practice court and issued a statement on social media saying he wanted to stay in Melbourne, where he is aiming to win the Australian Open for a tenth time.\n\n“I’m pleased and grateful that the judge overturned my visa cancellation,” Djokovic said. “Despite all that has happened, I want to stay and try to compete @AustralianOpen I remain focused on that. I flew here to play at one of the most important events we have in front of the amazing fans.”\n\n‘Ongoing process’\n\nDjokovic may want to focus on the tennis, but he may still be deported from Australia. Immigration Minister Alex Hawke is still considering revoking Djokovic’s visa and could overrule the decision. The MP is able to act using broad discretionary powers granted him by Australia’s Migration Act, the BBC reported.\n\nA spokesperson said the minister is “currently considering the matter and the process remains ongoing”.\n\nShould Hawke use this power, Djokovic “could be banned from re-entering Australia for three years”, the Daily Mail said. “But a three-year entry ban could be waived even if Mr Hawke does cancel the player’s visa.”\n\nFormer Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd used Twitter to “lambast” current PM Scott Morrison over the Djokovic case. Rudd tweeted: “Morrison just lost his case against #Djokovic. Total incompetence! Like on everything else.”\n\n‘Biggest victory’\n\nAs Djokovic was getting some practice in on the court at Melbourne Park, his family held a press conference in Belgrade, the Serbian capital city.\n\nDijana Djokovic, his mother, said the decision to overturn his visa cancellation was the “biggest victory” of her son’s career. She also claimed he had been “subject to torture and harassment”. Djordje Djokovic said his brother was in Australia to “set another record”. He added: “Novak has always advocated freedom of choice, nothing more.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}]}

Those were the first names of the students killed in Monday night's attack by a gunman.\n\nThe names were also part of yet another repainting -- this one requested by the university, according to a tweet by local reporter Rachel Louise Just -- depicting the MSU logo along with the words, \"Always a Spartan.''\n\nThat feeling was prevalent Wednesday night as thousands of students, university employees and alumni -- among them Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Spartans men's basketball coach Tom Izzo -- joined in mourning.\n\nA somber silence from the crowd spoke louder than any words uttered, though Whitmer -- a Michigan State alumnus -- captured the gathering's mood when she said: \"We really, really love this place. You can see it in how we treat each other. That's what makes this week so hard.\n\n\"Let's make sure tomorrow is better,'' she said in conclusion. \"I love you.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\nAll five students wounded in the attack remain in critical condition, campus police said Wednesday.\n\nThe University of Michigan said it will hold a vigil Wednesday evening in support of the Michigan State University community and some of the Wolverines' athletes will wear helmet decals with the Spartans logo as a tribute to the victims.\n\n'OUR SPARTAN HEARTS ARE BROKEN:3 students killed are ID'd. Updates.\n\nMSU students rally at state Capitol, express anger over gun violence\n\nAbout 100 Michigan State students joined community members Wednesday at the state Capitol in Lansing demanding to be heard after the latest mass shooting at a place of learning.\n\nSitting on the Capitol steps during a rally, several of those in attendance held signs expressing their anger and frustration -- some in profane terms -- about the profusion of gun deaths across the country.\n\n\"Our blood, your hands,'' said some of the signs. \"(Expletive) your thoughts and prayers,'' said another.\n\n\"Look at these students right here and understand their pain before you act like you understand us,\" rally organizer and MSU junior Maya Manuel told lawmakers. \"Please take a moment to sit with us and to listen to us and to be with us because you won't be us.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat, said on CNN that politicians who refuse to confront the issue of gun violence are out of touch.\n\n\"They haven't realized that from Oxford and Uvalde and now this, the average gun owner in Michigan, the average person who feels strongly about their Second Amendment rights, also feels strongly about keeping their babies safe in school,'' she said.\n\nStudents share their stories: 'A lot of people don't feel safe anymore'\n\nSome Michigan State students returned Wednesday to claim their belongings from the student union, which they had fled in a hurry Monday night upon learning a gunman had opened fire there.\n\nMatias Jimenez, 21, said he hid behind columns before racing out of the building and into the dorm room of a stranger, where they sheltered for hours. Jimenez said he grew up near campus and has relatives who work at MSU, so it will be difficult not to worry about them constantly now.\n\nHis friend and fellow triathlete Connor Dunn found it hard to go back into the building, typically a relaxed hangout but now the place where many were retrieving cell phones full of anguished messages from relatives trying to ascertain they were safe.\n\nHe figures some students will struggle to return to the classrooms when classes resume next week.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for a lot of people,\" Dunn said, \"especially those in a worse position than me. Some did see the shooter. I was lucky enough where I didn't see that visual. But I know a lot of people don't feel safe anymore.\"\n\n-- Mike Ellis, Lansing State Journal\n\nNo clear indication what prompted rampage\n\nTwo days after a gunman's rampage left three students dead on the MSU campus, investigators were still hunting Wednesday for an answer to one question: Why?\n\nThe shooter, who lived in Lansing and had no known ties to the university, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound when confronted by police about three hours after his attack Monday night, authorities said. A tip had led police to the killer just 17 minutes after photos from surveillance video were released to the public.\n\nAnthony McRae, 43, lived the past two years with his father at the end of a quiet street of older homes in Lansing’s north end, neighbors said.\n\n\"We have absolutely no idea what the motive was,\" Chris Rozman, MSU's interim deputy police chief, said Tuesday.\n\nMSU student from near Sandy Hook: 'We can no longer be complacent'\n\nAlerts urging Michigan State students to “run, hide, fight” sent them fleeing into the night in the minutes after the shooting started Monday. The chaos brought back memories of the Sandy Hook Elementary tragedy for Jaqueline Matthews. She crouched for so long at a nearby middle school when gunfire erupted at Sandy Hook a decade ago that her back was permanently injured. On Monday, the 21-year-old international law major and member of the Michigan State rowing team watched mayhem unfold again, this time from her campus window.\n\n“The fact that this is the second mass shooting that I have now lived through is incomprehensible,” she said in a TikTok video. “We can no longer be complacent.\"\n\nAnother MSU student is also experiencing a horrible case of deja vu. Jennifer Mancini told the Detroit Free Press that her daughter survived the November 2021 shooting that left four students dead at Oxford High School in southeastern Michigan. She's now a freshman going through a similar trauma.\n\n“I can’t believe this is happening again,” said Mancini, who didn’t want her daughter’s name used.\n\nThree bouquets for three Michigan State shooting victims\n\nMSU senior Julia Wallace placed three bouquets of flowers at the feet of the school's Sparty statue. Wallace was at Bessey Hall on Monday in a club meeting, talking to an alumni panel on a video conference, when an alert about the shooting came across the screen.\n\n\"Once it was announced, I was like, 'Oh ... I need to get out of here.' Then we all awkwardly got up,\" she said. \"Do we hide? I was like, 'I'm not going to sit here and be a sitting duck, that's the last thing I'm going to do.'\"\n\nShe said everyone got up and calmly walked out of the building – then sprinted to their cars and \"booked it home.\"\n\n\"For some reason that was the first thought on my mind this morning – to go show my community that I'm impacted and that I feel for others,\" she said. \"I kind of didn't think, I just did. I got the three (bouquets) for the three lives lost because it's just horrible.\"\n\nMichigan lawmakers put gun violence back on state agenda\n\nDemocratic lawmakers responding to the MSU shooting say they will introduce state legislation to address gun violence that stalled in the past. While they provided a general outline of bills they plan to put forward, exact details on the forthcoming proposals and their timing remain unclear.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last month proposed universal background checks, extreme risk protection orders to keep guns away from those deemed a danger to themselves or others and safe storage requirements. Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, a Democrat, on Tuesday called the proposals \"common sense\" measures that enjoy public support – and that other proposals are likely.

She told him that someone came into her classroom and started shooting.\n\n“Her hands were completely covered in blood. It was on her pants and her shoes,” he told The Associated Press. “She said, ‘It’s my friend’s blood.’”\n\nThat, he said, is when it hit him: “There was a real shooting, a mass shooting.”\n\nThe woman picked up her phone and started crying, unsure of what happened to her friend. Zimbo spent the next three hours hunkered down in his Toyota SUV, a blanket tossed over him.\n\nMOURNING THE MICHIGAN STATE SHOOTING VICTIMS:An aspiring pediatrician. 'Phenomenal daughter.' Beloved 'leader'\n\nThe students who died were from the Detroit area\n\nUniversity police identified the three dead students as sophomores Arielle Anderson and Brian Fraser and junior Alexandria Verner. Fraser was a fraternity chapter president. Verner was a science student with fond memories of her days as a high-school athlete. Anderson was a frequent volunteer who wanted to become a pediatrician. All were from the Detroit area.

Anthony Dwayne McRae served 18 months' probation after pleading guilty to a gun-related charge in 2019. Police had found him with a Ruger LCP .380 semi-automatic pistol in his pants pocket and a loaded magazine in his breast pocket despite not having a concealed weapons permit, according to court records.\n\nMcRae was originally charged with a felony, and a conviction would have prevented him from legally owning a gun in the future. But McRae agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor, a charge that did not bar his ability to buy a firearm after he successfully completed probation.\n\nAuthorities said McRae had a history of mental health struggles, and relatives described him as secluded. Neighbors and family members told the Detroit Free Press he fired a gun dangerously in his backyard.\n\nPolice said McRae shot and killed himself after they confronted him in an industrial area about 5 miles from campus following a three-hour manhunt.\n\nContributing: Bryce Airgood and Mike Ellis, Lansing State Journal; Kristen Jordan Shamus, Detroit Free Press; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/06/07/draftkings-lawsuit-sports-bet-goes-unpaid/7493418002/", "title": "DraftKings gets sued after Walled Lake man isn't paid winnings", "text": "DraftKings, a fantasy sports betting service, is embroiled in a federal lawsuit as a Michigan man claims the company stiffed him on a winning bet — and contends that he's not the only one.\n\nRyan Cristman, of Walled Lake, contends that he bet on a Boston Bruins game and won a jackpot over $5,000, according to the lawsuit filed on May 12 in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District.\n\nThe Nevada-based betting service, which boasted 1.5 million unique customers per month in the first quarter of the year, launched in Michigan on Jan. 22 after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed into law a bill allowing sports betting.\n\n“Sports betting online is new, they’re trying to get users as fast as they can, to essentially legalize their business model. Their focus seems to be expansion and revenue and there’s little thought and attention to consumer protection,\" said Ari Scharg, a lawyer at Edelson PC in Chicago, who is representing Cristman in court. “They lied to Mr. Cristman when he reached out to figure out what was going on.”\n\nBut DraftKings told Cristman it was all a mistake. They had marked the game's odds incorrectly, according to the support email received by Cristman, citing a \"display issue.\" The email was included in the lawsuit.\n\nDraftKings had not yet responded in court to the lawsuit and could not be reached for comment Sunday.\n\nThe lawsuit notes that prior to its launch of its sports betting (“Sportsbook”) app in Michigan, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins stated that they would be delivering the signature DraftKings experience to Michiganders. The filed suit sardonically claims that “Unfortunately, the ‘signature DraftKings experience’ offered by Defendant involves the systemic practice of refusing to pay winning wagers to customers who are contractually entitled to them.”\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, here's how the events unfolded:\n\nCristman wagered $915 on a hockey game on the evening of Feb. 10. It was the Boston Bruins versus the New York Rangers.\n\nCristman wagered the bet that the Bruins would not lose by three points. He called customer support to confirm that his bet was indeed +3 on the Bruins, and they confirmed that the wager and its odds were displayed correctly. If Cristman won, he would be owed $5,586.\n\nHe eventually won the bet, as the Bruins did not lose by more than three points. The game ended with a Bruins overtime win, 3-2. Cristman’s bet, however, was reportedly incorrectly displayed after the game had concluded, reading minus-3 goals rather than +3. In the lawsuit, Cristman supplies screenshots of the receipt and the subsequent bet that he placed.\n\nDraftKings replied with a customer support message concluding that there was “a display issue” with the bet and that instead of his winnings, he would be refunded his wager and offered a $50 free wager in the future. Cristman followed up through email with the claim that his bet was a winning one, then DraftKings failed to respond and locked Cristman’s account in retaliation, per the lawsuit.\n\n“This was two days in. I had been winning, and they froze my account,\" said Cristman . “They sent different chat operators to answer my emails, just spinning me around in circles.”\n\nThe lawsuit itself is filed on the grounds that “DraftKings failed to honor the winning wagers its customers paid for by incorrectly marking the wagers as losses and, as a result, prevented their customers from receiving the payout that they were entitled to”, entering the territory of a class-action lawsuit, as allegedly others find themselves in the same predicament as Cristman.\n\nIn addition, the damages owed to Cristman are reported by the lawsuit to be insufficient to truly rectify DraftKings’ practices, which makes it perfect for a class-action endeavor in providing “the benefits of a single adjudication, economy of scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court.\" A single court would reportedly offer a more manageable venue in time and effort to get DraftKings to pay up.\n\nThis isn't the first time sportsbetting sites have been sued and accused shady business practices. In the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Johnson v. Fanduel was a case in which Fanduel, a sportsbetting site similar to DraftKings, was involved in a class-action lawsuit in February 2016 over allegations of lying about the odds of certain games. DraftKings was also involved as a defendant in the suit, implicated for the same alleged practices.\n\n“DraftKings is in a precarious situation. They’ve undertaken a massive PR campaign to lobby other states to allow sports wagering. It seems like they want to retain control to unilaterally void bets when they lose,\" said Scharg. \"There’s going to be a lot of people watching, as they want to know if it’s going to be OKto legalize it in their state.\"\n\nWith sports betting recently legalized in Michigan, DraftKings likely saw it as an opportunity to expand its reach and connect with an entirely new user base. But according to the Cristman and his lawyers, it was done hastily and without care for its users.\n\nMore: Henry Ford made a short trip 125 years ago that changed his life\n\nMore: Detroit's Faygo just got shout out in new Billie Eilish music video\n\nThe lawsuit states that “the precise number of members of the proposed Class is unknown to plaintiff at this time, but, based on information and belief, Class members are so numerous that their individual joinder is impracticable.\"\n\nIn layman’s terms, that means that there are too many people reported to have been slighted by DraftKings for a union of them to even be possible. Cristman is representing the many people to whom DraftKings owe money. Members of the afflicted will be notified after the fact if the lawsuit is won. The amount of money said to be owed to DraftKings users is currently unknown, but if Cristman and his lawyers are correct, the sum may be large.\n\n“It’s been months, I haven’t bet on DraftKings since,\" said Cristman.\n\nEditor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the Bruins game ended in a 2-2 tie.

Today I feel a migrant worker,” FIFA chief Gianni Infantino said in a fiery tirade on Saturday, comparing his own plight as a redhead son of migrants to that of marginalized communities.\n\nHis ostensible empathy with Qatar was due to the barrage of criticism the nation has faced in Western media for hosting the tournament.\n\nBut it’s hypocritical of the West to be giving lessons in morality to others, he said.\n\nThose statements on the eve of the World Cup went viral, inviting much anger and ridicule. But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.\n\nUS actor Morgan Freeman (2nd L), Qatari singer Dana al-Fardan (2nd R), and Qatari YouTuber Ghanim al Muftah (R) perform during the Qatar 2022 World Cup opening ceremony on Sunday. Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOmar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized “from a Western point of view” what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.\n\nIn the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation’s treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain’s public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.\n\nThis year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.\n\nThe Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into “nations and tribes” so they can get to know each other.\n\nAccording to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.\n\nQatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nBut in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nThe visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn’t escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.\n\nWestern news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.\n\nThe Times of London on Monday said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country’s population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.\n\n“I think that the Western media is biased because they don’t want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],” Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.\n\nBut some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar’s Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows “the depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.”\n\nThe Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar’s right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was “laced with hypocrisy.”\n\n“I always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,” said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.\n\n“Scrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,” Al Hussein told CNN.\n\n“Especially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.”\n\nJames Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been “fair and proportionate.”\n\n“It’s absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,” he said.\n\nWorkers in the country continue to “face harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,” he said, adding that Qatar’s women and LGBTQ people “face serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.”\n\nCritics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn’t receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.\n\n“At the risk of engaging in whataboutism… Qatar’s human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,” said Al Hussein. “Qatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.”\n\nMaryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.\n\n“This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” she said. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”\n\nShe noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country’s human rights shortcomings.\n\n“Many of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,” she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn’t help the cause of Qatar’s migrant workers.\n\n“The plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN. “It shouldn’t be about whataboutism.”\n\nWith additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha\n\nIran protests\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN hears testimony from women who say they experienced sexual violence by Iranian regime 06:31 - Source: CNN\n\nSocial media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.\n\nWith media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq’s border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who’d left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.\n\nThe covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.\n\nUS Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is “a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.”\n\nRead the article here.\n\nHere’s the latest on the protests in Iran:\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Tuesday that the rising number of protest-related deaths highlights the “critical” nature of the situation in the country.

The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.\n\nBackground: The attack brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side of the conflict to at least 29 this year. This year has also been the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015.\n\nWhy it matters: Jerusalem has not seen a double bombing like this one in many years. Prime Minister Yair Lapid said after participating in a situation assessment with security officials that the incident was “different from what we have seen in recent years.” The explosions come after months of tensions in the occupied West Bank.\n\nRussia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says\n\nIran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.\n\nBackground: US officials have said that Russia has received hundreds of drones from Tehran which have had a deadly effect in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy it matters: The move would further cement the partnership between Tehran and Moscow and likely provoke significant anger from Ukraine and its western allies including the US. Sources explained that the goal is for Russia to produce thousands of new attack drones using Iranian components and blueprints.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market\n\nOil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China’s rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.\n\nBackground: The Wall Street Journal earlier on Monday reported an output increase of 500,000 barrels per day was under discussion for the next meeting of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on December 4. The report cited unidentified OPEC delegates. The report sent oil prices plunging by more than 5%.\n\nWhy it matters: The oil cartel last month cut production by 2 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the market “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” The oil cut was made despite strong US pressure against it. Potential further cuts could exacerbate already tense relations between the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/courts/2022/03/16/pastor-stovall-weems-founder-sues-jacksonvilles-celebration-church/7005515001/", "title": "Pastor Stovall Weems, founder, sues Jacksonville's Celebration ...", "text": "The founders of the 12,000-member Celebration Church are suing the Jacksonville megachurch’s hand-picked trustees to avoid being ousted over claims of financial irregularities.\n\nGlobal Senior Pastor Stovall Weems and his wife, Kerri, say in their lawsuit that Weems was wrongly suspended from his post in January after a trustee “falsely claimed that Pastor Stovall was improperly manipulating and misdirecting the church’s finances.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/09/15/ny-medical-worker-vaccine-mandate/8331702002/", "title": "NY's medical worker vaccine mandate entangled in lawsuits ...", "text": "New York’s push to implement a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers has become the frontline in a national battle over government leaders requiring the shots to curb coronavirus infections.\n\nFrom anti-vaccine lawsuits and rallies to President Biden’s national vaccine mandate proposals, New York Gov.

Iran started their group B campaign with a heavy 6-2 defeat against England.\n\nDespite the Iran result, Page is expecting a “tough game” and he believes his side are still the underdogs to qualify from the group. “England are favourites, USA are second favourites,” he said. “But there will be a few surprises along the way. We’re just planning for a tough game on Friday and that takes us into the last game against England.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The Swansea midfielder is “fit and raring to go” after his hamstring injury, Page said, and the boss has “a decision to make” on “what’s best for the team”.\n\nAnything other than victory will leave Iran facing “an early exit” from Qatar 2022, said Daniel Lewis on The Analyst. However, head coach Carlos Queiroz still has faith in his players. “What I can say as a conclusion is we win or learn,” he said. “We had the privilege to learn a lot of things against England and we are much better prepared now to play against Wales.”\n\nThe two sides have only faced each other once before in men’s international football, with Wales winning 1-0 in a friendly match in 1978.\n\nMatch facts\n\nWho: Wales vs. Iran\n\nWhat: Fifa World Cup group B matchday two\n\nWhen: Friday 25 November 2022\n\nWhere: Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium\n\nKick-off time: 10am (all times GMT)\n\nIn Friday’s other group B match England take on the USA at Al Bayt Stadium (7pm, live on ITV).\n\nWales captain Gareth Bale scored the vital penalty against the USA (Image credit: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nHow to watch on TV in the UK\n\nFriday’s clash between Wales and Iran will be shown live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer. Coverage begins at 9.15am, with kick-off at 10am. Presenter Gabby Logan is joined in the studio by former Wales internationals Ian Rush and Ashley Williams and German World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann. The match is also live on Welsh-language channel S4C.\n\nTeam news\n\nThe half-time introduction of Wales striker Kieffer Moore “transformed the game” against the USA, said Ben Fisher in The Guardian. He “has to start” against Iran and accompany captain Bale in attack.\n\nAll 26 Wales players trained on Wednesday, including Joe Allen. The Swansea midfielder has not played since September because of a hamstring issue and his return to full training is a “huge boost”, said Ash Rose in the Daily Mail.\n\nIran goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand was substituted after suffering a head injury against England and may not be fit enough to start on Friday. Hossein Hosseini could again deputise between the sticks. Star man Sardar Azmoun was fit enough to come on in the first game and could start in attack with Mehdi Taremi, who scored twice in the 6-2 loss.\n\nPossible starting XIs\n\nWales: Hennessey; Mepham, Rodon, Davies; Roberts, Allen, Ampadu, Williams; James, Bale; Moore\n\nIran: H.Hosseini; Moharrami, Pouraliganji, Cheshmi, M.Hosseini, Mohammadi; Jakanbakhsh, Noorollahi, Karimi, Gholizadeh; Taremi\n\nPredictions\n\nA Wales win – “something they have not achieved in their past six matches” – is predicted as the “most likely outcome” at 49.4%, according to The Analyst’s “supercomputer”. There is a 27.6% likelihood of the match ending in a draw, and a 23.2% chance of Iran winning.\n\nThe Independent’s Alex Pattle backs Wales to “pick up their first win” of this World Cup, but “not without a little trouble along the way”. Prediction: Wales 2 Iran 1.\n\nConsidering just how poorly Iran defended against England, “Moore and Gareth Bale should feel confident of causing problems”, said Jonathan Gorrie in the London Evening Standard. Prediction: Wales 2 Iran 1.\n\nWales have a “slight advantage” in terms of squad quality, said Shubham Dupare on SportsKeeda. And, as they usually do well in competitive games, “we are backing them to secure a narrow win”. Prediction: Wales 2 Iran 1.\n\nPage’s side will be regarded as the “marginal favourites” for this contest, said Darren Plant on SportsMole. However, with Iran having “more recovery time” and “playing at a time of the day which should benefit them”, we can see a “competitive low-scoring draw”. Prediction: Wales 1 Iran 1.\n\nThe stadium\n\nInspired by the sand dunes, you’ll find Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium on the edge of the desert in Al Rayyan, west of Doha. The 40,000-capacity venue will host seven World Cup matches, six in the group stage and one round of 16 tie.\n\nSquads\n\nWales\n\nHead coach: Robert Page\n\nRobert Page Key player: Gareth Bale\n\nGareth Bale One to watch: Brennan Johnson\n\nBrennan Johnson Goalkeepers: Wayne Hennessey (Nottingham Forest), Danny Ward (Leicester City), Adam Davies (Stoke City)\n\nWayne Hennessey (Nottingham Forest), Danny Ward (Leicester City), Adam Davies (Stoke City) Defenders: Neco Williams (Nottingham Forest), Ben Davies (Tottenham Hotspur), Ben Cabango (Swansea City), Joe Rodon (Rennes, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur), Chris Mepham (Bournemouth), Ethan Ampadu (Spezia, on loan from Chelsea), Chris Gunter (AFC Wimbledon), Connor Roberts (Burnley), Tom Lockyer (Luton Town)\n\nNeco Williams (Nottingham Forest), Ben Davies (Tottenham Hotspur), Ben Cabango (Swansea City), Joe Rodon (Rennes, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur), Chris Mepham (Bournemouth), Ethan Ampadu (Spezia, on loan from Chelsea), Chris Gunter (AFC Wimbledon), Connor Roberts (Burnley), Tom Lockyer (Luton Town) Midfielders: Aaron Ramsey (Nice), Joe Allen (Swansea City), Harry Wilson (Fulham), Joe Morrell (Portsmouth), Dylan Levitt (Dundee United), Rubin Colwill (Cardiff City), Jonny Williams (Swindon Town), Matthew Smith (Milton Keynes Dons), Sorba Thomas (Huddersfield Town)\n\nAaron Ramsey (Nice), Joe Allen (Swansea City), Harry Wilson (Fulham), Joe Morrell (Portsmouth), Dylan Levitt (Dundee United), Rubin Colwill (Cardiff City), Jonny Williams (Swindon Town), Matthew Smith (Milton Keynes Dons), Sorba Thomas (Huddersfield Town) Forwards: Gareth Bale (Los Angeles FC), Dan James (Fulham, on loan from Leeds United), Kieffer Moore (Bournemouth), Mark Harris (Cardiff City), Brennan Johnson (Nottingham Forest)\n\nIran\n\nHead coach: Carlos Queiroz\n\nCarlos Queiroz Key player: Sardar Azmoun\n\nSardar Azmoun One to watch: Ali Gholizadeh\n\nAli Gholizadeh Goalkeepers: Alireza Beiranvand (Persepolis), Amir Abedzadeh (Ponferradina), Seyed Hossein Hosseini (Esteghlal), Payam Niazmand (Sepahan)\n\nAlireza Beiranvand (Persepolis), Amir Abedzadeh (Ponferradina), Seyed Hossein Hosseini (Esteghlal), Payam Niazmand (Sepahan) Defenders: Ehsan Hajsafi (AEK Athens), Morteza Pouraliganji (Persepolis), Ramin Rezaeian (Sepahan), Milad Mohammadi (AEK Athens), Hossein Kanaanizadegan (Al Ahli), Shojae Khalilzadeh (Al Ahli), Sadegh Moharrami (Dinamo Zagreb), Rouzbeh Cheshmi (Esteghlal), Majid Hosseini (Kayserispor), Abolfazl Jalali (Esteghlal)\n\nEhsan Hajsafi (AEK Athens), Morteza Pouraliganji (Persepolis), Ramin Rezaeian (Sepahan), Milad Mohammadi (AEK Athens), Hossein Kanaanizadegan (Al Ahli), Shojae Khalilzadeh (Al Ahli), Sadegh Moharrami (Dinamo Zagreb), Rouzbeh Cheshmi (Esteghlal), Majid Hosseini (Kayserispor), Abolfazl Jalali (Esteghlal) Midfielders: Ahmad Noorollahi (Shabab Al Ahli), Saman Ghoddos (Brentford), Vahid Amiri (Persepolis), Saeid Ezatolahi (Vejle), Alireza Jahanbakhsh (Feyenoord), Mehdi Torabi (Persepolis), Ali Gholizadeh (Charleroi), Ali Karimi (Kayserispor)\n\nAhmad Noorollahi (Shabab Al Ahli), Saman Ghoddos (Brentford), Vahid Amiri (Persepolis), Saeid Ezatolahi (Vejle), Alireza Jahanbakhsh (Feyenoord), Mehdi Torabi (Persepolis), Ali Gholizadeh (Charleroi), Ali Karimi (Kayserispor) Forwards: Karim Ansarifard (Omonia Nicosia), Sardar Azmoun (Bayer Leverkusen), Mehdi Taremi (Porto)\n\nGroup B table, fixtures and results\n\nMonday 21 November\n\nFriday 25 November\n\nWales vs. Iran (Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium; 10am; BBC/S4C)\n\nEngland vs. USA (Al Bayt Stadium; 7pm; ITV)\n\nTuesday 29 November", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Jamie Timson", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/06/06/oklahoma-gov-kevin-stitt-losing-court-battles-gaming-compacts-medicaid/7511165002/", "title": "Oklahoma Gov.

They say a similar event in July was so loud and raucous it traumatized livestock. But Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange says organizers haven’t violated any zoning rules. County Commissioner Dan Harris says he voted against a move to block the festival because opposition appears to be “anti-Latino” even if it isn’t. Harris says he doesn’t want to be part of that, particularly after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: A wildlife monitoring group is seeking citizen scientists to help track beluga whales off the state’s coast. The Peninsula Clarion reports the Alaska Beluga Monitoring Partnership is offering volunteers an opportunity to help scientists understand more about Cook Inlet beluga whales. The partnership is a collaboration of several organizations including Beluga Whale Alliance, Defenders of Wildlife and the Alaska Wildlife Alliance. Monitoring events are expected to take place between Aug. 14 and Nov. 15. Planned monitoring locations include Twentymile River and Bird Point near Girdwood, Ship Creek in Anchorage, and the Kenai and Kasilof Rivers. Officials say volunteers will learn about the conservation needs of Cook Inlet beluga whales and receive training on identifying and recording data on beluga distribution and behavior.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials have approved placing a “sanctuary city” measure on the ballot, but not without some pushback. KVOA-TV reports the Tucson City Council voted Tuesday night to allow the initiative on the November ballot, which could potentially lead to Arizona’s first-ever “sanctuary city.” Councilmembers were required to vote after the measure got more than the minimum required number of petition signatures. The initiative would add protections for people living in the U.S. illegally. Video shows a woman wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat repeatedly shouting that the initiative defies U.S. immigration law. The footage has since gone viral on social media because of an man in a green polo shirt laughing nearby. #GreenShirtGuy was the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter as of Wednesday morning.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor is asking lawmakers to approve $25 million for a new state grant program aimed at increasing access to high-speed internet in rural areas. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday announced the creation of the Arkansas Rural Connect program, which will provide grants to qualifying communities with at least 500 people to deploy high-speed broadband to residents. Hutchinson, who announced the program at a meeting of the Arkansas Sheriffs’ Association in Rogers, says he’ll ask the Legislative Council to approve $5.7 million for the program this year, and the remainder will need to be appropriated by lawmakers in next year’s legislative session. In May, Hutchinson released a plan to expand rural access to high-speed broadband by 2022.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Actor Danny Trejo played a real-life hero when he helped rescue a baby trapped in an overturned car after two cars collided at an intersection in the Sylmar neighborhood Wednesday. Video aired by KABC-TV shows Trejo at the crash scene. Trejo says he crawled into the wrecked vehicle from one side but couldn’t unbuckle the child’s car seat from that angle. He says another bystander, a young woman, was able to undo the buckle. Together they pulled the baby safely from the wreckage. The Los Angeles Fire Department says three people were taken to a hospital, and there were no life-threatening injuries. The 75-year-old Trejo, an L.A. native, is perhaps best known for playing the character Machete, originally from the “Spy Kids” series.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: State wildlife officials say thousands of tarantulas are expected to start their annual migration through the state soon. The Gazette reports the migration is expected to begin this month through early October. Officials say the Oklahoma brown tarantulas migrate through La Junta, about 176 miles southeast of Denver. Scientists say the majority of the spiders are 10-year-old males looking to mate with females hidden in Colorado’s grasslands. Officials say the peak time to view the migration is mid-September near Comanche National Grassland south of La Junta off U.S. Highway 109. Officials say tarantulas are mostly harmless to humans but have bites that can cause injury or allergic reaction and hairs that can be irritating to the eyes, mouth and nose.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The federal Office for Civil Rights has launched an investigation into the state’s policy allowing transgender high school athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify. The investigation follows a complaint by the families of three girls who say they were discriminated against by having to compete in track against two athletes who were identified as male at birth. They say that violates Title IX, the federal law designed to ensure equal athletic opportunities for females. The Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy follows a state anti-discrimination law that says students must be treated in school by their gender identification. Transathlete.com says Connecticut is one of 17 states that allow transgender high school athletes to compete without restrictions.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Everyone’s a critic, including Delaware Air National Guard officials who wanted nude images of Adam and Eve depicted in a 50-year-old mural by famed artist Jamie Wyeth to put on some pants. Someone apparently isn’t mooning over the huge, 10-by-30-foot mural that shows the bare buttocks of the Garden of Eden couple. It hangs on a wall of a building at the guard’s 80-acre base at the New Castle County Airport. The mural was created by Wyeth when he served with the Delaware Air National Guard during the Vietnam War. Air National Guard officials have had recent talks about possibly altering or covering up part of the artwork by the well-known painter. Wyeth is the scion of three generations of widely celebrated American artists, including his illustrator grandfather N.C. Wyeth and his late father Andrew Wyeth, one of the best-known painters of the 20th century.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: An internal review of D.C. public schools shows more than 30% of employees have expired background checks. News outlets report Chancellor Lewis Ferebee shared the review’s findings with parents Tuesday and in a letter Wednesday. The district launched the review in June after an employee of a private before- and after-school program allegedly kissed and fondled a 13-year-old student on multiple occasions. The district says it discovered the company didn’t conduct proper background checks. Ferebee says by the end of October, all after-school staff, school staff and central office staff will have active background checks. He also says staff will receive more training on how to spot and respond to sexual misconduct cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Gov. Ron DeSantis says the state is expanding its efforts to eradicate invasive pythons in the Everglades and is working with the federal government to get snake hunters to remote areas of Big Cypress National Preserve. DeSantis announced Wednesday that Florida will double its resources for python removal and that the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Agriculture have a new agreement to begin hunting pythons in 130,000 acres of state parks. He’s directing the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the South Florida Water Management District to work together to research ways to eliminate pythons and to make a python challenge an annual event instead of once every three years. The challenge awards python hunters who capture the most snakes, which have decimated native species.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMilton: A farmer says his beloved miniature donkey named Sammy was literally scared to death by this year’s Fourth of July fireworks. Now he and an animal rights group want Georgia to ban rockets that go boom. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote to Gov. Brian Kemp, House Speaker David Ralston and others Wednesday asking for a “Sammy’s law” limiting fireworks to the non-explosive, non-aerial varieties. John Bogino tells WGCL-TV that Sammy and his other farm animals are like pets to him. His pet donkey of 22 years died last month, and he says Sammy wasn’t his first animal to die because of fireworks. He says one of his horses fled explosions in late July several years ago and had to be euthanized due to severe injuries.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists have discovered that a growing pond of water inside a crater is being heated by the Kilauea volcano. The U.S. Geological Survey says temperature readings taken last weekend show that the pool of water in Kilauea’s Halemaumau crater, the former home of a popular lava lake, is about 158 degrees Fahrenheit. For the first time in recorded history, the presence of water in the crater was confirmed last week. Since then, scientists have found two other small pools of water nearby. The crater floor collapsed about 2,000 feet, and the lava lake disappeared last summer as Kilauea stopped erupting for the first time in over 30 years. USGS geologist Matt Patrick told the Associated Press it’s hard to determine how deep the magma chamber is beneath the bottom of the crater floor where the water was found.\n\nIdaho\n\nSpokane: A study by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has found that cougars kill more elk than wolves in the state. The Spokesman-Review reports the study found that wolves accounted for 32% of adult female elk deaths and 28% of elk calf deaths. The study found that cougars accounted for 35% of adult female elk deaths and 45% of elk calf deaths. The study published earlier this year in the Journal of Wildlife Management examined 15 years of data. The study also found that food availability and the severity of winter is the most important factor for elk calf survival. Idaho Department of Fish and Game senior wildlife research biologist Jon Horne says the findings are also likely applicable for Washington, Montana and Canada.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Officials are showcasing one of the most popular attractions of the Illinois State Fair. The butter cow was unveiled Wednesday afternoon at the fairgrounds. The sculpture has been a part of the state fair for almost 100 years. This year’s cow has been sculpted from 800 pounds of recycled butter. The cow stands near the word “Future” to incorporate the theme of the fair, which is “Building Our Future.” The cow is on display at the Dairy Building. Last year, hundreds of pounds of butter were sculpted into a cow by the same Iowa artist, Sarah Pratt. The base had “Land of Lincoln” written on it and included a stovepipe hat, as a nod to Abraham Lincoln. The fair started Thursday and ends Aug. 18.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Rainbow-colored streamers welcomed students back for the first day of classes Thursday at Cathedral High School, a show of support for a gay teacher fired from the Catholic school over the summer. The brightly colored streamers were a silent twist on a long-held Cathedral tradition to decorate “the hill” with toilet paper on the first day of school, but they still spoke volumes. The private high school has been embroiled in a debate over LGBTQ rights since it fired longtime teacher Joshua Payne-Elliott because of his same-sex marriage. Cathedral officials have said they only did so at the order of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, which began requiring employment contracts with “ministerial language” and morality clauses to be used at its schools four years ago.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: They’ve built it. Now they’re coming. Major League Baseball is headed to town in 2020. The Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees announced Thursday that the two teams will play an official big-league game at the “Field of Dreams” movie site Aug. 13, 2020. “It’s definitely exciting,” says Roman Weinberg, the director of operations for Go the Distance Baseball, which owns the Field of Dreams movie site. “There’s nothing more American than the Field of Dreams and America’s pastime.” The 1989 movie centers on the 1919 White Sox and Shoeless Joe Jackson. Jackson, who was banned by MLB along with seven of his teammates for his alleged role in the White Sox throwing the 1919 World Series, inspires a farmer, played by Kevin Costner, to build a baseball field. The site has since become a tourist attraction, with fans from across the globe flocking to the Iowa cornfield to see it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to impose what some tax experts say would be the nation’s most aggressive policy for collecting taxes on online sales, possibly inviting a legal battle. The Department of Revenue issued a notice last week saying any “remote seller” doing business with Kansas residents must register with the department, collect state and local sales taxes, and forward the revenues to the state, starting Oct. 1. It cites a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year allowing states to collect sales taxes on internet sales. Most states now have policies to collect such taxes, but almost all set minimum annual sales or transaction thresholds to exempt small businesses, according to groups tracking tax laws. Kansas is the first to attempt to collect the taxes without exempting any businesses, they said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Amid major legislative efforts to restrict or end abortion in the state, a new poll commissioned by Planned Parenthood finds a majority of likely voters in the commonwealth believe the procedure should remain available. Asked whether it’s important for women to have “access to all of the reproductive health care options available, including abortion,” 65% said yes, according to the poll. Also, 65% said they’d have doubts about a law that bans abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case legalizing abortion. Just 18% said they believe all abortions should be illegal – though another 37% said abortion should be allowed only in “extreme cases,” such as for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or to save the life of the woman. And 43% said abortion should be legal with some regulations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPride: A highway marker honoring blues singer and guitarist Buddy Guy has been recovered, months after it disappeared. News outlets report Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office received a tip Wednesday that the sign was at a person’s house in Pride, roughly 30 miles northeast of Baton Rouge. Lt. Craig Dabadie says investigators believe a driver ran off the road and knocked the sign off a pole in May. Someone else picked it up as a souvenir. The sign was posted along Louisiana 1, marking the spot where Guy recorded a music video. The marker honors the Louisiana native’s legacy in music. Rolling Stone magazine listed him at No. 23 on its list of the “100 Greatest Guitarists.” No arrests were made, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal program designed to help farmers suffering due to trade disruption is unlikely to assist the state’s wild blueberry growers. Maine is the sole commercial producer of wild blueberries in the United States. The industry has struggled in recent years with falling crop sizes and low prices to farmers. Maine Agriculture Commissioner Amanda Beal has called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to include the crop in its Market Facilitation Program, which is slated to provide billions to growers negatively impacted by foreign trade retaliation. But the USDA said in a statement that the program is intended for crops that aren’t easily used in school food programs or through food banks. Wild blueberries sometimes fill those needs. The agency says the blueberries remain eligible for other USDA assistance programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The news of Toni Morrison’s death led a west Baltimore artist to create his own version of an ancestral shrine. The Baltimore Sun reports that 50-year-old Ernest Shaw Jr. completed a mural of the celebrated artist and Nobel laureate by Tuesday, just a day after Morrison’s death. Shaw says he considers the death of the 88-year-old Morrison to be the acquiring of an ancestor. He says creating the mural was his way of pouring libations, a reference to a ritual used to honor ancestors and deities. He says there’s no death in dying as Morrison has just transitioned to now work with “the other side.” The spontaneous mural dedicated to “TONI M” covers a Graffiti Alley wall behind Motor House and took several hours to complete.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Ever since “Boston Strong” became a rallying cry after the Boston Marathon bombing, the idea of “strong” has become an inescapable part of how this country heals after tragedy. People mourning this past weekend’s mass shootings in Ohio and Texas have rallied around the slogans “Dayton Strong” and “El Paso Strong.” After many tragedies, the mantra has been used in social media posts, memorials, pins, stickers and other mementos. Massachusetts resident Christopher Dobens co-created the blue and yellow “Boston Strong” T-shirts that helped rocket the phrase into the national lexicon. He says the idea was inspired by Lance Armstrong’s Livestrong cancer foundation and the U.S. Army’s “Army Strong” slogan. Dobens says it’s heartbreaking to see so many places have had to adopt the “strong” mantra because of violence.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: State and federal agencies are gearing up for a celebration of Smokey Bear’s 75-year legacy of preventing forest fires. Smokey will join staffers with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other partners Friday at Straits State Park in St. Ignace. A family-friendly birthday party is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. It will feature a fire truck open house, displays of wildland fire equipment, fire-prevention games, refreshments and an opportunity to meet the iconic bear. Smokey has shared fire-prevention messages with the signature phrase, “Only you can prevent wildfires.” Debbie Begalle of the Michigan DNR’s Forest Resources Division says the slogan is still relevant. Nine out of 10 wildfires are started by people.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Department of Natural Resources has denied requests to reconsider the tailings dam permits that it issued for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The DNR said Wednesday that opponents did not raise any new issues that materially affect its 2018 decision granting the permits. The Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa and environmental groups asked the DNR to reconsider in light of tailings dam failures elsewhere. DNR Commissioner Sarah Strommen said in a statement that her agency studied the failures but remains confident in the safety of the PolyMet dam. The DNR issued its decision one day after the Minnesota Court of Appeals stayed a different permit for the mine, governing water pollution, pending a court investigation into potential irregularities in how state and federal regulators handled that permit.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Hurricane Katrina left lasting scars on the Hurricane Camille Memorial at the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer. The church reached out to the Biloxi Fire Department, which, in turn, reached out to Lodging and Leisure Investments for help in returning the memorial to its best condition in light of the storm’s upcoming 50th anniversary. Officials tell WLOX-TV restoring the tile mosaic is the greatest challenge in the project. Other work includes power washing and cleaning each name on the memorial’s walls. Camille’s 50th anniversary will include a memorial service at the memorial site at 5 p.m. Aug. 17. Afterward, a program will be held at the Seafood & Maritime Industry Museum at 6 p.m.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Attorney General Eric Schmitt says counting of untested rape kits in the state is nearly complete. Schmitt said Wednesday that 95.6% of law enforcement agencies and 98.5% of hospitals and Veterans Affairs medical facilities have completed their inventory of sexual assault evidence kits. Former Attorney General Josh Hawley began an audit of the backlog in 2017 after the Columbia Missourian reported Missouri had never done a statewide review of untested rape kits. Schmitt began a SAFE Kits Initiative in February and appointed Judge M. Keithley Williams to lead the effort to eliminate the backlog of sexual assault kits. The counting project received funds from the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Rape kits contain DNA samples and other evidence from medical procedures conducted immediately after an attack.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A man charged with assaulting a 13-year-old boy who refused to remove his hat during the national anthem believed he was doing what President Donald Trump wanted him to do, his attorney says. Attorney Lance Jasper told the Missoulian he will seek a mental health evaluation for Curt Brockway, a U.S. Army veteran who became caught up in the heightened animosity and rhetoric gripping the nation and convinced himself he was following the president’s orders. “His commander in chief is telling people that if they kneel, they should be fired, or if they burn a flag, they should be punished,” Jasper said. He said Brockway “certainly didn’t understand it was a crime.” Brockway suffered a traumatic brain injury in a vehicle crash in 2000 that has affected his decision making, and Jasper said he plans to raise that in his client’s defense.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The remains of twins who joined the Navy together have been returned to the city for burial, decades after their deaths on a battleship at Pearl Harbor. The Lincoln Journal Star reports two ceremonies will be held in succession Saturday at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery for Rudolph Blitz and brother Leo Blitz. There will be two flag-covered caskets, two 21-gun salutes, two invocations, two flags presented to their surviving sister, 93-year-old Lincoln resident Betty Pitsch. Her DNA contribution helped bring her older brothers home. The 17-year-old twins left Lincoln High to join the Navy in 1938 and had been stationed at Pearl Harbor for a year and a day before the USS Oklahoma went down during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack by Japan. Their remains were buried at a Honolulu cemetery and later identified after being unearthed in 2015.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A jumbo jetliner that sparked controversy at last year’s Burning Man festival when it got stuck in the desert for nearly a month has returned for this year’s event after organizers agreed to post a bond for the popular art installation. The Bureau of Land Management granted a special permit to the foundation that converted the 747 into a nightclub. Burning Man officials reviewed the Big Imagination Foundation’s plans before it transported the multi-ton aircraft last weekend to the Black Rock Desert, 100 miles north of Reno. Group leaders haven’t disclosed the cost of the performance bond. They get the money back if they comply with the permit. Critics say the plane severely damaged the playa floor last year when it dug holes into the soft alkali dust and got stuck.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has signed a bill to help the state’s dairy farmers. The purpose of the bill is to provide a way to support dairy farmers by buying specially labeled milk for an extra 50 cents per gallon. The measure creates a dairy premium fund that replaces the milk producers’ emergency relief fund. Money remaining in the fund after payment of the premiums would be available to promote the program. It’s anticipated that the premium milk will be available this fall.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: Two actors from the Netflix series “Orange is the New Black” visited federal immigration detainees at the Hudson County jail Thursday. Vicci Martinez and Emily Tarver met with two female detainees from Jamaica. The actors, whose show tackled issues of immigration detention and family separation in its final season, said they wanted to draw attention to the plight of immigrants in such facilities. The visit was organized by Freedom for Immigrants, an organization that aims to abolish immigration detention and was featured in the final season of the show, and First Friends of New Jersey and New York, a nonprofit that sends volunteers to visit immigrant detainees. After leaving the jail, Tarver recounted the story of the woman she met, a victim of domestic violence who sought help from the police and wound up detained, for four months so far, when her immigration status came into play.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSan Antonio: A federal agency is taking advantage of high water levels in the Rio Grande to help a tiny minnow listed as an endangered species. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation workers recently aided in creating more habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow on the Middle Rio Grande, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Reclamation crews worked from January to March to lower and widen the riverbank on the southern end of private property near Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. They excavated 46,000 cubic yards of dirt to create water channels where minnows could escape the fast-moving river. The tiny fish, listed as endangered in 1994, was once abundant throughout the Rio Grande Basin from Colorado to Texas and into Mexico. It’s now found only in a fraction of its historic habitat as the river system has seen dam building and the straightening of its once meandering channels over the past 150 years.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has approved legislation aimed at bolstering the health and safety standards for all pet dealers operating in the state. The bill signed Thursday calls for separate spaces for pregnant animals and requires all enclosures be cleaned daily and disinfected at least once every two weeks. “Pet dealers must be held to standards that will promote the safety, good health, and overall well-being of the animals in their care,” says a memo attached to the bill. Under the new law, which takes effect in 90 days, pet dealers are required to regularly groom animals to prevent matting and flea and tick infestations and provide animals with diurnal lighting cycles, which mimic natural, 24-hour light patterns. And any for-profit dealer selling, or planning to sell, at least 25 cats or dogs in a year must provide an annual veterinary checkup for each animal.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWake Forest: The city is being recognized for its commitment to preserving monarch butterflies. Wake Forest announced Wednesday that the recognition was awarded by Monarch City USA, a nonprofit organization that promotes the species and recognizes areas that work on recovering butterfly populations. The nonprofit group says that the butterflies rely on milkweed and nectar plants. The butterfly’s population has declined as the plants have dwindled. Wake Forest, northeast of Raleigh, features the plants that attract the butterflies at E. Carroll Joyner Park. The town has installed signs that identify the butterfly habitat and one noting Wake Forest’s designation as a “Monarch City USA.” The nonprofit says it’s the first in the state to receive the designation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two environmental groups who say regulators should have intervened in the location of an oil refinery near the state’s top tourist attraction, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, are taking their case to the state Supreme Court. The Public Service Commission last year declined to review whether the refinery could be built just 3 miles from the park in the western Badlands, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Regulators concluded the proposed $800 million Davis Refinery would be too small to warrant review under state law. The Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Dakota Resource Council don’t believe developer Meridian Energy Group is being forthright about the refinery’s size and asked a state judge to force the commission to hold a hearing. South Central District Judge Bruce Romanick refused in May, ruling that the PSC followed state law.\n\nOhio\n\nSpringdale: A long-standing community event is facing backlash on social media. A Facebook post promoting Springdale’s annual Goldfish Swim has garnered more than 3,500 comments, most outraged, since it was posted Aug. 1. The end-of-summer event has been going on for almost 40 years. More than 4,700 people have signed a Change.org petition to stop the event, saying it is “obvious” animal abuse. City officials take 1,000 feeder goldfish and put them in the Springdale Community Center Pool. Children under the age of 12 try to catch the fish with their bare hands, take them home and care for them. “No nets, poles or help from mom and dad. Bring a plastic bucket to take your new pet home,” the post about the event says. The event is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday at the Springdale Pool.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Police were justified when they fatally shot a black teenager who was naked and unarmed, an attorney for the city argues in a response to a civil rights lawsuit filed by the teen’s parents. The parents of Isaiah Mark Lewis contend in their federal lawsuit that Sgt. Milo Box and Officer Denton Scherman used excessive force and acted “unnecessarily and unjustly” when they hit their 17-year-old son with a stun gun and then fatally shot him April 29 after he allegedly broke into a home. In a response filed Wednesday on behalf of the city, attorney Taylor Clark denies that the city violated Lewis’ constitutional rights and says: “Lewis was justifiably shot by a service weapon after being ineffectively tasered.” “Edmond also admits that Isaiah Mark Lewis was naked and unarmed when he was shot and that verbal commands were given to Isaiah Mark Lewis prior to the shooting,” Clark wrote. The officers have been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Taylor declined further comment.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A judge has ruled that the state Fish and Wildlife Commission illegally reversed an earlier decision granting endangered species status to the marbled murrelet, a small seabird that nests in old-growth forests. Environmental groups say Oregon has sought to avoid protections for the bird, allowing clear-cut logging in its habitat. A spokeswoman for the wildlife department said it won’t comment on legal matters. The ruling was by Lane County Circuit Court Judge Lauren Holland in Eugene. Conservation groups said they petitioned the wildlife commission to list the marbled murrelet as endangered, and it voted to do so, concluding the bird was likely to go extinct. But the commission reversed itself without explanation. Holland said the commission was required to explain its reversal and failed to do so.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Philadelphia’s Music Alliance will induct musicians spanning a wide range of genres to its Walk of Fame, including The Philadelphia Orchestra, R&B group The O’Jays and ’80s rock band The Hooters. The class of 2019’s other honorees include Philadelphia socialite and philanthropist Dorrance “Dodo” Hamilton, who died in 2017; disco queen Evelyn “Champagne” King; and Jody Gerson, the current CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group and the first woman to run a major music-publishing company. Longtime rock-radio DJ Pierre Robert is this year’s dual Radio Row Award recipient and Walk of Fame inductee. The announcements were made Wednesday at the Independence Visitor Center. The group will be formally inducted Oct. 22 during a gala at The Bellevue.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo says the state will begin offering a gender-neutral option for residents to put on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates. Rhode Island will join the ranks of about a dozen other states already offering an option of “X” instead of the standard “M” or “F.” The option is in response to the governor’s conversations with the transgender and LGBTQ community. The Democratic governor says this is “just basic fairness” in order to ensure all residents are being recognized for who they are. The Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Health echoed the governor’s remarks. The governor adds that the biggest hurdle has been the implementation of the change. Residents could potentially see the option available within a year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAiken: Officials say the U.S. government followed a requirement to remove weapons-grade plutonium from the state. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said 1 metric ton of nuclear material has been shipped out of the Savannah River Site near Aiken. The U.S. Energy Department was ordered in 2017 to remove that much plutonium by January. Federal court records said half the plutonium was sent to Nevada. Wilson’s statement Wednesday didn’t say where the other half was shipped. South Carolina sued the federal agency after it halted a plan to turn plutonium once used to make nuclear weapons into fuel for nuclear reactors. The Energy Department owes the state $200 million in fines in part because 11 metric tons of plutonium remain at the site.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBurke: As this small town recovers from a tornado that destroyed its civic center and caused other extensive damage, some residents are asking why the community’s warning siren wasn’t sounded. The EF-1 tornado with 100 mph winds ripped through Burke on Tuesday night, ripping roofs off buildings and homes, uprooting trees and leaving the school building unusable for the beginning of classes. Two men suffered minor injuries when a garage collapsed. Gov. Kristi Noem visited the community Wednesday and called the damage “unbelievable.” Noem promised the state’s help in the community’s restoration efforts. Burke Mayor Thomas Glover says the siren is sounded when officials get notification of a tornado sighting or that one is imminent. Glover says that did not happen.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Add Glen Campbell to the list of late country music legends with a museum in their honor in the city’s downtown. Clearbrook Hospitality LLC announced plans Thursday to open The Glen Campbell Museum and Rhinestone Stage, a live music venue, at the corner of Broadway and 2nd Avenue. It’s slated to open in early 2020. Campbell died in 2017 at age 81 following an extended battle with Alzheimer’s disease. The 4,000-square-foot venue will feature immersive, interactive displays showcasing different stages of Campbell’s career. He was a studio musician in The Wrecking Crew; the singer of many hit records including “Rhinestone Cowboy” and “Southern Nights”; and a television and film actor. In the evenings, the museum will transform into live music venue The Rhinestone Stage, where national and local acts can perform intimate shows.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state’s annual back-to-school sales tax holiday is coming this weekend. The Texas Comptroller’s Office says the tax break begins Friday and runs through Sunday. Customers can buy most clothing, footwear, school supplies and backpacks – sold for less than $100 – tax free from a Texas store or from an online or catalog seller doing business in the state. The sales tax exemption applies only to qualifying items. The tax break does not include products such as jewelry, handbags, briefcases, luggage, computer bags, umbrellas, wallets and watches. The Texas sales tax holiday weekend started in 1999.\n\nUtah\n\nRiverton: Administrators from more than 60 schools in northern Utah gathered ahead of the first day of classes to assemble “care kits” for students in need. The Deseret News reports administrators from the Jordan School District met Wednesday to pack more than 2,400 kits, which include food, personal hygiene products and backpacks loaded with school supplies. Walmart donated the supplies. Event organizer Peggy Margetts said the kits help students in a discrete way and show students their school cares about their well-being. Students will receive the kits at the start of school. Administrators said they will keep some on hand to use during the year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets says the state’s cheese producers won 44 ribbons at the American Cheese Society’s annual awards competition. Officials say this is Vermont’s best showing yet. The results were announced at the society’s annual conference last week in Richmond, Virginia. Agriculture officials say five Vermont cheeses were finalists for the best in show. A total of 25 Vermont companies submitted cheeses to be judged among the more than 2,000 total entries. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott congratulated the state’s cheesemakers on their “impressive achievement.” He says their “commitment to excellence is helping Vermont grow its economy by creating jobs and further strengthening our great Vermont brand.”\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: Town officials are cracking down on an unsanctioned Virginia Tech fraternity they say is operating in violation of zoning rules. Blacksburg officials recently determined the house is being used as a base for the rogue frat Omega Alpha Kappa. Zoning Administrator Paul Patterson said frat activities at the house must stop. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the fraternity is not recognized by the university and was formed by members of Kappa Delta Rho when that chapter was suspended for violating alcohol policies. The fraternity has a history of trash citations and accusations that members made female guests at social events feel uncomfortable. The Roanoke Times reports the university has advised students to avoid the fraternity and seven others for their safety.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A $219 million property-tax levy that would abolish overdue fines in the Seattle Public Library system is heading toward approval. The Seattle Times reports the seven-year levy supporting the library system had 73% of the vote in returns Tuesday. The measure proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan would authorize additional property taxes and replace a $123 million library levy set to expire at the end of this year. The levy would collect about 12 cents per $1,000 of assessed property value in 2020. The additional library funding would support seismic renovations, new programs for children, more social workers, extended operating hours and the elimination of fines for overdue items. About $167 million would be used to maintain current services.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Public Port Authority board has decided to consider lease proposals and bids for the Heartland Intermodal Gateway Facility in Prichard. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the board made a motion Wednesday in Charleston to delay a possible public sale. West Virginia Transportation Secretary Byrd White says the board discussed selling it because of a funding shortage. Wayne County Commissioner Jeff Maddox says the county’s economy isn’t the best, but a sale for “pennies on the dollar” would be “a grave error.” The board will further discuss options at its September meeting. The $32 million facility opened in 2015 on 76 acres donated by Norfolk Southern railroad. It’s designed to move containers more efficiently by rail through a double-stack method while offering a cheaper alternative to gas-guzzling trucks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State prison officials say they illegally released information that could reveal whether inmates are in substance abuse treatment. The Department of Corrections said Thursday that officials responding to an open records request released records June 24 that contained 1,041 inmates’ personal identification numbers and locations. No names were released, but DOC officials say someone could use the numbers and locations to learn whether an inmate is at a substance abuse facility or receiving treatment. The agency says that information is confidential under Wisconsin law. Only two people saw the information, and they’ve since confirmed the data has been destroyed. DOC spokeswoman Molly Vidal didn’t answer emailed questions asking who received the questions and what information they actually wanted.\n\nWyoming\n\nMeeteetse: A ranch where black-footed ferrets were discovered in the 1980s is being preserved. The Nature Conservancy recently announced a conservation easement agreement to restrict the Lazy BV ranch’s 2,300 acres near Meeteetse from being subdivided or developed. The ranch is in the area where the ferrets were discovered in 1981 after they were thought to be extinct. The ferrets were used to start a captive-breeding program that has restored black-footed ferrets in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and elsewhere in the western U.S. Jim Luchsinger of The Nature Conservancy tells Wyoming Public Radio it had been a dream of the ranch owners to protect the ranch and bring ferrets back. The protected land is also home to greater sage grouse, mule deer, antelope and Yellowstone cutthroat trout.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/958572/france-karim-benzema-ruled-out-of-world-cup", "title": "'New blow' for holders France as Karim Benzema is ruled out of ...", "text": "France’s hopes of retaining the Fifa World Cup have suffered a major blow after Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema was ruled out of the entire tournament with a thigh injury sustained during training on Saturday in Qatar.\n\nWinner of the 2022 Ballon d’Or, awarded to the best men’s player in world football over the past year, Benzema felt pain in the “quadriceps of his left thigh”, the French Football Federation said in a statement.

World Cup winners Presnel Kimpembe, Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante are also missing from the squad.\n\nFrance head coach Didier Deschamps said he was “extremely sad” for Benzema, who had made this World Cup “a major goal”. Despite this “new blow” for the French team, Deschamps has “full confidence” in his group and they will “do everything to meet the huge challenge” that awaits them.\n\nDeschamps has until Monday to call up a replacement for Benzema.

Six days after the Cup-clincher on a once-in-a-lifetime beauty of a goal by Darren McCarty, after a gap-toothed Steve Yzerman hoisted the silver chalice, after coach Scotty Bowman skated a victory lap with the trophy and after metro Detroit celebrated wildly, yet peacefully, a limousine accident nearly killed defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, paralyzed masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov and severely injured defenseman Slava Fetisov. The tragedy cast a pall over Stanley Cup celebrations that slowly lifted as Hockey’s Holy Grail traveled the world — including its first visit to Russia and its second to Sweden — and popped up regularly in Michigan — from Clark Park in southwest Detroit to a charity softball game in Dearborn to a day of jet-skiing with The Captain on Lake St. Clair to William Beaumont Hospital to inspire the recoveries of Vladdie and Sergei in Royal Oak. Our 60-day series on the Red Wings’ run to their eighth Stanley Cup ends with how Stanley spent his summer vacation, whose names were engraved for posterity, how the Wings retooled for another Cup run and a personal remembrance from your author of these daily looks back at the two months that captivated Hockeytown like no other time.\n\nTo Russia with love: Nobody knew the backstory of the Wings’ Russian Five better than Keith Gave, a hockey writer at the Free Press from the early days of Mike Ilitch’s ownership through the 1997 Stanley Cup celebrations. A U.S. spy-turned-newsman, with as unique a resume as you ever will see, Gave traveled to the Russian in the early 1990s to document how the Wings managed to pry Sergei Fedorov, Slava Kozlov and Konstantinov from the Red Army and turn them into Red Wings. He returned in 1997 when Slava Fetisov, Igor Larionov and Kozlov took the Stanley Cup to Mother Russia for its first visit. (Konstantinov was unable to make the trip because of his injuries from the limousine accident. Fedorov spent his summer embroiled in a contract dispute and following Anna Kournikova, a 16-year-old Russian phenom, on the tennis circuit with stops at Wimbledon and the US Open.) More than two decades later, Gave wrote “The Russian Five: A story of espionage, defection, bribery and courage.” It came out in March 2018, a month before “The Russian Five” documentary premiered at the Freep Film Festival. Gave served as a writer and a producer for the project. He spent six years in the Army as a Russian linguist during the Cold War before 40-plus years working in the news industry, sports-talk radio and writing books. The following excerpt from “Stanleytown 25 Years Later” was condensed from “The Russian Five”:\n\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman still lingered on the ice moments after Steve Yzerman handed the Stanley Cup to Slava Fetisov and Igor Larionov for a celebrated lap around Joe Louis Arena by the distinguished former Soviet stars. And after they handed it off to teammates for their special moments, Fetisov made a beeline over to the commissioner for a spur-of-the-moment appeal that he knew would not be well-received.\n\nWhich probably explained why it was delivered more as a statement than a request.\n\n“Gary, you know I’m going to need the Cup in Moscow now,” Fetisov said.\n\n“No way. Absolutely not!” the commissioner responded.\n\n“Yes, this is my right after we win.”\n\nSince 1989, a tradition had evolved regarding the Stanley Cup celebrations after the champion was crowned. Each player on the winning team could have the trophy for a day or two, depending on seniority, which produced some unprecedented goodwill throughout North America as the Cup made its rounds. Fetisov knew long before he ever won it exactly what he would do with his time.\n\n“No, no, no!” Bettman said. “There’s too much crime in Russia now. It’s too dangerous.”\n\nMoscow, once among the safest cities in the world, was changing. The Communist KGB had lost its iron grip and its replacement, the FSB (Federal Security Service), was still finding its way in a rapidly changing Russian society under a succession of new leaders. Petty crime was prevalent, if not rampant, and serious crime was no longer uncommon.\n\nAdding to the country’s woes, the Russian mafia — a term used to loosely describe a collective of various organized crime elements — was growing exponentially in the absence of a strong police force. In other words, the NHL could not depend on civic law enforcement agencies to help protect the Stanley Cup.\n\nBettman knew all this, but Fetisov remained undeterred.\n\n“We can talk about it later,” he said, “but I need to take this Cup to Moscow.”\n\nAs it turned out, Fetisov got his wish — and Bettman’s anxieties were confirmed.\n\nStanley hits Red Square\n\nOn a dreary Saturday afternoon in August, a plane landed at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport carrying precious cargo. Fetisov was there with teammates Igor Larionov and Slava Kozlov to receive the Stanley Cup on its arrival in Russia. It was accompanied by several NHL executives and a large staff that naturally included Phil Pritchard, curator and self-proclaimed Keeper of the Cup from the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto.\n\nPritchard opened a large trunk, lifted the burnished trophy out of its velvety cocoon and handed it to Fetisov, who turned and walked toward a chain-link fence. On the other side were several hundred of his countrymen who had come to celebrate this moment. They poked their fingers through the fence to touch the silver chalice and stamp their fingerprints on history. Later in the day, the Stanley Cup was given a place of honor at the Central Sport Club of the Army, CSKA headquarters of the Red Army hockey organization that produced all five players in Detroit’s Russian unit.\n\nIt was the first stop of a whirlwind tour for the most famous trophy in sports making its first visit to Russia. And Steele, then 46, was intent on making sure it stopped by his club to mingle with some passionate hockey fans.\n\n“Do you think you could convince those guys to bring the Cup here?” Steele asked me as we were enjoying a perfectly legal Cuban cigar. “I promise it will be worth their time. I’ve got some big plans if they can make it happen.”\n\nHe said he was willing to spend $10,000 transforming his bar into a replica combining the best traits of Joe Louis Arena and Olympia Stadium, complete with banners commemorating the Stanley Cup seasons and retired numbers of former Wings greats, as well as a copy of the Cup.\n\nI winced. I never liked asking athletes or coaches for favors beyond a few minutes for an interview, or a special sitting for a photograph to accompany a story for the Free Press.\n\nThe following morning, sunny but unusually cool and breezy for mid-August even in Moscow, Red Square was bustling. Tourists were there to visit the Kremlin behind the tall, red-brick wall, snap pictures of St. Basil’s Cathedral, perhaps the most recognizable church in the world, where czars once read their edicts. People also came to pay homage at the tomb of V.I. Lenin, the inspiration behind the Bolshevik Revolution and the first leader of the USSR. But many others were there because they had heard rumors that the famous hockey trophy from North America might be making an appearance.\n\n“It’s amazing to think of the Cup in Red Square,” said Todd Carmichael, who was there with Monique Couture, both attorneys from Ottawa, Ontario, working for a firm in Moscow. They were armed with a camera, posing in the foreground while players held the Stanley Cup near Lobnoye Mesto — the Place of Skulls — where 16th-century czar Ivan the Terrible was said to behead his rivals.\n\n“I never thought we’d see the day,” Carmichael said. “And the people of Moscow — the ones who know about it — are really pumped.”\n\nAmong them was Andrei Chursakov, a sergeant of the Kremlin guards who held an autographed photo of Fetisov, Larionov and Kozlov as they posed with the Cup. He was mesmerized by the star power in the photo and lamented the loss of most of Russia’s best players to the NHL.\n\n“I don’t watch as much hockey as before,” Chursakov said. “All the players have left. But I watch the NHL now so I can follow these guys. I’ll put this picture up at home, and I will look at it all the time.”\n\nThe players walked from place to place around the square as Kozlov, by far the youngest of the three, lugged the Cup. Each wore his Wings jersey. Fetisov also wore some of his other cherished hardware, including several gold medals. People would stop and stare. Not at the big trophy, but at the men accompanying it.\n\n“Oh my God, is that Fetisov?” one would whisper to another. “Yes, yes! That is Fetisov. And there’s Larionov, too!” And the crowd behind them would grow. The men who had brought so much joy to Russian hockey fans — the world championships, the Olympic gold medals and now even the Stanley Cup from North America — were right there among them in Red Square.\n\nFetisov saw the beauty of the moment in the eyes of the people he met there, and he knew he was right to insist to the leaders of the NHL that they consent to this tour with the Stanley Cup.\n\nNearly two decades later, it was the smiles he remembered most about those days with the trophy in Russia.\n\n“I’m telling you,” Fetisov said, “from first moment when Cup arrived on the plane and we meet it on the field after an international flight, you can see the smiles on the people, on the customs people, the policemen, the people who work in airports. You see the smiles and you realize we bring so much happiness to so many people.”\n\nAnd no one was more moved than Aleksandr Maximovich Fetisov, Slava’s father, who was 65 when the Cup visited Moscow.\n\n“I am so proud of Slava because now he has all the hockey trophies there are to have,” the elder Fetisov said. “And now he’s walking through Red Square with the Stanley Cup!”\n\nFather and son posed for pictures with the other players and a few of us from the media at Lenin’s tomb. Slava Fetisov was in high spirits when I tentatively broached the subject of taking the Cup to The Hungry Duck.\n\n“What do you think about bringing the Cup to this wild and crazy club we’ve discovered here in Moscow, Slava?” I asked. And then I told him about the bar, its reputation and its fanatical owner.\n\n“Yeah, sure, why not?” he said.\n\n“Seriously?” I said, thinking of plenty of reasons why not. “What about the league? They’re going to fight you on it.”\n\n“We will be there,” Fetisov said. “I want to see this place. … Sometime after 11 o’clock, OK?”\n\nBy early that Sunday evening, The Hungry Duck looked a lot more like Joe Louis Arena than a notorious Moscow nightclub. And it was beyond packed. “The interest in the NHL is huge here,” Steele said, “because of the Russian players over there now. The Rangers were the most popular, but now it’s Detroit. It’s all about where the Russians are playing.”\n\nSteele had roped off a VIP area, where he joined reporters and a few of his friends as we waited for the Cup’s arrival. And waited. And waited some more. When 11 p.m. passed, I shrugged it off; players are typically late for things like this. Midnight came and went, and now I was wondering whether something had gone wrong. The crowd was getting a little restless, too, but no one was leaving.\n\nSteele began to speculate that NHL officials had pulled the plug on this visit, and it probably wasn’t going to happen. My head wanted to agree with him, but my heart wasn’t so sure. Let’s be patient. Fetisov was nothing if not a man of his word, and if he said he’d be here with the Stanley Cup, then he would be.\n\nFinally, well past 1 a.m., a murmur grew to a roar as Kozlov approached from a back entrance holding the most recognizable sports trophy in the world. Steele gave me a quick look and a nod, his eyes reflecting surprise, relief and unmitigated joy. The Stanley Cup was in his bar, brought to him by three stars of the team he idolized as a boy. Close behind Kozlov were Fetisov and Larionov, waving to a wildly exuberant crowd. Immediately behind them were several NHL officials, nervously scanning the room for trouble.\n\nThey were uneasy, obviously, because they had done their due diligence and knew that The Duck had a rather checkered reputation. Since Steele took over the bar on March 15, 1996, a few months after its doors opened, until the day he closed it on March 15, 1999, police had opened 256 criminal cases involving The Hungry Duck. Network television filmed inside the bar on 43 occasions, and three motion pictures shot scenes there. The Duck was raided frequently, and one night 79 patrons were arrested on suspicion of narcotics, according to Steele. All were subsequently released without charge.\n\nBut the night the Stanley Cup made its visit, Aug. 17, 1997, the massive crowd celebrated without an incident. The Free Press had supplied me with several hundred placards featuring its now iconic photo of the Russian Five in profile. It was used for promotional purposes in newsstands, and people were lined up at the VIP area getting them signed by three of those men in the picture.\n\nAmong them: those burly KGB thugs, those modern-day Cossacks hired to maintain order and protect the Cup and those who brought it. They were rendered speechless as these great former Soviet hockey stars signed the placards. The biggest, scariest-looking one of them all was sobbing like a baby.\n\nHome sweet home\n\nTwo days later, the Stanley Cup continued its tour at the Podmoskovie Sports Palace in Voskresensk, otherwise known as Hockeytown East, hometown of Larionov and Kozlov. They grew up a few blocks from one another in a community about a 90-minute drive from Red Square. The gleaming 4,500-seat arena with stained-glass windows also served as a veritable museum honoring the history of the local professional club, Khimik Voskresensk. The citizens of Voskresensk were all there to see Russia’s hockey royalty and this magnificent trophy they called Kubok Stenli.\n\nIt was an emotional moment, for Larionov especially.\n\n“The Russian players were a big part of the success in Detroit,” he said. “We got the trophy, and we decided this is the way. We were proud to bring the Stanley Cup to Russia and share the experience and history of the Cup with the fans who had been behind us for the past two seasons in Detroit.”\n\nLarionov’s entire family was there. So was Kozlov’s. Their former coaches and mentors were there, too, along with several hundred young hockey players among thousands of others.\n\n“It was a great feeling for us to share this moment with them,” Larionov said. “And it was very nice of the NHL to let us take the Cup home to Moscow.”\n\nThe Stanley Cup had made a glorious maiden tour around Russia’s capital city and suddenly, the chill between two long-standing global rivals felt a little warmer.\n\n“We start a new life in the history of the Stanley Cup,” Fetisov said. “We cross the border into the Russian Federation, and now it’s part of the culture in Russian sport, too.”\n\nNot back in the USSR: During the summer, each Red Wing got some personal time with the Stanley Cup, and it traveled everywhere from Sweden to the Soo. At the start of training camp at Traverse City, Helene St. James compiled the tales of Round Stanley. Here are a few of those answers:\n\nMartin Lapointe: He took the Stanley Cup to Ville Ste-Pierre, Quebec, near Montreal, where the town had a parade for him. He took the Cup to a hospital to show it to the father of his sister’s friend. Within a week of the visit, the man died of cancer. Lapointe also took the Cup to a camp for intellectually and developmentally challenged children. He had pictures taken of his 16-month-old son, Guyot, “buck naked and sitting in the Cup.”\n\nBrendan Shanahan: “For all the time I spent parading it around and holding it above my head in front of hundreds of people, my favorite memory was of a Saturday afternoon in Toronto, when I took it to my father’s grave,” Shanahan said. “For a Saturday afternoon, the place was totally empty. I just sat there with it. That was my favorite moment.” Shanahan’s father, Donal, died of Alzheimer’s disease several years earlier. Shanahan also displayed the Cup for hours for fans as part of an Alzheimer’s fundraiser in Dearborn, which included a softball game in which Wings players (and Zamboni driver Al S0botka) destroyed a media team (with the starting battery of Free Press beat reporter Jason La Canfora on the mound and sports editor Gene Myers behind the dish).\n\nSteve Yzerman: “We did a lot of everything,” he said. “When you have that trophy around, you don’t sleep a whole lot. We had a couple of parties with it. We had it out on Lake St. Clair. I think my favorite part was when we took it to Ottawa to my parents’ home and invited over some of the guys I grew up playing hockey with, some of my coaches on teams I played on when I was 10 and 11 that I haven’t seen in quite a while.”\n\nKirk Maltby: He took it to a couple of restaurants in Cambridge, Ontario, and had it at his parents’ house for a bit. He also took it to the pediatrics center at a hospital. He then had a party for 300 people. “That night, I slept with it in my bed,” he said. “I had to clean it because it absolutely reeked. I don’t want to tell you what time in the morning it was, but I was there with a little cloth wiping it clean. The guy who takes care of it was in bed long ago, so I had to take care of it on my own. I shined it up.”\n\nJoe Kocur: “We had some friends over, we partied all night, and when the sun came up, we went fishing,” he said. His favorite part of having the Cup was sharing it with friends in Michigan — and his beer-league buddies. “Just the chance to have all my friends who’ve lived in Detroit all these years, waiting for a Stanley Cup, to give them a chance to drink out of it, get a picture with it,” Kocur said. “The over-30 team I played with last year at this time, they were all over. We had a team picture taken with the Stanley Cup. The best picture I got was, when you win the Stanley Cup they give you a replica, it’s about 16 to 18 inches high, and my daughter was drinking out of that one and I was drinking out of the main one.”\n\nDarren McCarty: He threw a party for the Cup and took it home to show his parents and brought it over to the arena in Leamington, Ontario, where he played while growing up. He took it out with his buddies, who played in a band, and “jammed with it.” He also had a professional photographer take pictures of his son Griffin with the Cup.\n\nTomas Holmstrom: He took it to his hometown of Pitea, Sweden, which is close to Lapland. He showed it to friends and family and said it helped make for one of the best summers he had ever had.\n\nNicklas Lidstrom: He had a public viewing of the Cup in Vasteras, Sweden, where he played hockey before coming to Detroit. Then he took the Cup to a public viewing in his hometown of Avesta, where his parents still lived, and threw a party for the Cup. He posed for pictures with the Cup with sons Kevin and Adam. He then put Adam in the Cup and took pictures.\n\nChris Osgood: After arriving in Medicine Hat, Osgood had a big party. He took the Cup to the rink where he played as a youngster. He took it to his parents’ house and showed it to friends. “I had it for two days and got no sleep,” he said. “It was a good time. We had fun.”\n\nKris Draper: “My favorite moment was the excitement of seeing my dad hold the Cup,” he said. “For all the hard work and support your parents give you, to see the excitement they have with it was great. But there was a point in the night that I had to let my dad know that I was the one who won it. He was there for me, but I was the one who won it. I had it next to me in bed, but I didn’t sleep.”\n\nOff the ice: The Wings elected to chase a second straight Stanley Cup in 1997-98 with essentially the same roster. But there were plenty of bumps in the road and plenty of second-guessing on their decisions. They lost center Tim Taylor, the leader of the Black Aces, in the waiver draft. For grit, they added left wing Brent Gilchrist as free agent from Dallas, their top competitor in the Central Division. They planned bigger roles for Tomas Holmstrom, an awkward-skating Swedish wing who relished battling in front of the net; forward Mike Knuble, brought up late the previous season as part of the team’s commitment to get younger and bigger; and defenseman Anders Eriksson, a former first-round pick with size (6-feet-3, 225 pounds) expected to help fill the Konstantinov void.\n\nAll these moves, however, paled when compared to the Big Three, which involved the front office, the goaltending situation and the best two-way player. After ending his speech at the televised rally for season-ticket holders at The Joe with “we’ll come back next year and do it again,” Scotty Bowman made it official: He wanted to return for a fifth season. He signed a two-year contract to coach with a raise to nearly $1 million a season. But he lost his powers as director of player personnel. Those went to Ken Holland, who was promoted from assistant general manager to GM. His boss remained Jimmy Devellano, the direct link to Mike Ilitch. Bowman kept Dave Lewis and Barry Smith as his associate coaches.\n\nIn Holland’s biggest move, he traded Mike Vernon, the Conn Smythe Trophy winner for his stellar play between the pipes, and a fifth-round draft pick to the San Jose Sharks for a pair of second-round picks. After a 13-victory regular season, Vernon’s contract was to expire following the playoffs. But his 16 victories en route to the Stanley Cup triggered a clause that gave him an additional season for a little more than $2 million. Vernon, seemingly embroiled in continuous contract disputes during his three seasons in Detroit, wanted more money and more years. The Wings didn’t want to provide either, and they also did not want to face losing Chris Osgood (at $1.6 million) or Kevin Hodson (at $400,000) in the waiver draft. So, for the third time in their history, the Wings did what no other NHL team had done: Trade its No. 1 goalie after he won the finals. Detroit’s past three starters to win the Cup — Vernon (1997) and Hall of Famers Terry Sawchuk (1955) and Harry Lumley (1950) — were dealt before the start of the next season. Lumley was traded to Chicago to make room for Sawchuk, who won three Cups with the Wings. Sawchuk was dealt to Boston make room for Glenn Hall, a 24-year-old; and the latest torch was passed to Osgood, another 24-year-old. (Osgood was more than up to the task: He backstopped Cup-winning teams in 1998 and again a decade later and came within a victory of another Cup in 2009.)\n\nVernon’s contract issues were nothing compared to Sergei Fedorov’s. For more than a year, the Wings and Fedorov, a restricted free agent, remained far apart on a new contract for the former Hart Trophy winner who had notched 20 points in three straight playoff runs and played his best, and grittiest, hockey ever in 1997 despite a severe rib injury. He reportedly wanted $6 million a year; the Wings were willing to spent $4.5 million a year. So, he held out when training camp opened. He worked out with the Plymouth Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League, owned by Peter Karmanos, a Detroiter who also owned the Carolina Hurricanes and was a longtime rival of the Ilitches in junior hockey circles. Fedorov still was holding out when the Nagano Olympics rolled around in February, so he went to Japan and won a silver medal with the Russians. He told a Russian newspaper: “I made a decision in August and still haven’t changed it. They think they can break me with the help of some financial tricks, but they don’t know the kind of person I am. They don’t know who they are messing with.” Holland reiterated he had no intention of trading Fedorov for less than equal value. In stepped Karmanos. His Hurricanes signed Fedorov to an offer sheet for six years and $38 million. It included a $14 million signing bonus, a $2 million annual salary and $12 million in additional, automatic payments. Karmanos planted a poison pill to scare off the Wings: The $12 million in additional payments would be paid in $3 million installments — unless the team made the conference finals, in which case the entire $12 million was due July 1. The Wings had seven days to match the offer, try to work out a trade with Carolina or decline the offer and receive the Hurricanes’ next five first-round draft choices. Detroit cried foul, as Holland said, because the offer sheet was “structured to try to deter the Red Wings from matching.” The league agreed, but an arbitrator disagreed. Back on the clock after the Feb. 26 ruling, the Wings matched the offer right away. “It was an easy decision on the part of our ownership to make,” Holland said. “We’re a much better hockey club with Sergei.”\n\nFamous last words: Let me introduce myself. I am Gene Myers, a former sports editor at the Free Press, and each night for the last two months I have spent an hour or two or three or four trying to capture the day’s events as the Detroit Red Wings marched through the 1997 playoffs to end their 42-year Stanley Cup drought. It was a labor of love, despite much of it spent in the wee hours.\n\nAlong the way, I once again could feel the excitement, agony and glory of that incredible spring a quarter-century ago. And I hope that these 60 installments along the way come to be viewed as the definitive day-by-day account of the 1997 playoffs, to be dusted off and reposted at freep.com to mark the 30th, 35th, 40th, 45th and 50th anniversaries. By that time, I’ll be 87 years old, and 32 years from the day I retired after 32 years at the Free Press, the last 22½ as sports editor.\n\nToday’s installment ends this two-month project. But, really, I have spent more than six months over the past year immersed in the 1996-97 Red Wings, as a writer, editor and researcher. In 2021, my spring and summer were consumed spearheading “Stanleytown 25 Years Later,” the Free Press’ 208-page, full-color collector’s book that should be a must for all serious Wings fans. The book soon will be out of print, it’s only $29.95, I don’t have a financial stake in sales and the ordering information follows below.\n\nIn the rush to finish that book, I never found the time to do two things: 1. Properly thank the folks who lent hands as large as the downtown Fist statue. 2> Tell my hockey story, as I let several writers do in the book.\n\nSince this might be the last thing I ever write about these 1997 Wings, please indulge me as I do so now.\n\nI kissed the Stanley Cup — and kept my eyes open.\n\nI stood in the stands next to Joy Osgood, Chris’ mother, as Patrick Roy challenged her son to a fight. (She couldn’t bear to watch, but after her son landed a few blows, she was chanting like the rest of the arena, “Oz-zie! Oz-zie! Oz-zie!”)\n\nI even have scored goals in recreational games in an empty Joe Louis Arena — and imagined the cheers of 20,066 fans.\n\nMy hockey story, I suppose, begins when the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams in the late 1960s. I was born in cookie pollution— that is, just a bit downwind from a giant NABISCO factory in the northeast section of Philadelphia. My hometown suddenly had the Flyers, and hockey games were shown on a grainy UHF station. In my neighborhood packed with other Baby Boomers, we started playing street hockey but plastic equipment was scarce and costly. My first stick was a wooden field hockey stick my mother used in college, which was nicknamed The Club. Wooden sticks didn’t fare well on asphalt streets, so we also used roll after roll of duct tape.\n\nYou couldn’t get tickets to see the Flyers, so my parents took their four kids — I was the oldest, born in 1960 — across the Delaware River to watch the minor-league Jersey Devils of the old Eastern Hockey League. I recall their games featured fights galore. I was about 11 years old the only time I saw the Flyers in person. Somehow, we had seats in the front row in a corner, and my sister Terry was thrilled beyond belief when she could jump up and bang the glass when players collided along the boards. My mother told her to stop it, but she was uncontrollable and said she learned to do that watching games on television.\n\nI was devastated when, halfway through my eighth-grade year in 1973-74, my family moved to Kansas, a few miles from the border with Kansas City, Missouri. For starters, the Flyers were becoming a powerhouse known as the Broad Street Bullies. On the Great Plains, hockey telecasts were few and far between as the local affiliate would preempt the coverage provided by NBC and Peter Puck.\n\nIn May 1974, Kate Smith sang “God Bless America” in person at Philadelphia’s Spectrum, and the inspired Flyers beat Boston, 1-0, in Game 6 to become the first expansion team to win the Stanley Cup. In May 1975, the Bullies repeated, beating the Buffalo Sabres in six games, despite an overtime loss in the famous fog game early in the series. I remember watching part of the series on Kansas City’s PBS station, which begged for pledges between periods.\n\nAt least in the fall of 1974 the NHL expanded again with its 17th and 18th teams — the Kansas City Scouts and the Washington Capitals. Led by general manager Sid Abel, a legendary Red Wings player, coach, GM and later broadcaster, the Scouts were beyond horrible. They finished 15-54-11 for 41 points — the same additional number of points they needed to make the playoffs. They were outscored, 328-184. They started 0-8-1 before their first victory. They ended with one victory in their final 19 games.\n\nThe only highlights were a thrilling 7-6 loss at KC’s new Kemper Arena to the Montreal Canadiens, and a 3-1 record against the Capitals, who were even worse. Washington managed only 21 points with a 8-67-5 record and was outscored, 446-181.\n\nAbel’s Scouts somehow found a way to lose more games in their second season. They went 12-56-12 for 36 points — the same additional number of points they needed to make the playoffs. They were outscored, 351-190. From Dec. 30 until the season’s end, the Scouts won one game — yes, one game! — and, of course, it was against the Capitals. The Scouts finished their season on a 1-35-8 streak and then bolted for Denver to become the Colorado Rockies (and a few years later the New Jersey Devils, in time for Wayne Gretzky to call the franchise a “Mickey Mouse organization” that was “ruining the whole league”).\n\nWhen the Scouts arrived in town, a rink was built that they used for practices at times. Youth teams, recreational teams, figure skating and open skating also filled the ice time. For Christmas, I asked for skates and with my Bobby Orr signature blades, I tried to learn to skate before my 15th birthday. I failed.\n\nHockey pretty much didn’t exist for me for my last two years of high school and my five years at the University of Kansas. But in 1982, the Detroit Free Press selected this proud Jayhawk to be an intern on the copy desk in the Sports Department. For a summer, I lived in a dorm at the University of Windsor, commuted over the Ambassador Bridge and pretty much edited every Red Wings story. That’s because even though pizza baron Mike Ilitch had purchased the franchise from old-money Bruce Norris right as I arrived, my fellow copy editors were sick and tired of the Dead Wings era.\n\nA year later, the Free Press hired me right out of college. And I moved into my eastside Detroit flat in time for the Wings to draft a young centerman from the Ottawa suburbs whose name no one knew how to pronounce. And, once again, I edited the bulk of the Wings stories.\n\nThat fall, I made my first visit to Joe Louis Arena. I was not impressed. By the building. By the team. And by the number of fans urinating in the sinks in the men’s room between periods.\n\nBut Ilitch improved the warehouse on the waterfront and, eventually, the Winged Wheel on the ice. I was part of a season-ticket consortium. And I wondered whether the Wings ever would be capable of beating the Edmonton Oilers and winning their first Stanley Cup since 1955. But there were plenty of exciting moments as they failed, especially because of Steve Yzerman.\n\nIn 1988, right after the Calgary Winter Olympics, and nearly five years since I arrived in Detroit, I purchased a pair of cheap figure skates from Sears, signed up for a beginner class at St. Clair Shores Civic Arena and finally learned to skate — at least in one direction, with the on-again, off-again ability to stop. I played hockey for the first time on a frozen lake in Oakland County. I rented the ice in the wee hours at St. Clair Shores and we started playing weekly pickup games with minimal equipment, a sponge puck and goalies without stakes. It was a blast.\n\nA year later I formed a Free Press team in a twice-a-week morning league in Fraser. We were out of our league, like Harvard competing in the SEC. All our players were college graduates, college dropouts or in college, and we routinely were destroyed by a team of construction workers and a team proud to be comprised of the chronically unemployed. But Team Freep improved when I recruited an ex-con and a couple of GEDers and adopted the team-building motto I still use to this day: “younger, faster, dumber.”\n\nI was finally a hockey player. Not a great one. Not a good one. But a player. As a right wing, I could take up space on the defensive end and charge the net and knock home the occasional garbage goal on the offensive end. Years later, when we finally won a “title,” our cheap plastic trophies meant as much to me as Lord Stanley’s chalice.\n\nHockey fever was so rampant as the Wings improved in the 1990s that we started an annual game pitting the Free Press against the Detroit News. Note: I considered the News a worthy competitor but my Forever Enemy. One year, while I was camped in front of the goal, Bryan Gruley of the News put his stick between my legs and tried, ahem, to jostle my private parts. I spun around cursing, raised my stick as high as possible and delivered a vicious B.C. two-hander to the back of his knees. All hell then broke loose on the ice, and the benches emptied. Some of our bosses weren’t too happy; others were thrilled. Hours later at the Anchor Bar, as both teams drank to fun times, the video of the game clearly showed my dirty deed but not Gruley’s.\n\nWhen I became sports editor in February 1993, it wasn’t so easy to play in the mornings so I became a hockey nomad at night. I played until 2008 when a lingering neck injury — and a doctor’s warning that I probably wouldn’t sustain serious damage if I kept playing — caused me to retire. But I returned in January 2018 at the Ann Arbor Ice Cube, to run a team of free agents in a Friday night Never Ever league, the lowest of levels. In our first calendar year, we won two games — the second of which was via forfeit. But we slowly improved, finished first in a short summer league, finished first again when COVID-19 ended a season early and, up a level at long last, won the playoffs this past winter for a giant, cheap plastic trophy. April, 2022 (Oh, What a Night)! Alas, we are 1-2-3 as the spring season winds down. At least to improve this time, I didn’t need to go dumber, just younger and faster. Our team, called the Yaks, one of a series teams at different levels using the same name while playing out of The Cube, has included a concussion expert, a rocket scientist, engineers, IT specialists, nurses, researchers and one retired journalist.\n\nBack to 1997. I controlled a ticket consortium. So, I had my pick games.\n\nTime to dispel a myth: Sports staffers do not accept free tickets to games. By choice, I rarely spent much time in press boxes. I always figured there were three types of sportswriters there: 1) Those who would suck up to me in hopes of landing a job down the road. 2) Those who wanted to punch me because I didn’t hire them at some point. 3) My staffers who didn’t need their boss hovering over their shoulders. At one point or another, I had at least partial season tickets to the Wings, Tigers, Lions, Pistons, Michigan football and Michigan State football.\n\nIn 1997, my Wings tickets were about 10 rows up in a corner of the upper bowl. They were right next to two controlled by Osgood, which was how I met his mother the night of his 1998 slugfest with Roy.\n\nSo, naturally, I used the tickets in ’97 for the two most famous games in The Joe’s history: Fight Night at The Joe on March 26 and the Stanley Cup clincher on June 7.\n\nI have three other indelible memories from the 1997 championship season. The Saturday night the Wings won the Cup, I arrived in the Free Press’ downtown offices around 2 p.m., six hours before face-off. Staffers were working on an instant commemorative book that needed to be finished within 12 hours of the final buzzer if the Wings won the championship. At that point, we weren’t even sure what the book’s title would be. Around midnight, it became the original “Stanleytown.”\n\nIn the afternoon, I was checking on a preprinted edition that would be sold outside Joe Louis Arena if the Wings won. We used the big headline of “OUR CUP” and giant photo of Brendan Shanahan celebrating a goal in Game 3. I helped a bit with the book. And I planned out a 20-page commemorative section that would run Monday morning if the Wings won.\n\nThe game itself was thrilling and nerve-wracking. Despite a three-games-to-none lead in the series, hey, anything can happen and had to the Wings in the past four decades. Also, for my job, all the plans were in place for the Free Press’ coverage. I didn’t want to create a new plan for Game 5. And a clinching game at home was far easier to cover by flooding the zone with staffers than a clinching game on the road. No matter what, I did not want to series to return to my hometown.\n\nAnd thanks to Darren McCarty’s amazing goal, the Wings held on for a 2-1 victory. The atmosphere inside The Joe was insane. As it was once fans started heading outside. When I did, I grabbed piles of the “OUR CUP” special editions and started hawking them. Fans couldn’t buy ’em fast enough.\n\nWhen I made it back to the office through the sea of humanity, it must have been closing in on 12:30 a.m. A dozen or so folks were working on the “Stanleytown” book, editing stories from The Joe for freep.com and starting on Monday’s commemorative section. I worked on all three throughout the night and into the next morning. With the book finished, I worked exclusively on Monday’s section. When that finished around 8 p.m. Sunday, I started planning coverage for the rest of the week, which besides a parade now included a rally at The Joe. I finally left at 4 a.m. Monday — 38 hours after my arrival. Crazy, eh? No excuses during the playoffs, right? Who needs sleep, anyway?\n\nMy second indelible moment came near summer’s end, when Shanahan staged a celebrity softball game in Dearborn to raise money to fight Alzheimer’s, which had taken his father several years earlier. Fans lined up for hours for their chance to visit with the Stanley Cup. And, to my chagrin, way too many of them watched the softball game.\n\nNobody really wanted to see a game. Folks just wanted to see their Red Wings heroes up close and watch them smack the living daylights out of the ball. A team of “media celebrities” was supposed to be the Washington Generals.\n\nWhen a PR person requested that I play in the game, I declined and said nobody wanted to see me in action. The PR person agreed that was true but wanted me anyway. She also wanted Jason La Canfora, the rookie Wings beat reporter for the Free Press.\n\nOn the softball diamond, I figured how why. The PR person asked me to try to organize two dozen media members into a team. There were plenty of big egos involved. There were only I’s on this team. The PR person had one more request: The Wings wanted La Canfora to be the starting pitcher.\n\nSo, I did my best crafting a lineup and figuring out what body type looked like it could play which position. It was a waste of time: Nobody was very good.\n\nI put myself at catcher figuring it would be easier to watch my teammates from there and it would be best place to try to help La Canfora. He was just a year out Syracuse and had joined the Free Press late in the season and had impressed everyone, including the Wings, which is why they wanted to light him up. It was a badge of honor.\n\nLa Canfora has had a spectacular 25-year career that started in Detroit. He moved to the Washington Post to cover the football team no longer called the Redskins, then the NFL Network and later CBS Sports. He hosted a radio show, too.\n\nFor a quarter-century, La Canfora has been a triple threat — with the written word, on radio and on television. He’s all those things. He wasn’t a pitcher, though.\n\nGiven time for a quick warm-up, he struggled to come within several feet of home plate. The Wings were good-naturedly razzing him. His first several pitches weren’t in the same time zone. When Wings came to the plate, I all but begged them to swing at anything close. And they did.\n\nThey bashed the ball, even Zamboni driver Al Sobotka, which thrilled the fans. Somehow the media celebs got out of the inning down only by double digits. The Wings did the same thing in the second inning. Everybody was having fun, or so it seemed.\n\nMy embarrassment came after I singled and then tried to advance to third base on another hit, a rarity for my team. Halfway between second and third my uniform pants, which were several sizes too big, started falling down. Way down. I yanked them up and kinda hopped into third safely. The PA announcer was kind to point out my wardrobe malfunction to the laughing fans. Thank goodness for compression shorts!\n\nThe following inning brought a confrontation with rookie defenseman Aaron Ward. At 6-feet-2 and 210 pounds, he towered over me. He had made a reputation in the Stanley Cup playoffs for delivering big open-ice hits. He had a bit of a cult following despite coach Scotty Bowman playing him sparingly.\n\nFor reasons I failed to understand, Ward had not swung at a pitch in his two previous at-bats. I figured he was waiting for something in his zone to drive a country mile. I politely told Ward that La Canfora was unlikely to throw a pitch anywhere near the plate, that he should cream any pitch he could reach and that the fans weren’t there to watch him walk.\n\nWard just glared at me — and walked again on four pitches. Whatever, I thought. And I didn’t give it another thought.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Ward score. No surprise there. How he scored shocked me. He slowed down as he neared the plate, stomped both feet on it and growled at me, “Take that, (expletive).” (I was taught at KU’s journalism school to never use this word in print. Let’s just say the first part includes an m, an o, a t, an h, an e and a r.) He wasn’t joking around. He was furious with me.\n\nWhen I figured that out, I remembered saying “you’re kidding, right?” and backing away to diffuse the situation. I am certain parts of me were trembling.\n\nWhen Shanahan came to bat, he asked what was up between Ward and me. I told him about his at-bat and his stomp, and Shanahan called Ward something I won’t print, apologized on behalf of the Wings and thanked me for organizing the media celebrities. I thanked him for the invite, for raising money for a charity and for sharing the Stanley Cup with the masses.\n\nBetween innings, I’m happy to report, I saw Shanahan giving the business to Ward.\n\nAfter that, Myers and La Canfora retreated to the bench for the remainder of the biggest rout since the Christians versus the Lions.\n\nMy third indelible moment came not long after the softball game. The Ilitches allowed the Stanley Cup to go on visits to downtown businesses and someone, somehow had gotten the Free Press on the list. The Keeper of the Cup placed the trophy on a table in a large room, and my coworkers waited their turn to check it out up close and to snap a few photos. I waited my turn with Steve Schrader, an assistant sports editor and the author of the Octometer. Schrader wasn’t tall, but he was solidly built, an offensive lineman back in his high school days. He didn’t see the Keeper hovering nearby, so he reached down and hoisted Lord Stanley’s chalice. I snapped a photo. Then he turned to hand Hockey’s Holy Gail to me, and I held it in front of my chest.\n\nYes, it was heavy. Heavier than I expected. Plenty of places listed its weight at 35 to 37 pounds. John Wharton, the Wings’ trainer at the time, insisted he weighed the Cup twice and it checked in at 32 pounds. In addition, the trophy required a wingspan wider than mine.\n\nI used all my (limited) might to lift Stanley over my head. For maybe a few seconds. I felt like I’d drop it — but not add to its lore — if I couldn’t reach the table ASAP. Fortunately for me and the Hockey Hall of Fame, someone else positioned himself to receive the Cup. The handoff occurred not long before the Keeper, probably with a sixth sense about his job, reappeared and demanded the Cup go back on the table.\n\nIn 2008, when the Wings won their 11th Stanley Cup, I ran afoul again with the Keeper. Before the Cup was put on display for employees, the Free Press publisher, a Jayhawk like me, invited a couple other Jayhawks for a private audience and photos. That’s when I kissed the Cup. And that’s when I put two books written after the 2002 Cup into Stanley’s bowl and snapped a few photos. The Keeper was livid and said the Hall of Fame did not allow the Cup to be used for promotional purposes. (Unless, of course, you are a big-time sponsor.) I swore I would never do that. And I didn’t. I just framed a photo and put it in my office. (It makes its public debut right now!)\n\nAin’t hockey the best sport? You betcha. That’s why I’ll be on the ice for a Yaks game at 11:55 p.m. Friday in Ann Arbor. That’s why I’ve devoted months to the 1996-97 Red Wings.\n\nAnd that’s why I need to thank a village of people. It all starts with Free Press sports editor Kirkland Crawford, who began working in my Sports Department while at Detroit’s Renaissance High and who greenlighted “Stanleytown 25 Years Later” and the 60 installments about the 1997 playoffs. Then there’s deputy sports editor Ryan Ford, the best designer and headline writer in the business. And there’s my cross-country skiing buddy and fellow retiree, Owen Davis, the ace copy chief in an era in which so many don’t value editing.\n\nI relished researching all the great writing and reporting from the Free Press in 1997, led by Keith Gave, Jason La Canfora, Helene St. James, Mitch Albom, Steve Schrader and the late Drew Sharp. The photo all-stars were Mary Schroeder and Julian H. Gonzalez — each of whom has been inducted into the Michigan Journalism Hall of Fame — with plenty of support from Gabriel B. Tait and Kirthmon F. Dozier.\n\nAlso deserving of shoutouts are Marlowe Alter, Tyler J. Davis, Andrew Hammond, Adam Engel, Bill Dow and Beth Myers.\n\nMost of all, I’m typing this while giving a standing ovation to the Free Press readers who return often — online and in print — for their Red Wings updates. And to those of you who already have purchased “Stanleytown 25 Years Later.”\n\nHere’s hoping we don’t have to wait until 2050 for the Spirit of Detroit to don a giant Winged Wheel jersey again. I desperately want to do another championship book.\n\nUntil then … Go, Yaks!\n\nRelive the glory: The Free Press has crafted a 208-page, full-color, hardcover collector’s book with fresh insights and dynamic storytelling about the 1996-97 Wings. It’s called “Stanleytown 25 Years Later: The Inside Story on How the Stanley Cup Returned to the Motor City after 41 Frustrating Seasons.” It’s only $29.95 and it’s available at RedWings.PictorialBook.com. (It’ll make a great Father’s Day gift for the Wings fanatic in your life!)\n\nMore to read: Another new Wings book arrived in April from Keith Gave, a longtime hockey writer for the Free Press in the 1980s and 1990s: “Vlad The Impaler: More Epic Tales from Detroit’s ’97 Stanley Cup Conquest.” It is available through Amazon and other booksellers and a portion of the proceeds is earmarked for the Vladimir Konstantinov Special Needs Trust. (Plenty of Gave’s prose also appears in “Stanleytown 25 Years Later.”)\n\nEven more to read: Red Wings beat reporter Helene St. James, who helped cover the 1997 Stanley Cup run, recently wrote “The Big 50: The Men and Moments That Made the Detroit Red Wings.” Featuring numerous tales about the key figures from 1997, “The Big 50” is available from Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Triumph Books.

And despite reports that executives and investors have been working to bring Altman back, the former CEO announced Monday that he will join Microsoft to help lead a new AI research team.\n\nGreg Brockman, another OpenAI co-founder and former president who quit in solidarity with Altman, is also joining Microsoft, according to a post on X, formerly Twitter, from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Hundreds of other employees are now threatening to quit to join Microsoft as well.\n\nFor those who have yet to catch up on the shakeup at OpenAI, here’s what we know so far:\n\nWhy was Altman ousted?\n\nOpenAI’s board of directors on Friday announced that Altman would depart as CEO and leave the board.\n\nA blog post said the board found Altman “was not consistently candid in his communications,” which was “hindering (the board’s) ability to exercise its responsibilities.” Reporting from the Washington Post and CNN found that tensions arose from Altman's push to commercialize the company's product, while the board wanted to move forward with the technology more cautiously.\n\nThe board also said Friday that Brockman would be stepping down as chairman of the board but keep his role at the company. Brockman quit his job at OpenAI soon after the announcement.\n\nWedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives wrote that the \"train wreck situation at OpenAI\" created by its four-person board may go down in tech history as one of the biggest debacle decisions in the history of Silicon Valley,\" according to a Sunday note.\n\nWho are the board members of OpenAI?\n\nNow that Altman and Brockman are out, the OpenAI Nonprofit board consists of chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and non-employees Adam D’Angelo, CEO of Quora; technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley; and Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s Helen Toner.\n\nHow did OpenAI staff react?\n\nHundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to resign over the board’s actions, leaving the future of the AI company on shaky ground.\n\nAxios and Wired reported that more than 500 of OpenAI's 700-plus employees have signed a letter urging the company’s board to resign. The employees threatened to join the newly-announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Altman and Brockman, noting that Microsoft “has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join.” Microsoft is OpenAI’s biggest stakeholder with a roughly $13 billion investment.\n\n“We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees,” the letter reads.\n\nThe employees threatened to quit “imminently” unless all current board members resign, two new lead independent directors are appointed, and Altman and Brockman are reinstated.\n\nOpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who is part of the board that ousted Altman, is one of the 505 employees to sign the letter. Sutskever on Monday said he regrets his participation in the board’s actions and “never intended to harm OpenAI,” according to a post on X.\n\n“I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company,” he wrote.\n\nWill Sam Altman return?\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported that OpenAI’s board was having second thoughts about the firing after receiving pushback from investors. Altman on Sunday posted a photo of himself to X wearing an OpenAI visitors’ badge at the company's San Francisco headquarters.\n\nThe New York Times reported that OpenAI’s board told employees Sunday night that Altman would not be returning to his job. But the Verge on Monday reported that Altman and Brockman are still willing to return if the remaining board members step aside.\n\nWho is Emmett Shear, the interim CEO of OpenAI?\n\nOpenAI’s board of directors on initially named Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, as interim CEO. The board reversed course on Monday, naming Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear as interim CEO.\n\nShear has noted his concerns about AI and is in favor of a slowdown in advancing AI technology.\n\n\"We can't learn how to build a safe AI without experimenting, and we can't experiment without progress, but we probably shouldn't be barreling ahead at max speed either,\" he said in a September post on X.\n\nShear said Altman’s removal had been “handled very badly,\" which \"seriously damaged our trust.” He plans to hire an independent investigator to generate a report on Altman's firing.\n\n“I will drive changes in the organization − up to and including pushing strongly for significant governance changes if necessary,” he said. “I will be rolling these out as they become clear over the 30-day period. OpenAI’s stability and success are too important to allow turmoil to disrupt them like this.”\n\nShear also denied that the board removed Altman over disagreements on safety.\n\n\"I'm not crazy enough to take this job without board support for commercializing our awesome models,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/technology/961823/sam-altman-profile-openai-ceo-leading-ai-revolution", "title": "Sam Altman: the OpenAI CEO leading the AI revolution | The Week", "text": "The launch of ChatGPT last November propelled OpenAI, and its co-founder and CEO Sam Altman, into the global spotlight.\n\nThe generative AI tool “had the world’s imagination like nothing in tech’s recent history”, said The Atlantic, and, for Altman, this was “a moment of triumph”, despite the possible dangers the technology could pose.\n\nOpenAI was created as a non-profit with the “noble” aim of developing AI while making sure “it doesn’t wipe out humanity”, said Sky News.

For that reason, he’s advocated for government regulation, which would be “critical to mitigate the risks”.\n\nWho is Sam Altman?\n\nAltman grew up in St Louis, Missouri, where he learned to program and “disassemble” a Macintosh when he was eight years old, said Tad Friend in The New Yorker. The Mac “became his lifeline to the world”, and Altman, who came out as gay to his parents at 16, told the publication that “finding AOL chat rooms was transformative”.\n\nHe attended John Burroughs School and “changed the whole school”, according to Madelyn Gray, the college counsellor, when he “addressed the whole community, announcing that he was gay” after a Christian group boycotted a school assembly about sexuality. He asked whether the school wanted to be “a repressive place or one open to different ideas”.\n\nAltman made his way to Stanford to study computer science, but dropped out after two years. He gave up “a precious spot at one of America’s top universities”, said Sky News, which amounts to a “rite of passage for the country’s leading tech entrepreneurs”.\n\nHis first venture was a smartphone app called Loopt, founded in 2005, which let people share their real-time location with others. He raised £30 million with the aid of start-up accelerator Y Combinator. This is an “aggressively geeky” three-month boot camp, run twice a year, in how to become a “‘unicorn’ – Valleyspeak for a billion-dollar company”, according to The New Yorker. Altman became a partner of Y Combinator in 2011, then its president in 2014. He then turned his attention to his next start-up, OpenAI, the following year, and stepped back from Y Combinator in 2019.\n\nWhy did Altman co-create OpenAI?\n\nAltman created OpenAI with Musk in 2015 as a “hedged bet on the end of human predominance”; it was born of “Musk’s conviction that an AI could wipe us out by accident”.\n\nLaunching a start-up back then was “akin to assembling an alt-rock band in 1996 or protesting the Vietnam War in 1971 – an act of youthful rebellion gone conformist”, said Friend in The New Yorker. “Like everyone in Silicon Valley, Altman professes to want to save the world; unlike almost everyone there, he has a plan to do it,” Friend added.\n\nUnder his leadership, OpenAI is no longer a non-profit, and has an estimated value of $29 billion, according to Sky News, thanks to the “remarkable success of its generative AI tools” including ChatGPT and DALL-E.\n\nWhat next for Altman and OpenAI?\n\n“For all the wonder” generative AI is providing, it’s matched by concerns including “spreading disinformation or making jobs redundant”. Governments are also “scrambling” to effectively regulate a technology that “seems destined to change the world forever”. These are also among Altman’s “worst fears”. For this reason, he “appears keen to be a willing participant” in the responsible use of AI and how regulation should be shaped.\n\nThe Silicon Valley CEO, however, sees releasing the technology as “a great public service”, said The Atlantic. He also added that “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop”. This is something he “doesn’t seem to be too stressed about”, said The Byte, and says a “world with AI will be better – though it sounds like he isn’t quite sure what that world will look like”.\n\nAltman is preparing for what comes next through other ventures including Tools for Humanity, which recently launched a new cryptocurrency project, Worldcoin. The aim, according to Wired, is to create a global ID system that will “help reliably differentiate between humans and AI, in preparation for when intelligence is no longer a reliable indicator of personhood”.", "authors": ["Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Theara Coleman", "Justin Klawans", "Devika Rao", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Elliott Goat", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2023/11/22/sam-altman-returns-to-openai/71671153007/", "title": "AI drama over as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reinstated with help ...", "text": "Ousted co-founder and CEO Sam Altman has been reinstated at OpenAI, the latest twist in the headline-grabbing power struggle that jeopardized the future of the buzzy artificial intelligence company and captivated the tech world.\n\nOpenAI announced an agreement to bring back Altman while three of the four board members who abruptly pushed him out are leaving.\n\nAn interim board has been tapped, led by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, and includes former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo.

He also co-founded free online dating platform OkCupid in 2011.\n\nThe OpenAI bosses’ stated aim is “to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) – by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work – benefits all of humanity”. OpenAI’s “primary fiduciary duty is to humanity”, they emphasise in the company charter.\n\nThis charter is “so sacred that employees’ pay is tied to how well they adhere to it”, said MIT Technology Review’s AI editor Karen Hao. Although “the purpose is not world domination”, she wrote, “AGI could be catastrophic without the careful guidance of a benevolent shepherd”.\n\nOpenAI promotes itself as this shepherd and said the company was created as a non-profit in order to “build value for everyone rather than shareholders”. In a statement announcing the launch back in 2015, OpenAI also vowed to “freely collaborate with others across many institutions” and to “work with companies to research and deploy new technologies”.\n\nDoes OpenAI live up to its claims?\n\nAn investigation by MIT Technology Review uncovered “a misalignment between what the company publicly espouses and how it operates behind closed doors”, according to Hao. Former and current employees – many of whom reportedly “insisted on anonymity because they were not authorised to speak or feared retaliation” – were said to have portrayed a company “obsessed with maintaining secrecy, protecting its image, and retaining the loyalty of its employees”.\n\nEven Musk has criticised OpenAI after quitting the board of directors 2018, a decision that the company said was to “eliminate potential future conflict” with the AI goals of Tesla.\n\nIn 2020, Musk tweeted that his confidence in OpenAI was “not high” when it came to safety. “OpenAI should be more open imo,” he wrote in response to MIT Technology Review’s investigation.\n\nIn a Twitter post shortly after the launch of ChatGPT, he wrote: “Need to understand more about governance structure & revenue plans going forward. OpenAI was started as open-source & non-profit. Neither are still true.”\n\nAre there any other issues with ChatGPT?\n\nPlenty, according to Gizmodo. The technology threatens to “kill the college essay and lead to other academic dysfunction”, “make human writers obsolete”, “generate factually inaccurate news articles (already happened)” and “cause a disinformation typhoon”. Concerns have also been raised that the easily accessible AI system could “democratise cybercrime” and help to “fuel easy malware creation”, said the site, as well as “get loads of people fired”.\n\nOpenAI has faced further criticism after Time magazine reported that the company “used outsourced Kenyan labourers earning less than $2 per hour to make the chatbot less toxic”. Workers allegedly said there were “mentally scarred” after sifting through graphic images and disturbing text from the dark web to help build a tool to help build a tool that tags problematic content.\n\nAfter the contractor cancelled the deal early, OpenAI insisted that “we take the mental health of our employees and those of our contractors very seriously”.\n\nBut the Partnership on AI, a coalition of AI organisations to which OpenAI belongs, told Time that “despite the foundational role played by these data enrichment professionals, a growing body of research reveals the precarious working conditions these workers face”.\n\n“This may be the result of efforts to hide AI’s dependence on this large labour force when celebrating the efficiency gains of technology,” the coalition said. “Out of sight is also out of mind.”", "authors": ["Asya Likhtman", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Theara Coleman", "Harold Maass", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "Devika Rao", "Elliott Goat", "Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2023/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/tech/elon-musk-twitter/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk has taken control of Twitter and fired its top executives ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk has completed his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, a source familiar with the deal told CNN Thursday, putting the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nMusk fired CEO Parag Agrawal and two other executives, according to two people familiar with the decision. Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/football/chelsea-thomas-tuchel-sacked-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Thomas Tuchel sacked as Chelsea manager after disappointing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChelsea has sacked manager Thomas Tuchel after a run of disappointing results this season.\n\nThe decision was made by the club’s new owners and follows a 1-0 defeat to Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\nIn a short statement posted to the club’s official website, Chelsea thanked Tuchel for his efforts but said it was looking to move in a new direction.\n\n“As the new ownership group reaches 100 days since taking over the Club, and as it continues its hard work to take the club forward, the new owners believe it is the right time to make this transition,” the statement read.\n\n“Chelsea’s coaching staff will take charge of the team for training and the preparation of our upcoming matches as the Club moves swiftly to appoint a new head coach.\n\n“There will be no further comment until a new head coach appointment is made.”\n\nTuchel took charge of Chelsea in January 2021, a day after Frank Lampard was let go by the Premier League outfit.\n\nThe German went on to win the Champions League in his first season but has struggled so far this campaign, with Chelsea dropping points in three of its six league games.\n\nSome fans were particularly concerned after watching Chelsea lose 3-0 to Leeds United in August, a result that piled pressure of Tuchel and his team.\n\nResults and performances continued to disappoint with Tuesday’s shock defeat in the Champions League proving the final straw.\n\nA new ownership group, led by American investor Todd Boehly, bought the club in a deal worth more than $5 billion earlier this year after Roman Abramovich put it up for sale following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBoehly owns stakes in the MLB’s Los Angeles Dodgers, the NBA’s Los Angeles Lakers and the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/uk/buckingham-palace-resignation-intl/index.html", "title": "Buckingham Palace official quits after asking Black charity CEO ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn honorary member of Buckingham Palace has resigned and apologized after a Black charity founder said she was questioned about whether she was really British at a royal reception on Tuesday.\n\nThe guest, Ngozi Fulani, is the CEO of Sistah Space, an organization that provides specialist services to women of African and Caribbean heritage affected by abuse.\n\nFulani was attending a royal function on domestic abuse organized by the Queen Consort on Tuesday evening when she said a member of staff began a line of questioning that the palace called “unacceptable and deeply regrettable.”\n\nFulani said that the person persistently asked about her heritage and would not accept that she was a British national.\n\nSistah Space shared a rough transcript of the conversation on Twitter on Wednesday.

We prefer that this be handled kindly,” Sistah Space said.\n\nBritish media have identified the Buckingham Palace official as Lady Susan Hussey, who served as the late Queen Elizabeth II’s lady in waiting for more than 60 years and is a godmother to the Prince of Wales.\n\nCNN has reached out to Ngozi Fulani and Buckingham Palace for further comment from the household member in question.\n\nA Buckingham Palace spokesperson acknowledged the incident and said the palace was taking the situation “extremely seriously.”\n\n“Unacceptable and deeply regrettable comments have been made.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (formerly Facebook) has also slashed its headcount in the run-up to Christmas as the global financial outlook continues to cause alarm in the sector.\n\nWhat has happened?\n\nAround 45,000 tech employees have been laid off as of October this year, reported Firstpost. “While some tech giants are going all out laying off their employees, many have frozen or confirmed a slowdown in hiring to cut budget spending in anticipation of a recession.”\n\n“Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook… announced it would eliminate 13% of its workforce, amounting to more than 11,000 jobs”, said Rob Garver at VoA.\n\nBut despite the bad news for employees, “Meta’s share price, which had plunged from more than $345 last November to below $89 last week, got a boost from the news.” Shares in Meta jumped back up above $100.\n\nAfter cutting thousands of jobs, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company was “keeping email addresses active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell”. His gesture “did little to ease the pain”, said Katie Prescott in The Times, with words like “brutal”, “heartbreaking” and “devastating” echoing “across the social media posts of fired staff”.\n\nElon Musk, meanwhile, cut 3,750 jobs from Twitter following his takeover on 28 October. While this represents fewer redundancies, it is a comparatively larger proportion of the company’s workforce, at 50%.\n\nThe widespread job cuts at two of America’s largest tech companies follow a trend established earlier this year. In 2022, “other tech firms, including Seagate, Snap, Intel, Netflix, Shopify, Lyft and others have either cut jobs or restricted hiring”, said Garver.\n\nWhy did it happen?\n\nThe pandemic is largely to blame for the sudden jobs cuts across the technology sector, said Prescott. “As they overhired during the boom time of the pandemic when the industry expanded rapidly, now they are overcompensating the other way.”\n\nDuring the two-year period that saw lockdowns across the world, the tech sector grew and companies hired more staff to accommodate that growth. Meta, for example, hired 27,000 people during the first two years of the pandemic and a further 15,000 this year.\n\nAccording to Prescott, “technology businesses have… experienced a sharp reversal in fortunes from being pandemic winners to facing the reality of a gloomy economic outlook, soaring inflation, rapidly falling consumer confidence and rising interest rates”.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe dramatic change in the employment landscape of Silicon Valley led to technology reporter Kari Paul asking in The Observer: “Is Silicon Valley’s golden era coming to an end?”\n\n“Nervousness is palpable among the bright young things in the technology industry,” said Prescott, “as the rising number of job cuts shatters any lingering perception that the sector was bulletproof.”\n\nThose “seeking other employment in the tech sector will enter a challenging environment” as a result of the “sudden layoffs of thousands of their fellow workers across the sector”, said Garver. There is no guarantee these former employees will easily find work elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, job cuts are expected to continue across the sector. Mark Sweney reported in The Guardian that the billionaire hedge-fund manager Christopher Hohn had called for Alphabet, the company which owns Google and YouTube, to cut costs. Hohn is a major investor in Alphabet and the billionaire believes the company’s employees are “paid too much and its workforce should be drastically cut back”.", "authors": ["Fred Kelly", "The Week Uk", "Jamie Timson", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Harold Maass", "Rebekah Evans", "Justin Klawans"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}]}

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers (4-5) will face the Seattle Seahawks (6-3) in front of nearly 75,000 spectators at Allianz Arena in Munich.\n\nThe meeting makes history on multiple fronts. It marks the first time two division leaders face off internationally and the first non-soccer event ever played at the home of Bayern Munich.\n\nWith a start on Sunday, Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady will become the first quarterback to start a game in three different countries (outside of the US). As a New England Patriot, Brady won all three of the international games he played in, with two in London and one in Mexico City.\n\nEntering Week 10, the Buccaneers were tied at the top of the NFC South. On Thursday, the Atlanta Falcons were upset by the Carolina Panthers, handing the Bucs sole possession of first in the division.\n\nBrady looks for an open receiver during the game against the Los Angeles Rams. Cliff Welch/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images\n\nHowever, they will need a win over Seattle to keep it. A win for Seattle would further solidify their position at the top of the NFC West and put them another step closer to postseason action.\n\nBoth teams’ quarterbacks have surprised football fans as of late, but for different reasons.\n\nAt 45-years-old, Brady has struggled to lead his team to success through the first half of the season. Through ten weeks, he is posting the worst touchdown percentage and passing touchdowns per game of his career, and his second-worst passing yards per attempt mark.\n\nNow, these numbers don’t just reflect Brady’s performance, but also that of the receiving core and team as a whole. But the short story is that this has been Brady’s worst-ever start to a season.\n\nSeattle’s Geno Smith, on the other hand, has surprised in a positive way. He leads the league in completion percentage and has the third-best passer rating (107.2 compared to Brady’s 90.5).\n\nHe’s led the Seahawks to a 6-3 record including impressive wins over the New York Giants and the Arizona Cardinals. Smith’s revival is a welcome shake up for Seahawk fans, especially considering the year former quarterback Russell Wilson is having in Denver.\n\nSmith throws a ball during practise in Germany. Sven Hoppe/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nThe matchup comes at a crucial point for both teams. Midway through the season and at the top of their divisions, each team is vying for optimal postseason positioning.\n\nThe Bucs just snapped a three-game losing streak with a win over the Los Angeles Rams, so a second-straight win could signify the team is back on track. The Seahawks have the opportunity to prove they’re the real deal and deserve their spot in the postseason.\n\nTo watch how it all unfolds, tune in on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\nVikings at Bills\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings (7-1) travel to Buffalo to take on the Bills (6-2) on Sunday night.\n\nEntering the matchup, the Vikings are second in the NFC and boast the league’s second-longest winning streak. The Bills are first in the AFC, but to Minnesota’s benefit, they could potentially have to play without their star quarterback, Josh Allen.\n\nAllen suffered a right elbow injury during the Bills’ Week 9 loss to the Jets. Heading into this weekend, he was listed as questionable. He missed practice Thursday and had a limited showing on Friday. As of Saturday evening, Allen is expected to take the field on Sunday, despite the risk of further injury.\n\nAllen runs with the football against the New York Jets. Erick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images\n\nIf the Bills choose not to give the signal caller another week’s rest, they run the risk of potentially setting him back further down the line. In the case of Allen’s absence, backup quarterback Case Keenum would make his first start with the Bills.\n\nThe matchup also features two of the league’s top receivers: Vikings’ Justin Jefferson and Bills’ Stefon Diggs. Jefferson leads the league in receiving yards and ranks fifth in receptions while former Vikings receiver Diggs ranks second in receptions and fourth in receiving yards.\n\nTo see these teams in action, tune in on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. ET.\n\nFamily ties\n\nFamily loyalties could be tested on Sunday.\n\nIn an interesting twist, multiple members of the same families will compete against each other in four different Week 10 matchups.\n\nBrothers Dalvin and James Cook will face off for the first time in Buffalo, Amon’Ra and Equanimeous St. Brown will meet in Chicago, Joey and Nick Bosa will battle in San Francisco, and cousins Nick and Bradley Chubb square off in Miami.\n\nHow to watch\n\nHere’s how to catch these teams and others across the league in action, from wherever you are.\n\nAustralia: NFL Game Pass, ESPN, 7Plus\n\nBrazil: NFL Game Pass, ESPN\n\nCanada: CTV, TSN, RDS, NFL Game Pass on DAZN\n\nGermany: NFL Game Pass, ProSieben MAXX, DAZN\n\nMexico: NFL Game Pass, TUDN, ESPN, Fox Sports, Sky Sports\n\nUK: NFL Game Pass, Sky Sports, ITV, Channel 5\n\nUS: NFL Game Pass, CBS Sports, Fox Sports, ESPN, Amazon Prime", "authors": ["Hannah Brewitt"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2023/01/30/chiefs-answer-bengals-trash-talk-afc-win-super-bowl-berth/11148295002/", "title": "Chiefs answer Bengals' trash talk with AFC title win, Super Bowl berth", "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. – And then there was the last word.\n\nAnd last laugh.\n\nNot only did the Kansas City Chiefs punch a ticket to Super Bowl 57 by extracting revenge against the Cincinnati Bengals in a classic AFC title game, they made the ultimate statement to answer the over-the-top trash talk.\n\n\"I think guys were probably the most pumped up I’ve ever seen them going into a football game,\" Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said after the 23-20 win. \"Lot of trash talk coming from a lot of different places.\"\n\nThere was no shortage of bulletin board material to add spice to what has quickly become one of the NFL’s hottest rivalries.

Rodenberg saw a glimpse of Hubbard's days as a safety in the first round of the playoffs, when he returned a fumble 98 yards for the game-winning touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\n\"I saw it fall into his (Hubbard's) hands and saw him race downfield,\" Rodenberg said. \"It's like, 'wow,' because you know the kid. I heard Mike Tirico's 'Cincinnati Kid' comment and that's just so true. It's like a moment made in magic.\"\n\nRodenberg believes Hubbard and the rest of the Bengals' defensive line will be the key on Sunday. Cincinnati has had success against the Chiefs with just three-man pass rushes and now they'll face a quarterback in Pat Mahomes who is dealing with a high ankle sprain which could limit his ability to extend plays with his legs.\n\n\"If they can get by with Hendrickson, Reader and Hubbard, they'll stick to that. Mahomes, he's not gonna be 100%. That's gonna be a mobility issue that puts him as a drop-back passer,\" Rodenberg said. \"When you rush a drop-back passer, things are definitely in your favor. I think with the mobility issue, they can get after him.\"\n\nOT Jackson Carman's high school coach Jason Krause of Fairfield\n\nThe Bengals' banged-up offensive line turned in a memorable performance in the team's 27-10 win over the Buffalo Bills last week. One standout was Jackson Carman, who was making his first professional start at left tackle. Carman and company allowed just one sack and paved the way for 172 rushing yards in a dominant effort.\n\nFairfield head coach Jason Krause, who coached Carman in high school, was not surprised by the showing.\n\n\"It was very validating for us, the people who know what he's capable of,\" said Krause, a Browns fan who is now pulling for the Bengals. \"With him (Carman) being there, I'm becoming a Bengals fan and a Jackson Carman fan, for sure.\"\n\nCincinnati has won three consecutive close games against the Chiefs, including last year's AFC title game. What does that do to the game plan, knowing the Chiefs are going to attempt to take away what worked in the previous matchups?\n\n\"The things that did work against them, they're figuring out how to defend,\" Krause said. \"You gotta look at the week prior and see what things they're doing differently than the first time you saw them.\"\n\nBengals head coach Zac Taylor claimed this week he'd cover every inch of the internet to find things to motivate his team. Krause is no stranger to this method.\n\n\"We always look for bulletin board material. I have taken articles, copied them and posted them in every locker of the locker room,\" Krause explained. \"I think there's a little piece of that in all of us coaches, in terms of finding a competitive advantage.\"\n\nKansas City Chiefs' Byran Cook's high school coach Arvie Crouch\n\nCrouch, now with the Hamilton High School Big Blue of the Greater Miami Conference, was head coach at Mt. Healthy while Bryan Cook played for the Owls.\n\nCook is in his rookie season with the Kansas City Chiefs after they drafted him in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft out of Cincinnati. Cook was a big part of the defense on UC's 2021 team that made the College Football Playoff semifinals, totaling 93 tackles and earning first-team all-conference honors.\n\nCook has primarily played special teams this year for Kansas City but does play some defense in red-zone packages. Cook has 33 tackles this season, 22 solo, with one sack. He has two passes defended.\n\n\"He’s one of the best kids I've ever coached as far as being a great human being and one heck of an athlete,\" Crouch said. \"All his hard work has paid off and his work ethic is second to none. I’m really proud of him. He is one of the guys who built Mt. Healthy into a winner.\"\n\nCrouch is a Bengals fan and will be rooting for the orange and black first, but he will also be happy if Cook gets to play in the Super Bowl.\n\nSubscribe today:Support local journalism with an all-access subscription\n\nHe will be looking for Cook to make a key play when he gets his chance, and Crouch said Cook will be ready if Joe Burrow throws his way.\n\n\"He’s a role player right now, and he does a great job at what he’s asked to do,\" Crouch said. \"They have a great staff and he knows what he’s doing. He’s disciplined, hard-working and that’s the type of guy they want.\"\n\nCook was lightly recruited out of high school, signing with Howard University before eventually transferring to UC and going on a unique path to the NFL.\n\n\"He was a late bloomer,\" Crouch said. \"He took advantage of his opportunities. I told (one NFL scout) what a great human being he was. They talked to other people. Someone called me and said 'Is anyone going to say anything bad about this guy?' He’s not one to worry about unless you’re playing against him.\"\n\nFormer Bengals player Bruce Kozerski, Holy Cross head football coach\n\nThough he did coach Derrick Barnes of the Detroit Lions, Kozerski hasn't coached any players on the Bengals' or Chiefs' rosters. However, he was an offensive lineman for Cincinnati from 1984 to 1995 and was part of the second Bengals team to go to the Super Bowl. Staying true to his roots as a player, Kozerski believes the game will be won at the line of scrimmage.\n\n\"Win the trenches. If all the substitutes can handle all the pass rushers, that makes it even harder to stop the Bengals' fleet of receivers.\" Kozerski said.\n\nHe is speaking about Carman, Max Scharping and Hakeem Adeniji, who are filling in for injured starters Jonah Williams, Alex Cappa and La'el Collins. Including last Sunday's win over Buffalo, the three reserves have just five starts between them this season but were a key cog in a win over Buffalo that saw Joe Burrow pass for 242 yards and Joe Mixon run for 105 yards.\n\nOn the flip side, Kozerski said there are several things the Bengals can do defensively to control the game. The defensive game plan starts with Patrick Mahomes, who suffered a high-ankle sprain in the Chiefs' win against Jacksonville.\n\n\"They need to get pressure on him and see how mobile he is, and see what directions he runs where he has limited mobility,\" Kozerski said.\n\nWhen Mahomes returned in the second half of last Sunday's game, the majority of his passes came from inside the pocket. Forcing him out of the pocket, Kozerski said, could impact his accuracy to receivers like former University of Cincinnati tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nCincinnati has won each of its three prior meetings with Kansas City by three points. The Bengals enter Sunday's contest on a 10-game winning streak, while the Chiefs have won seven straight. Taking all these factors into mind, Kozerski predicts a seven-point Bengals win.\n\n\"The confidence level of both teams is extremely high,\" Kozerski said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/sport/nfl-week-6-recap-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Tom Brady f-bombs, best teams show championship mettle and New ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn a week where some teams showed why they’re contenders and others showed why they might not, the biggest talking point from Week 6 of the 2022 NFL season came from the sideline involving the sport’s biggest name.\n\nTom Brady’s profanity-laden tirade aimed at his teammates sowed doubts over the 45-year-old’s commitment and enjoyment in playing his 22nd NFL season.\n\nSo without further ado, lets get into what we learned from Week 6 of the 2022 NFL season.\n\nOut of sorts\n\nBrady’s dedication to winning has been unrivaled ever since he joined the league way back in 2000. It’s one of the reasons he’s earned the title of ‘greatest of all time’ with seven Super Bowl titles to his name.\n\nHowever, a rocky beginning to the season has left Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with more questions than answers.\n\nBetween an offseason retirement, an 11-day leave of absence to “deal with personal things” and reported marital issues, Brady’s long-term commitment to playing has been questioned.\n\nAlthough he’s reassured fans, players and coaches that he’s fully invested this season, the Bucs’ success – or lack thereof – on the field has been uncharacteristic for a Brady team.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Brady had some choice words for his offensive line during Tampa Bay’s 20-18 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers which moved the Bucs’ record to 3-3 on the season.\n\nDuring the second quarter and with his team trailing 10-6, Brady was seen venting his anger at his offensive line, saying: “You’re so much better than you’re f**king playing.”\n\nIt’s the second sideline outburst already this season from Brady after he smashed a tablet in frustration against the New Orleans Saints in Week 2.\n\nOn Monday, Bucs head coach Todd Bowles had to downplay any controversy that his star quarterback is receiving preferential treatment after Brady’s focus was once again questioned after he attended Patriots owner Robert Kraft’s wedding this past Friday – two days before game day – as well as being permitted to take Wednesdays off this season.\n\nBrady walks to the locker room after a loss to the Steelers. Justin K. Aller/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\n“He works as hard as anybody. Special treatment? There have been a few guys that have missed some meetings and some practices for some special things,” Bowles told the media.\n\n“It just doesn’t get publicized because they’re not him. It kind of comes with the territory. We don’t worry about it too much.”\n\nEntering the season, the Bucs were ranked in the ‘contender’ tier for their Super Bowl prospects. But, after six weeks of NFL action, things aren’t going as smoothly for Brady as people would have foreseen.\n\nLeague’s best?\n\nWeek 6’s headline game came from Arrowhead Stadium in what was a rematch of last season’s most memorable playoff game as the Buffalo Bills were out for revenge against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nThe Bills were left devastated after a last-gasp overtime loss last season, but this time, it was they who produced a late comeback to win.\n\nIn a battle of the NFL’s two best quarterbacks – Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and Buffalo’s Josh Allen – a touchdown pass to Bills tight-end Dawson Knox was the decisive score in Buffalo’s 24-20 victory.\n\nThe win not only banishes demons from last year, but it also reiterates the Bills’ championship mettle – not that we doubted it.\n\nBehind the ascending Allen and a beefed-up defense, Buffalo is being tipped to win the organization’s first ever Super Bowl, banishing years of heartache and coming up just short.\n\nWe are learning that this Bills team is for real this year, with seemingly only injuries able to slow them down.\n\nAllen celebrates a touchdown with teammate Jordan Phillips against the Chiefs. Jason Hanna/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nUndefeated\n\nThe only remaining undefeated team is another potential Super Bowl contender and they, like the Bills, are looking tricky to slow down.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles beat their bitter division rivals, the Dallas Cowboys, 26-17 on Sunday night, improving their record to 6-0 as they continued to fire on all cylinders.\n\nWith Jalen Hurts at quarterback, the best offensive line in the league and a plethora of offensive weapons paired with a loaded defense, it’s hard to find a weakness with the Eagles.\n\nBut Jason Kelce – the 34-year-old center who’s played the entirety of his 11-year NFL career with Eagles as well as winning Super Bowl 52 with the franchise – says the team isn’t sated with their good start to the year.\n\n“There isn’t a player here who is satisfied with what we’ve done,” Kelce told the media. “It’s great to be 6-0 and where we are.\n\n“We’ve worked hard to win these games and each one of them has been a little bit different, so to find ways to win these games has been important for this football team. But there are a lot of areas where we need to be better. I don’t think we’ve played a full game. I think we have yet to play our best game and it’s exciting to know that it’s still out there.”\n\nHurts celebrates as he walks off the field after defeating the Dallas Cowboys. Mitchell Leff/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nThe team has a bye coming up this week, maybe coming at a less than ideal time as it could break the Eagles’ momentum.\n\nAnd although Philly sports fans don’t like to get ahead of themselves, a deep playoff run will be the bare minimum expectation this year, as the Eagles continue to pass every test and show why they are legitimate contenders for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nBack again?\n\nAs the popular NFL podcast, ‘Around the NFL,’ puts it: “It’s on in New York City.” And it most certainly is on in the Big Apple.\n\nBoth of the city’s football teams – the Giants and the Jets – picked up meaningful victories on Sunday, with the Giants beating the Baltimore Ravens and the Jets stunning the Green Bay Packers.\n\nWith the wins, the two teams’ combined records are 9-3 this season, marking a drastic change in their success over recent years.\n\nSauce Gardner of the New York Jets celebrates after beating the Green Bay Packers wearing a cheesehead hat -- a traditional accessory for Packers fans. Stacy Revere/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nFor the 5-1 Giants, a return to health for star running back Saquon Barkley and new head coach Brian Daboll have transformed Big Blue into a tough, resolute football team who already have some big wins under their belt this season.\n\nAnd for the 3-2 Jets, it’s all about their young crop of players. The first four picks of the team from the 2022 draft – Sauce Gardner, Garrett Wilson, Jermaine Johnson and Breece Hall – have all had a huge impact and have helped to transform one of the lowliest teams to one which no one wants to face off against.\n\nAfter years of bland, gray football, New York is spicy once again.", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/01/06/bills-bengals-playoffs-rematch-neutral-site-coin-flip/11002928002/", "title": "Bills-Bengals rematch? Why no neutral site or coin flip for playoffs?", "text": "Friday, the NFL approved \"2023 Resolution G-1,\" which allows for special playoff contingencies in the AFC bracket in the wake of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin's on-field collapse Monday night and subsequent hospitalization – a virtually unprecedented event at a league game that eventually necessitated the cancellation of Buffalo's contest with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThat matchup was rife with implications for postseason seeding, though it did not contain a scenario that would either send a team to the playoffs or prevent one from going – a major determinant in the league's decision to cancel the game.\n\nHowever Commissioner Roger Goodell and his competition committee laid out some unique recommendations – adopted Friday – that could lead to unparalleled postseason circumstances. For one, the AFC championship game would be played on a neutral field if either the Bills or Bengals are matched up against the Kansas City Chiefs. Second, even though the Bengals were declared AFC North champions since they currently retain a 1½-game lead on the Baltimore Ravens, if the Ravens complete a season sweep of Cincinnati on Sunday, then the site of a potential wild-card rematch between the teams would be determined by a coin flip.\n\nNFL PLAYOFF PICTURE ENTERING WEEK 18:Unprecedented outcomes possible after Bills-Bengals game canceled\n\nZAC TAYLOR:Bengals coach doesn't hold back when asked about NFL's coin-flip decision\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nHOW WILL NFL PLAYERS RESPOND? After Hamlin incident, it's clear that 'life is bigger than this game'\n\nHowever one possibility the league didn't create a provision for is a potential Bills-Bengals rematch. If the current seedings hold, No. 2 Buffalo (12-3) would host No. 3 Cincinnati (11-4) in the divisional round. Conversely, if both teams wind up 12-4, the Bengals would be ranked higher based on the strength of victory tiebreaker and a matchup with the Bills would be staged in Cincinnati.\n\nBut why didn't the NFL adopt a neutral-site scenario for this outcome given the cancellation of Monday's game nixed the ability to create a head-to-head tiebreaker – which is always preeminent?\n\nUSA TODAY Sports submitted the question to league executives Friday.\n\n\"Yes, there was (consideration for a Buffalo-Cincinnati neutral site),\" said NFL competition committee chairman Rich McKay, suggesting only a neutral site championship game offers requisite time to plan for such an alternative logistically.\n\n\"That was discussed at length on the call today amongst ownership.\"\n\nAdded league vice president of broadcast planning Michael North: \"The fact that Buffalo and Cincy never got played, they're going to have a different number of games played relative to Kansas City.\n\n\"But when it comes to Buffalo and Cincinnati playing each other potentially in the divisional round of the playoffs, they have played the same number of games – they've both played 16 games. So there wasn't really a conversation about a coin flip relative to the host site. We'll let that play out on the field this weekend.\"\n\nNorth also said the league is in the early stages of assessing neutral site locations should one be needed for the AFC title game. Cities like Detroit and Indianapolis have been floated due to their proximity to Kansas City, Buffalo and Cincinnati. North would only say preliminary talks are underway as the availability of any prospective stadiums are assessed, and that more information will be forthcoming next week once the postseason field is finalized by Week 18's results.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/playoffs/2019/01/13/new-england-patriots-kansas-city-chiefs-afc-championship-game/2566059002/", "title": "Patriots at Chiefs: Can Patrick Mahomes unseat Tom Brady for AFC?", "text": "A preview of the AFC Championship Game between the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs:\n\nWhen: Sunday, Jan. 20, 6:40 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nChannel: CBS\n\nLine: TBD\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nInjuries: Though the Chiefs are relatively healthy at this point in the year, the one injury that persists is a significant one. Safety Eric Berry, the veteran presence in Kansas City’s secondary, missed Saturday’s divisional-round victory against the Colts with a calf issue, marking the second consecutive contest in which he was inactive. One other notable injury, a hamstring issue to running back Spencer Ware, has forced him to miss the last four games.\n\nSimilarly, New England has a favorable outlook. Safety Devin McCourty (concussion) and receiver Cordarrelle Patterson (knee) returned to the field against the Chargers in the divisional round. Right guard Shaq Mason was helped off the field in Sunday’s game, but he later returned. Defensive end Deatrich Wise (ankle) was the lone regular contributor to miss New England’s playoff opener with an injury.\n\nTHREE THINGS TO KNOW\n\n1. Rematch: Anyone who tuned in for Week 6’s thrilling battle between these two teams – an eventual 43-40 Patriots victory – should be glad there’s another iteration of the matchup. It was a back-and-forth matchup with two ties and four lead changes. After the Chiefs tied the game with just more than three minutes to play on a 75-yard bomb to Tyreek Hill, the Pats fought back and kicked the 28-yard, game-winning field goal as time expired. That game earlier in the year was in Foxborough. This time it will be at Arrowhead, so the Chiefs may get a little boost from the home-field crowd in the first AFC title game hosted in Kansas City. One other interesting nugget: the last time the Pats played in Kansas City, it was the 2014 game – a 41-14 New England loss in Week 4 – after which many questioned whether Brady’s run as a dominant passer had come to an end.\n\n2. Prolific passers: The duel between Brady and Patrick Mahomes is the marquee attraction of the AFC Championship Game. Mahomes is the favorite for the league MVP and boasts one of the strongest arms in the NFL. He uses creative arm angles and can slip out of the pocket while keeping his eyes downfield to find targets who may have raced past coverage. Brady, on the other hand, is masterful in the pocket and – despite many claiming that his demise was coming soon – was clinical in a divisional-round thumping of the Chargers. They have different styles, but this matchup – in some ways – is a representation of what happened this year throughout the NFL: Several young passers flourished, but they still need to get past experienced mainstays to reach the next level in the league.\n\n3. (In)experience: This will be New England’s eighth consecutive trip to the AFC Championship Game and 13th in Brady's 17 seasons as the team’s full-time starter – not counting the 2008 campaign in which he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the season opener. The Patriots will be trying to reach their ninth Super Bowl in the Brady-Bill Belichick era. Kansas City, meanwhile, has a quarterback who’s in his first season as a starter. Its roster doesn’t come even close to the postseason experience that New England’s enjoys. While Kansas City coach Andy Reid has plenty of experience in big games, he may need to work on not having the stage become too big for his squad.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/23/sport/cowboys-lions-nfl-week-7-preview-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "NFL Week 7 Preview: Welcome Back Dak, Cowboys' Prescott ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDallas Cowboys’ quarterback Dak Prescott will be back in action this week after missing the last five games with an injury.\n\nThe 29-year-old fractured his right thumb in the Cowboys’ season-opening loss.

On their own one-yard line, needing to punt the ball away with restricted space available, punter Thomas Morstead kicked the ball off teammate Trent Sherfield's backside and out of bounds for a safety.

In addition to his contribution on the field, Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy noted his leadership and energy as huge benefits to team morale.\n\nThe question is what will the adjustment period be like, considering it’s been five weeks since he last took the field?\n\nThe Cowboys’ offense will have to readjust to working with Prescott as opposed to Rush.

The team’s season began with a catastrophic season-opening loss to the Buccaneers, during which starting quarterback Dak Prescott sustained a thumb injury.\n\nThat injury turned out to require surgery, sidelining Prescott for multiple weeks and thrusting the reins into the hands of backup quarterback Cooper Rush.\n\nRush’s experience at the helm was limited to one career professional start against the Minnesota Vikings back in 2021.\n\nDuring that game, he notched a win with an impressive stat line: 30 of 47 for 325 yards with two touchdowns (including a come-from-behind game-winner) and an interception.\n\nNow entering Week 6 of the 2022 season, Rush has yet to lose a career start and has given the Cowboys momentum heading into the second-third of the season.\n\nThe Eagles are the league’s only team that hasn’t lost yet. With a win on Sunday, they would become the fourth team in the Super Bowl era to begin a season with a 6-0 record and have a positive turnover differential in each victory.\n\nThe biggest reason why they haven’t lost a game so far this season? Explosive offense.\n\nThe Eagles are one of the most effective teams once in the red-zone and have one of the league’s best run games.\n\nThey have scored 18 of 20 times they’ve entered the red-zone, with touchdowns on 13 of those drives. That’s 90% scoring success and 65% touchdown scoring. Eleven of those 13 red-zone touchdowns have come via the running game, with six from quarterback Jalen Hurts.\n\nHurts and the Eagles will be feeling the pressure from the Cowboys defense on Sunday.\n\nThrough five games, Dallas has only allowed five touchdowns and is third in the league in points allowed per game.\n\nLinebacker Micah Parsons has recorded multiple sacks in three of his first five games this season. In Week 5, he earned NFC Defensive Player of the Week after recording five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble. All this to say, it won’t be easy for either side to climb to victory.\n\nMicah Parsons sacked Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford when the Cowboys played the Rams. Brian Rothmuller/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images\n\nA strong offense met with a well-matched defense could turn into a shootout and rely more heavily on special teams.\n\nCowboys kicker Brett Maher is one of the league’s more accurate kickers, going 13-for-14 on field goal tries including some from longer distances.\n\nThe Eagles’ kicker situation is a little more uncertain.\n\nIn Week 5, 22-year-old Cameron Dicker made his debut. After signing to the team just days prior, “Dicker the Kicker” cashed both extra point attempts and two field goals, including the winning 23-yarder. It was a performance impressive enough to earn him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, but inexperience could show in his subsequent showing.\n\nKickoff for the NFC East battle is Sunday night at 8:20 p.m. ET.\n\nBuffalo Bills at Kansas City Chiefs\n\nWeek 6 presents a rematch of last season’s dramatic divisional playoff featuring the Buffalo Bills (4-1) and Kansas City Chiefs (4-1).\n\nAhead of this week’s contest, the two teams boast the league’s highest-scoring offenses.

Bryan M. Bennett/Getty Images\n\nThe pair are no strangers, as this will be the fifth time they’ve faced off over three seasons.

St. Augustine’s settlers celebrated the nation’s first Thanksgiving over a half century earlier, on September 8, 1565. Following a religious service, the Spaniards shared a communal meal with the local native tribe.”\n\nHosting the first Thanksgiving celebration in what would become the United States is one of many “firsts” for the oldest continuously occupied European settlement in America.\n\n“When the Spaniards founded St. Augustine nearly 450 years ago, they proceeded to found our nation’s first city government, first school, first hospital, first city plan, first Parrish church, and first mission to the native populations,” Gannon said.\n\nCross Florida Canal idea lasted decades, finally failed\n\nIn 1965, Gannon was a priest and historian in St. Augustine, leading several projects to help celebrate the 400th anniversary of the founding of the city. He oversaw the erection of the Great Cross on the site of the first religious service and thanksgiving feast in North America. At 208 feet tall, the stainless steel structure is the largest freestanding cross in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“It was decided to build a cross, because that was central to the original ceremony, where Father Francisco López, the fleet chaplain, soon to be first pastor of the first Parrish, came ashore ahead of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, the leader of the founding expedition, and then went forward to meet Menéndez holding a cross,” said Gannon. “Menéndez came on land, knelt and kissed the cross.”\n\nEvery year, the September 8, 1565, landing of Menéndez and the Catholic Mass that followed is reenacted in St. Augustine with dignitaries from around the world in attendance. For many years the role of Menéndez has been played by Chad Light.\n\nToday, visitors to the first permanent European settlement in North America can see a statue of Father Francisco López in front of the Great Cross. The statue is placed on the approximate site where Father López held the first Catholic Mass in the city, which was attended by Native Americans. Following the service, the European settlers and the native people shared a Thanksgiving meal.\n\nStory continues below\n\nThe Most Famous Speech Never Given\n\nThe statue of Father López is carved out of indigenous coquina stone, a sedimentary rock comprised of compressed shells. The rough surface of the coquina symbolizes the difficult journey the Spanish endured on their voyage to Florida.\n\n“That statue was erected in the 1950s. It was executed by a distinguished Yugoslav sculptor, Ivan Meštrović,” said Gannon. “But it was placed in a copse of trees where it did not stand out against a dark background. The plan that the architects in 1965 came forward with was to move it to a site on open ground where the figure of Father López, with his arms in the air, would stand out against the sky. And now, at long last, the statue has been moved to that space. You can see the dramatic difference in the figure of Father López as he’s seen completely and clearly now against the sky, and directly in front of the Great Cross, which stands behind him.”\n\nThe Spanish had only just arrived in St. Augustine when their Thanksgiving dinner was served, and they did not have the benefit of having raised crops for a year as the English Pilgrims did more than half a century later.\n\nThe Spanish had to do the best they could with leftovers from their long voyage.\n\n“The menu was a stew of salted pork and garbanzo beans, accompanied with ship’s bread and red wine,” said Gannon.\n\nWhile Floridians should proudly proclaim ownership of the first Thanksgiving celebration held in what would become the United States, we may want to retain the traditional menu of turkey, stuffing, vegetables, and cranberry sauce.\n\nDr. Ben Brotemarkle is executive director of the Florida Historical Society and host of the radio program “Florida Frontiers,” broadcast locally on 90.7 WMFE Thursday evenings at 6:30 p.m. and Sunday afternoons at 4 p.m., and on 89.5 WFIT Sunday mornings at 7 a.m. The show can be heard online at myfloridahistory.org.\n\nMORE: Gas prices below $2 for Thanksgiving", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/11/21/what-really-happened-during-first-thanksgiving-5-things-podcast/8703720002/", "title": "What really happened during the first Thanksgiving? 5 Things podcast", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast:\n\nWe've all heard the story of the first Thanksgiving; Pilgrims and Native Americans sitting down together to enjoy the fruits of their labor and feast in friendship.

I'm Shannon Rae Green, and this is 5 Things. It's Sunday, November 21st. These Sunday episodes are special. We're bringing you more from in depth stories you may have missed. Thanksgiving is this Thursday. I hope you'll get to be with people you love, to relax, to break bread, if you're celebrating. On today's episode, we're talking about the historically accurate story of Thanksgiving. It's not as simple as the story that many Americans were raised on, that pilgrims and Native Americans easily trusted each other and shared a cornucopia of food somewhere near Plymouth rock. I've invited US Today network's, Erin Dionne onto the show to share her reporting into what really happened between the pilgrims and the indigenous people living in New England 400 years ago. They did eat together, but there's a lot more to that story. Erin, thanks so much for joining me.\n\nErin Dionne: Yeah, no problem. I love telling this story. I like rocking people's world with it. You're not going to think about Thanksgiving again after you hear it.\n\nShannon Rae Gre...: Thanks so much for doing that for us. That's exactly why I wanted you here. So tell me, how were you first assigned this story and why did you want to tell it?\n\nErin Dionne: So last year, 2020 was the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim's landing it in Massachusetts in the kind of general Massachusetts area. November 11th, 1620, they dropped anchor off Cape Cod and came ashore at what is now known as Provincetown or P town. And you'll be forgiven for not knowing that date, not everybody grew up two towns away from Plymouth like I did, and didn't have it kind of stuffed down their throat from a very early age. But anyway, 400 is a big milestone. And for years, organizations had been planning this year long celebration that was going to be called Plymouth 400. And it was also tied to the founding of Plymouth where the pilgrims eventually settled. And it became kind of the first quote unquote town in the United States. So Ginette had a strong presence in the area through the Cape Cod times, and we have a network of weekly's there.\n\nAnd so we decided to pool our resources and do our own project about the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim landing. The project would be centered around the events, but also stories about the impact that pilgrims have had on New England and the impact that pilgrims had on the US. But as a part of that, we also wanted to include in this project, a restorative justice piece to it and bring the native voices back into that narrative, which included the story that I produced, which deconstructed the myth of the first Thanksgiving and retold that piece of history accurately. And in a way that recentered the story around the Wampanoag people, who were the group of native Americans or Indians who were living in that place at the time. Obviously COVID happened and our project had to shift from sending around the Plymouth 400 event is centering around this Thanksgiving and restorative piece. That's how we got the project that we ended up with.\n\nShannon Rae Gre...: Yeah. So tell me more about the native Americans that lived in that area, where the pilgrims landed.\n\nErin Dionne: The pilgrims landed in P town, and then they kind of moved to a couple places before they eventually settled in Plymouth. But in that whole area were living the Wampanoag people, and the Wampanoag people were basically a series of different tribes. You had the Mashpee Wampanoags who were living around Plymouth. You had the Herring Pond Wampanoags, you had the Aquinnah AOS.\n\nThere were a bunch of other tribes and each tribe was kind of an independent functioning cell of itself, but they were united together under the great Sachem who is Massasoit and Massasoit's job was to basically keep the peace between all of the various Wampanoag tribes. He wasn't the boss. He had to kind of rule through the goodwill of others, kind of invoking the trust of everybody. He couldn't order people around, but he was the person who would negotiate with the pilgrims or negotiate with other tribes in the area. Also worth noting is that across the Narragansett bay was the Narragansett tribe who live in what is now Rhode Island. And they were the rivals of the Wampanoag. And so there was a lot of tension happening there between those two groups.\n\nShannon Rae Gre...: Yeah. It sounds fairly democratic, which I think you noted in your story.\n\nErin Dionne: Yeah, you could... It was a much more sophisticated system than the Pilgrim myth would lead you to believe that they came here and everything was kind of disorganized and people were living in the woods. I mean, where the pilgrims landed was really the summer resort of the Wampanoag people. And that's why when they landed there in November, nobody was there because that's where they summer, because it's close to the water, they can catch fish and sell fish. They were actually where they winter in their winter resort, if you will.\n\nShannon Rae Gre...: I love that. It makes sense. So tell me about what happened between the pilgrims and the Wampanoag people and how that led to the first Thanksgiving story and the overall mythos that comes with it.\n\nErin Dionne: So the important thing to know, going into the Thanksgiving story is that, in about 1615 or 1616, a pandemic swept through the Wampanoag people, not unlike the pandemic that came our people in 2020, the Wampanoags were devastated by this pandemic. They didn't have kind of the infrastructure or the knowledge to treat whatever illness this was. They haven't identified what illness it was, but whatever it was, I mean, whole villages were wiped out. And so just as that illness was beginning to recede, the pilgrims showed up and all of a sudden here, kind of out of nowhere, this group of Europeans appears on P town. Now the Wampanoags and the other tribes in the area had actually had contact with Europeans for about a century before the pilgrims showed up. So some of them spoke English, they were familiar with Europeans, but the thing was Europeans usually brought conflict with them. Many of their interactions with Europeans, up until that point, either involved Europeans taking native Americans as slaves and bringing them across the ocean or cultural misunderstandings that ended in violence.\n\nAnd in fact, the Wampanoags had just driven off a pack of Europeans who had been living in the very spot or had tried to establish in the very spot that the pilgrims had just landed. So the pilgrims land and the Wampanoags are in a very delicate position because they are so weakened by this pandemic and the Narragansett's are pushing on their borders. And the Narragansett's had not been impacted by the pandemic at all. They are at full strength and so Massasoit has a difficult decision to make. Does he let these Europeans come ashore and establish and possibly make them allies, while keeping in his mind that previous encounters with the Europeans had gone very, very badly? Or does he drive them off, which potentially wastes... Not wastes, but results in the loss of warriors. Of strong men that could be later used to fight off the Narragansett's.\n\nSo he holds back and lets them come ashore. And let me tell you, the pilgrims do not make a good case for themselves when they come ashore. They're starving, they're seasick, they're ill. They come ashore and what do they do? They immediately start digging up Wampanoag graves, and they even remark at the time that they know that they're graves and they start digging them up, trying to find any food that may have been buried with the Wampanoag people who were buried there. So they're going through, and they're taking the stores of corn, whatever else that they had been buried with, dried fruit, vegetables, pumpkins, squash, anything, and they're bringing it back to the ship. And the Wampanoags are watching these people being like, \"Are you kidding me?\" But they hang back and they let the pilgrims kind of establish themselves a little bit.\n\nAnd they don't actually approach the pilgrims formally until February. And this is after a very hard winter for the pilgrims. About half of them died in that first winter, they landed in November. They couldn't get enough shelters built for people to come off the ship. So many of the pilgrims had to stay on the ship and they died of starvation, cold, illness, and the such in February the Wampanoags and Massasoit decide to formally approach the pilgrims and kind of establish diplomatic relations. And that was a deeply unpopular move among the rest of the Wampanoags and Massasoit knew that he was taking a big risk and doing that because many of the Wampanoags really wanted to kill the pilgrims and just get rid of them and be rid of whatever threat this could be. And Massasoit knew that he was taking a big risk in doing that.\n\nHe was taking a risk in losing the trust of the other Wampanoag tribes and also taking a risk in that this is all going to go south. Spoiler alert, it does, but he couldn't have possibly known that at the time. So diplomatic relations with the pilgrims are established, the pilgrims get on their feet a little bit fast forward, and you get to November and the pilgrims decide that they want to have a Thanksgiving. Now, Thanksgivings are a pretty standard cultural practice among Christians at that time. And among other cultures where they take a day and they have a Thanksgiving fast, which is actually the Thanksgiving. They fast all day. And it makes them really, really grateful for all of the things that they have. And then they break the fast with a big feast. So they do that and they get a little rowdy during the Thanksgiving feast part of it.\n\nAnd they start shooting in the air. And that alerts the Wampanoags who are nearby saying, why is all of this shooting happen? Are we under attack? Is it finally happening? Are the Europeans turning on us? And they show up and they're like, what's going on? And the pilgrims are like, \"Oh, we're just having a feast, whatever.\" And so the Wampanoags kind of invite themselves into the feast and it is... At first, it's a little awkward. They're like \"Why are all...\" And it's all warriors too. It's not like the women and children, it's all big warriors and it's a little awkward, but eventually things are kind of smoothed out through the help of a lot of alcohol. And everybody's kind of having a grand time. And that really is the Thanksgiving feast.\n\nNow, with the amount of attention that it gets, you would think that it was this really big grand thing. But really, if you look at the first person reports at the time, it's about a paragraph, maybe that, if you look at Mort's Relation, which is published in 1622, and it's kind of the first first person account of the establishing of the pilgrims. It's literally a paragraph, maybe and a half, it's a blip on the radar. So it's kind of amazing that this little thing became such a big part of the American mythos.\n\nShannon Rae Gre...: Yeah. So exactly to the point that you've just made I have a question. How did this inaccurate story get cemented into our culture when it comes to the holiday of just Thanksgiving and that the native Americans were invited that they just trusted each other?\n\nErin Dionne: So the story of how the Thanksgiving myth became cemented actually has very little to do with what actually happened on Thanksgiving and has everything to do with the cultural hierarchy within our country. And who gets to set what the history of the country is. So for much of American history, nobody cared about the pilgrims. Unless you were from Plymouth, Massachusetts, or that surrounding area, nobody cared about them. America wasn't enough of a thing for a very long time to really need an origin story. And frankly, people were more focused on surviving than looking back in the past and trying to find a common story and a reason for why we were all here. They were here. They wanted to get on their lives. Thanksgiving was created as a federal holiday by Abraham Lincoln during what is probably the least thankful time in American history, which was the Civil War.\n\nIn 1863, he declares that the last Thursday in November will be a Thanksgiving Day, no mentions of the pilgrims. He's just really co-opting that already established tradition of giving things that we had talked about. This is 1863. It's a time of great upheaval. It's a time when a lot of people were arriving into America from abroad, and those people who were arriving into America, they were not like the people who had established America and who had been living there for several centuries at this point. Many of them were from Southern Europe or elsewhere. They were from Italy. They were from Greece. They were from Macedonia. They were from that Mediterranean area. And so they looked different and they sounded different and they spoke different languages. And more than that, they were Catholic, which really upset a lot of the Anglo-Saxon and Protestant people who established deep roots in America.\n\nAnd so this is when good old, New England Protestants who had been really nurturing the story of the pilgrims started using this story as the founders of America, as a sort of cultural bludgeon to claim their spot on the top of America's hierarchy. So you fast forward a little bit and the United States is really taking its place on the world stage. American pride really becomes a thing. And so Americans do start looking for an origin story. The problem is, when you look back at how America became America, it's really not a nice picture. They look back and they find slavery. They find the Indian wars, they find the Trail of Tears. They find a lot of blood and things that don't really make for a tasteful story. And that's where New England, who had been holding onto the pride of the pilgrims swoops in and says, \"Here have this bloodless story about English separatists who came to America through resilience and, bonus points faith in God, built the foundation of this country.\"\n\nIt didn't matter that what they sold was a completely sanitized to the point of being mythological. It played well with the intended audience. And so this all becomes really cemented in 1963, a hundred years after Lincoln's first Thanksgiving address. President John F. Kennedy, who is from Massachusetts. And the Kennedy compound is in Hyannis, which is on Cape Cod, which is where all of this Pilgrim stuff was happening. Kennedy invokes the pilgrims in his declaration. He says \"Over three centuries ago, our forefathers in Virginia and in Massachusetts, far from home in a lonely wilderness, set aside a time of Thanksgiving. On that appointed day, they gave reverent thanks for their safety, for the health of their children, for the fertility of fields, for the love which bound them together, and for the faith, which united them with their God.\" You'll notice no mention of the Wampanoags here. And that is really the moment when the Thanksgiving myth is cemented in American popular culture, and is really when the history of the pilgrims became the history of the United States. And thus far the history of Americans.\n\nShannon Rae Gre...: That's so helpful to explain that. There's a lot there to unpack. You talked with people who are members of tribes, who are trying to bring the documented facts to light. What did these indigenous folks share with you? What did they want people to know?\n\nErin Dionne: I think mostly what they wanted people to know is that they still exist. They're still here. And for many Americans, myself included, we have the luxury of thinking of these things as something that happened 400 years ago, it was a singular event that happened 400 years ago. For them, this is something that is still happening. I talked to a medicine man for the Mashpee Wampanoags, his name is Troy Currants. And he told me how his grandfather was sent to a residential school where they made him cut his hair. They kind of beat the Wampanoag language out of him. He lost his language, and that was his grand father. That is only two generations back. And for a long time, the Wampanoags did not have their language. They had lost it. And it's really only recently through the great efforts of people within that tribe, that they are starting to get that language back.\n\nHe said that right now, they have kind of the first generation of Wampanoag youth who are now teenagers who are growing up with the Wampanoag language. They are growing up speaking English, but also having the Wampanoag language as a household language. And that is something that they have not had for many generations. Of the 69 tribes of Wampanoags who lived in Massachusetts and this area at the time, only three survived, the Mashpee, the Herring Pond, and the Aquinnah. But they're still here, and they are still working to preserve their culture and bring their culture back. And they still face so many hardships and roadblocks because of what happened here, because of the loss of their land, because of the loss of their culture, because of the loss of their language. And so I think that is really what many of the people that I spoke to wanted to stress.\n\nAnd the other thing that they wanted people to know is that Americans need to understand their past in order to be able to become better in the future. When you learn the history of the pilgrims and the history of Thanksgiving through this extremely sanitized lens, in a way that really lacks the context of everything that happened, it really leaves you unprepared to understand the things that are happening today.\n\nIf you grow up not understanding that history, it makes it really difficult, if not impossible to look out and see Black Lives Matter protests and understand what that's about, to understand the movement to remove Confederate statues, to understand the movement, to remove Columbus statues, to understand the movement to stop celebrating Columbus day. You just don't have the ability to reconcile that because you don't have that basis of knowledge of your history. And it also makes it really difficult to understand where you need to go as a country, makes you really susceptible to propaganda. It makes you really susceptible to kind of populist political movements. Understanding this really helps you understand your history, where you came from, and where you as a country need to go.\n\nShannon Rae Gre...: Erin, this Thanksgiving, thank you for helping us be able to do that, especially helping me.\n\nErin Dionne: No problem. If people are looking to learn more about this, I would suggest digging up the story. There's a lot more in there including kind of a quick hit version of four things that your kindergarten teacher told you that aren't true about the pilgrims. I would also highly recommend reading the book This Land is Their Land, which is a telling of the history of the pilgrims centered around the Wampanoags. And it goes really in depth. And it's going to absolutely blow your mind probably from the first page.\n\nShannon Rae Gre...: I'm excited. Erin, thank you so much for coming on the show today.\n\nErin Dionne: No problem.

Nor do they usually learn just how much Pilgrims relied on the native Wampanoag tribe during those tough early days.\n\nAs Plymouth, Massachusetts, prepares for the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower's arrival in 1620, new archaeological work at the town's original Pilgrim settlement has unearthed more artifacts from native Americans than anticipated.\n\nThe discovery provides more context to a Dec. 11, 1621, letter written by Edward Winslow, an early Pilgrim, to a friend back in England that offers the clearest clues about the feast that became known as the first Thanksgiving.\n\nWinslow wrote that Wampanoag leader Massasoit \"with some 90 men\" joined the colonists for a three-day feast. About half of the 102 Pilgrims who arrived the year before died the first winter, meaning native people would have nearly doubled the 50 or so Pilgrims at the 1621 event.\n\n\"I think a lot of times we really view (Thanksgiving) in a very Pilgrim-centered way,\" said David Landon, associate director of the Andrew Fiske Memorial Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Massachusetts Boston. \"But when you look at the historical accounts more closely, and combine that with the archaeology, it's really clear that there were way more native American people there than there were English people.\"\n\nFor the past eight years, Landon has led students at UMass on annual digs each spring around Burial Hill, a cemetery situated in the middle of downtown Plymouth where the Pilgrims' first settlement is buried. It's in preparation of the city's yearlong Plymouth 400 commemoration that kicks off in April.\n\nEven where researchers uncovered European pottery inside the remains of early Pilgrim homes, they often found Wampanoag pottery next to it. The association is strong enough to conclude they were used side-by-side. Landon said it indicates a high level of trade and exchange after the Pilgrims arrived.\n\nPlymouth wasn't simply an \"English colony transplanted into Massachusetts,\" Landon said, but an unfamiliar environment where others were already living. It's a different picture than some 20th century paintings, for example, that depict a first Thanksgiving dominated by Pilgrims eating with a few Native Americans.\n\n\"And the native people brought a lot of the food,\" Landon said. \"That sometimes get lost in our simplified view of it.\"\n\nHere are some other lesser-known Thanksgiving tidbits.\n\nWhy Thanksgiving traces to Plymouth\n\nYears before the Mayflower arrived in the U.S., other colonists and native people, in what are now Florida, Virginia, Maine and Texas, held religious services to give thanks, according to researchers from the Plimoth Plantation, a nonprofit living history museum of early Plymouth.\n\nBut Plymouth is considered home of the first \"Thanksgiving\" because the push to make it an official U.S. holiday originated in New England in the 1830s. Sarah Josepha Hale, a writer and early Thanksgiving champion, led a campaign to reinstate the holiday, which had been proclaimed by early presidents but abandoned.\n\nIn 1841, publisher Alexander Young printed a book with Winslow's letter that coined the 1621 harvest feast America's \"First Thanksgiving.\" It stuck. President Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving an official holiday in 1863. It was initially the last Thursday in November and later set as the fourth Thursday of the month.\n\nThanksgiving versus thanksgiving\n\nWinslow's letter detailed a successful first year of harvest for the Pilgrims, with 20 acres of corn and six acres of barley. Peas didn't fare so well.\n\nHe does not use the term \"Thanksgiving\" but describes a three-day feast with Massasoit and his men to \"rejoice together, after we had gathered the fruit of our labors.\" It would have included games, military demonstrations, rejoicing and religious services, said Tom Begley, Plimoth Plantation's executive liaison for administration, research and special projects.\n\nThanking God for their blessings and harvest, according to Begley, was in the tradition of the Pilgrims' Separatist Church.\n\n\"We talk about a capital T and a lowercase t thanksgiving,\" he said. \"The lowercase thanksgiving is the religious day that Separatists and Puritan communities are marking. The capital T is what's become our holiday today.\"\n\nCedric Cromwell, chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, said the first Thanksgiving wasn't the \"Normal Rockwell\" portraits of native people sitting cheerfully on the ground and being served pies.\n\nHe said the feast was a diplomatic effort for peace after the Wampanoag spotted Pilgrims in a field shooting muskets for practice. He said Massasoit sent 90 men their way — only to find out \"what they were doing was planning on how to take us out.\"\n\n\"They said, 'Let's sit down and talk about peace,'\" Cromwell said. \"And so we sat down and came up with 75 years of peace — the longest-standing peace known within this country.\"\n\nThe turkey question\n\nOn Thursday, a week before Thanksgiving, more than 1,000 students on school field trips spread across the plantation, about two miles from the original settlement. They peeked inside Pilgrim homes and a native campsite and talked to museum workers portraying Pilgrims living in Plymouth in the 1620s.\n\n\"There were no formal invitations sent out — that we know of,\" Begley said of the 1621 feast, speaking in front of a replica Wampanoag hut, or wetu, erected last year at Plimoth Plantation to show the close proximity between homes of native people and Pilgrims.\n\nWinslow's letter does not explicitly say their feast included turkey — nor does it mention pies or cake, for that matter — but refers to fowl. Turkey, duck and geese would have been plentiful in the area, Begley said. Winslow also wrote the native people went out and killed five deer for the feast.\n\nThe English colony's governor, William Bradford, in a diary called Plymouth Plantation, singled out the abundance of wild turkey near the settlement, Begley said. Kate Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Plimoth Plantation, said it suggests a \"strong likelihood\" of turkey at the feast.\n\nCromwell, however, doesn't believe turkey, including varieties the Pilgrims brought to America, would have been served. \"Turkey was a European creature,\" he said.\n\nSheehan said pork, venison, rabbit, chicken, pork and goats also would have been available for the first Thanksgiving. Vegetables could have included traditional favorites like squash and pumpkin as well as carrots and turnip greens. Grapes and cherries also would have been available in the area, as would cod, lobster, mussels and other fish.\n\nInspired by the archaeological discoveries by the UMass group, Plimoth Plantation is currently exploring how Pilgrims would have cooked European dishes with the pottery of Native Americans.\n\nFew women at first feast\n\nThe 1621 feast was a male affair.\n\nOnly four married women were living in Plymouth when the feast was held, according to Plimoth Plantation, after so many died from sickness and disease during the colony's first year.\n\nAs for the 90 native people, the Winslow letter refers to Massasoit and his \"men,\" but no women. The letter refers to \"others\" who attended the feast, but Begley said it's unclear who they were.\n\nOne of the Pilgrim women was Winslow's wife, Susanna White Winslow, according to research from the Pilgrim Hall Museum. The museum counts 53 Pilgrims overall: 22 men, nine adolescent boys, five adolescent girls and 13 young children.\n\nPreparing the meal, like any other day, Begley said, would have been the responsibility of the women and children. About 140 are thought to have joined the first Thanksgiving meal.\n\nIn 400th year, Plymouth to highlight natives' story\n\nThe Pilgrims and native people first made contact in March of 1621, Begley said. Pilgrims met Samoset and then Squanto, who introduced Massasoit to the Pilgrims. He said the two sides came to an agreement of mutual alliance, which created the period of peace.\n\nSquanto, a member of the Patuxet tribe, is credited with helping the Pilgrims grow corn. Seven years earlier, in 1614, Squanto was captured by English sailors, brought to Europe and sold as a slave in Spain. He escaped and returned to England before coming back to North America in 1619.\n\nCromwell said the English settlers brought concepts of capitalism, slavery and labor that were foreign to the Wampanoag.\n\n\"That's what that 75 years of peace was about – to teach them our way in survival – but unfortunately the story turns and twists such a different way,\" he said. \"Our women were raped, our children were murdered, our men were murdered. Villages were desecrated.\"\n\nOrganizers of Plymouth 400, a commemoration throughout 2020 that will include a restored Mayflower, say they have put a greater focus on the perspective of native people than past anniversaries. Events next year, including an ancestors walk and indigenous history conference, were organized in consultation with a committee of Wampanoag people.\n\nSince 1970, Native Americans have held a National Day of Mourning on Thanksgiving to recognize the democide of native people throughout American history.\n\n\"For the first time, in an anniversary about the Mayflower's arrival, native people are telling their story,\" said Michele Pecoraro, executive director of Plymouth 400. \"We can't ask native people to be involved and then not talk about what happened to them.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison and on Twitter @joeygarrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/22/thanksgiving-story-native-american-history/71563811007/", "title": "The truth about Thanksgiving: The Indigenous fight against erasure", "text": "Paula Peters remembers learning about the pilgrims' arrival in North America in elementary school, the backstory behind Thanksgiving Day.\n\nAs the teacher explained how \"friendly Indians\" came to help settlers arriving on the Mayflower, Peters was excited to hear about her own history in the classroom. She's a citizen of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe who grew up to become an independent scholar of the history of the Wampanoag, who have inhabited present-day Massachusetts and Eastern Rhode Island for more than 12,000 years, according to the tribe.\n\n\"As a kid, I'm thinking to myself, 'This is great. She's talking about me, and she's talking about my history,'\" Peters told USA TODAY in an interview this month.\n\nBut her wonder was squashed when a classmate asked what happened to those friendly Indians after Thanksgiving.\n\n\"They all died,\" the teacher said.\n\nPeters remembers being shocked at the erasure of a long history that preceded the Mayflower and the Wampanoag's continuation into today.\n\n\"That's the way that our history was being taught for the longest time, and still is in some areas of the country,\" she said.\n\nWith the upcoming holiday, known by many as Thanksgiving but recognized by Native American communities as the National Day of Mourning, Peters and other Indigenous activists and scholars are advocating for the recognition of the Wampanoag's true history. They say that must be grounded in the fact that they existed far before and long after the pilgrims' first harvest feast.\n\n\"I mean, you can't argue with people coming together and celebrating family, good fortune and being thankful. That's an important holiday to have,\" Peters said. \"But it is also a platform that we as Indigenous people have to step on and remind people of the significance of our story and the myths that are perpetuated by the Thanksgiving holiday.\"\n\nWhy is Thanksgiving so expensive?Here's what the data says\n\nThe myth of Thanksgiving\n\nThe Plymouth colonists and the Native American Wampanoag people \"shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the colonies\" in 1621, according to the History Channel.\n\nThe History Channel says that the pilgrims invited the Native Americans to the feast, but Peters said that part is a myth.\n\n\"There wasn't an invitation extended to invite the Wampanoag to come and feast with them,\" she said. \"It was really quite by accident, that there were any shared festivities at all.\"\n\nThe pilgrims were celebrating their first harvest when they fired off muskets repeatedly, a form of entertainment for the settlers.\n\nHearing the blasts, the Wampanoag thought it was a threat. The supreme leader Massasoit Ousamequin assembled a small army of approximately 90 warriors and approached the settlement, much to the surprise of the pilgrims.\n\nAfter deescalating the situation, the pilgrims and the Wampanoag feasted together, though historical texts don't indicate what they might have eaten besides deer hunted by the Wampanoag, as Peters writes in an introduction to \"Of Plimoth Plantation.\"\n\n\"The contemporary holiday perpetuates the myths of the Wampanoag and Pilgrim relations,\" Peters writes in the book. \"It further buries the truths of kidnappings, pestilence and subjugation and ignores the scant details of the tense encounter, while it conjures up Hallmark images of happy Natives and Pilgrims feasting on a cornucopia of corn, pies, and meats, including a fully dressed roast turkey.\"\n\nWhat the Thanksgiving story misses about Indigenous history\n\nPeters said that the years leading up to the arrival of the Mayflower and the first harvest are just as important as what followed. The pilgrims were aided by a couple of Indigenous men who remarkably knew how to speak English, including a man named Squanto.\n\nHis acquired tongue was not a miracle, but a byproduct of tragedy. In 1614, he was part of a group of Native Americans lured onto a ship and and sold into slavery in Spain.\n\nWhen he returned in 1619, his home village of Patuxet had been ravaged by a great plague. In fact, the settlers who came to that same land had to move decaying bodies to make the village that later became Plymouth.\n\nPeters said that story is rarely told, and demonstrates an example of the erasure of Indigenous histories.\n\nThat erasure exists in part to gloss over the ugly parts of American history, said Joseph P. Gone, an enrolled member of the Aaniiih-Gros Ventre Tribal Nation of Montana and a professor at Harvard who researches the intersections of coloniality and mental health in American Indian communities.\n\nThat can have an impact on those whose stories are not being told, he said.\n\n\"We are aware of much more than most people would realize the weight of history and the realities of dispossession that even though these might have happened centuries ago, they linger on in our relationship to America,\" Gone said. \"So we engage today in a constant tussle with American myths about who we were and who we are, in the effort to better imagine a future.\"\n\nMore:New Barbie doll honors Wilma Mankiller, the first female Cherokee principal chief\n\nReconciling the holiday and the history\n\nAlthough the Wampanoag and the pilgrims did not exist as harmoniously as many are taught, many tribal members still take the holiday to celebrate family, Gone and Peters said.\n\nJordan Marie Brings Three White Horses Whetstone of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe in South Dakota started the Truthsgiving Run to bring awareness to Indigenous perspectives and issues.\n\nThe virtual, 4-mile run was created in the summer of 2020 to try to counteract some of the myths around Thanksgiving and the first interactions of between pilgrims and the tribes of first contact, said Whetstone, also the founder and executive director of Indigenous grassroots organizing group Rising Hearts.\n\n\"We really wanted to highlight the truth coming from the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and some of the far more eastern coastal tribes, the first-contact tribes and get their perspectives,\" Whetstone said. \"So (Truthsgiving) was just our way to kind of give a different perspective.

The biggest food holiday of the year is almost here.\n\nThanksgiving, the day we give thanks while stuffing our faces, is Thursday, Nov. 23.\n\nThrough the years, Thanksgiving has become known for spending time with family and friends, watching football and the famous Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and, of course, eating good food.\n\nWhile the holiday's origins may not be as accurate as the tales that appear in children's stories or high school textbooks, many see the day as an opportunity to enjoy the company of loved ones and show gratitude.\n\nBut how did Thanksgiving begin? When was the first celebration, and what did they eat? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nWhen is Thanksgiving 2023?\n\nThanksgiving is on Thursday, Nov. 23, 2023.\n\nOn what day does Thanksgiving fall?\n\nThe holiday falls on the fourth Thursday in November each year.\n\nWhen did Thanksgiving become a federal holiday?\n\nThanksgiving was celebrated independently by colonies and states for more than 200 years, The History Channel reports. Magazine editor and famed author Sarah Josepha Hale became known as the Mother of Thanksgiving for her campaign to establish it as a national holiday.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln answered her call during the Civil War in 1863 and proclaimed a national Thanksgiving would be celebrated on the last Thursday in November.\n\nBut, in 1939, department store mogul Fred Lazarus Jr., concerned that the late Thanksgiving that year would mean less shopping days before Christmas, persuaded President Franklin D. Roosevelt to move Thanksgiving back a week. For a couple years, the confused nation celebrated the holiday on two different days. To end the confusion, Congress passed a joint resolution, signed by Roosevelt on Dec. 26, 1941, that established Thanksgiving as a federal holiday held on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nWhen was the first Thanksgiving?\n\nAccording to the History Channel, the first Thanksgiving celebration is believed to have occurred in 1621.\n\nThe story, historically told from the pilgrim's perspective, is that Plymouth colonists from England shared a meal with the indigenous Wampanoag people to give thanks for a successful fall harvest.\n\nThis lore, however, may not be completely accurate. Most recounts of the event's significance are often overstated, journalist Eryn Dion noted in her reporting.\n\nMembers of the Wampanoag were not formally invited as a gesture of good grace, she says. Instead, the pilgrims became a bit rowdy at their feast and began shooting into the air. Fearing violence, Wampanoag warriors went to see what was occurring, prepared for war (if need be), but saw it was a celebration and eventually joined the feast.\n\nThe second Thanksgiving celebration was held in 1623 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to mark the end of a long drought that threatened the year's harvest. Days of fasting and feasting would soon become common practice in other New England settlements over the years.\n\nWhy do we celebrate Thanksgiving?\n\nThe national holiday began as a celebration of the harvest and other blessings, per the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Thanksgiving, however, has since moved away from its Puritan roots and has become a day to \"symbolize intercultural peace, America's opportunity for newcomers, and the sanctity of home and family.\"\n\nHow is Thanksgiving celebrated?\n\nFor generations, Thanksgiving Day, fondly referred to as Turkey Day, has been celebrated with a large feast consisting of several dishes that vary by culture, ethnicity, state and region. But in most households, you will usually find stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, corn, dinner rolls, cranberry sauce, candied yams, macaroni and cheese, pumpkin pie, and the quintessential main dish: turkey.\n\nThanksgiving Day is also often celebrated with football games, parades, and volunteering, BBC Good Food reports. The day after Thanksgiving has also become its own celebration known as Black Friday. During this day, stores nationwide offer extended hours, discounts and special promotions in preparation for the Christmas shopping season.\n\nWhat was eaten at the first Thanksgiving?\n\nThe History Channel reports that no record exists of the first Thanksgiving menu. Although turkey has become the official mascot of Thanksgiving Day, many historians believe it was likely not a part of the original feast. Here's a list of foods that might've appeared on the table instead:\n\nDeer, likely roasted over a smoldering fire or made into a stew.\n\nLocal vegetables such as onions, beans, lettuce, spinach, cabbage, carrots and peas.\n\nIndigenous fruits such as blueberries, plums, grapes, gooseberries, raspberries and cranberries.\n\nCorn, likely pounded into a thick corn mush or porridge.\n\nVarious types of seafood like mussels, lobster, bass, clams and oysters.\n\nPumpkin custard.\n\nRoot vegetables like turnips and groundnuts.\n\nWhat other countries celebrate Thanksgiving?\n\nThe United States isn't the only country that has a designated holiday for giving thanks. Several other countries and territories also celebrate Thanksgiving. But the dates and reasons for celebrating may vary.\n\nThe countries and territories that celebrate their own versions of Thanksgiving include:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2017/11/16/recreating-first-thanksgiving/861798001/", "title": "The first Thanksgiving, recreated", "text": "Editor's note: This story was originally published on Nov. 23, 2010.\n\nYou think it's tough making a Thanksgiving dinner, from bird to biscuits?\n\nTry making the original Thanksgiving dinner, prepared in 1621 by the Pilgrims to celebrate their first disease-ridden, disaster-plagued year at Plymouth Colony.\n\nI did.\n\nNo Cuisinarts, no stoves, no electric mixers, no microwaves, no forks (that froufrou utensil didn't come in until the 18th century).

In all likelihood, no turkey.\n\n\"We don't really have a lot of details,\" says Kathleen Wall, food historian at Plimoth Plantation, a historic re-creation of the original settlement in Massachusetts.\n\nWhat we know of the first Thanksgiving — other than it was not called Thanksgiving —comes from a single letter from a colonist named Edward Winslow. Writing to a friend in England, he tells of a three-day harvest festival. \"In one day [they] killed as much fowl as ... served the company almost a week,\" he wrote. Local Wampanoag also stopped by for dinner, bringing five deer.\n\nMore:Macy's Parade Studio debuts new floats for 91st Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\n\nMore:Macy's Thanksgiving clowns make the grade at 'Clown U'\n\nMore:What's in your stuffing? Send us your recipes!\n\nAnd that's it. Everything else we know about Thanksgiving comes from the 19th century, when that 1621 letter was unearthed and used as the dubious basis for a national holiday to bind the country together during the Civil War. Promoted relentlessly by Godey's Lady's Book (the Martha Stewart Living of its day), Thanksgiving became an official holiday in 1863.\n\nSo ... what to whip up, in the 21st century, to approximate the menu on that first turkey day?\n\nTurkey? Maybe. But the \"fowl\" referred to in the letter was more likely duck or goose. We opted for the latter. Also venison. And a few side dishes that were not mentioned but would have been familiar to the early settlers: stewed pumpkin, boiled root vegetables, boiled cranberries and corn grits. Easy peasy, right?\n\nNot so fast there, Priscilla.\n\nStart with the corn — which has been bred, hybridized and improved over 400 years into something the Pilgrims wouldn't have recognized. What we need is flint corn, now nearly extinct.\n\n\"Nobody grows it, it's a poor-yielding crop,\" said Paul Drumm III, owner of Kenyon's Grist Mill in Rhode Island, whom we contacted about getting some. However, Drumm knew a local farmer who sometimes grew it as a hobby. Through him, Drumm was kindly able to send us 12 ears of the most knobbly, hard, unappetizing corn you ever saw.\n\n\"I'm laughing, because I don't think you know what you're in for,\" says Mary Karr, outkitchen cook at New Bridge Landing historic site in River Edge.\n\nShe and Barbara Flurchick, senior kitchen cook at the Bergen County Historical Society, have agreed to help me prepare the meal in a fit setting: a replica 18th-century outkitchen at New Bridge Landing. We'll be using only the tools the Pilgrims used.\n\nRight about now, I'm wishing for a labor-saving device to rescue me from the torment of de-kerneling 12 ears of rough, hardened corn by hand. By about Ear 6, I have blisters. By the time I'm finished, my hands are numb. \"They used to stuff mattresses with the cobs,\" Karr remarks.\n\nNow comes the hard part. The corn kernels are put in a mortar made from a hollowed-out log, and pounded with a stone pestle. And pounded. And pounded. Periodically, the meal is sifted, like gold nuggets, through a strainer. After about an hour and 45 minutes, I have two-thirds of a cup of cornmeal.\n\n\"Faster, faster,\" says Karr, being droll.\n\nI have generously left Flurchick the job of cutting off the goose's head and webbed feet, and splaying its poor little body over an outdoor fire (geese are super-greasy; they can start fires indoors). By rights, I should have shot the goose and the deer myself — preferably with a blunderbuss — so already we're cheating.\n\n\"I brought a modern meat thermometer with me to do some quiet testing,\" Flurchick admits. \"I want to be sure it's done correctly.\"\n\nIndoors, Karr has cut the marinated venison into pieces and thrown them in an iron kettle. It will cook in the fireplace. So — in various kettles and cauldrons — will the boiled vegetables (parsnips, turnips and cabbage), the stewed pumpkin, the boiled cranberries and the corn grits. The kettles all hang by chains; the temperature is controlled by moving the kettle up and down the chain, or rehanging it in another part of the hearth. \"It's a system of cooking: up and down, front to back, side to side,\" Karr says. \"It's a pain in the neck.\"\n\nI, meanwhile, am making butter. Don't ask.\n\nA quick restaurant review: Our five guests found our 1621 Thanksgiving feast to be non-lethal (all of them, at the insistence of New Bridge Landing, had to sign a waiver). Most thought it tasty, but perhaps a bit bland. The Pilgrims had few condiments, fewer sweeteners; there was no sugar trade with the West Indies, honeybees hadn't been introduced yet and they were too far south to tap maple trees. Spices were precious.\n\n\"They would have had a little box like this,\" says Karr, drawing out a little lockbox full of tiny spice bottles.\n\nSo what to top off a 1621 meal with? A 1621 cleanup, of course — buckets of boiling water, and a scrubber made of corn grass. No sinks, no dishwashers, no Brillo.\n\n\"Now this,\" Flurchick says, \"is the hard part.\"\n\nROAST GOOSE\n\n1 10- to 12-pound goose, fat removed from cavity\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper\n\nPosition a rack at the lowest level of the oven.

According to historic accounts, however, Europeans had been visiting New England since at least the late 1400s. The Basques, English and French had a thriving fishing industry off the coast of Maine and New England. The first documented European to make contact with either the Narragansetts or the Wampanoags in Southern New England was Italian explorer Giovanni de Verrazano, who, in 1524, while sailing for the French, traveled up Narragansett Bay and traded with the Native people he found there.\n\nIn fact, several Native Americans in the area spoke English by the time the Pilgrims arrived in 1620, picked up either through trading encounters or by previously being taken into slavery by the English but either escaping or being returned to the area. Samoset, Tisquantum, or “Squanto,” and Epenow, all spoke English and played important roles in burgeoning relations between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoags, as detailed by historian and author David Silverman in his book, \"This Land Is Their Land: The Wampanoag Indians, Plymouth Colony, and the Troubled History of Thanksgiving.\"\n\nMyth: The Pilgrims came to the New World seeking religious freedom.\n\nThe group we most often associate with the Pilgrims — the Puritan congregation that separated from the Church of England — did, at least partially, come to America looking for a place where they could practice their religion without persecution. Puritans made up less than half of the more than 100 people who crossed the Atlantic on the Mayflower and settled what would eventually become Plymouth, as detailed in William Bradford's \"Of Plimouth Plantation.\"\n\nThe main reason they came to America was to maintain their English culture and to make money. After splitting off from the Church of England near the turn of the 17th century, the congregation fled to Holland, which allowed for more religious freedom. But they found it difficult to find jobs to support themselves,.......... and were worried their children were being too influenced by Dutch culture and morals.\n\nThey secured a charter from The London Company to start a colony in America — England’s second, after Jamestown in Virginia — and began gathering a group of people to travel with them, mainly servants, explorers and sailors. It’s also worth noting that, while the Pilgrims wanted the freedom to practice their religion, that freedom did not extend to anyone else. One of their main goals was to convert the Native people to Christianity.\n\nMyth: The Pilgrims intended to settle in Patuxet/Plymouth or, alternately, the Pilgrims meant to settle in Virginia but they were blown off course.\n\nWhile the story of the first Thanksgiving usually starts with the Pilgrims completing their oceanic crossing by stepping off the Mayflower onto Plymouth Rock (another myth!) the area then known as Patuxet and later christened Plymouth was actually the Pilgrims’ second landing. On Nov. 11, 1620, the voyagers dropped anchor on the tip of Cape Cod and came ashore at what is now Provincetown.\n\nThey were driven off about a month later, due to intimidation by Nauset tribesmen, who did not take kindly to the new European arrivals. The Pilgrims got back on the ship and sailed farther into Cape Cod Bay to settle at the site of the relatively abandoned Wampanoag village of Patuxet in December. Most of the Pilgrims spent the rest of the winter living on the Mayflower until enough buildings were built and they could settle the area in earnest in 1621.\n\nAlternatively, there is an idea that the Pilgrims were originally meant to settle in Virginia, near England’s first colony, Jamestown. While Virginia was considered by the Pilgrims as a destination, the charter granted to them by The London Company covered the area north of Virginia, named New England. As Bradford writes, their destination was meant to be the area around the mouth of the Hudson River, where Dutch traders had tapped into the lucrative fur trade. The Pilgrim's goal was to claim that area, and the fur trade, for England.\n\nWhen the Pilgrims sighted Cape Cod, they realized they’d been blown off course and tried to head south for the Hudson River, only to encounter dangerously rocky shoals causing them to turn back. Since Cape Cod technically was part of New England, they decided to stay there.\n\nMyth: The Pilgrims and Wampanoags came together in November 1621 for a Thanksgiving feast.\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack with this one, and not just because it forms the basis of our country’s Thanksgiving Day story.\n\nFirst, while the Puritans did have “days of Thanksgiving” they were literally the opposite of a big, fun, family feast. They were usually days of fasting and prayer that maybe would be broken with a larger meal.\n\nEdward Winslow, in his writing about the first few years in Plymouth titled “Mourt’s Relation: A Journal of the Pilgrims in Plymouth,” does mention a celebration marking the settlement’s first successful harvest, probably held around October 1621. Given the context, it certainly wasn’t a huge deal but it would later become one in modern America.\n\nAccording to Winslow, despite the fact that the Wampanoags had allowed the Pilgrims to live on their land, provided them with aid and taught them how to successfully grow native crops, the Wampanoags were not invited to this celebration. They arrived only after the Pilgrims started shooting their guns into the air. Believing themselves to be under attack, the Wampanoags head sachem, Massasoit, showed up at the settlement with about 90 warriors expecting war. Instead, they found a celebration and they decided to stay, with their hunters bringing in five deer as a contribution. Rather than a happy celebration of camaraderie and partnership, the feast that would serve as the basis of the traditional Thanksgiving myth was actually quite a tense affair, fraught with political implications.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/11/24/what-do-native-americans-really-think-thanksgiving/8739438002/", "title": "What do Native Americans really think about Thanksgiving?", "text": "The first Thanksgiving is generally regarded in history as a friendly gathering among pilgrims and the Wampanoag Tribe.\n\nBut as we learned from Eryn Dion in last year's edition of This is America, the first Thanksgiving actually has a fraught history, as the pilgrims later violated their agreements and attacked and encroached upon Wampanoag lands. This brutality was not uncommon — upon arrival in America, Europeans broke promises and inflicted violence, disease and assimilation against Native people nationwide for generations.\n\nI'm Nora Mabie, a reporter focusing on Indigenous communities for the Great Falls Tribune, part of the USA TODAY Network. And, of course, you're reading This is America, a newsletter about race, identity and how it shapes our lives.\n\nThe question we pose this edition: What do Native Americans think about Thanksgiving? The Great Falls Tribune surveyed more than 40 Indigenous people across 12 tribes. For some, Thanksgiving is a day to honor ancestors and be with family; for others, it's a stark reminder of oppression.\n\nBut first, race and justice news we're watching\n\nHere's what Indigenous people said about Thanksgiving\n\n(Responses are edited for length and clarity).\n\nKasey Salois, 24, Blackfeet and Little Shell: Thanksgiving may have started out with the pilgrims, but we have made it our own. We can't change the past but we can't let it define us either. This holiday is less about celebrating the past for us and instead celebrating what we have and what we can look forward to. We do a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, and we have a lot to be thankful for.\n\nJason Rosette, 45, Chippewa Cree: Thanksgiving means eating with your family, and because of that, I'm grateful. But I feel the truth needs to be told about how America was really founded. It was founded on the murder of my ancestors and the robbery of our land. The only way we can overcome historical trauma is by teaching the truth in schools.\n\nDavid Coldwell, 63, Blackfeet: I used to celebrate, but I no longer will. Had I known the real history, I never would've celebrated. I didn't learn the truth in history class growing up. Native Americans weren't talked about.\n\nLilly Juneau, 18, Fort Peck Sioux: I celebrate it in the name of family and remembrance of my ancestors. It's also a sad day reflecting on the atrocities that happen to Native people.\n\nBrandy Unruh, 43, Confederated Salish and Kootenai and Cree: I have mixed feelings on Thanksgiving. I have two sides because my dad's family came through Ellis Island, and my mom's family was Bitterroot Salish and Cree. Without them, I wouldn't be here, so I focus on the positive. I love the holidays because we get a break from work and school to spend time with our families.\n\nLeslie Stump-Meyers, 35, Chippewa Cree: Celebrating the colonization of Indigenous people is sad. Instead, we celebrate by remembering what our ancestors went through and how they persevered.\n\nKirby Drake, 36, Crow: It's somber, but I like the food. I definitely don't partake in the common myths of the Natives and pilgrims being friends. Instead, I focus on gratitude.\n\nMatt Wacker, 49, Blackfeet, Haida, Tlingit and Cherokee: I give thanks for what my ancestors survived over many generations. I'm proud but also saddened by their struggles and the lack of acknowledgment by the broader population.\n\nSunni Grotberg, 20, Little Shell: I love Thanksgiving. I'm familiar with the horrific events after the first Thanksgiving, but I choose not to let hatred fester. I believe it's important to know and remember what happened in the past so we don't repeat the same mistakes, but it's equally important to forgive.\n\nRachel Wilson, 44, Little Shell: My family celebrates Thanksgiving in honor of the kindness and generosity the Indigenous people showed the Europeans.\n\nHeather LaMere, 38, Chippewa Cree: This holiday started out as a gathering between different nations. There were hidden intentions, but we, as Native Americans, have grown. I do feel happy and blessed by Thanksgiving, as it allows me to give thanks not only to my family and friends but to my ancestors as well.\n\nYolanda Swearinger, 64, Blackfeet: My family never celebrated Thanksgiving, so when I was in school, I found it odd — the idealism that the pilgrims and Natives shared a table with an abundance of food and we all got along. Our reality is so different, and nowadays, I educate my grandchildren on our history and what we Natives have done for this world.\n\nJasmine RunningRabbit-Bercier, 24, Blackfeet: I love Thanksgiving. My family hasn't been together in years, and this is the first Thanksgiving we'll all be together. I'm excited and ready to be around my loved ones.\n\nCarma Corcoran, 65, Chippewa Cree: I don't celebrate the holiday. It makes me angry and sad.\n\nDebra Upham, 65, Blackfeet: I feel like it was the beginning of the end of our way of life. It started on the East Coast and quickly moved west. For me, it's just a meal.\n\nDion Ontiveros, 52, Chippewa Cree: We celebrate it as a gathering with family. Historically, this holiday is built on lies. Natives were murdered by the millions after helping and teaching the white men.\n\nAhanu Boyle, 20, Blackfeet: I don't like Thanksgiving.

As for that 1621 feast — the supposed genesis of today’s Thanksgiving tradition — there was a small feast, but the Wampanoag were not invited, they showed up later. Their role in helping the Pilgrims survive by sharing resources and wisdom went unacknowledged that day, according to accounts of the toasts given by Pilgrim leaders.\n\nLincoln’s first Thanksgiving Day didn't mention Pilgrims\n\nThe first national Thanksgiving Day did not invoke the Pilgrims at all. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared a Thanksgiving Day on the last Thursday of November, looking to reconcile a country in the throes of the Civil War.\n\nOn a parallel track, the story of the Pilgrim forefathers coming to the New World and founding America for religious freedom gained steam, as New England Protestants wielded the myth to gain the top spot in the country’s cultural hierarchy, above Catholics and immigrants, according to historian David Silverman in his book “This Land Is Their Land: The Wampanoag Indians, Plymouth Colony and the Troubled History of Thanksgiving.”\n\nAs Americans looked for an origin story that wasn’t soaked in the blood of Native Americans or built on the backs of slavery, the humble, bloodless story of the 102 Pilgrims forging a path in the New World in search of religious freedom was just what they needed, according to Silverman. Regardless of whether it was rooted in historical fact, it became accepted as such.\n\nMore: Not all Native Americans celebrate Thanksgiving. Find out why.\n\nIn 1963, these two tracks crossed when President John F. Kennedy, whose family frolicked in the home of the native Nauset and Aquinnah people on Cape Cod and Martha’s Vineyard, immortalized them in his own Thanksgiving Day proclamation, baking the plaits together like the bread broken and shared in the mythic first Thanksgiving feast.\n\nThe historically accurate story of the Pilgrims and the founding of Plymouth Colony 400 years ago this month is not in most school history books. It also is not the one you’ll find at Pilgrim Memorial Park in Plymouth, home of the famed Plymouth Rock and the Mayflower II, a replica of the cargo ship turned people carrier the Pilgrims crammed into to cross the Atlantic.\n\nThe more historically accurate telling is gaining a foothold in small circles, as members of the Herring Pond, Mashpee and Aquinnah Wampanoag tribes; Michele Pecoraro, executive director of Plymouth 400, who is helping lead the anniversary commemoration; and Silverman bring the documented facts to light.\n\n“How are we supposed to improve on this sorry record if we don’t understand the sorry record?” asked Silverman, a George Washington University professor.\n\n“I think the only way forward is to understand the history the way that it happened,” Steven Peters, a spokesman for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, said. He and other Mashpee and Herring Pond Wampanoag tribe members have been working with museums and on platforms such as Vimeo to elevate the history of the indigenous people who lived in the region for thousands of years before the Pilgrims arrived.\n\n“At that point, it really changes your perspective.”\n\nHostility, slavery and pandemic\n\nTradition dictates the Pilgrims’ story starts in September 1620, with the departure of the Mayflower, packed with colonists and sailors, leaving England to set sail for the New World.\n\nBut starting there ignores years of European contact with the Native people of New England, and paints the Wampanoag and their neighbors in the broad stroke of simplicity, ignoring the complex regional relationships and politicking at play.\n\nThe story could start a century earlier, in 1524, at the first known contact between Native Americans in southern New England and Europeans, in Narragansett Bay near Aquidneck Island.\n\nPilgrim myths: Don't believe everything your kindergarten teacher told you\n\nOr 1602, when Bartholomew Gosnold visited Cape Cod and what’s now known as Martha’s Vineyard, where contact with the Wampanoag started with trading and ended in violence. As Silverman writes in his book, future annual encounters between the two would follow this same, high-tension pattern.\n\nOr in 1614, when a Nauset (Cape Cod) tribe member named Epenow was captured by Europeans and kept in bondage for three years. He engineered an escape and returned to his people on Martha’s Vineyard. That same year, Tisquantum, later known as Squanto, and 19 other Wampanoag men were lured on to an English ship, taken captive and sold into slavery.\n\nTisquantum, who spent time in Spain and London, would later return to Patuxet (now Plymouth) and he and Epenow would play important roles in burgeoning Wampanoag-Pilgrim relations. Only Squanto was immortalized in the Pilgrim story.\n\nBut perhaps the best starting point, according to Peters and other historians, is 1616, when a lethal pandemic tore through many Wampanoag villages. In three years, once populous villages like Patuxet, where the Pilgrims would eventually settle, were “utterly void” of people, as English explorer Thomas Dermer wrote. Further threatening the existence of the Wampanoag, the Narragansett Tribe, their powerful western rivals, were left largely untouched.\n\n\"We weren't used to diseases here,\" said Hazel Currence, an elder with the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe, which lived in Patuxet. \"Our systems were not used to the illnesses that came with the Europeans and the Pilgrims.\"\n\nA nation diminished:Pilgrims’ arrival in Provincetown 400 years ago spawned a clash of cultures\n\nMayflower Compact:The beginning of American democracy on Cape Cod\n\nSo by 1620, the Wampanoag, as Peters describes, were in a “difficult spot,” shaped by years of volatile contact with Europeans, slavery, regional threats to their power and a mysterious, devastating illness.\n\n“For me, that’s a really important place to start, because you understand the big decisions that were made,” Peters said. “It would have been a hugely complex situation.”\n\nWhy Massasoit helped the Pilgrims\n\nWhen the Mayflower anchored off what is now known as Provincetown, the Pilgrims found themselves not in a vast, untouched land held for them by divine province, but amid indigenous people wary and distrustful of Europeans, and the complex politics of rival tribes.\n\nIt’s hard to separate the Pilgrims, from what the United States would eventually become, Silverman said. It’s easy to believe they arrived here seeking religious freedom and intending to eventually form their own country based on those ideals, he said.\n\n“Many white Americans hold it very dear, the idea that the main impetus for colonization was the search for religious freedom,” Silverman said. “If you ask the general public, even educated people, that's the most common explanation. It's not right.”\n\nThe congregation of Puritans within the Pilgrims did break off from the Church of England for religious reasons, but that brought them to Holland, where they were free to practice their religion. After a decade of struggling to find jobs and fearing the Dutch influence on their children, the congregants sought a charter from The London Company to start a colony in America, although it was originally granted for land around the mouth of the Hudson River.\n\nThe Pilgrims’ main concerns were their own survival in the New World and turning a profit for those who backed the venture. That survival was made possible with help from the Wampanoag, the piece left unsaid at the feast that would become Thanksgiving.\n\nThe decision to help the Pilgrims, whose ilk had been raiding Native villages and enslaving their people for nearly a century, came after they stole Native food and seed stores and dug up Native graves, pocketing funerary offerings, as described by Pilgrim leader Edward Winslow in “Mourt’s Relation: A Journal of the Pilgrims at Plymouth,” published in 1622.\n\nThat decision was made by Ousamequin, more commonly known as Massasoit, which means “great sachem.” In a structure that Peters says was far closer to a democratic government than the Pilgrim government, Wampanoag territory was organized into sachemships, each with a sachem — a leader — who would oversee that particular village. Sachems ruled by the will of the people. Each sachemship was independent but had relationships with the other sachemships, all coming under the purview of the great sachem.\n\nMassasoit has gone through a bit of a rebrand in the ensuing centuries to be painted as the “protector and preserver” of the Pilgrims — as it says on the statue dedicated to him overlooking Plymouth Rock. But his decision to allow the Pilgrims to stay at Patuxet (now Plymouth) and eventually provide them aid after they were driven off the Cape, Peters said, had less to do with a sense of dutiful benevolence and more to do with a careful weighing of circumstances and outcomes.\n\nDriving off or killing the Pilgrims, as many tribes, including the Nauset and specifically Epenow, wanted, was a valid option. From their point of view, whatever benefit they might gain would not be worth the threat of betrayal, violence and enslavement that seemed to follow contact with the Europeans. But it would cost valuable warriors, in short supply after the pandemic, and there was the risk of Europeans returning in overwhelming numbers or, worse, sailing around the Outer Cape to take their guns, knives and armor to the Narragansett, according to Silverman.\n\nAllowing the Pilgrims to settle and establishing diplomatic relations with them, even providing aid, brought risks but also reward. The guns, knives and armor the Pilgrims carried would intimidate enemies threatening Wampanoag territory. And, after generations of trading secondhand and thirdhand for coveted European goods from neighboring Native peoples, the Wampanoag would finally gain a firsthand source and considerable trading power.\n\nMassasoit weighed the risks and concluded it was better to have the danger on his side than have to face it.\n\n“We needed a friend,” Peters said. “We needed an ally. That would have been a really difficult decision for them to make.”\n\nWampanoag and Pilgrims: A deal and a meal\n\nAs these debates were happening among the Wampanoag, the Pilgrims, most of whom were still living on the cramped and creaking Mayflower, struggled to survive the winter. Half of them died of illness, cold, starvation or a combination of the three.\n\nThroughout the season, the Wampanoag made their presence known but did not approach until February, when Samoset, a visiting Abenaki tribesman from Maine, approached Pilgrim leaders. He spoke English and carried a subtle message — the Wampanoag were ready for peace or war with their new neighbors, and the Pilgrims needed to make their intentions clear.\n\nSeveral weeks later, in late March, diplomatic relations between the two groups formally opened when Massasoit arrived in Plymouth, his face painted deep red, and flanked by about 60 intimidating warriors. With Tisquantum acting as a broker, the two groups worked out a kind of alliance through a series of visits, exchanges and the belief, at least on the part of the Wampanoag, that this small band of Pilgrims would stay just that: small.\n\n“I don’t think anyone at that point would have gone into an agreement with the Pilgrims if they knew how quickly they would multiply and start arriving,” Peters said.\n\nSeveral months later, after receiving help and protection from the Wampanoag, the Pilgrims held the harvest feast that would form the crux of the Thanksgiving myth centuries later. Wampanoag members were not even invited, but they showed up. A group of about 100 men and Massasoit came not to celebrate but, according to Peters, mostly as a reminder that they controlled the land the Pilgrims were staying on and they vastly outnumbered their new European neighbors.\n\nThis is where the traditional telling of the Pilgrims and the Thanksgiving myth ends, with the two groups sitting down to dinner, celebrating their partnership and, for the Pilgrims, celebrating their successful colony and toasting to a future to come. But in the same way the real story stretches back before the arrival of the Pilgrims, it stretches forward.\n\nIn a little more than 50 years, European settlers would vastly outnumber the indigenous people, with growing settlements such as the Massachusetts Bay Colony to the north and Rhode Island to the south.\n\nBy the 1670s Massasoit was dead and his son Wamsutta had died after he was imprisoned in Plymouth for negotiating a land sale to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. At the same time, colonists were pressing deeper and deeper across the region. Relations between the settlers and the Native people would deteriorate into the devastating King Philip's War, which ended with death, enslavement or displacement for the majority of the Native people living in southern New England.\n\nThe head of another of Massasoit’s sons, Metacomet, better known as King Philip, was mounted on a pike outside Plymouth Colony as a warning, and the descendants of Massasoit, the Pilgrims’ great “protector and preserver,” were captured and sold into slavery in the West Indies.\n\nThere’s a reason this part of the story did not make it into school history books and pageants or get remembered on Thanksgiving.\n\n“It’s not a fun story,” Peters said, but its telling brings the focus away from the white Europeans, the Pilgrims, and shifts the balance back to the people who were harmed. Its telling builds the empathy that has been sorely lacking when it comes to Native American lives.\n\n“No one has acknowledged these atrocities happened,” Peters said, bringing up King Philip's War. “Yet when we talk about it, there’s zero empathy. The native life doesn’t hold the same value.\n\n“I think if we can get people to come to terms with the history and the way it happened, they can start to look at Native American lives on the same plane as European lives,” he said.\n\nRaising up Native voices\n\nTrying to move that focus, as Michele Pecoraro and Plymouth 400 have done for their commemoration, comes with pushback — people saying they shouldn’t use their organization and the 400th anniversary to disparage the Pilgrims. But when you’ve been telling a story one way for four centuries, any change feels like a monumental one, she said.\n\n“I do believe that the way we’ve gone about it is as balanced as we could make it,” said Pecoraro, who is helping lead the commemoration. “In order to balance something like this, you have to swing the pendulum a little more to one side.”\n\nTo bring the commemorations into the 21st century, Pecoraro and her group worked to elevate the voices of the Wampanoag, who still live in southern New England.\n\nThe Wampanoag have survived and clung to their culture despite centuries of systemic removal from their land, destruction of their culture and denial of their rights. More recently, the Trump administration has been working to revoke the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe’s federal tribal status and hundreds of acres of previously recognized tribal lands.\n\n\"Out of the 69 tribes of just Wampanoag people who lived here pre-contact, only three — the Herring Pond, the Aquinnah and the Mashpee, plus a band of Assonet peoples, are still here,\" said Troy Currence, a medicine man with the Herring Pond Tribe. \"We're lucky to be one of them. We survived. We’re still here. We have a chance to reclaim our language and our history and re-educate people. We didn't go away, we adapted.\"\n\nAt the same time, Peters does not think Thanksgiving should go the way of Confederate statues and names of slaveholders on buildings as the nation reckons with its history.\n\nHe will continue to celebrate Thanksgiving — something he and his family do every year, after the National Day of Mourning in Plymouth. But it is important to bring the other side of history to light, he said, correcting inaccuracies and adding context to monuments and museums.\n\n“Even though it’s inaccurate, we can’t just bury it,” he said. “There’s a place where those things do belong, as a point that we don’t make that mistake ever again.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/causes/2017/11/20/prof-talks-truth-behind-story-thanksgiving/875857001/", "title": "Prof says 'there was really no first Thanksgiving'", "text": "Zachary Boehm\n\nFSU Communications\n\nWhen millions of American’s sit down for Thanksgiving dinner this month, they will retell the story of peaceable Pilgrims gathering with their Native American neighbors to enjoy the bounty of a fruitful harvest.\n\nThere’s only one problem, said Florida State University’s Allen Morris Associate Professor of History Andrew K. Frank. That famous first Thanksgiving feast is a myth.\n\n“Historically, there was really no first Thanksgiving,” Frank said. “There were regional days of thanks in the colonial past, and they told their own localized stories, but the classic first Thanksgiving story is largely an invention.”\n\nIn 17th century Massachusetts, early colonists adopted a story that broadly mirrors the contemporary Thanksgiving tale. They used the story of a neighborly banquet with Native Americans to frame the customs of their own annual day of thanks.\n\nHowever, Virginians at the time were telling a different story entirely. Their moment of thanks and appreciation was tethered to the story of Pocahontas and the Englishman John Smith.\n\nElsewhere, various stories of colonial and Native fellowship were used as founding myths for regionalized days of thanks and reflection. These parables, said Frank, provided frameworks of tradition for colonial days of thanksgiving, but they have very little to do with the holiday that we now celebrate every fourth Thursday of November.\n\n“Asking about the first Thanksgiving is a bit like asking about the first Easter Bunny,” Frank said. “There was never one Thanksgiving moment that inspired the national holiday. Instead, there were regional traditions, normally connected to the harvest, that began to emerge in the 17th century.”\n\nHundreds of years after these provincial customs first appeared, President Abraham Lincoln called for the first national day of thanksgiving. Lincoln’s motivations had little to do with Pilgrims or Pocahontas — his aim was to encourage a day of appreciation and comity between the North and the South and to lay the groundwork for reunification after the bloody Civil War.\n\nIt wasn’t until the 20th century that President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared Thanksgiving an official federal holiday to be observed the fourth Thursday of November. By formally enshrining the holiday, Frank said, Roosevelt was engaging in a canny piece of statesmanship.\n\n“By picking a particular Thursday every year and putting it on the national calendar, Roosevelt was doing the work of nation building,” he said. “Scholars argue that to be a nation, citizens have to imagine themselves as being part of one big community that shares a collective past, true or otherwise. Thanksgiving helps to serve that function.”\n\nWhile the founding story of Thanksgiving now exists as a fixture of our national mythology, Frank said the tale of Pilgrims and Native Americans can promote a narrow, exclusionary understanding of American history.\n\nFor one, the widespread acceptance of a regional Massachusetts fable as the definitive Thanksgiving story ignores the tapestry of other colonial stories that inspired days of communion and gratitude.\n\n“There were many historical moments when people came together and broke proverbial bread,” Frank said. “The fact that we’ve chosen to latch onto this Massachusetts story gives us a false sense that Massachusetts is the origin of the United States.”\n\nMore importantly, Frank said, the story of Thanksgiving tends to sanitize the fraught, often violent relationship between the colonists and Native Americans.\n\nWhile there were intermittent episodes of harmony between Native Americans and their new colonial neighbors, these periods always occurred against a backdrop of conquest and colonization.\n\n“The idea that things were really peaceful and nice for such a long period of time is totally misguided,” Frank said. “People have begun to use Thanksgiving as an opportunity to realize that these stories gloss over what many would consider a history of genocide. The holiday allows people to stuff their faces in really wonderful ways, but at the same time we know these stories hide a pretty traumatic history.”\n\nFrank said he believes Thanksgiving would be just as meaningful without invented folk tales of fictional feasts.\n\n“It’s frustrating when the holiday is reduced to a third-grade play with construction paper Pilgrim hats,” he said. “I think we could have Thanksgiving without the fake story behind it all. Lincoln’s idea of taking a moment to think about what we do have rather than what we fear is enough, and I don’t feel like we need Puritans to teach us how to do that.”\n\nShare food and cheer\n\nPremier Fine Homes is coordinating this year’s 33rd annual Tallahassee Community Thanksgiving Celebration at Lake Ella.\n\nOnThursday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., a traditional Thanksgiving meal will be offered and shared at the American Legion Post 13, 229 Lake Ella Drive.

Many families are spending their first Thanksgiving dinner together since World War I began. It’s a time of celebration, hope, and defined gender roles. Oh, how things have changed! (Except for the menu. The menu hasn’t really changed.) Here’s a look at Thanksgiving over the past 100 years.\n\nTHE COOKS\n\nThe first Thanksgiving meal was prepared 100% by women (only four of them, to be exact). Today, the duties are split a little more evenly with 84% of men helping with the meal in some way, and 42% of men cooking the actual turkey.\n\nTHE DRINKS\n\nThe prohibition era was just getting started in 1919, which surprisingly (or not!), birthed some delicious cocktails that Americans still consume on the regular. Highballs, French 75s, Sidecars … the list goes on. People back then were more apt to consume these cocktails in secret, though — not around the Thanksgiving table.\n\nFast-forward 100 years, and we’re drinking everything at the Thanksgiving table: apple cider mimosas, pumpkin pie martinis, and wine. Lots of wine.\n\nMore:Wine taste test: Is $50 wine really better than $5 wine?\n\nFRIENDSGIVING\n\nIt’s hard to pin down exactly when Friendsgiving became a thing. Some say it began in 2008 when the economy took a nosedive, and millenials who had moved to urban areas could no longer afford plane tickets back to their hometowns.\n\nOthers argue that the TV show Friends created Friendsgiving. The term was coined by Urban Dictionary in 2009, so it’s been a thing for at least a decade, and it doesn’t necessarily take place on Thanksgiving Thursday.\n\nTHE MENU\n\nAlthough 88% of Americans consume turkey on Thanksgiving Day, the first Thanksgiving in 1621 most likely featured deer or fowl as the main dish. Writer Sarah Josepha Hale (author of “Mary Had a Little Lamb”) can take most of the credit for turkey’s Thanksgiving takeover. She campaigned heavily for Thanksgiving to become a national holiday and even included an entire chapter on turkey as the main dish in her book “Northwood: A Tale of New England” in 1827.\n\nAs shown in this menu from 1919, the meal remains similar in 2019: turkey, a cranberry dish, mashed potatoes, creamed cauliflower (a trendy replacement for mashed potatoes), pumpkin pie … not a lot has changed.\n\nMore:Cheesy cauliflower mashed potatoes: Get the recipe\n\nTURKEY TROTS\n\nThanksgiving may be a huge day for food consumption, but it’s also the most popular day of the year to run in a race. Thanksgiving 5Ks — “Turkey trots” — have been around since 1896, when the Buffalo YMCA hosted their first holiday 8K. These days, more than 14,000 runners will run in more than 1,000 turkey trots all over America.\n\nSHOPPING ON THANKSGIVING DAY\n\nAlthough the dismal origins of Black Friday go back to 1869, only in the last decade have stores begun to open for shopping on Thanksgiving Day — amidst massive backlash from consumers and employees.\n\nWhatever your feelings are toward shopping on Thanksgiving Day or Black Friday, most Americans can get behind Small Business Saturday. American Express came up with the idea in 2010 to encourage spending in local shops during the holiday weekend.\n\nBLACK[OUT] WEDNESDAY, AKA THANKSGIVING EVE DRINKING\n\nWe are definitely not in the prohibition era anymore. Given that many Americans don’t work on Thanksgiving Day and a fair amount of college students come home for the holiday, the night before Thanksgiving has become a night of binge drinking for many. In 2006, the term Black Wednesday (aka Blackout Wednesday or Thanksgiving Eve) was coined; since then, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) recognizes it as the deadliest holiday of the year because of an increased number of drunk drivers on the road. MADD even partnered with Uber last year to offer free rides on Thanksgiving Eve in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nThe first official Thanksgiving NFL game took place between the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears in 1934, but playing football on this particular holiday can be traced back to 1869. Since 2006, this day has turned into a triple-game day with more than 30 million viewers tuning in post-feast.\n\nThis year, no matter who you choose to celebrate with (family or friends), what you choose to do (run a race or go shopping), or what you choose to eat (probably turkey), stay safe and enjoy this moment in history.\n\nNow, more and more people are growing their own herbs and vegetables for homemade dinners.

Our seven-part guide helps you minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you’re feeling ruffled by recent reports that turkey prices are on the rise, don’t panic. There’s no need to start hoarding turkeys.\n\n“We’re not seeing a shortage of supply,” said Ben Del Coro, vice president of sales and marketing at Fossil Farms, a New Jersey-based purveyor of sustainable and all-natural meats and farm-raised game.\n\nUnlike last holiday season, where supply chain and labor issues caused ingredient shortages, there should be enough frozen turkeys to go around for Thanksgiving. However, avian flu outbreaks and inflation’s impact on fuel, feed and labor costs have contributed to higher prices for turkeys.\n\nWhole frozen turkey prices have increased from $1.15 per pound at this time in 2021 to $1.47 per pound for the week of October 28-November 3, 2022, according to the US Department of Agriculture. While that’s nearly a 28% increase per pound, “the overall costs are in line with what everyone has been experiencing all year” with food prices and inflation, Del Coro said. Indeed, costs for all turkey parts have increased across the board, including bone-in fresh and frozen breasts, drumsticks and ground meat.\n\nIn case such prices seem affordably low, they are not the final ones you’ll see in the butcher case. As Del Coro explained, the USDA weekly pricing report shows wholesale pricing for commodity birds — not free-range, organic or any other so-called premium descriptor. Distributors and retailers add markup costs before the turkey gets to your cart.\n\nFor those who had planned on cooking the traditional turkey for Thanksgiving, this year might be the time to try something different. “The purchasing trends have shifted,” Del Coro said. “For the past two years, people have been eating at home and hosting smaller gatherings,” while restaurants and hotels pulled back on serving large Thanksgiving feasts.\n\nWith more options returning for dining out on Thanksgiving, there’s “increased demand on the same supply,” he said. “Now wholesale is coming back, but retail demand is still there.” While home cooks will likely be able to find a frozen turkey at the market, the size and price may not be ideal.\n\nIf you’re feeling adventurous or considering opting out of serving turkey this year, here are some alternatives for the Thanksgiving menu.\n\nTry a different bird or cut of meat\n\n“I personally understand that Thanksgiving is all about tradition, but it’s OK to have fun with tradition,” Del Coro said. His Thanksgiving meal often incorporates foods that were more frequently eaten in preindustrial North America.\n\nPrepared with seasonal accompaniments, venison steak evokes Thanksgivings of years past. HLPhoto/Adobe Stock\n\nFor example, game meats used to be a common staple of the American diet, he said. “Venison was certainly part of the original Thanksgiving meal and is seasonally appropriate,” with cuts similar to a beef roast or steaks that can be prepared with seasonal accompaniments.\n\nIf you’d like to stick to the poultry theme, Del Coro recommends guinea hen, pheasants and ducks as replacement birds, which “are more available and less expensive than turkey,” he said. Try a whole roasted duck with balsamic glaze for crispy, succulent skin, rosemary-brined guinea hen or roast pheasant with cornbread stuffing.\n\nOr for a more turkey-adjacent experience, Del Coro suggests poussin, a young chicken that weighs about 1 to 1½ pounds and is popular in Britain. Each poussin can be stuffed individually, he said, and “everyone can get their own little mini-roast turkey on their plate.”\n\nDecolonize your menu\n\nSince turkey is just one element of the many colonial myths and stereotypes surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday, this can be an opportunity to revamp the menu to honor Native Americans.\n\nThe movement to decolonize Thanksgiving focuses on acknowledging the historical racism and violence toward Native Americans instead of perpetuating the “Pilgrims and Indians” narrative and celebrating the continued cultural contributions of these tribes. Creating a decolonized menu can focus on more of the foods traditionally prepared and served by Native Americans.\n\nHelp decolonize your menu by serving stuffed butternut squash with chickpeas, cranberries and quinoa. sveta_zarzamora/Adobe Stock\n\nSome of the ingredients common to what we think of as the “traditional” Thanksgiving meal — squash, including pumpkins, corn, wild rice, and root vegetables such as sweet potatoes and turnips — are also traditional Indigenous ingredients, so a decolonized menu can bring these dishes to the forefront.\n\nYou can also add foods frequently prepared by tribes in the region where you’re living. In the Pacific Northwest, that can include salmon and berries; in the Southwest, you can try making homemade tamales.\n\nGo plant-based\n\nNo, focusing on plant-based dishes for Thanksgiving doesn’t mean you have to serve Tofurky.\n\n“I’ve done lots of polls with my friends and family” regarding favorite Thanksgiving dishes, said Jules Aron, certified holistic nutrition coach and author of “Nourish and Glow: Naturally Beautifying Foods and Elixirs.”\n\nPlant-based dishes such as baked carrots, sweet potatoes, beets and zucchini add color to your menu. vaaseenaa/Adobe Stock\n\nMore often than not, she noted, people choose a side dish as their top Thanksgiving food — “and most side dishes are already plant-based.” This makes Thanksgiving a natural time to include more plant-based dishes at the table when there’s already an inclination toward sampling and sharing. And if your favorite side dish recipe isn’t vegetarian, it’s not the end of the world.\n\n“People get scared when thinking about plant-based recipes,” Aron said, fearing that they will have to make multiple substitutions to a dish or find unusual ingredient replacements. However, “if your side dishes are not already plant-based, usually there’s a very easy tweak you can make,” such as replacing chicken broth with vegetable broth or using mushrooms in place of bacon.\n\nAron recommends simple plant-based dishes that highlight seasonal vegetables for two reasons: Vegetables add color to a menu often dominated by brown and beige ingredients, and “when you’re buying in season, the prices are lower.”\n\nA whole roasted cauliflower can make a picturesque plant-based centerpiece dish for Thanksgiving. julie208/Adobe Stock\n\nOne of her favorite Thanksgiving side dishes is rosemary maple-roasted vegetables, which can feature a mix of root vegetables such as purple potatoes, sweet potatoes, beets and carrots — or whatever options your family likes best. “It’s not difficult to throw them on a sheet pan and roast them,” Aron said.\n\nShe also suggests showing off with a whole roasted cauliflower as a plant-based centerpiece dish. To bring another pop of bright color to the table, “go the extra mile and find a purple one.” Cauliflower is a blank slate for absorbing flavors, so for Thanksgiving, Aron recommends pairing creamy tahini sauce with seasonal cranberries and candied pecans.", "authors": ["Casey Barber"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2021/11/24/pumpkin-pie-thanksgiving-abolitionist-history-united-states/8755627002/", "title": "The abolitionist history of pumpkin pie and Thanksgiving", "text": "BERGEN, N.J. — Sorry, apple. Pumpkin is the true home-baked American pie tradition. (Or maybe sweet potato, but more on that later.)\n\nEach year on the fourth Thursday of November, America embarks on a pumpkin pie feeding frenzy unknown anywhere else in the world. In the lead-up to the Thanksgiving holiday, sales of pumpkin spike like a toddler’s blood sugar. Even people who don’t really like pumpkin pie often eat it anyway. After all, it’s tradition — as American as college sports and unused vacation days.\n\nBut it wasn’t always so.\n\nThe Thanksgiving pumpkin pie is now a symbol for sweet, sweet national unity. But it was once a hotly contested battleground in America’s original culture war. In the 1800s, the humble pumpkin became a totem of the fight to abolish slavery in America.\n\n“There are these New England abolitionists writing saccharin-sweet stories about pumpkins,” said historian Cindy Ott, author of \"Pumpkin: The Curious History of an American Icon.\" “They very consciously saw these pumpkin farms in contrast to the immoral plantation economy and plantation farms in the South. They very specifically and explicitly compare those two landscapes.”\n\nIn the mid-19th century, according to Ott, eating pumpkins was a matter of identity politics. And much the same could be said of Thanksgiving itself.\n\nWhen Abraham Lincoln declared a day of Thanksgiving on the fourth day of November in 1863, it was the culmination of a long pro-Thanksgiving campaign by abolitionist, pumpkin lover and home economics icon Sarah Josepha Hale. Lincoln framed it as a call to \"heal the wounds of the nation and restore it,\" and the declaration became an annual tradition for American presidents.\n\nBut some in the Confederacy decried the Thanksgiving declaration as a rank political ploy. Worse, Thanksgiving was yet another example of self-regarding New Englanders telling them how to live.\n\n“This is an annual custom of that people, heretofore celebrated with devout oblations to themselves of pumpkin pie and roast turkey,” read a fiery anti-Thanksgiving editorial in Richmond.\n\nFor years after the Civil War, according to Ott, many Southern families refused Thanksgiving and especially pumpkin pie as cultural artifacts of the Yankees. This is true even though pumpkins grow just fine in the South and pumpkin pie or “pudding” recipes had long existed there, including in Mary Randolph’s famous 1824 cookbook “The Virginia Housewife.”\n\nSo how did the New England anti-slavery movement get sole custody of the pumpkin? It’s complicated.\n\nThe abolitionist history of the pumpkin\n\nPumpkins were always a strange romance.\n\nThe orange field pumpkin is impressively massive. But it is also dry, stringy and a bit tasteless.\n\nUnlike other varieties of a domesticated squash, the field pumpkin never took hold in the everyday urban market of the 1800s. It was too ungainly. Too cheap to be profitable.\n\nContrary to legend, it didn’t have any place of pride in the Pilgrims’ 1621 feast, which few associated with Thanksgiving until decades after the holiday had become a national tradition. In fact, no one from that feast recorded serving pumpkins at all.\n\n“If it was served, it was just as kind of like a savory side dish,” Ott said. “It was not in any way a special part of the occasion. It was probably served the day before and the day after, too.”\n\nListen:What really happened during the first Thanksgiving?\n\nThe native pumpkin was a fast-growing source of sustenance, a staple but not a beloved food for early colonists up and down the coast. By the 19th century, increasingly picky eaters preferred more flavorful winter and summer squashes.\n\nThe fast-growing field pumpkin was often grown in manure bins or amid cornrows and used as feed for dairy cows to make milk taste richer. In the rural South, it was the province of poor and little farms, said Ott, not really something you'd get sentimental about.\n\nBut in the urban North, it became something city dwellers encountered only while on salutary trips out to the country to appreciate “nature.”\n\nFor the New England literati, the pumpkin came to symbolize a noble and primitive way of life that urbanites had left behind. Even as farmers were derided as rubes and “pumpkin eaters” — nothing spoils your appreciation of a farm’s natural beauty quite like encountering actual farmers, wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson — pumpkins became nostalgic totems of abundance and connection to the land.\n\nThis coincided with a change in how New England celebrated the old religious tradition of Thanksgiving. Once marked by a day of fasting, the tradition had morphed into a celebration of autumn prosperity, with all God's rustic spoils laid out on the table. Amid cranberry and turkey, pumpkin pie reigned supreme.\n\n“The thought of keeping Thanksgiving without a pumpkin pie is surely almost unsupportable,” wrote a correspondent for American Farmer in 1833.\n\nStorytellers of the day filled the world with proto-Hallmark Channel fantasies of New England Thanksgiving that almost invariably ended with pumpkin pie, said Ott. Others wrote poetic odes to the honest pumpkin.\n\nProminent among them was Thanksgiving activist Hale. As the editor of wildly popular Godey's Lady's Book and the author of nursery rhyme “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” Hale was the Martha Stewart of her day. She also had a habit of writing letters to state governors on behalf of Thanksgiving.\n\nLike many New England writers who loved pumpkin pie and turkey day, Hale was a deeply religious voice against slavery. She depicted the North’s idyllic little pumpkin-filled farms as morally superior to the vast slave plantations of the rural South.\n\n“I have no doubt that many of the slaveholders would rejoice to have the southern states entirely freed from slaves, and cultivated in the same fashion as we Yankees do in the North,” wrote Hale.\n\nThe Northern farmer, just by existing, was a natural-born abolitionist, she argued. Pumpkin pie and Thanksgiving were celebrations of a better, more godly way of agriculture without the institution of slavery.\n\nThe Southern Thanksgiving resistance\n\nHale's campaign for state Thanksgivings had been largely successful in the early 1800s, helping spur declarations in 29 states by the 1850s. But as the fight over slavery intensified and the Civil War loomed, commentators in Southern states began to reject any Northern cultural aggressions.\n\nThe state of Virginia, in particular, wanted no part of it.\n\nIn a letter to Hale, stridently pro-slavery Virginia Gov. Henry Wise inveighed against New England’s abolitionist aims, calling out “this theatrical national claptrap of Thanksgiving, which has aided other causes in setting thousands of pulpits to preaching ‘Christian politics.’”\n\nAn 1856 editorial in the Richmond Whig likewise decried the “repugnant” holiday, opining that it incurred nothing but Northern idleness and drunkenness.\n\nEven for decades after the Civil War, Southern states remained leery of the Yankee holiday. As each president made his annual Thanksgiving proclamation, some Southern states moved their own Thanksgivings to a different day as a form of resistance. Texas refused to acknowledge the holiday altogether until the 1880s.\n\n“It’s only after Reconstruction that the Southern states finally say, well, we realized we’ve finally got to get back in the fold and get with the program — to show that we are after all American — that the Southern states start to embrace Thanksgiving,” said historian James Cobb, in a 2018 interview with Arizona State University publication Zocalo.\n\nNot until 1941 did the date of the Thanksgiving holiday become enshrined in federal law.\n\nAs for pumpkin pie, it remained a mostly Yankee food for years. Arguably, it didn't fully spread through the South until the 20th century and the advent of mass-marketed pumpkin pie filling.\n\n“I think it happens more in the ‘40s and ‘50s of the last century,” said Frank Clark, foodways historian at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. “It’s something that happens as we homogenize the cultures a little bit more with TV and fast food in supermarkets. You start to see some of these things move around from place to place and become more common in places where they weren't necessarily prior to that.”\n\nBefore that, said Clark, the paucity of pumpkin pie in the South may have been in part a matter of preference, and of pre-existing traditions like sweet potato pie.\n\nEnslaved Africans who were cooks in much of the South had brought with them a love of the African yam, which wasn’t available in the New World. The sweet potato became a substitute, and orange-fleshed sweet potatoes are often still called yams today.\n\nMore:Are yams and sweet potatoes the same? 5 questions answered about the Thanksgiving favorite\n\n“A lot of these African things just merged into the Virginia diet,” Clark said. “If you take a look at the first cookbook written and published in Virginia, 'The Virginia Housewife' by Mary Randolph, there are at least four or five recipes of clearly African origins.”\n\nAnd so rather than eat the pumpkin pie loved by abolitionists, white Southerners instead cooked a sweet potato version made according to the preferences of formerly enslaved Africans.\n\nBut during the 20th century, New England's yen for pumpkins swelled into a truly national love affair, from the porch front jack o'lantern to the pumpkin spice latte and throwback decorative gourds. Some small farms make more money with eight weeks of pumpkin patch than during the whole rest of the year, Ott said.\n\nThe sweet potato pie endures as a parallel and Southern Thanksgiving tradition, and also in the homes of many African American families who migrated north.\n\n“I don't think many people in New England eat sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving,” Ott said. “But there's a lot of people in the South who do, and it’s because of this cultural history. It’s not because the South can’t grow pumpkins.

While the conventional narrative around Thanksgiving has been one of friendship and alliance between the Wampanoag and the Plymouth colonists, Barton sees the holiday as a reminder of all that Indigenous people endured with the arrival of Europeans.\n\nAmong what was lost: Knowledge of traditional foods and the ways they were cultivated, produced and prepared.\n\nNow that Barton has a platform as a chef and a cultural food enthusiast, she treats Thanksgiving as an opportunity not only to draw attention to the Indigenous ingredients that show up in the standard holiday fare, but also other seasonal Native foods that have been overlooked – in other words, what she thinks about all year round.\n\n“I want to encourage people to become acquainted with the stuff that grows naturally around us,” Barton, who is also restaurant manager and executive chef at The Vault in Tulsa, told CNN.\n\nAs they reject the myth of Thanksgiving, Barton and other Native American chefs and culinarians are engaging with the holiday on their own terms – making it instead about revitalizing ingredients and foodways indigenous to North America.\n\nChefs and cooks revive ancestral traditions\n\nGrowing up Cherokee, Barton didn’t think much about Cherokee food. It was just a part of who she was.\n\nThough Barton had been cooking for her family since she was a girl, it wasn’t until her grandmother died in 2016 that she began deepening her understanding of the dishes and traditions of her culture. If she didn’t start practicing what she had learned, she realized, that knowledge might be lost.\n\nThat included making kanuchi, a hickory nut porridge traditional to tribes in the southeast. Hickory trees today are valued primarily for the wood that they provide, but Cherokee people have long eaten the nuts from certain species, which Barton describes as having an “earthy, woody, maple, cinnamony, kind of pecan flavor.”\n\nAfter her grandmother died, Barton started expanding her knowledge of traditional Cherokee foods. Courtesy Taelor Barton\n\n“This is their motherland,” she said, referring to hickory trees. “So we’re basically using this resource from time immemorial.”\n\nTo make kanuchi, Barton employs the same techniques that her grandmother once did, using a mortar fashioned from a tree stump and a pestle made of wood. She now prepares it for potlucks and intimate gatherings, and has since become known in her community for her knowledge of the dish, which is noteworthy given that such recipes can’t be easily looked up.\n\nIn carrying forward the culinary traditions of her ancestors, Barton is part of a larger movement.\n\nShe’s a member of I-Collective, a group of Indigenous chefs, activists, herbalists and knowledge keepers dedicated to promoting Native ingredients and championing Indigenous food sovereignty. In past years, other members of I-Collective have hosted pop-up Thanksgiving dinners aimed at revising the American understanding of the holiday and celebrating Indigenous resilience and food traditions. What started as a few intimate dinners in New York expanded to events across the US that go beyond Thanksgiving.\n\nI-Collective has grown into a sprawling network whose members reflect the diversity of the continent’s Indigenous peoples. They’re bound together by a shared commitment to elevating and restoring Native food systems.\n\nThose principles inform much of the work that Hillel Echo-Hawk does.\n\nThough Echo-Hawk is a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma, she grew up in rural Alaska next to an Athabaskan family that she says adopted her family into their culture. Grocery store access was limited, and she learned to hunt and fish, eating moose, muskrat, squirrel and salmon. When she moved away, she realized how little people knew about Native food, which can vary widely from region to region, tribe to tribe.\n\nNative food means different things depending on the tribe and geographic region. Adobe Stock\n\nEcho-Hawk eventually became a cook and started the catering company Birch Basket, which highlights pre-colonization ingredients and seeks to tell stories of people and land through each plate. She doesn’t particularly care for Thanksgiving as a holiday, but she does feel strongly about educating others about Indigenous food and foodways.\n\n“While I do think it’s a very dumb holiday, if I can show people that yes, we are still alive, we’re not just corn, squash and beans, then I will absolutely do whatever I can to uplift my culture,” she said.\n\nCommunities reclaim control of food systems\n\nSean Sherman experienced a pretty typical Thanksgiving spread growing up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota: Turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes.\n\nThe Oglala Lakota chef has warm memories of that time, but as he got older, his outlook on the holiday shifted. What he had learned in school was a false narrative that glorified colonialism, he said, and not something that ought to be celebrated.\n\nAt the same time, Sherman was working in restaurants and coming to terms with the lack of Native food in his own life and in broader society. In 2014, he founded the food education and catering company The Sioux Chef to help address the issue.\n\nSean Sherman, an Oglala Lakota chef, is part of a movement of culinarians dedicated to revitalizing Native cuisines. Dan Koeck/The New York Times/Redux\n\nStill, Sherman enjoys cooking for loved ones and gathering for a big meal, so he hasn’t given up on Thanksgiving entirely. He simply encourages people to identify what’s growing around them and incorporate that into their cooking – his own Thanksgiving dinner this year will likely feature rabbit, heirloom squash and corn.\n\n“I think that people should always understand the land that they’re on – understand the Indigenous communities around them and struggles that they had to go through and still go through in many scenarios,” said Sherman, who is also behind the Indigenous restaurant Owamni in Minneapolis.\n\nMany of those struggles go hand in hand with the disruption of food systems.\n\nFederal policies that removed tribes from their ancestral lands also severed them from centuries-old ways of hunting, growing and harvesting. And during the 19th century, the US Army carried out a mass slaughter of bison in an effort to wipe out the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains.\n\nUnder some treaties that the US made with tribal nations, the federal government agreed to compensate tribes for the loss of their food sources through rations, which tended to be unhealthy and laden with preservatives. Such policies contributed to disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity in Native American communities, as well as high rates of poverty and food insecurity, that persist today.\n\nDana Thompson, who along with Sherman co-founded the nonprofit North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems, sees the restoration of traditional foodways as key to addressing health and economic crises in Native communities. The organization works with tribal communities to bolster traditional knowledge and support their efforts toward food sovereignty.\n\nDana Thompson (left) is a co-owner of The Sioux Chef, the company behind the restaurant Owamni in Minneapolis. Stephen Maturen/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\n“Sovereignty means that communities of people have an understanding of where their food comes from, have control over where their food comes from, and can define their own food systems instead of just eating whatever an outside dominant party gives them,” said Thompson, who identifies as a lineal descendant of the Wahpeton-Sisseton and Mdewakanton Dakota tribes.\n\nOne need look no further than the Thanksgiving table to understand how North American ecosystems have been disrupted, Barton noted. Turkeys were once an animal traditionally hunted by the Cherokee, but livestock farming has made the birds abundant in a way that now feels foreign.\n\nWhen she can, Barton makes it a point to source ingredients locally, whether through farmers markets, tribal producers, gifts or foraging. Ultimately, she said, the food sovereignty movement seeks to transform modern relationships with the land and allow tribes control over their own food production and distribution again.\n\n“The power to feed our people is tantamount to our ability to govern ourselves,” she added.\n\nThe work continues beyond Thanksgiving\n\nBarton is happy to shine a spotlight on Native cuisines and food traditions during Thanksgiving. But though she works in the restaurant industry, she’s wary of making certain Native foods for customers who might not understand their significance – she’s not interested in providing a “Native experience” for profit.\n\nA spread of foods including fire roasted pig, sweet potatoes, hominy and mush, prepared by Barton and fellow chefs Nico Albert and Brad Dry. Courtesy Taelor Barton\n\nSome Cherokee dishes are sacred and personal to Barton, and for now, she’s keeping them close.\n\nShe will, however, be spending Thanksgiving at her grandfather’s house in eastern Oklahoma. There she’ll collect black walnuts from trees that her great-grandfather planted around a century ago – those walnuts might be eaten as is, baked into a pie or used as a filling for stuffed acorn squash. She’ll also be making her signature dish: Kanuchi.\n\nAnd she’ll continue to urge people to connect with the bounty around them – not just at Thanksgiving, but all year round.\n\n“There’s so much more to learn,” she said. “This is a good time to learn it, but we should also be thinking about it through all of our seasons.”", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2018/10/31/toute-heure-cranford-has-new-direction-under-rising-star-chef/1650371002/", "title": "A Toute Heure in Cranford has new direction under 'rising star' chef", "text": "CRANFORD - Chef AJ Capella certainly has an impressive resume, having worked at restaurants including the acclaimed Aviary in New York City, the Ryland Inn, Bernards Inn, Pluckemin Inn, Uproot and Hamilton Farm Golf Club.\n\nBut as of Sept. 24, after 13 years in the restaurant industry, the 28-year-old Jersey City resident has finally found a place to call his own — as the executive chef of A Toute Heure, a French-inspired bistro here that locals have been flocking to since it opened 11 years ago.\n\n“I had a life goal when I was 20 years old to become an executive chef by 30, so I’m two years early,” said Capella. “I’ve always loved New Jersey and I’ve always wanted to be a chef here, so it was just perfect timing.”\n\nREAD:How to craft the ultimate cheese board, with tips from Piattino in Mendham\n\nREAD:New Hot Spot Restaurant in Somerville offers fusion of Eastern, Western cooking\n\nCapella already has big plans in store for A Toute Heure, with tons of new menu items including beef and broccoli with grits, fried broccoli and broccoli salad; a crudo of the day; pan seared salmon with fennel, sunchoke and brown butter almonds; and s’mores with chocolate cake, housemade marshmallow, housemade graham cracker crumble, panna cotta and pickled cherries.\n\n“This restaurant has always been a French-inspired bistro and almost all of the restaurants I have been at have been New American with French techniques,” Capella said. “With the progressive techniques I learned at Aviary, I want to blend everything together and create something that’s nonexistent in this area to make my own style.”\n\nCapella said he uses “simple, relatable twists” to turn a dish around and make it attractive to local customers, such as the brown butter almonds in his pan-seared salmon, which is essentially dried almondine sauce that results in a brown butter almond crumble. The s’mores dessert, which is not s’mores in a traditional sense, also utilizes its past as well as modern techniques to create a fresh, new dish. Plus, his sweet potato soup unexpectedly houses an oyster – a popular food during the nation’s first Thanksgiving – as well as bacon and sage walnut crumble.\n\nUnlike many other eateries known for their local sourcing, Capella said that he plans to change the A Toute Heure menu much more frequently than quarterly.\n\n“I get bored of dishes quickly, so the menu will change pretty rapidly,” he said. “When a local farm has something really nice, I’ll make a dish off of that.”\n\nHowever, his big plans go far beyond what diners will pick out for their plates on a Friday night. He also hopes to introduce a midweek special, possibly a $45 three-course pre-fixe menu for weekdays, he said, as well as a weekly changing entrée for two — “something with a ‘wow’ factor,” he said, which in the past few weeks has included a 38-ounce Porterhouse steak and braised lamb shank.\n\nThe young chef, who was named as the 2017 Rising Star Chef by the Garden State Culinary Arts Awards, also hopes to offer a reservation-only tasting menu.\n\n“For me, connecting with the guests on a more personal level, where I can just take their dietary restrictions and cook, would be great,” he said.\n\nCapella hopes these initiatives will help get people in his restaurant's door during the week, which usually sees about 20 to 30 guests a night, and upwards of 75 on the weekends, in its 38 indoor seats and 30 outdoor seats (weather permitting).\n\nOne thing that A Toute Heure certainly does have is a dedicated local following.\n\n“This restaurant, out of all of the ones I’ve worked in, really connects with its hometown of Cranford the most,” Capella said. “Its whole philosophy is to be a local neighborhood gem. We get a lot of people from Cranford who have come here for birthdays and celebrations, so there’s a lot of positive memories here.”\n\nTo keep that momentum going, Capella will also host dinner collaborations with local restaurants, including one coming up on Monday, Nov. 5 at 6 p.m. at the Cranford Hotel at 1 S. Union Ave., which will be a joint effort between 100 Steps, the Cranford Hotel and A Toute Heure. Guests can make reservations for the $80 six-course dinner which costs an additional $35 with wine pairings by calling 908-276-2121 or visiting bit.ly/2QSjN39.\n\nCapella said that when he first started cooking, there were about six top New Jersey restaurants which were followed after a huge drop-off in quality by many others. However, these days, he’s noticed that there are a lot more top-notch eateries in the Garden State as well as many more people working to improve the local foodie scene.\n\n“New Jersey has everything to offer that other major food destinations have,” he said. “In other states, you have to get ingredients imported on a truck, but we have it right here. We can find things in the woods that people spend God knows how much on to get imported through FedEx. We have every climate, including beaches and mountains, and the new class of chefs in this state is really honing in on that.”\n\nStaff Writer Jenna Intersimone: 908-303-8390, JIntersimone@MyCentralJersey.com\n\nAt a glance\n\nA Toute Heure\n\nWhere: 232 Centennial Ave., Cranford\n\nContact: 908-276-6600, atouteheure.com\n\nPrice Range: $28 to $36 for an entree\n\nCranford Collaborative Dinner: Monday, Nov. 5 at 6 p.m. for $80 per person, additional $35 with wine pairings.

Recently, they’ve been relying mostly on one income. Their reduced earnings, coupled with inflation, have dealt a blow to their finances.\n\nAnd that has changed, radically, the way they eat. Altman is not alone in making big changes.\n\nWe asked CNN readers how inflation has impacted their eating habits, and many mentioned dining out less often, buying less meat and giving up splurges. Some said they are very worried about the future.\n\nFood prices have spiked 11.4% over the past year, the largest annual increase since May 1979, according to data released in mid-September by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grocery prices jumped 13.5% and restaurant menu prices increased 8% in that period.\n\nWith food prices soaring, people are changing how they shop and eat. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConsumers are responding by looking for deals and switching to generic brands, according to July data from the market research firm IRI. Companies like Tyson (TSN) have noticed customers are switching from beef to chicken, and Applebee’s and IHOP have reported an uptick in higher-income customers who are likely trading down from pricier restaurants. Some people may be dining out less often, or avoiding restaurants altogether.\n\nFor those who struggled to buy food even before prices shot up, rising costs could mean falling into food insecurity, a state of unreliable access to affordable food.\n\n“If food prices continue to increase at a rate that outpaces increases in wages, that is the inevitable consequence,” said Jayson Lusk, head of the agricultural economics department at Purdue University. “The last time we had a big run up in food insecurity rates was in the wake of the Great Recession.” Last year, about 10.2% of US households were food insecure, according to the USDA, slightly below the 10.5% rate in 2020 and 2019.\n\nEven for those not at risk of hunger, the surges in food prices are jarring.\n\nFood “matters a lot to our self esteem, our mood,” said William Masters, a professor at Tufts University’ school of nutrition science and policy who is also a member of the economics department faculty. “Not being able to buy the foods that people are used to — that your children are asking for, that your family wants — that’s a really hard thing,” he said. “Any disruption of habit is very, very hard.”\n\nGiving up on simple pleasures\n\nCarol Ehrman taking a Thai cooking class over Zoom during the pandemic. Courtesy Carol and Tommy Ehrman\n\nFor Carol Ehrman, cooking is a joyful experience.\n\n“I love to cook, it’s my favorite thing to do,” she said. She especially likes to cook Indian and Thai food, but stocking the spices and ingredients she needs for those dishes is no longer feasible. “When every ingredient has gone up, that adds up on the total bill,” she said.\n\n“What used to cost us $250 to $300 … is now $400.” Ehrman, 60, and her husband, 65, rely on his social security income, and the increase was stretching their budget. “We just couldn’t do that.”\n\nAbout six months ago, she realized she had to change the way she shops for groceries.\n\nIn an effort to bring their immediate costs down, Ehrman stopped shopping in bulk as often as she used to. Now, she hunts for sales, avoids buying beef, and opts for boxed wine instead of nice bottles when she buys wine at all. She’s also cooking simpler meals, and saying goodbye to dinner parties.\n\nEhrman haș even given up preparing basic items, like tomato sauce, because of the expense, opting instead for a pre-packaged version.\n\n“I know that I can make it much healthier,” she said. And “it always tastes so much better.” Those fresh ingredients are just too pricey now.\n\nEhrman’s husband is retired due to chronic health problems, and it’s been difficult for her to work because of her own health issues — she recently had pacemaker and heart catheterization procedures. The couple, who live in Billings, Montana, were frugal before the current spike in prices, enjoying simple pleasures. But now, even those are out of reach.\n\n“Before, we at least found joy in being home and having friends over and family over, cooking and sitting around the table and just being content,” she said. Now, “I’m not entertaining at all. It’s really sad.”\n\nFrom Coke to Pepsi\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Local markets, generic brands help family save money on groceries 01:25 - Source: CNN Business\n\nRick Wichmann, 64, and his wife have been dining out less often in recent years, due to the pandemic and in an effort to eat healthier. With menu prices rising because of inflation, they see no reason to change their habits.\n\n“Eating out is expensive,” he said, noting that he’s often happier with home-cooked meals than restaurant food anyway.\n\nBut grocery shopping is also more expensive. Over the past year, Wichmann noticed that he had been spending about 25% more shopping for groceries for himself, his wife and their son than he used to.\n\nTo help mitigate those costs, Wichmann, who lives in Brookline, Massachusetts, started going to different grocers. He avoids Whole Foods and Stop & Shop, opting instead for Costco and the local chain Market Basket.\n\nHe’s also switched to store brands, if he feels the quality is the same, and will sometimes choose products based on price rather than brand loyalty — like, for example, buying Pepsi when it’s cheaper, when he’d otherwise choose Coke.\n\nWichmann also pays attention to events like weather, and how they might affect prices. When he saw reports of a possible tomato shortage due to droughts in California, he took notice. The next time he saw tomato sauce on sale he stocked up on enough to last for months.\n\nA vegetable garden in the front lawn\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Turning to gardening to save money on food 01:33 - Source: CNN Business\n\nLike Wichmann, Jenni Wells, 38, pays attention to weather patterns and food systems. A former chef and rancher, she noticed price increases well before the current bout of inflation.\n\n“My alarm bells started going off for prices going up in 2019,” she said, when devastating floods in the midwest drowned livestock and destroyed grain stocks. Wells decided back then that she’d like to be more self sufficient.\n\n“I saw the food prices going up, and I realized that it was going to quickly overwhelm our budget,” she said. So in February, she ripped up the grass in the front lawn of her home in Fort Worth, Texas, which she shares with her husband and best friend, and planted a vegetable garden.\n\n“I just wanted to see what I could grow for myself,” she said. This year, she’s managed to grow broccoli, cauliflower, okra, tomatoes, peppers, squashes and more in her garden.\n\nThere are upfront and maintenance costs for the garden, of course. And it’s not easy to grow vegetables. But the household’s weekly grocery spending, excluding meat, has fallen from about $200 to $50, she said.\n\nWith the money left over, Wells and her household have been able to eat at restaurants, something that would have been “too much of a luxury” had they still been spending $200 a week on groceries. And there’s the satisfaction of growing your own food.\n\n“There’s a huge sense of reward,” she said. “I feel pride in every meal that I make with it.”\n\nChanging for good\n\nA recent weekly grocery haul for Lisa Altman. Courtesy Lisa Altman\n\nSome consumers have made changes because of current circumstances that they plan to hold onto.\n\nNow, Altman, the Austin parent of three, aims to keep her grocery bill to about $100 to $125 per week by buying store brands, lots of pasta and a limited amount of protein each week.\n\nInstead of ordering in or grilling steaks or ribs, Altman’s family eats more basic meals with smaller portions. “Now our meals consist of one primary dish, and that’s it, maybe some bread on the side, or a salad.” If they go out to eat, they’ll pick up a fast food meal with a few sides, like one burger and two fries, split the items and have beverages at home.\n\nWhen Altman is able to afford it, she’ll go back to buying more fruits and veggies. But she’s hoping some habits, like encouraging her children to avoid mindless eating and reducing food waste, will stick.\n\n“I’m not going to be spending $1,200 a month on groceries,” she said. “This has taught us that that’s not necessary.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/11/27/chitlins-what-are-chitterlings-south-carolina-chitlin-strut/4317003002/", "title": "What do chitlins taste like? Go to this tiny SC town to find out", "text": "SALLEY, S.C. – Mark Hartley is really trying. The sudden halt in his speech signals he's thinking hard.\n\nIt isn't because of bad cell reception where he lives, the backcountry some 40 miles southwest of Columbia – at least not this time.\n\nHartley's wrangling with a slippery question folks in Salley have been asked at least a ton of times in the past 50 years. This is a doozy that not even 10,000 people – like the population of this town 25 times over – would know how to answer, either.\n\n\"Chitlins taste like... chitlins,\" Hartley said. \"It's like a chitlin; it's not like pork skin. You don't fry them that hard. It's a chitlin. It's a chitlin...\"\n\nThe act of defining a chitlin as, well, a chitlin isn't totally wrong. Hartley, who will be cooking thousands of pounds of the stuff Saturday during Salley's famous annual Chitlin Strut, may be onto something.\n\nTry this: Say \"chitlin\" out loud. It sounds strange and funky, bold and strong. It's unusual. Chitlins taste that way, too: strange, funky, bold, strong, unusual.\n\nChitlins are, in fact, a gutsy culinary choice – they are the small intestines of a pig. The term is also a Southern-fried contraction of \"chitterlings.\"\n\nThey are not for the faint of stomach. They take a lot of time and effort to clean and cook. They require patience and prowess.\n\nAnd let's just say it's not pleasant work. One can joke that if they are cooked for the holidays, the kitchen could smell like chitlins virtually through the New Year. They are a commitment that lasts after the plate is clean.\n\nOne thing, however, they've never been called: boring.\n\nWhen it comes to chitlins, strong tastes and smells inspire similarly strong feelings and strong statements – like the longtime Salley saying that cooking chitlins stinks so much that leaves on nearby trees turn the other way.\n\nPeople love them or hate them or won't even give them a try.\n\nTake Hartley, who is also a city council member. He'll spend Saturday running the chitlin part of the Chitlin Strut. He's been working at the festival since he was a teenager.\n\nBut even Hartley hasn't eaten a boiled chitlin, one of two ways it is served to the thousands who come each year.\n\nAnd for the fried ones on that menu?\n\n\"I've tasted them,\" he said. \"I can't say I've ever made a meal of them.\"\n\nSalley is the chitlin capital of the world\n\nSince 1966, the Chitlin Strut has put Salley on the map.\n\nThe event has been celebrated in the pages of the Los Angeles Times, Southern Living and a Paris newspaper. Beloved South Carolina humorist William Price Fox titled a collection after the Strut. When he died in 2015, The New York Times extensively quoted his chitlins musings in his obituary.\n\nAs many as 40,000 people have packed these few blocks the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and they have come from as far away as Ireland, according to a South Carolina General Assembly resolution congratulating the town on the Strut's 50th anniversary.\n\nIn recent years, that total has looked more like 15,000 to 20,000, many arriving from Greenville and Chester, South Carolina, and Georgia or Florida by way of bus or motorhome.\n\nThe other 364 days of the year, Salley is home to just 400-something people. Most either work the land bordering the town limits or at the shops and businesses a few miles away.\n\nA new mayor was elected earlier this month – LaDonna Hall. She won with 44 write-in votes.\n\nThe 40-year-old Salley native has never missed a Strut, she said.\n\n\"It makes us feel alive,\" Hall said. \"It makes us feel good that people actually flock from all of these places.\"\n\nThe calendar in the city office has a couple of things listed on November days, and they're all Strut-related. Strut shirts hang from the ceiling above.\n\nA rack is filled with all the programs from all the Struts. The first year is two stapled pages. \"Everybody invited,\" it reads on the cover.\n\nSalley calls itself the \"Chitlin Capital of the World\" on the event's website. There doesn't seem to be much competition. Clio, Alabama, has hosted something called the Chitlin Jamboree, but it's not as big or storied as the Strut.\n\nThere isn't a stoplight in Salley. Or a bank. Or a school. The old school building is still around; that's where the Chitlin Strut is. Students go to Wagener-Salley High School these days about eight miles north.\n\nThe post office is still open, too, but that's about it on the main block.\n\nWhy Salley does the Strut\n\nBy 1966, Salley, a promising whistle–stop that got its first railroad in 1887, was cash-strapped after the automobile age stopped its growth in its tracks.\n\nThe story goes that the mayor wanted to buy new Christmas decorations, so he sought the advice and influence of a local country music DJ, Ben Dekle. Dekle is the one who gets credit for coming up with the Chitlin Strut, according to the Library of Congress American Folklife Center.\n\nA thousand people ate 600 pounds of chitlins at the first event in 1966. They had new Christmas decorations lining the streets weeks later.\n\nThese days, the Strut mostly just pays for itself, said Paul Salley, a longtime city council member who can trace a branch of his family tree back to the town's founder. The town did buy something recently, though. They got some more Christmas decorations.\n\nThe future of the Chitlin Strut\n\nThat's not to say the Chitlin Strut is frozen in time.\n\nThey used to clean each three-yard-long chitlin on site, \"twice slung and pulled through a forked limb,\" event programs described.\n\nBefore being cleaned, chitlins are loaded with the dangerous and the disgusting – harmful bacteria, feces, undigested food, hair and so on.\n\nAnd the people of Salley volunteer to handle thousands of pounds of chitlins every November.\n\nThe Chitlin Strut is a lot easier now, Hartley said. The chitlins they buy from North Carolina are already cleaned, boiled and pretty much frozen.\n\nAll they have to do to prepare them is to bring a big pot to a simmer.\n\nBut the Strut has gotten harder in one way: The event date now overlaps with the annual football game between Clemson University and the University of South Carolina. Hartley, a die-hard Clemson fan, hopes for not just the win every year but that the matchup is scheduled for the evening. Alas, this year kickoff is at noon.\n\nOrganizers have also struggled to get more volunteers in recent years. Mayor Hall has been on the job just a couple weeks, but she's already working to change that. She aims to bring in new vendors, volunteers and sponsorships.\n\nThe folks who have been running the Strut are reaching the age when they can't help the way they once could, Paul Salley said. They are dying.\n\nThey are members of the generation that raised hogs in these parts, he said. They lived by that principle of waste not, want not: If it could be eaten, it should.\n\nThat was Hall's childhood, too.\n\n\"We ate a little of everything,\" she said. \"My parents didn't have much, so we ate what we could afford. A lot of the times, chitlins was that thing.\"\n\nThe complex history of chitlins\n\nMichael Twitty has never eaten chitlins and says he never will.\n\nAnd he's a celebrated culinary historian, writer and educator. Still, he addresses chitlins in his award-winning book, \"The Cooking Gene.\" He describes how his grandmother would make chitlins for his father for the holidays.\n\nAs a child, he wouldn't even stay in the house while she made them. They made such a show of it, Twitty said. Chitlins are one of those foods, he said, that's a challenge. Eating them is a way to show off, he said, and that's one of the reasons that the food endures.\n\n\"It's really what it comes down to,\" he said. \"That bravado is there.\"\n\nHistorically, chitlins are not everyday eats. They were always seasonal and continue to have a holiday association. The end of the year coincides with traditional hog-killing time.\n\nBefore refrigeration forever changed safe food storage, most Southerners slaughtered pigs in the winter, before the first snow, Twitty said. And intestines have to be harvested as soon as the animal is killed.\n\nThe American South certainly didn't invent eating entrails. The Scottish have haggis, made of sheep or cow offal. The French have andouille, a sausage consisting of pig intestines.\n\nIn West Africa, eating every part of an animal is common, Twitty noted.\n\nChitlins are deeply entangled with the history of slavery in the South, and some will not eat the food in protest, citing that in order to survive, slaves were forced to eat the parts of the pig, including the intestines, that slave owners did not want.\n\nYet historians are now exploring how the story of chitlins is not that simple. There is evidence that slave owners did eat chitlins. It is also a food traditionally eaten in poor white communities.\n\nUltimately, chitlins come \"in and out\" of class, race, assimilation and fashion, Twitty said. The most favored part of the pig, the one reserved for the elite, has also changed through the years, too.\n\nThere's another important part of the historical narrative that's often lost in contemporary conversations. An individual's personal preferences and tastes have always mattered, Twitty said.\n\nThrough all the changes, through the centuries, chitlins have emerged as a signature Southern food.\n\n\"These are the building blocks, the secret pieces of what makes our food and our home cooking so good,\" Twitty said, \"and I dare say, better than anybody else in the United States.\"\n\nChitlins belongs on the same shelves of prominence with delicacies like okra, hog maw, mutton. These are the ingredients that Twitty said just give him a \"certain feeling.\"\n\nHe can't really explain it, he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/25/media/thanksgiving-box-office/index.html", "title": "Thanksgiving used to be a movie feast. This year? Slim pickings ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThanksgiving weekend has historically offered a cornucopia of films, letting moviegoers get out of the house and kick back after eating copious amounts of turkey, mashed potatoes and pie.\n\nBut this year the movie menu is pretty sparse. The North American box office has few new films this weekend that are likely to draw tons of moviegoers.\n\n“Strange World,” Disney’s new animated film about a family of explorers starring the voice work of Jake Gyllenhaal, is projected to bring in only about $30 million domestically over the five-day holiday weekend — a fine, albeit muted, opening. But early box office results from Wednesday and Thursday indicate that “Strange World” is likely to come in under even those initial expectations.\n\nAnother Disney film, Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” is now in its second week and is set to win the holiday weekend with around $40 million domestically. It’s made $552 million so far.\n\nThe slate is a far cry from Thanksgiving weekends of yore. Thanksgiving is usually one of the busiest times of the year for movie theaters, as in many ways it kicks off the profitable holiday box office season — similar to how Memorial Day weekend ushers in the summer. For example, films like “Creed,” “Moana,” and “Knives Out” opened on Thanksgiving weekends and did well.\n\nSo what happened to Thanksgiving this year? Once again, blame Covid.\n\n“The impact of the pandemic, both in terms of production disruption and release-calendar shuffling, has left the table fairly light on cinematic entrees,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business.\n\nSupply chain issues in Hollywood have been hampering movie productions all year long. Summer ticket sales during the summer were strong thanks to hits like “Top Gun: Maverick,” but big new releases have been hard to find in recent months. “Wakanda Forever” is another notable exception, having notched a record $180 million earlier this month, but otherwise it’s been pretty quiet at the cineplex.\n\nA ‘prime time’ for the movie industry\n\nThe dearth of big new releases helps explain why the domestic box office is down 32% so far this year compared to 2019 before the pandemic. The number of releases on 2,000 screens or more is down by 36%.\n\nHolidays like Thanksgiving are important for theaters because “they act as a calendar-based touchstone,” which audiences have come to associate as a “prime time of sorts,” Dergarabedian added.\n\n“This is when the biggest and brightest movies are in the marketplace, and Thanksgiving is certainly one of those timeframes that has developed that type of identity over the years,” he said. “It would be a shame for Thanksgiving to wind up as another marginalized holiday period, like Labor Day weekend.”\n\nBut the 2022 holidays aren’t over yet, and there’s hope on the horizon thanks to James Cameron and his sequel to “Avatar” — the biggest blockbuster in cinema history.\n\n“Avatar: The Way of Water,” which opens on December 16, could unleash a wave of moviegoing to help the industry end the year on a high note. The film Cameron’s first since the 2009 original, and there are some questions about whether this very expensive film can find attract the same type of audience. Others argue: One bets against the director of “Titanic,” “The Terminator” and “Aliens” at their own peril.\n\nAs for Thanksgiving, Dergarabedian hopes that as the theater industry normalizes, the holiday will make a comeback.\n\n“This is likely a temporary shift and a result of the challenging marketplace dynamics over the past two and a half years,” he said. “Thanksgiving will rise again as one of the most important moviegoing weeks of the year.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/daniel-finney/2016/05/25/making-weight-year-2-daniel-finney/84895382/", "title": "Making Weight: Embrace exercise zeal", "text": "Daniel P. Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 16, 2016\n\nEmbracing the zeal\n\nA friend made an offhanded joke about CrossFit members being a cult while we were hanging out a while back.\n\nI know he doesn’t read my paragraphs, so I decided to let him talk.\n\nHe complained about the fact that CrossFit athletes tend to talk about their accomplishments a lot and seem boastful about their fitness.\n\nFinally, I told my friend that I went to CrossFit Merle Hay. The workouts have helped me lose more than 120 pounds, get stronger, more flexible and more mobile than I have been in years.\n\nMy friend shrugged and said I didn’t seem like a narcissist. I let the conversation thread die out.\n\nIt strikes me as ironic to be judged harshly for both being morbidly obese and for trying to fight it at a gym.\n\nI should say this for the record: I don’t endorse CrossFit. This is the gym and workout plan I chose, mostly because of my close friendship with CrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho.\n\nI generally support any course of action that involves eating less and moving more, especially in a society as sedentary as ours, whether it be long walks or a regimented program of diet and exercise.\n\nCrossFit seems to have some kind of reputation as a place where people get hurt. I don’t understand this, in part because I went to CrossFit while I was hurting.\n\nMy knees hurt so bad it was hard to step off curbs or get in and out of cars. I could easily hurt my back carrying in groceries or getting out of bed.\n\nAt CrossFit, I’ve only gotten stronger, faster and leaner.\n\nAm I a picture of fitness? Absolutely not.\n\nThe things I see the elite athletes do at CrossFit boggle my mind. The feats seem truly superhuman.\n\nBut we all had different goals. My goal is losing weight and having the physical strength and endurance to live my life without limitations as long as possible.\n\nIt’s true that CrossFit athletes do talk about their activities. I spent a good five minutes talking to Nate about my technique on the rowing machine in a recent session.\n\nNate encouraged me to lean back farther, pull harder with my arms to get the most out of my strong legs. The first workout I tried his tips in resulted in much higher rotations per minute during my rows.\n\nA year ago, I never thought I would ever have a conversation with anyone about technique on a rowing machine.\n\nThat CrossFit athletes talk about what they do isn’t so unusual. How many times have you been stuck next to someone who is very into gardening, shopping of fantasy football?\n\nI don’t write these paragraphs to pick on my friend. He’s as good and loyal a man as I know.\n\nWhat I am emphasizing, however, is that we could all do a better job of being more tolerant of different ideas and different ways.\n\nThe truth is, I probably held much the same view of CrossFit as my buddy before I started it. I thought of CrossFit athletes as zealots.\n\nBut if this zealously is helping improve and extend my life. Count me all the way in.\n\nWEDNESDAY, DEC. 7, 2016\n\nEmpathy is winning\n\n“Someone @DMRegister must think @newsmanone story is compelling but it’s getting old, repetitive & a waste of space. Not good writer either,” wrote a Twitter user who identifies as Susan Thorne and uses the handle @SueIowaGal.\n\nI don’t know this person, or at least I don’t think I do. But the tweet tweaked all the proper insecurities.\n\nMaking Weight is “getting old, repetitive & a waste of space.” Yeah, I’ve thought that, too. It worries me a great deal. Part of the reason the story is so slow moving is because weight loss and wellness are very incremental with successes and failures.\n\nOnly the gross fiction of game shows such as “The Biggest Loser” produce weight loss results in quick bursts.\n\nIn fact, a study of 14 contestants who participated in the 30-week competition regained most of their weight if not more and suffered slower metabolism, which means they were burning fewer calories than they were before they participated in the show.\n\nBut the audience, in this case, readers of this news organization, have come to believe the arc of carefully crafted fiction can be replicated in life. I assure you, it cannot. And that’s why my effort to lose more than 300 pounds began as a marathon rather than a sprint.\n\nStill, I worry that readers, who are easily distracted and often bored, will lose touch with the underlying themes of continuing to fight for wellness despite setbacks and the judgment of others who really don’t understand how hard it is making life-altering choices.\n\nSo that stung. It’s a criticism for which I have no answer other than this: This is non-fiction and I am a work in progress. I can’t and won’t alter course to make the story more entertaining. I’m working for wellness, not “likes” on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe second half — “not a good writer either” — hurt a little, too. It hurt because I am insecure. Most people are. Few of us talk about it. We bluster or hide. In these paragraphs, though, I am as stripped down and raw as I can be.\n\nThis is a difficult path because I am more vulnerable to the cruelties of social media hecklers.\n\nYes, criticism comes with this job. I understand that and even welcome it. But the tone of the internet is overwhelmingly angry. My friend Bill McClellan, a semi-retired columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, calls the trend “compulsive outrage disorder.”\n\nI am old enough to remember the beginning of the modern internet. When I was a student at Drake University in the early 1990s, we had something called a VAX system.\n\nIt had primitive email and text-only web searching. If you wanted to download a single photograph from the web, you needed some fairly sophisticated computer science skills to do it.\n\nBut even then there were bulletin board systems, the precursor to the chat rooms, which I suppose are an early ancestor of social media. And the bulletin board systems on that old VAX system where overwhelmingly angry.\n\nThe most popular posts were by people who said the meanest things about others on campus, particularly those in public services like the student government or campus newspaper editor.\n\nI’ve got a lot of experience dealing with mean things said about me by people I don’t know on the internet. And I am no better at it today than I was more than 25 years ago.\n\nI harbor great insecurity that I have my job not because I earned it through merit but simply because I survived through attrition after job cuts. My bosses tell me this isn’t true and this is a manifestation of my negative self-talk.\n\nMaybe they’re right. But there are plenty of former Register employees on Facebook who gleefully jump on any of my or my colleagues’ foibles to make withering remarks that I hope at least make them feel good about themselves.\n\nWhenever I write about these kinds of worries, someone drags out the cliché: “Just grow a thicker skin.”\n\nI reject this premise. That simply gives a permission to people who are being mean for the sake of being mean. I’m a sensitive person and sometimes things said of me hurt.\n\nI recognize, too, that I say things, either in an attempt at humor, through sarcasm or simply because of my perspective, that hurt other people’s feelings. I’m truly sorry when it does. That’s never the goal.\n\nJust the other day, I got into an argument with my boss over what was ultimately a trivial matter. I lost my temper in a fit of anxiety and said things I regretted. I later apologized. She accepted. We moved forward.\n\nI write about the effect of this tweet on me not to induce sympathy from readers. Rather, I note it because mental health is as critical to wellness as physical health.\n\nI’ve noted my struggles with anxiety and depression in these columns many times. Again, this isn’t a plea for sympathy but an earnest effort to broaden understanding and engage empathy.\n\nI’m just one person who is trying to lose weight, better control my mood disorders and generally get healthy. But, in a way, I represent roughly a million Iowans considered obese and about 750,000 Iowans who live with a mental health issue.\n\nI write about my struggles for all those people who don’t have the benefit of advocacy or representation in the media. And if that means I have to take hits on social media or the comment section, so be it.\n\nBut I think empathy may be winning.\n\nI finished my second full year as a columnist for The Register in November. Since I started the job, I’ve made it a practice of saving positive emails in a folder and counting them on or near my anniversary.\n\nReaders sent 1,309 positive emails over the last year. And thank you to every single person who took the time to sit down and write their kind thoughts, well wishes and other uplifting messages. It means a lot.\n\nAs for the Twitter critic, I responded with my usual form tweet:\n\n“Gosh, it’s nice to meet you, too. Where would you like your autographed photo sent?”\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 1, 2016\n\nThe long and short of it\n\nI’m learning that you need both a long and short memory when it comes to intense exercise.\n\nFor example, in a recent workout, my coach and friend, Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay, put me through a metabolic conditioning that involved a deadlift, shoulder press and burpees.\n\nThe plan was to decrease in reps by round, starting at 10 and ending with one. The workout was capped at 20 minutes. The added twist was three burpees every two minutes.\n\nThe first round went well. I attacked the 10 deadlifts and shoulder presses with relative ease. I hit the floor for burpees with as much grace as my 440-pound frame can manage.\n\nThe round of nine went OK, but I tired quickly.\n\nBy the round of seven, I was gasping for air, a little dizzy and needed to take a seat between reps. The 20 minutes expired and I stalled after the round of seven.\n\nNate encouraged me to get a drink and focus on lowering my heart rate with slow, deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth.\n\nI was annoyed that I didn’t do better. Nate told me we would retest on the workout in a couple months. He figured I would pass all 10 rounds by then.\n\nI lacked his confidence in me, but this is where the memory question comes in.\n\nIn the short-term, I need to forget that workout results. I did the best I could. I didn’t get as far as I wanted to, but I still worked out at a strong pace for 20 minutes. There will be more weights to lift, more burpees to, um, burp, and so on.\n\nThe point is to get in as many quality repetitions in as possible even if it falls short of the goal of the planned workout. Each rep builds muscle, burns fat and increases endurance.\n\nSure, I still wish I could rip through the workout at top speed right now.\n\n“If you did,” Nate said, “what would we have to strive for?”\n\nI smirked.\n\n“I’m sure you can find a way to make it harder,” I said.\n\nThis is where a long-view is necessary. It was not that long ago that I got winded walking to the mailbox and hesitated to step off curbs because my knees would hurt too much from the girth crashing down onto the fragile, arthritic joints.\n\nA week or so back, I realized I could lift my lower leg off the floor and catch the ankle with my hand to stretch out the quads. I haven’t been able to do that since high school. We’re talking more than 23 years ago.\n\nWhen I started at CrossFit with Nate, I had to awkwardly lift my leg onto a box and lean back to stretch that quad. Now I’m much more flexible and leaner than I was eight months ago.\n\nI still get disgusted with myself when I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror coming out of the shower or see pictures of my bulbous belly.\n\nBut I have to remember that in a relatively short period, I have come a long way. And it’s valuable to measure those gains.\n\nNo, I wasn’t able to finish the workout Nate laid out before me. That’s fine. I will make it one day. The victory is making enough progress to even safely attempt such an exertion.\n\nForget short-term foibles. Celebrate long-term accomplishments. And remember every rep counts.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 22, 2016\n\nScaling back\n\nThe holidays provide a difficult challenge for anyone trying to lose weight.\n\nLast year, still early in my efforts to recover from morbid obesity, I decided to forego a traditional Thanksgiving meal at my uncle’s house. My parents and I celebrated together quietly on another evening with a menu friendlier to my diet.\n\nI’m following the same plan this year, but with an added twist. I’ve decided not to check my weight until after the first of the year.\n\nThis is not giving myself permission to blow my daily calorie goals for the entirety of the holiday season. Rather, it’s been a stressful couple of months with public tragedies and personal struggles.\n\nWeighing in, even when I expect good results, is an anxiety-riddled experience. All of the health professionals in my life repeat the same mantra: Weight is not the only, nor the best measure of health.\n\nStill, I know that more than 440 pounds is not a health weight nor sustainable if I would like to live comfortably over the next few decades.\n\nSo when the scale creeps up, I am terribly disappointed in myself because it feels like I’m doing the same work twice rather than gaining ground.\n\nThe science of this thinking is poor. Weight fluctuates daily based on a myriad of factors, including water intake and the kinds of foods you recently ate.\n\nFor example, my weight numbers tend to be goofy if I step on the scale after having taken a protein shake or within two hours of an intense workout.\n\nFurther, every time I write about my weigh-ins, particularly those after which I’ve gained weight, the internet trolls really pounce.\n\nI would love to tell you that after two years of doing this job and nearly as long chronicling my health efforts, that I have found a good way to cope with the cruel things people say to me about this or any other topic.\n\nBut I haven’t.\n\nPeople say I need to get a thicker skin. The thickness of human skin is about a tenth of an inch. Mine is no different. I just don’t like to be insulted.\n\nWhy, then, would I actively seek a career that puts me before the public eye and requires me to comment on issues that are controversial? Well, that’s a long story, but at least one reason is that stacking paragraphs is what I’m best at and fear is only a powerful force in your life if you let it limit your possibilities.\n\nStill, I’ve been on edge for a long time. Now is not the time to test my maximum endurance, which, while it is quite high, has been pushed enough for one fall.\n\nThe truth is, I’ve probably gained a few pounds in the last few weeks. I do two things when I’m anxious: spend money and eat.\n\nI’ve dug out some bags of french fries from the back of the freezer. I stabbed more than a few tator tots with my fork. One or two Marie Callender’s frozen meals, heavy with fats and carbs, landed in my microwave.\n\nThese incidents would usually lead me to a lengthy series of self-loathing. But this is a long game and, frankly, I’m tired of hating myself. I wrote last week about how anxiety has twisted my brain for several weeks and for much of the fall.\n\nI’ll go back to the scale in January. I’m not afraid of it. I just don’t need to do things that add to acute stress right now. This is my choice to make and I’m comfortable with it.\n\nI’m still going to the gym and getting stronger, more flexible and agile working with my friend and trainer, Nate Yoho, of CrossFit Merle Hay. I enjoy these sessions very much and come to view them as much as mental health therapy as physical fitness.\n\nI plan to keep my workout schedule through the holidays. We’ll get back on the scale after the first of the year. For now, I want to focus on fellowship of friends and family, calming thoughts and activities and making the best food choices available during a challenging season.\n\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 17, 2016\n\nSetting it aside\n\nThe new day’s sunlight filtered through the vertical blinds in my living room when I finally realized I had been up all night.\n\nI looked at the bright red digits on the clock on my TV stand. The time was shortly after 7 a.m. on a Sunday.\n\nI was wide awake and had been for nearly 20 hours. Normally, this kind of insomnia is associated with the panic attacks symptomatic of my acute anxiety disorder.\n\nBut I did not feel anxious. I did not feel anything.\n\nI just kept flitting between small projects for no good reason.\n\nIt started with finishing a page in my “Doctor Who” adult coloring book, an activity specifically designed to be calming.\n\nUsually, that works. This time, though, I became hyper-focused on finishing the page before I went to bed.\n\nI remember going into the bedroom at about 2 a.m. That’s late for bedtime, but not terrible for a former night police reporter who enjoys the quiet solitude of what Frank Sinatra described as the “wee, small hours of the morning.”\n\nI grimaced at the stack of comic books, magazines, half-read paperbacks, computer cords and other clutter gathered by my bedside.\n\nI decided it must be organized. This resulted in an hours-long reorganization of bookshelves and some furniture in my bedroom.\n\nIn the sorting, I discovered a small stack of 50-cent comics I bought at Black Medicine Comics. They were well-worn books from my childhood, “reader copies” as the collectors say.\n\nSome years ago, I bought an old-fashioned spindle rack similar to the one I bought comics off of at Montross Pharmacy in Winterset when I was a boy.\n\nI keep the rack in a corner of the living room. I thought I would put the comics on the rack and go to bed.\n\nThen I realized I didn’t like the fact the comic rack was in the corner and I couldn’t really see the books I’d just put on it.\n\nAnother hours-long reorganization of furniture began.\n\nA text from my girlfriend appeared on my phone at 10 a.m. I was still up. I told her I’d been up all night. I didn’t really know why.\n\nShe asked me if I’d taken my depression and anxiety medication on time. Sometimes I wait to take my medication so I can finish writing a stack of paragraphs or some other activity. But I took them at their appointed time, 10 p.m.\n\nWe exchanged a few texts. She urged me to get some rest. I showered and went to bed, but did not feel tired. I eventually fell asleep.\n\nI don’t remember what time I woke up Sunday afternoon. I talked with a few friends by phone. I napped through some dull NFL games on TV.\n\nThe reminder chirped on my smartphone. It was time to take my medication. I did. I went into the bedroom to read and get ready for a new week.\n\nThen I looked at the stack of books I reorganized just a day before. Wouldn’t they look better if I stacked them in a completely different way?\n\nFinally, just after midnight on Monday morning, I called my therapist’s after-hours service. He called back right away.\n\nI explained the patterns of behavior over the past two days. I couldn’t figure it out. I wasn’t manic, at least I didn’t feel that way.\n\nMy therapist talked me back through recent events. I helped cover the ambush killing of two Des Moines-metro police officers. Though I am not a police officer, I have a great affinity for the men and women who do the job.\n\nThen I wrote about my childhood friend Liz fighting terminal cancer. I recently learned another friend, Steve, who used to have the desk next to me at the Register, was “in the home stretch,” as he put it, with pancreatic cancer.\n\nAnd then there was the election. Sure, the popular thing to do is call people upset at the presidential results “crybabies.” But good friends of mine were terribly sad and angry. I could feel it. And it hurt.\n\n“That’s a lot of stuff you’ve got going on in a short amount of time,” my therapist said.\n\n“So why am I playing Tetris with my furniture?” I asked.\n\n“It’s just something to keep your mind off the things you don’t want to talk about,” my therapist said. “Your mind engages in these projects so it doesn’t have to think about what hurts.”\n\nThat made sense. It had been a rough few weeks. Too many carbs slipped into my diet. My motivation to hit the gym practically evaporated despite the supportive atmosphere. I felt wild and out of control.\n\n“I talk to a lot of people who are feeling the same way,” my therapist said. “Do you know what I tell them? Set it aside. There’s nothing you can do about it right now. You have to live your life.”\n\nThis seemingly simple advice helped me unlock “sleep mode.”\n\nI’m still very anxious, maybe as bad as I have been in a very anxious year. But I’m doing my best to handle it, keep commenting on the passing parade and telling stories.\n\nIt isn't easy, but, then, nobody ever promised us easy.\n\nWEDNESDAY, NOV. 9, 2016\n\nClearing the mechanism\n\nI thought I was processing the grief that came with the killings of two Des Moines-metro police officers as well as could be expected until I drove to the gym last week.\n\nIn the strip mall home of CrossFit Merle Hay, a vendor put up fencing and signage for a Christmas tree lot. I thought of Des Moines Police Sgt. Tony Beminio and Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin.\n\nTheir families were weeks away from experiencing their first Thanksgiving and Christmas without their loved ones. Beminio was the father of three. I thought about my first Christmas without my dad nearly 28 years ago.\n\nI pulled into the parking lot and parked a few rows away from the gym. I composed myself and walked in.\n\nMy trainer and friend, Nate Yoho, seems to inherently read moods. After stretches, we started a deadlift. Deadlifting is my favorite weightlifting exercise. I can’t say why. I just like it.\n\nI pressed my mind into thinking about my form as I yanked 272 pounds from the floor for five sets of three repetitions. We did another round of three sets of three reps at 250 pounds.\n\nOn good days at the gym, my mind locks into the exercise and all noise both internally and externally fades away.\n\nIt’s a wonderful mindset. Your body strains, yet you ignore the exhaustion in favor of one more rep. You don’t even hear the music blasting on the gym speakers.\n\nThe best representation I can think of for this comes from the mediocre 1999 baseball movie “For Love of the Game.” Kevin Costner plays an aging pitcher throwing a perfect game on the last day of his career. Early in the movie, the camera pans across the jeering Yankees fans and the cacophony of noise inside Yankee Stadium. He looks in at the catcher and thinks to himself, “Clear the mechanism.” With that, the noise around him fades away and it is just pitcher, catcher and batter.\n\nThis level of engagement is rare for me. Often the exhaustion breaks my concentration.\n\nBut the elite athletes at the gym, like Nate, are practiced enough at the mental game that they can lock in more frequently and it is a marvelous thing to witness.\n\nI could not “clear the mechanism” last week, at least not in terms of getting into a zone where I was attacking the exercises without awareness of how tired I was.\n\nYet as I worked through 20 minutes of metabolic conditioning that involved rounds of carrying 53-pound kettle bells in both hands, rowing and sit-ups, my mind at least temporarily pushed out the grief.\n\nMy session ended as they usually do, with me panting on the floor in a pool of sweat, feeling an odd mixture of accomplishment and annoyance that I could not do more.\n\nAs I drank my protein shake, Nate and I talked about the fallen officers. I told him about the Christmas tree lot. Nate and I became friends after I wrote a story about the loss of his wife, Laura, to cancer three years ago.\n\nWe both paused to consider that in the beginning, everyone tries to help you cope with grief. But eventually, the ham sandwiches are all gone, people go home to their lives and you are left with a great emptiness that remains for the rest of your life.\n\nNate still feels the loss of his wife. I still miss my dad.\n\nMost days, both of us are able to “clear the mechanism,” as it were, and live our lives.\n\nBut some days, the hurt feels raw and fresh. And you are left with only one solution: Keep moving forward.\n\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 3, 2016\n\nStrange sensation\n\nI visited my doctor, Shauna Basener, while I was on vacation last month.\n\nThe appointment was our first since she moved from a clinic in West Des Moines to the McFarland Clinic in Ames.\n\nI decided to follow her despite the extra travel time because I feel a strong sense of trust, rapport and open communication with Shauna as a doctor and a person.\n\nThis relationship is critical while dealing with chronic health issues. In my case, those issues are morbid obesity, high blood pressure and arthritis in my knees and lower back.\n\nIn one of our first visits, Shauna won my trust when she told me to stop taking an iron supplement because my blood tests showed it was unnecessary.\n\n“The best medicine is no medicine,” she said.\n\nThis is a philosophy I wholly support. This is not to say I oppose medication or regular preventative care.\n\nThe idea is to help the body function properly without the assistance of medications or supplements. I still take two medications for blood pressure, three medications for mental health issues, a daily vitamin and a fish oil supplement.\n\nBut in the time I’ve worked with Shauna, I’ve changed my physical well-being enough to stop taking medication for type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nMy blood pressure reading was good enough that Shauna considered lowering the dosage of my blood pressure medication or dropping it altogether.\n\nThis idea astounded me. I thought once a person went on blood pressure medication, it became a permanent part of the routine.\n\nBut the weight loss and increase in physical activity over the last 19 months improved my health enough that some of the chronic conditions have eased.\n\nMy blood tests during this visit showed similar promise.\n\nMy A1C test, which gives doctors a picture of my average blood sugar level for about three months, was the second-lowest (that’s good) since I began recovery.\n\nMy cholesterol levels were within acceptable ranges and improving.\n\nAnd my weight was 444.6 pounds – a loss of 118.6 pounds since I began the journey nearly 600 days ago and also my lowest mark to date.\n\nI gained 13 pounds between August and September and the thought distressed me so I feel into a deep funk complete with the usual round of negative self-talk.\n\nBetween September and my October physical, I lost those 13 pounds and three more.\n\nThis inspired an unusual emotion: hope.\n\nGetting healthier means, barring accident or catastrophe, I likely will live longer.\n\nMost of my life, I’ve thought about the end of my life.\n\nMy dad died when I was 13. My mom died when I was 14. My dad was sickly for the last several years of his life.\n\nI used to write my will and testament on wide-ruled notebook paper that I kept in my desk because I thought that was something I needed to do.\n\nOne of my favorite teachers in fourth grade died of leukemia. I remember staying home from school the day after she died and trying to will myself to die because I didn’t want to face school without her kind face and gentle manner.\n\nThroughout all my struggles – health, financial, psychological or vocational – in my 41 years, I have always thought about how my life would end.\n\nI assumed it would end badly, with lots of pain and suffering or, as I have often admitted, by my own hand.\n\nNow, though, there is a good chance that isn’t going to happen anytime soon. This represents a dramatic shift in perspective.\n\nIf I’m going to live, what am I to make of my life? I need to reshape my outlook.\n\nIt’s daunting, but it beats planning your own funeral.\n\nTHURSDAY, OCT. 13, 2016\n\nA path forward\n\nThe pain lanced through my lower back like an electric shock.\n\nThe time was about 3 a.m. I tried to sit up in bed, but my lower back hurt so much I actually cried out.\n\nI tested the boundaries of movement. Articulation at the waist hurt the most. With some painful effort, I threw my legs over the side of the bed and pulled myself up to a standing position.\n\nI equated the harshness of the pain to the back injury that started this journey to recover from morbid obesity 19 months ago.\n\nI gingerly shuffled to the closet and fished out a prescription muscle relaxant I keep in case of emergencies. I swallowed one with some water and slowly walked into the living room.\n\nI tried to think of what might have caused this flare up. My workout at CrossFit Merle Hay earlier in the day went fine. I was tired but felt no pain or stiffness.\n\nTrainer Nate Yoho wanted to try a new movement, something called a sumo deadlift. I stood on two boxes a foot tall. I squatted and reached past my feet to grab a 35-pound kettlebell from the floor. Then I stood.\n\nThe challenge was almost like pulling 35 pounds out of a hole in the ground.\n\nAt the time we did the exercise, I felt the usual strains associated with a workout, but nothing spectacular.\n\nWe finished with a metabolic conditioning cycle that involved kettlebell swings and the rowing machine. I walked – and partially ran – a mile.\n\nI drank a protein shake and a recovery drink. I sat around for a while to watch the most experienced athletes prepare for an upcoming competition.\n\nI returned to my home office to stack paragraphs and knocked off for the day in the early evening.\n\nI recalled no incidents that would have set off this tight, aching back.\n\nYet there I sat in my living room, waiting for the pain killer to kick in propped up by some extra pillows in the small of my back and barely able to move.\n\nI worried the injury would stop the progress I’ve made at the gym in recent weeks. Since a recent setback in weight loss, I’ve shifted focus from the scale to what I can do with my body.\n\nI’ll return to the scale soon enough, but confidence comes quicker and more practically through training than it does in those few anxious seconds before I step on a scale.\n\nThe pain, combined with the sluggishness that comes with muscle relaxers, sidelined me from the gym later that day.\n\nI hate to miss sessions, which is in itself something of a victory. I never thought I would enjoy training as much as I do and in such a variety of ways, from the physical exertion and strength gains to camaraderie of the trainers and athletes.\n\nI also hate to miss sessions because even though I know recovery is just as important as exercise, my brain – twisted by anxiety – always believes a missed session means my body begins to atrophy and I’ll lose all the strength and mobility I’ve gained.\n\nIt’s an irrational worry, as most of mine are, but it’s something I wrestle with in these situations.\n\nOn the day I took off and during my regular off day, I tried to stretch as often as I could. I bent over and put my palms on the floor. I cycled through the exercises I learned in physical therapy when I originally hurt my back.\n\nThe pain lingered at varying intensities, but by the end of the second day off I started to feel better. My back still hurt – especially after long periods sitting or lying down.\n\nBut I found myself texting Nate, pledging to be at our next session. I wasn’t fully recovered, but Nate is used to working around injuries.\n\nHe recently had a client with a torn bicep who came in and managed to work out. My injury was far less severe than that.\n\nI took several lessons from this frightening recurrence of back pain. First, I am in better shape and stronger than I was 19 months ago. That means my body recovers faster even when it really hurts.\n\nAnd secondly, while I might worry that every pitfall will be catastrophic, I’m slowly beginning to understand that not everything is going to end in disaster.\n\nThis is something my mental health therapist has been working on with me for years, as have my family, friends and loved ones.\n\nBut it took working out at CrossFit with Nate to finally realize there is always a path forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCT. 5, 2016\n\nCast of characters\n\nSometimes I watch them, the other athletes and trainers, as I sit on the wooden bench at the front of CrossFit Merle Hay, dabbing the sweat from my bald head and recovering my breath.\n\nIt still feels like an exaggeration to refer to myself as an “athlete” in this gym filled with men and women who look like Greek marble statues come to life.\n\nBut Nate Yoho, the gym’s owner, insists upon it. Once you heft the first weight, pull the first row and walk the first step, to Nate, you are an athlete – his athlete.\n\nWhen my workouts end, I drink a protein shake and suck water from an aluminum bottle.\n\nThey truly come in all shapes and sizes, both athletes and trainers.\n\nThere is 72-year-old Denny Joe, survivor of three open-heart surgeries. A doctor told him he would never run again. He runs nearly every day on a high school track near his home.\n\nHe works with Nate, who helps him with flexibility, strength and stamina. On a recent day, I watched Denny Joe prop himself up on his forearms and rest his ankles on a box. He held a ridged position with his abs tightened for 2 minutes. They call the exercise planking. I call it amazing.\n\nOn the days when my arthritic knees bark and I want to stay in my comfortable oversized office chair, I think of Denny Joe, the septuagenarian superman who still runs when they told him he could not.\n\nVan Marshall works alongside Nate as a trainer. He hurt his hamstring recently and then hurt it again. This stops normal people from intense workout. It turned Van into a carpenter.\n\nHe assembled workout equipment that allowed him to exercise without straining his injured muscle a third time.\n\nMy favorite: He wound a thick rope around a sled and stacked heavy weight plates atop it. With another athlete, they took turns pulling the heavy sled across the floor. While one pulled, the other did pushups.\n\nWhen I gasp for air and think I have no more to give, I think of Van and push just a little harder.\n\nMichelle is another trainer at CrossFit. She works with a young, overweight middle school girl. She pours her heart into inspiring the girl to embrace fitness the way she embraces reading and academic achievement.\n\nMichelle starts each session by walking beside the girl. I don’t know what they talk about and it’s none of my business.\n\nBut in those dark moments when I want to quit because it feels hopeless or the chemical malfunctions in my brain turn my thoughts against me, I think of Michelle and the culture of this gym. I know I never walk alone.\n\nI watch Nate as he works with other athletes. He greets everyone with a smile. He encourages, corrects, directs and pushes.\n\nHe is in top physical condition, stronger and faster than he has ever been in his 33 years. He recently set a series of personal records in competition-style workouts. Had they been in a competition, he would have finished 17th in the region and in the top 100 in the world.\n\nNate relates the accomplishments with the giddiness of a small boy. Yet I witness him reflect that same enthusiasm and joy for the gains of his athletes.\n\nWords fail to accurately reflect how much I respect this man, how honored I am by his friendship. He played minor league baseball but never cracked the big leagues, the kind of disappointment that turns many people into round-bellied storytellers at the end of the bar, loudly reliving their glory days to anyone within earshot.\n\nBut Nate rebuilt. He came home to Des Moines, became a trainer, met the love of his life, got married and opened his own gym.\n\nThen Nate lost his wife to cancer a few months before his daughter was born by surrogate. That’s the kind of twist of fate that could crack a man.\n\nNate rebuilt again. His world rotates around daughter Caralyn, who turns 3 in November. Nate plans to move into a larger site to accommodate the growth at his gym.\n\nSometimes I look at myself in the mirror and grimace at what I see. I think withering thoughts about my lumpy body, saggy skin and all the mistakes and overindulgence that led to that point.\n\nThen I think of Nate, who never judged me not on my first wheezing day when I could barely lift a 45-pound bar without pain lancing through my back and not on my most recent workout, when I tossed a tire, cradled a kettlebell under my chin while squatting and pulled ring rows for 22 minutes in a row.\n\nI think of this man who helps me three times a week push harder, get stronger and be better. And I know he does it because he cares. He wants me to succeed, sustain and achieve.\n\nSelf-discipline is a wonderful concept and not to be underestimated, but neither is teamwork. With my bent mindset, I give up on myself often.\n\nYet with this cast of characters working so hard to help themselves and each other, I shrug off the anxiety and doubt despite internal misgivings.\n\nI need only look at the faces of my teammates to find the faith to keep moving forward.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 27, 2016\n\nA better kind of scale\n\nI needed a win.\n\nThe weigh-in that showed a gain of 13 pounds over the previous month brought my spirits low. I felt as if the work I had done in increasingly intense workouts over recent months was in vain.\n\nI had the vague, unrealistic fear that I was creeping back to the nearly 600 pounds I was before I began this journey.\n\nNate Yoho, my friend and trainer at CrossFit Merle Hay, seemed to sense this when I arrived at the gym.\n\nWe started with a deadlift, my favorite weightlifting exercise. It’s the one that reminds me I once couldn’t carry a few bags of groceries without hurting myself.\n\nNow I can pull hundreds of pounds off the floor without a problem.\n\nI can’t see the muscles in my back, but my girlfriend says they are firmer, and I feel stronger.\n\nNate and I started, as always, with 10 reps of just the 45-pound bar. We started to warm up, increasing weight and decreasing repetitions.\n\nThe plates started stacking thick on both sides of the bar.\n\n“I see we're going with the no-messing-around weight today,” I said to Nate. I may have used a different word than “messing.”\n\n“We’re going for it,” Nate said.\n\nBy “it,” Nate meant a personal record. I set one several months ago at 331 pounds.\n\nAt the time, Nate said I probably could have done more, but I began to lose my form — which can lead to injury — on my final reps, so we stopped.\n\nThis time, with form locked in, I pulled from the ground to my knees, keeping my back straight, my chest up and leading with my shoulders.\n\nNate kept sliding on more plates. Finally, we reached 352 pounds, which would best the previous record by 21 pounds.\n\nI squatted into position, set my heels and yanked that bar to my waist. I held it for a second before I let the bar drop and slam to the floor.\n\nNate and I bumped fists. That felt damned good.\n\nWe dropped the weight down to 225 pounds for five sets of five reps. I focused on the form that sometimes fails as I try to set records.\n\nI squeezed my shoulder blades together and led with my upper body as I stood. I worked the rounds.\n\nWith each round completed, Nate fist-pumped on the side. He bubbled with jubilation.\n\n“This is what I do this for,” he said. “This is about you getting your life back. You’re no longer a prisoner in your own body or your own home. You don’t have to worry about hurting yourself doing everyday things.”\n\nHe reminded me I pulled 352 pounds off the floor and was closing in on a full body-weight deadlift — a major accomplishment in weightlifting, especially for a man of my girth.\n\nThen he pointed out I finished 25 reps of 225 pounds. No amount of groceries I bought was going to weigh that. That strength was mine now, to nurture and build upon.\n\nAnd that felt even better than the personal record.\n\nFor our metabolic conditioning, Nate retested me on a workout I completed twice during our time together.\n\nThe set involved declining reps on three separate exercises for time, beginning at 10 and decreasing by one until the last round was one rep.\n\nThe three exercises were rowing on the machine, push-ups and pulling a 20-pound medicine ball from the floor and throwing it down.\n\nMy first time was 18 minutes — 18 seconds. The second time I ran the gauntlet, my time went up — in part because I fiddled with the straps on the rowing machine too much.\n\nThis time, though, I felt a burning sense of purpose, a desire to rip this thing to shreds.\n\nI don’t remember much about the metabolic conditioning series other than when I felt even the slightest sense of fatigue, I screamed to myself in my head, “Next time, you do one less than this time.”\n\nWhen I pounded the medicine ball on the floor for a final time, I fell to my knees and rolled over on my back. Sweat rolled back off my bald head and pooled on the gym floor.\n\nI could barely breathe.\n\n“Time,” I wheezed to Nate.\n\n“12:29,” he said. “You just beat your old best time by almost 6 minutes. You went to a different mental place to do that.”\n\nNate shook my hand. I stayed on the floor.\n\nMy chest heaved. My heart rate slowed. I smiled.\n\nI’ll take this measure of fitness over the scale every single time.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 20, 2016\n\nSetbacks and commitments\n\nMy shirt hung heavy on my sweaty frame.\n\nThe day’s workout at CrossFit Merle Hay felt good. Coach Nate Yoho put me through a timed metabolic conditioning circuit.\n\nIt involved a row, followed by a bike ride followed by a 200 meter walk with a 50-pound barbell in each hand.\n\nThe thing took 20 minutes, 10 seconds. We both wanted to finish in less than 20 minutes, but the strength of my grip faded on the back half of the 200-meter. I need to stop one more time before the finish. It cost me a few seconds.\n\nStill, I felt good. I thought of all the things I could do now that I wasn’t able to do when I when I started at the gym about nine months ago.\n\nI probably am the physically strongest I have ever been and, outside of playing basketball as a sophomore at Winterset High School, this is probably the most sustained physical activity I’ve ever done.\n\nI drank my protein shake and a recovery drink. I chatted with Nate. We talked about how my form had improved in various lifts and exercises. I am beginning to develop body awareness.\n\nI felt good and strong. I decided to drive over to Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center to check my weight.\n\nWorkouts continued to increase intensity over recent weeks. The sweat and grind must surely produce a positive result.\n\nJacque Schwartz, my regular dietician, wasn’t available. Another professional familiar with these paragraphs took the measurement.\n\nMy jaw hung agape at the results. I gained 13 pounds since Aug. 11. It was the biggest rollback since I began recovery from morbid obesity more than 18 months ago.\n\nI held back tears as I slid on my shoes and socks. I hustled out to my car and collapsed into the driver’s seat. Despondency washed over me. Boy, the jerks on social media were going to love this. I can almost see the all the creative fat jokes being crafted once this column is published.\n\nThe first thought I had was to take the car down to Iowa Highway 5 south of the airport and get it up as fast as I could go and smash it into the bridge truss at top speed.\n\nI have suicidal thoughts sometimes. It is painful and embarrassing to admit, but it is true. They come from a combination of thinking errors, adverse childhood experiences and the malfunction of brain chemistry that goes along with chronic depression and acute anxiety.\n\nThis does not mean I am actively suicidal. It means that sometimes when I struggle, my mind visits upon those thoughts, usually exceptionally briefly. I first had suicidal thoughts in fourth grade after my favorite teacher died. I think once your brain cracks the seal on that kind of thinking, it always lurks in your mind even if you aren't going to act upon it. Author Susanna Kaysen, who lives with borderline personality disorder, described the persistent, illogical nature of suicidal thinking in her autobiographical book, “Girl, Interrupted.”\n\n“Once you’ve posed that question, it won’t go away,” she wrote.\n\nThat’s how suicidal thinking is for me. I think about it, usually when I screw up or believe I have disappointed people who give me their love and put their trust in me. Through behavioral therapy, I’ve learned to manage suicidal thoughts. The first thought I have is that I don’t want to cause pain to the people I love, especially Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nThen I think of the poor cop who has to see whatever is left of me at the accident scene. Or I consider the fact I might survive the attempt but permanently and severely injured.\n\nAll these thoughts pass in a few seconds or less. Usually, the real problems – sadness and disappointment – are revealed. Sadness and disappointment are rational reactions to negative events. These I can work with, unpleasant though they may be.\n\nOne note of caution here: Always take seriously someone who talks openly about suicide. I have a lot of experience wrangling these thoughts and an excellent support structure in place, but others — especially adolescents — don't have the experience to know the pain will pass.\n\nMy boss read these paragraphs and called to check on me, as one should. We had a talk. I assured her I was OK, just going through a rough patch. Talking is always a good idea. The worst that can happen is a person tells to buzz off or that they are fine. The best that can happen is they ask for help.\n\nI called my therapist and told him I was in a spiral. He asked me what might have caused the weight gain.\n\nMy best guess was too many carbohydrates. I indulged in one too many English muffins, lasagna and pizza a few times in the previous month.\n\nMy therapist emphasized that weight is but one measure of success. I was stronger. I looked better. I found a new community at the gym. I knew that, but when overwhelmed by the disappointment, I could not see it.\n\nMy therapist asked me what my plan was. I decided to cut my daily calorie intake from 2,500 calories to 2,250. I planned to more vigorously eschew carbohydrates.\n\nI also planned to break up my total calorie intake into three or four smaller meals instead of some snacks or protein supplements and one large, high-calorie meal.\n\nBy the time I finished detailing the plan, a kind of calm settled in. My therapist always says it helps to say things out loud. The negative thoughts sound silly and the positive ones make more sense.\n\nI texted the bad news to Nate.\n\n“Life happens,” he said. “I’ve never had a client who lost more than 100 pounds that didn’t slide back. Did you think you were going to be the first?”\n\nAt first, I thought Nate unsympathetic. Then I remembered a story he told me while he was playing minor league baseball some years ago.\n\nHe went through a 0-for-40 slump. He was the fourth outfielder on the team and only played once or twice a week.\n\n“I’d go 0-for-5 and sit for four days,” Nate said. “Nobody wanted to be around me. I was in a bad mood all the time.”\n\nThe lesson, though, is that nobody bats 1.000. I made some bad decisions with food and it caught up with me. I already had a plan in place to improve.\n\nYes, the usual trolls would come in via social media or email with their scolds and finger-wagging about the fat man who got fatter.\n\nI don’t have to write about the dark places my mind goes or the pain I feel when I don’t reach a goal. I choose to do so because setbacks, mistakes and failures are a part of recovery. Pretending that they aren't is simply a lie.\n\nSuch challenges matter less than what one does about them once they’re presented.\n\nI was back at the gym Monday afternoon, lifting weights, doing push-ups, burpies, squats, dumbbell snatches and kettlebell swings.\n\nThe journey continued.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 13, 2016\n\nGetting to the good stuff\n\nForty seconds remained in the 15-minute workout.\n\nAt CrossFit Merle Hay, where I continue my ongoing battle against morbid obesity, they call it “AMRAP” – as many repetitions as possible in a set time period.\n\nThe menu of exercises included five “wall balls,” which involves squatting with a 20-pound medicine ball at your chest and standing up, throwing the ball to a mark on the wall in front of you and catching it, a 10-calorie exercise bike ride and 15 sit-ups.\n\nNate changed the form on the sit-ups. In the past, when my belly was larger and my back weaker, the goal was to get my hands to my knees.\n\nThis day he wanted me to get my hands to my toes, tapping my fingertips on the 70-pound dumbbells I hooked my toes under while doing the activity.\n\nWhen he first described it, I thought I couldn’t do it. I found I was able to do it with relative ease. This, of course, changed as the workout continued and my body tired.\n\nThe workout was near complete and I’d made three full rounds and was two sit-ups away from four complete rounds. But my abdominal muscles – I promise there are some under all of the fat rolls – started to fail.\n\nI needed to hit two more sit-ups with 40 seconds. I hit one. But on the final try, my muscles just surrendered and I fell back.\n\nNate hollered for me to try again, counting down the seconds on the clock.\n\nI tried and got about two-thirds of the way there, but my gut muscles had no more left to give.\n\nI rolled over and pulled my knees to my chest. I sweated and gasped on the rubbery gym floor. Nate gave me a fist bump. The final tally marked 119 reps.\n\nThis is the good stuff, I thought, out of gas and exhausted.\n\nHow did it come to pass that such a feeling of exhaustion became “the good stuff?”\n\nIn recent weeks, this job had been getting to me. I live with acute anxiety disorder. My brain twists small problems into big problems and sometimes no problems into big problems.\n\nI was really struggling with a few work-related things: jerks on social media, worries about convincing a broad audience that it’s worth paying for the content in The Register and so on.\n\nMy bosses assured me they were pleased with my work and that they were happy with how my paragraphs connected with our audience.\n\nMy brain was misfiring and I was in a loop. And when you’re an anxiety sufferer in the middle of a downward spiral, very few things can jolt you back to clarity.\n\nI worked with my therapist. He can usually do it, but I wasn’t settling to a normal rhythm. Everything felt uncomfortable and overwhelming.\n\nI’ll talk to my girlfriend about her cats or my buddy Paul from Memphis about stupid TV shows and bad movies, which is nearly all of them.\n\nBut that nagging feeling that my life was out of control and everything was going to end badly persisted. I woke up in the morning in a nearly full panic and found myself extra surly and suspicious.\n\nIt reached a point where I wanted to write a column that poked fun at one of Iowa’s sacred subjects but I was afraid to do it because of the beating I would take on social media, through email and phone calls.\n\nThat was the moment I knew I needed to take a timeout. I took FMLA leave to clear my head and bring the anxiety symptoms back into manageable ranges.\n\nI’m an insecure person. Lots of people are, maybe most of us are. I want to be liked and loved, but I’ve picked a strange occupation to seek adulation in the age of angry discourse augmented by social media.\n\nStill, an important part of my job is challenging the audience with ideas counter to the status quo. If I’m afraid to do that, I can’t be the kind of columnist I want to be and I might as well turn in my laptop.\n\nI took 11 days off, including the Labor Day holiday and two weekends. I rested. I read. I eschewed social media. I hung out with friends. I tried to get my sleep schedule back on track.\n\nAnd I hit the gym.\n\nI played catch with Nate and Van Marshall, a trainer at the gym. I ran through the workouts despite arthritic knees aching with the barometric pressure shifts during a rainy period.\n\nAnd the days I was at the gym, I felt settled, even gruntled. There’s science behind this. Workouts produce endorphins and serotonin, which lead to better moods and less anxiety.\n\nBut the routine of it – working out to near-exhaustion, hanging out with the crew – was as important as any of the physicality involved.\n\nAbout eight days into my sabbatical, I woke up and felt fine. My gut was calm. My brain was active and eager to be at the gym.\n\n“Today is the first day in about two months that I’ve felt good,” I said to Nate.\n\n“It’s about time,” Nate said.\n\nI agreed.\n\nBack to the recent workout: I lay on the floor in a kind of sultry daze.\n\n“Did you see there is a Part C?” Nate said. He meant there was another round to the workout. My brain cursed him, but I fought my way to my feet.\n\nHe wanted me to walk or run a mile, not for time. I restrained my profanity again. I drank a protein shake. I got my wind back. I hit the bricks.\n\nMy mind worked ahead. As I navigated the bumpy, pockmarked pavement behind the gym, I already was thinking of climbing the long hill on the access road.\n\nBy the time I was at the access road, I was thinking about the turn back to the building to complete the first lap.\n\nMy mind was working at the same frenetic pace it does during anxiety attacks. But instead of shredding my psyche with worry, it was planning my attack to finish this mile in less than 20 minutes.\n\nI jogged the last 100 yards or so and finished at 18 minutes, 54 seconds. I was out of breath. I sipped a recovery drink and sweated on the bench while Nate worked with other clients.\n\nYes, I thought, this really is the good stuff.\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 30, 2016\n\nHead games\n\nThe kettle bell with the green stripes at the base of the handle weighs 53 pounds.\n\nRust peeks through portions of its rounded base where the black paint has chipped away.\n\nChalk dust coats the ball with clean spots made by drips of sweat striking the lead weight in a series of swings to end a grueling workout.\n\nThrough the loop on the handle, you can see the obscured image of a man exhausted, splayed out on the floor with his seemingly lifeless hand laying on the soft padded floor of Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay gym.\n\nThis portly paragraph-stacker unceremoniously dropped the kettle bell to the floor after 20 swings and collapsed in to what Nate calls “the CrossFit position.”\n\nI began the workout with some trepidation. My arthritic knees ached with the recent humidity and volatile barometric pressure.\n\nRecent workouts challenged the joints’ stability with jump roping and light jogging. I warmed up slowly on the humid day.\n\nAs always, Nate asked how my body felt. I warned him my knees ached, but, as always, I was not at the gym to be comfortable.\n\nWe began with an exercise called “thrusters.” The lift involves putting weight on a bar, holding it at the tops of your shoulders in front of your body with your elbows pointed out.\n\nYou squat and then thrust up from the squat, careful to keep your heels on the floor, and then push the weight above your head as your hips swing forward.\n\nMy knees hurt, but they eventually loosened up or enough adrenaline flowed that I did not notice the ache as badly.\n\nThe cardio portion of the workout came next. Nate lined up nine activities to be completed for time. It began with a 20-calorie row, a 100-meter run (run!), and 30-calorie bike ride, followed by another row, run, ride and run.\n\nThe capstone was 20 swings of the 53-pound kettle bell.\n\nLet’s pause for a moment to consider the notion of a 447-pound man running. Brian Brown will not be recruiting me for any special events at next year’s Drake Relays.\n\nBut running is something I’ve largely avoided since maybe playing a few pickup basketball games at Bell Center when I was a Drake University student more than 20 years ago.\n\nWhen I began this recovery from morbid obesity, a 156-foot walk was enough to drench me with sweat and force me to sit down, near complete exhaustion.\n\nI was in slightly better shape when Nate invited me to his gym in late January this year. But running and jumping were far from my mind.\n\nYet in recent weeks, we’ve started running and jumping. It’s difficult and taxes my knees in particular.\n\nBut my knees are strong. A doctor took X-rays when I weighed close to 600 pounds. There was still good cartilage and space between the bones. I was simply putting a lot of pressure on the joints, which caused the arthritis.\n\nNow I’m challenging those joints again, though with a body that is much lighter. Still, they hurt. Yet I keep pushing them. Because something strange is happening to me.\n\nI want to see how hard I can really go.\n\nI am good at rowing and the stationary bike. I keep a good pace at those, even when fatigue sets in. Running is new.\n\nNate said I could walk the 100 meters if I needed to. I pledged to run all four rounds, even if it was barely a jog.\n\nI stayed on the balls of my feet and dug in when I needed to climb the hill back to the gym.\n\nI regained my breath on the bike or rower. I still went hard, but I’ve become strong enough in those exercises that I can perform at a higher level and still recoup some of my energy for activities that are more taxing.\n\nNate set no time goal for me, but mentally I wanted to finish in less than 20 minutes. On the last 100 meters, my creaky knees really ached on the downhill run alongside the gym’s building.\n\nI turned to run back to the gym and I turned it on. Now, I don’t want anyone getting visions of Usain Bolt here. It was a slow, plodding, clopping graceless run.\n\nBut for a man of my girth on this point in my journey, it was a damn Olympic sprint.\n\nThe last round was 20 kettle bell swings. My breath was shallow. I decided to break it down into four sets of five swings. I made the first five and took a break.\n\nMy gray T-shirt was heavy with sweat. My arms and legs were slick.\n\nI swung five more and thought for a moment that I did not have two rounds in me. I leaned on the stationary bike for support. I gasped for air.\n\nNate suggested I try six swings to get more than halfway home. I decided I wanted to be done.\n\nI swung the final 10 swings in the third round. The kettle bell landed on the floor. I followed, spent and gasping.\n\nThe elapsed time was 17 minutes, 3 seconds.\n\nNate shook my hand. He let me be for a few minutes while I regained my breath.\n\nI propped myself up on my elbows.\n\nNate said I’d been hitting the floor a lot after workouts recently. I said he was pushing me harder.\n\nHe corrected me.\n\n“No, you’re breaking through mentally,” Nate said. “You’re going to that place in your head that really wants to push as far as you can go.”\n\nI understood exactly what he meant. Look at all I can do now when 18 months ago, exhausted after 156 feet, I asked Stefanie Kirk, physical therapist at Mercy South Physical Therapy, if I had any hope.\n\nNow my mindset is: Just how far can I go?\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 23, 2016\n\nJump, jump around\n\nI bought a jump rope.\n\nIf Vegas took odds on what this paragraph stacker would buy, jump rope would not have even been on the board.\n\nBut I bought one because my trainer, CrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho, said it was time to integrate jumping into my workouts.\n\nWe worked on some light jumping, just a few inches off the ground. My arthritic knees took the pounding fairly well.\n\nSo I shelled out almost $25 for a jump rope. This isn’t actually a rope. It’s a thin aluminum cable with slim handles with rubber grips.\n\nThe elegant little thing is a far cry from the nylon jump rope with wood handles I received for participating in Jump Rope for Heart in fifth grade.\n\nScores of jump ropes hang on hooks at the gym. But Nate worried that none would be long enough for my 6-foot-4 frame.\n\nSo I invested in exercise equipment. It even comes with a small nylon storage bag to keep it tightly and tidily wound inside my gym bag.\n\nI have not jumped rope since it was a unit in physical education class, likely in elementary or middle school. I recall charts on the wall with various tricks one could do.\n\nMy favorite was “side swing,” which involved swinging the rope on each side of your body and no actual jumping.\n\nBut this is a new era. CrossFit athletes do something called “double-unders,” in which they spin the rope so quickly and jump high enough that the rope clears their feet twice for every jump.\n\nThis big-and-tall man is not ready for double-unders. I am barely capable of single jumps. But once the jump rope arrived, Nate decided to incorporate it into the metabolic conditioning.\n\nThe act of getting a body that weighs 447 pounds to jump up repeatedly while spinning a rope underneath is somewhat comical if observed from the outside.\n\nYet I was surprised how easily my morbidly obese form took to the rhythm. I made six jumps unbroken the first time. Nate adjusted the length of the rope and I was able to do an unbroken stretch of 16 jumps.\n\nThis will hardly set a world record, but it almost certainly is a personal one.\n\nJumping rope reminds me of swimming. It’s something done effortlessly as a child but somehow became exceptionally exhausting as an adult.\n\nI felt my heavy body pile-driving into the gym floor with each leap, yet I kept jumping the line as quickly and often as I could.\n\nNate included jump-ropes in our metabolic conditioning for the day. The series of exercises involved a 10-calorie row, 10 push-ups and 10 rope jumps over 18 minutes.\n\nThese metabolic conditioning routines are rough. I try to get through as many rounds as possible, but I often find myself gasping for air early in the process.\n\nThe arms always go first. By the second or third round, they might as well be those flags waving wildly in those wacky inflatable tube men on display at used car lots.\n\nThe legs hold out better, to a point. But I often feel the burn in my quadriceps earlier than I like.\n\nNate would admonish me that I am much stronger than I was when we started in January. But I stay in the moment.\n\nOne pull, one jump, one push-up. There is no past or future, only now.\n\nSomehow, in the midst of that cycle, the jump rope became the easy part. I got a rhythm fairly quickly and made it through 10 jumps unbroken three or four times.\n\nAh, but there were consequences. The first time we used the jump rope, it was a Thursday workout. Nate had just returned from a trip out east.\n\nTypically, Thursday workouts are a little lighter. The body is beat up from going hard at the beginning of the week. The Thursday workout is just to get the blood flowing.\n\nBut Nate’s assistants led me through workouts earlier that week. He did not see me grind through. So he decided to bring his own grind.\n\nThe workout ended and my legs quivered.\n\nThe next day, my knees ached as they hadn’t done since the early days of physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nI invested in a large bottle of ibuprofen, which cost almost as much as the jump rope. But hopefully the 1,600 pills will last longer.\n\nThe medicine did the trick for the inflammation. A light weekend allowed the knees to recover.\n\nBut after Monday’s workout, I texted Stefanie to ask her what muscles were hurting. I described the location of the pain.\n\nShe sent me the name of the muscle and a link to a health website to learn more about it. My trouble spots were the hip flexor and something called the quadratus lumborum.\n\nSo not only am I jumping rope like I did in middle school, I’m learning physiology through aches and pains after workouts.\n\nI took physiology from a great teacher at East High School named Paul Sloan.\n\nI don’t recall how well I did in the class, but if you’re reading, Mr. Sloan, you were right. I probably should have paid more attention.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 17, 2016\n\nNew sensation\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of anything. I’ve typed that sentence before, but I find it especially true as I evaluate the changes in my life while recovering from morbid obesity.\n\nThe latest weigh-in at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center shows a loss of 116 pounds since March 2015 and a decrease of my body mass index of more than 22 percent.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, but I am headed in the right direction — and have been nearly 18 months. My diet is better, but hardly perfect.\n\nMy exercise routines at CrossFit Merle Hay continue to grow in intensity. I probably am physically stronger now than I have been at any point in my life.\n\nStill, sometimes my brain defaults to running my body as if it were still 563 pounds.\n\nFor example, one of the reasons I began this journey was because I hurt my back carrying in groceries from the car. I carried in all my groceries at once because my body wasn’t fit enough to make two trips to the car without serious exhaustion.\n\nIn a recent workout, I set a personal record of deadlifting more than 330 pounds, under coach Nate Yoho’s guidance.\n\nYet, still, whenever I get home from the grocery store with the bags in my trunk, I think, “Oh, man, am I going to hurt my back again?”\n\nI eat well, but I do not carry 330 pounds of groceries at any point. I doubt I carry in 50 pounds of groceries.\n\nAnd the other day, as part of a circuit workout, I carried a 53-pound kettlebell in each hand on a 100-meter walk as a part of a series of exercises in metabolic conditioning. It wasn’t a strain.\n\nCarrying the groceries isn’t, either. But my mind thinks I can’t, even when my body obviously can.\n\nIt’s a strange thing.\n\nWhen I weighed 563 pounds, one of the most difficult tasks I faced six days a week was walking the 150 yards or so from my apartment building to the mailboxes in the parking lot.\n\nAt my worst, I would drive my car to the mailbox, get my mail and then park as close as I could to my door.\n\nNate and I have just begun to work on running and jumping in workouts — two activities I thought my body would never be able to handle again. I even bought a jump rope.\n\nI walked a mile the other day for time. I don’t remember the time, but it wasn’t bad, and I wasn’t out of gas.\n\nWe’re going to try a jogging and walking combo the next time we test on the mile.\n\nSo, of course I can traverse 150 yards without a problem. I just think that I can’t.\n\nSo I hesitate. I think, “Oh, that is so far.”\n\nThen I walk and think, “Why was I worried about this at all?”\n\nOne of the things my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, and I worked on early in recovery was getting in and out of the car without pain.\n\nTo this day, some 116 pounds lighter and much stronger, I often pause with my door open, dreading the idea of standing up and getting out of the car.\n\nI know I can do it without needing to use my arms to pull myself up on the frame of the door and roof of the car.\n\nBut I still think about it.\n\nI suppose this will eventually pass.\n\nI felt a little milestone recently at the gym when Van Marshall, a CrossFit trainer who was pinch-hitting for Nate while he was out of town, gave me a lengthy workout.\n\nI looked at the slate he outlined for me. It was one of those scaled workouts that decreases by one rep each session, beginning at 10 and ending at one.\n\nThe circuit involved rowing, ring rows and a weightlifting exercise. The whole thing was topped off with an 800-meter walk.\n\nI looked at that workout and thought, “Yeah, I can do that.”\n\nNow that is real progress, friends.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 10, 2016\n\nLessons in mental health\n\nDear Natasha,\n\nYour therapist emailed me asking for a copy of a recent column I wrote about an incident in my childhood in which my mother briefly locked me in the basement and how that affected how I think about the world.\n\nYour therapist kept with the ethics of her profession. She did not tell me your name or anything specific about your case other than you, too, struggled with adverse childhood experiences.\n\nNatasha, as far as I know, is not your real name. I picked the name Natasha because there is a Natasha Romanov bobblehead figure on my desk as I type. Natasha is also known as the superhero Black Widow and is played by Scarlett Johansson in the “Avengers” movies.\n\nAll your therapist said was that you struggled as a child and were working toward ways to change how that affects you.\n\nThis is good. This is great. It is an important first step, maybe the most important one of your journey. I wanted to pass along a few things I have learned in my efforts to regain mental health and physical health.\n\nYou are not alone. It seems that way, especially in the darkness of night when there is no one to talk to and the anxiety and depression creeps in. But there are millions of us out there who live with mood disorders. Yes, we struggle. But through the struggle we learn about ourselves and the better we understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to accept who we are and become the person we want to be.\n\nIt’s going to hurt. There is no pain-free path through the suffering we’ve endured or our current challenges. Remembering the things that we survived, whatever they may be, hurts. Sometimes it hurts worse than the day it happened. But you can get past the pain and on the other side of that is understanding. I wish there was an easier way toward personal enlightenment, but there isn’t. I promise you, though, it’s worth it.\n\nClosure is a lie. The link between adult behavior and childhood experience is well-studied and scientifically proven. Still, the world is not made up of thinkers. People like snap judgments and simple answers. They will tell you to “just get over it already” or that you need to seek something called “closure.” Maybe you will even tell yourself these things. These are fantasies. “Closure” is brought up when people who are tired of talking to you about the things that hurt the most. There is no such thing as closure. The most painful moments in our lives, be it the death of a loved one or a hardship endured, are with us for the rest of our lives. We never “get over” them. We just reach a point of where we understand that pain is a part of our identity.\n\nA reason is not an excuse. As you continue on your wellness journey, you will begin to understand the links between your current behavioral issues and their roots in your past. Still, you must accept responsibility for the mistakes you make now and in the future. You may not have had an easy go of it so far. That’s true for lots of people. Everyone makes mistakes and will for the entirety of their lives. Through therapy, you’re investigating the causes of the thinking errors that lead to patterns of mistakes. But the only way we make progress is by accepting our faults with our strengths and owning the person we are as a whole.\n\nKeep moving forward. You will fail. You will still have bad days. There is no such thing as a perfect person and there’s no sense in shredding your sense of self-worth because you’re not perfect. Remember that no matter how hard life hits you, no matter how often our brain chemistry twists our thoughts into knives that cut us so deeply, we are still standing. Survival is no small feat. Don't take it for granted. There is a difference between surviving and living. And the key to that is accepting that you are deserving of love, dignity and respect. I work on that every day and haven't come to fully accept it. But I, like we all are, am a work in progress.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniel P. Finney, fellow traveler\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 3, 2016\n\nThe gauntlet\n\nCrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho wrote the day’s workout plan on the black dry erase board in yellow marker.\n\nHe said it would be a challenge. I read the list. I thought it was attempted murder.\n\nStill, in nearly eight months working with Nate, I’ve yet to refuse one of his “challenges.” The tasks daunted me.\n\nThe first round consisted of 60 reps of squatting and tossing a 14-pound ball to hit a target on the wall, 50-calorie row and 40 reps of a weightlifting exercise.\n\nA five-minute break followed.\n\nThen came 40 swings of a 35-pound kettlebell, a 30-calorie bike ride and 20 pickups and tosses of a 40-pound ball.\n\nThen came a seven-minute rest.\n\nThe final round was 20 “thrusters,” a chore that involves squatting with weight on a bar across your back and then pushing the weight over your head, 10 jumps onto a platform and five burpies, a kind of torture that can barely be described without profanity.\n\nI was halfway through squatting and tossing the 14-pound ball against the wall when the I first thought I was never going to make it through this insanity.\n\nMy shoulders burned so bad somewhere through the first weightlifting exercise that I was glad to be bald for I would surely never be able to wash my hair again.\n\nI remember the first break. My legs and arms quivered. I could barely lift my water-filled University of Iowa Iowa women’s basketball tumbler, a recent gift from my dear friends Lisa Bluder, Jan Jensen and Jenni Fitzgerald.\n\nI thought for sure I was going to throw up each time I leaned over to pick up the kettlebell for a series of swings. I thought I might actually pass out in the humidity. My forearms were slick with sweat.\n\nMy shirt, one of those newfangled fabrics that’s supposed to wick moisture away from the body, was heavy with sweat. Apparently the designers had not consulted Nate Yoho when they made that wicking promise.\n\nI kind of enjoyed the second round of ball throwing. I picked up the sand-filled ball, hefted it to my shoulder and let it fall to the ground behind me. I repeated the process 20 times.\n\nI like throwing things on the floor. It feels like something you should get in trouble for. Yet in the gym, under the right circumstances, such activity is rewarded.\n\nI can’t remember the seven-minute break. I know I took it. I drank water. I’m sure I hurt everywhere and felt spent. But my psychologist says the brain doesn’t remember pain. It’s a good thing. If it did, I would never get out of bed.\n\nI recall Nate saying near the end of the break that I should walk around a bit to loosen up. The first task of the final round was thrusters. I botched the first three reps before Nate corrected me.\n\nAt this point, I only had so many reps of anything left in me. It was no time to start losing form. I recovered.\n\nThe jumps came easy. Somewhere Stefanie Kirk, my physical therapist at Mercy South Physical Therapy, is squealing. When I first came to see her about 18 months ago, I couldn’t walk 156 feet. Now I was jumping. It was only a few inches onto a soft platform, but still — jumping.\n\nThen came the burpies. No one likes burpies. The fittest person in Nate’s gym will groan at the notion of burpies. A burpie is an exercise in which you touch your thighs and chest to the ground, hop to a standing position and then jump.\n\nExperienced athletes often jump over a weight bar. My goal is to jump enough to get my feet off the floor and clap my hands above my head.\n\nI did 30 burpies to close out a workout session earlier that week. I had “burpie burns” on both knees — red scabs from where the fabric of my shorts rubbed against my knees so much it created bloody sores.\n\nI needed to complete just five burpies to end the session. I felt like a building collapsing each time I hit the floor. But I fell five times and got up five times.\n\nThe workout ended. I survived.\n\nNate showed me the timer on his phone. I had worked out for an hour straight.\n\n“How does that feel?” Nate said as he offered me a fist bump.\n\n“Awful,” I said.\n\nThat was a lie. It felt fantastic. I mean I was spent. If he had asked me to do one more thing, I definitely would have thrown up.\n\nBut consider: I weigh about 450 pounds with arthritic knees. I made it through nine different exercises with a total of 275 repetitions.\n\nIf you’d asked me before I started if I thought I could make it through all that, I would have scoffed.\n\nYet I did.\n\n“I didn’t think I had it in me,” I said to Nate.\n\n“There’s always more left than you think there is,” he said.\n\nTUESDAY, JULY 26, 2016\n\nYesterdays matter today\n\nMorbid obesity is a medical diagnosis, but I also look at it as a symptom of my complex psychological profile.\n\nI’ve written often about the close connections between mental wellness and physical wellness, in particular the relationship of obesity to adverse childhood experiences. But I rarely write about the experiences themselves.\n\nToday, I want to share one story, a milder one, from my childhood as a way of talking about how patterns of behavior formed in my brain that continue to contribute to mental and physical health problems some 26 years after my mother died.\n\nI was a small boy. I’m not sure how old.\n\nWe lived in the baby blue house on Lynner Drive off of what was then known as Harding Road in northwest Des Moines.\n\nMy father was a traveling salesman. He was often away.\n\nMy mother could be loving and caring. But her moods were volatile. She took many medications for a variety of ailments both real and imagined.\n\nSome of the medications include opiate-derivative painkillers that now are illegal because of their highly addictive nature and side effects that include severe short-term memory loss.\n\nI didn’t know any of this at the time. What I knew was that if Mom was sleeping, it was best not to interrupt that because you never knew if you were going to get Loving Mom or Other Mom.\n\nI was so afraid of Other Mom that on more than one night, when she slept through dinnertime — which happens when you are on heavy painkillers — I crawled on my hands and knees to the kitchen and poured myself a bowl of Lucky Charms and crawled back to my room.\n\nI crawled because I didn’t want to risk waking Mom. Loving Mom would have made me toast and been apologetic.\n\nOther Mom would have been apoplectic that I was out in the kitchen dirtying dishes, and she probably would have sworn she made dinner, even if she had not.\n\nOne day, Mom slept in her room. I was looking for two comic books. I wanted to trace the art on notebook paper.\n\nOne was an issue of reprints of the Invaders, a World War II superhero team that included Captain America. The other was an issue of the Avengers, now the basis of blockbuster movies.\n\nI was fairly certain the comics were in the cream-colored bag with yellow handles that had a Joe Cool Snoopy silk-screened on the side. I kept things to do in that bag, activity books, colors and so on.\n\nWhen my parents went places, rarely were there things for children to do. I was expected to be seen and not heard.\n\nThe bag was in the basement. I was not supposed to go to the basement without permission, but I decided to risk it.\n\nI went downstairs and found the bag, but the comics were not in it. Mom appeared behind me.\n\n“WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE BASEMENT?” she asked. It was Other Mom, and I was in big trouble.\n\nI stammered an explanation. She would have none of it. The argument was brief, one-sided and loud.\n\nIt concluded with Mom saying, “WELL IF YOU LIKE IT DOWN HERE SO MUCH, YOU CAN JUST STAY HERE!”\n\nShe flipped off the light, slammed the basement door and latched the hook and chain.\n\nI tried to push the door open, but she slammed it onto my arm and I withdrew. The darkness scared me.\n\nMy feet were bare and there were sometimes creepy little water bugs on the concrete tile floor.\n\nI waited until I thought she was gone. I was a husky boy, even when I was small. I opened the door as far as the chain would allow and leaned in until the chain ripped loose of the door frame.\n\nI hustled up to my room, closed the door and nothing was said of the incident again.\n\nThe next day, Loving Mom took me to the Target down the hill to buy some “Star Wars” toys.\n\nEven typing that story today, I feel a tightness in my chest, a primal kind of fear that is hard to explain.\n\nI’ve written about schema before — behavior patterns set as children as a reaction to environmental stimuli.\n\nThere were three ways I learned as a boy to cope with the potential for Other Mom: eating sugary foods, watching TV and buying toys, comics and books.\n\nAs a child, these were effective survival strategies.\n\nBut they have led to unhealthy behaviors as an adult, some of which I have finally begun to address directly through psychoactive medication and behavioral therapy.\n\nYet whenever I feel stress — whether it be a performance evaluation at work, a cruel comment from a reader or simply an unexpected change in plans — I default to these reactions.\n\nI am a spendthrift. It is a terrible habit that I’ve learned is not uncommon among people who struggle with mood disorders.\n\nHistorians, for example, say Winston Churchill, who lived with depression, was constantly in need of money after he left the prime minister’s office.\n\nI have spent myself into bankruptcy once. I continue to struggle with overspending.\n\nSome people use the cute name “shopaholic” to describe the affliction. But this isn’t enjoying sales at Von Maur.\n\nThis is me trying to buy a sense of security and safety. My apartment looks like a combination toy, book and DVD store. And still I buy more.\n\nI should pause to note I don't blame my late mother for the mistakes I make as an adult. The authorship of those errors rests only with me.\n\nBut there is a difference between a reason and an excuse. This is an examination of the root cause.\n\nIt's the simplest and most human of all: I am insecure.\n\nMost of us are insecure to a degree. Mine is both chronic and acute.\n\nIt is strange that I chose a trade in which I would put so much of myself up for public scrutiny, but that is a column for another day.\n\nSometimes it’s hard for people to understand that things that happen to us as children affect how we feel about ourselves and act as adults.\n\nIt was a long time ago, the thinking goes. Let it go.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s not the way the brain works. It takes time to build new schema and the struggle goes on.\n\nThe good news is Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who took me in after my parents died, are thrifty. They saved 4 cents of every nickel they ever earned.\n\nThey counsel me on debt management and spending. I know I frustrate them because of my struggles turning off the spending spigot. But we make progress.\n\nIt really is the same principle as working out at the gym or losing weight. One starts and moves forward.\n\nThere will be setbacks, weight gains, missed reps on the dumbbells and money spent that should have been saved.\n\nThe best I or anyone can do is get up tomorrow and try again.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JULY 20, 2016\n\nA fitting tale\n\nMy friend Yvonne sent me a gift card to a big-and-tall men’s store for my recent birthday. She suggested I get myself something to celebrate my smaller frame after losing nearly 110 pounds since last March.\n\nI drove to West Des Moines with some trepidation. Yes, I’ve lost weight and it is both visible to myself and others but also measurable in gains in physical activity and health.\n\nBut lost weight does not always translate into a trimmer frame. The body loses weight asymmetrically. Some parts shrink quickly, others seem to desperately hang onto the fat.\n\nThen there is the problem I have described before of hanging skin. I was more than 560 pounds when I began this recovery. That extra weight stretched some of the skin in my body beyond its natural elasticity.\n\nAs I have lost weight, the skin has not shrunk to fit, so to speak. So I have great folds of flesh in my midsection that were once fully filled with fat now dangling at my beltline and below like the deflated envelope of a hot air balloon.\n\nShopping for clothes was never my favorite exercise, fat or otherwise. I have an odd predilection to either loud, brightly colored Hawaiian-style shirts or navy blue golf shirts and khaki slacks.\n\nVariety may be the spice of life, but the wrong shirt will hang in my closet for years unworn – much to the frustration of Mom 2.0, who for years try to style me up only to see me favor navy blue and khaki.\n\nThis much I will say about shopping for larger sizes for the good: 20 years ago, shopping for what was called “husky” clothes was an adventure in awful fashion.\n\nIt was as if manufacturers scoured the notebooks of the D- students at fashion design schools and told their factories to make that peach and cream stripped shirt, only really big with a pocket on the left breast and an elastic waistband at the bottom.\n\nToday, I can find clothes emblazoned with logos of my favorite sports teams, comic book characters and other pop culture ephemera. Still, I trend toward the navy blue golf shirts and khaki. There are very few places where such attire isn’t considered acceptable.\n\nDespite the expanded selection, there is always a lot of emotion tied up in trying on clothes. I’ve worked hard not to make this journey about a single number – my weight.\n\nBut almost as haunting as my weight is the size of my pants. The number on the scale can be kind of abstract after a bit, but few things terrorize the psyche as much as trying to button and zip up a pair of jeans that once fit loosely.\n\nStill, I was realistic as I selected several sizes of my current brand of khakis from the rack. All the exercise at the gym, the swimming and the diet would still count even if my pant size had not changed.\n\nI tried on a pair two sizes smaller than my current pants. I knew this wouldn’t work. This was sort of a Hail Mary. My current pants are very loose, but comfortably so. I like my pants a bit on the baggy side.\n\nI was right. Two sizes down was too far to go. I couldn’t button them. I shed them and tried the next size up.\n\nThis was the real test. Where was I at? Had my circumference at the waste shrank along with the number on the scale.\n\nI slid them on. Not a bad fit, I thought. I buttoned and zipped them with ease. These are all good signs. But there is a final test that all pants must endure before I will pay money for them: How do they sit?\n\nWhen I sit, that’s when those folds of flesh at the waist bunch up into what some inelegantly describe as a “front butt.” I took a deep breath and sat. And … fail.\n\nThe otherwise nicely fitting pants pulled taut over my belly. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I would be uncomfortable and self-conscious, especially with the pockets filled with my keys, wallet, smartphone, pens, notebooks and sundry other items.\n\nIn the past, this sort of thing would have sent me on a spiral, feeling as if all the work had been for naught.\n\nInstead, and pleasantly so, I felt only vaguely disappointed. I know I am healthier. I also the journey is still in its early phases. My current khakis are made of sturdy material. I’ll wear them a little loose for a while longer.\n\nI spent the gift card on a T-shirt with superheroes on it and a polo shirt made of that material that wicks sweat away from the body. I even broke form with the color. It’s a pleasant dark gray.\n\nMONDAY, JULY 11, 2016\n\nDon't cheat, just eat\n\nA while back a reader stopped me in Tasty Tacos. He was a follower of Making Weight and wondered if my three taco meal was a “cheat day.”\n\nThe fellow was good-natured and lacked malice. It was, I thought, an honest question.\n\nI told the man I don’t believe in cheat days. I’m allotted a specific number of calories per day – 2,500. When I reach that number, I stop eating.\n\nThis isn’t to imply I have a perfect record on that. I go over a smidgen here and there and sometimes more than a smidgen.\n\nEstimating calories can be tricky even with the help of a quality smartphone app such as MyFitnessPal, my preferred calorie counter.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to use most of those calories up on food that is high in nutrients and low in certain fats, sugars, simple carbohydrates and chemicals.\n\nSo I could eat 2,500 calories worth of Twinkies, but I’m not going to get much nutrition out of that. And it won’t do my type 2 diabetes much good, either.\n\nThat said, I don’t go in for the “cheat day” concept. We can all make better choices about what we put into our bodies, but none of us are perfect.\n\nI would fare poorly on a diet of mostly greens, a few fruits and some meat. So, yes, sometimes an English muffin or even deep dish pizza finds its way onto my plate.\n\nI mitigate these calories by planning. For example, a buddy took me out for my birthday a few weeks ago. I wanted to go the Wig & Pen in Ankeny and indulge in their glorious deep dish pizza.\n\nWe split a large. That was four slices for me. I looked it up in advance. Those four slices amounted to 1,400 calories. We ate side salads with the meal.\n\nI still had room within my calorie goal for a glass of milk and a protein bar before bed.\n\nObviously I wouldn’t want to eat deep dish pizza every day. That would be counterproductive. But once in a while is fine, especially if I’m keeping up with my exercise schedule and making regular trips to the swimming pool.\n\nThe idea of cheat days bugs me for a couple of reasons. First, I think it encourages binging, which is a behavior that one simply must avoid to lose weight and get fit.\n\nSecondly, the “cheat” part of the concept implies you should feel guilty about the food you enjoy. That kind of thinking leads to shame and hopelessness that can lead to a shattered diet plan.\n\nI’m all stocked up on guilt and shame for this lifetime. So I’m not going to feel guilty about what I eat. What I am going to do is try to make the best choices possible within prescribed limits.\n\nFor example, Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died, host an annual July 4 bash.\n\nThe buffet table is laid out with scores of delicious goodies. Hardly any of them are on those preferred food lists.\n\nSo this year, I went with a game plan. I decided in advance which foods I really wanted and which foods I could pass on.\n\nI measured out my pork and beans, grilled turkey and pulled pork, coleslaw and pickles wrapped in chipped beef and cream cheese.\n\nI left the chips and the dip behind along with the scalloped corn and cheesy potatoes.\n\nThe toughest passes were Mom 2.0’s delicious spritz and sugar cookies.\n\nOh, I could have had one, but I saved my sweet for the once-a-year treat of homemade pineapple sherbet.\n\nI ate a small meal at the end of the day of some leftover grilled turkey and a yellow tomato. I made sure I went for a swim.\n\nIt turned out I was about 150 calories under my goal for the day. My carbs were with in prescribed levels, though my fats were higher than I would want to see on most days. I blame the cream cheese.\n\nStill, I had a lovely meal with company of good friends and family. I was able to enjoy the holiday.\n\nI believe not considering it a “cheat day” prevented me from overeating and making myself miserable both physically, by overstuffing my stomach, and mentally, by feeling guilty for how much I ate.\n\nSo if you want my advice, don’t cheat, just eat within prescribed limits.\n\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 30, 2016\n\nNumbers game\n\nI haven’t written about my weight in a while, which seems odd given these paragraphs are about my ongoing efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nWhen I started this journey, that was the only number that mattered to me.\n\nHow I felt about myself and the entire journey rested on the number that flashed on the scale.\n\nIf I lost weight, I was good. If I gained, I was bad. My mood swung violently with each pound. Anxiety rattled me in advance of weigh-ins.\n\nBut I’ve been at this a while now. I’ve come to the realization my recovery and health is not measured by the scale.\n\nThis isn’t to say I’ve gained a bunch of weight. I don’t know. I haven’t been to Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center, where I weigh in, since May.\n\nI’m not avoiding it. I’m just not that interested in the results.\n\nNo, I’m not giving up on the journey. I’m just measuring progress differently.\n\nInstead of body weight or even body composition, I’m looking at the things I can see with my own eyes.\n\nMy pants are baggy to the point of being clownish. Clothes in my closet that haven’t fit for years are comfortable again.\n\nI can even see the changes to my body. Oh, I’m still plenty lumpy. Yet skin sags where it was once filled with fat.\n\nI can feel muscles in my arms, legs, shoulders and chest.\n\nAnd there are plenty of other numbers.\n\nI can carry 35-pound kettle bells for 400 meters. A year ago, I whined when Stefanie Kirk, my physical therapist, handed me 2-pound weights.\n\nI can press 120 pounds over my shoulders.\n\nA back that once couldn’t carry in groceries without injury can now withstand deadlifts of 230 pounds for four repetitions in six sets.\n\nI can row on a machine for 500 meters in less than two minutes.\n\nI can squat to my heels without losing my balance and I can do that with 125 pounds on my back.\n\nNate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay and my fitness coach, posts my progress on a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and my doctor, Shauna Basener, can see.\n\nI can see the differences in my body, from the thickness of my belly to my balance in the videos and pictures he posts.\n\nWhen I took to the pool this spring, I started doing the exercises Stefanie gave me last year. But they were too easy.\n\nSo I just decided to swim. I swim uninterrupted for 40 minutes. I get faster and stronger each week.\n\nMy muscle mass is increasing. I know this not because of a readout on a computer, but because it is easier for me to sink to the bottom of the pool.\n\nLast year, I couldn’t dive down to touch the bottom of the pool the entire season.\n\nThis year, I do it on every dive. I try to do a handstand on the pool.\n\nI’m getting ever closer to being able to do pushups off the floor.\n\nThe other day at the gym, I fell down. I lost my balance while trying to do front squats, an exercise where I hold a weight bar at my neck and bend into a catcher’s squat.\n\nI’ve seen it happen to the other athletes at Nate’s gym. They front squat a lot more weight than me. But everybody falls down.\n\nHere’s the difference for me: I got back up again and finished the rep.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, a fall might have sidelined me for the day.\n\nI used to get calf injuries with big knots on the muscle. Nate would roll them out with a special tool.\n\nI haven’t had that problem in a long time.\n\nI feel better. I am stronger.\n\nAm I done? Heavens no.\n\nThere is so much more to do.\n\nBut I am getting better about not letting the journey be about one number.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 20, 2016\n\nJust one of the guys\n\nI looked at the red numbers on the dusty, old clock radio by my bedside. Monday morning had arrived. The workweek loomed.\n\nMy brain stalled. The chemicals that cause anxiety churned somewhere in the folded pink-gray mass inside my skull and a froth of panic bubbled.\n\nI tried to process the intense fight-or-flight response with intellect. I knew this was a chemical malfunction. There was no real reason to be this horrified by the new day.\n\nAll I needed was to swallow one of the greenish yellow pills. Fifteen minutes would pass. My heart rate would drop. I would be fine.\n\nBut I resisted. In retrospect, of course, I feel the fool. A close friend struggles with anxiety, too. She also takes prescription medication to control it.\n\nWhen the first pangs of an anxiety attack echo in her mind, I tell her to take a pill. Sometimes, she pauses. I remind her the medicine cannot work if you just think about taking it.\n\nOh, were I only so good at taking the advice I so smugly give.\n\nTime passed. I checked emails. I looked at the spate of paragraphs that needed stacking for the week. Yet the tightness in my chest remained. Anxiety gripped my heart in a clenched fist.\n\nAll I wanted in this world was to get back into bed and pull the sheets over my head. Today was too much. We’ll try again tomorrow.\n\nWhy didn’t I take the pill? I can’t explain that. Sometimes I believe I can out-think my anxiety. If I know what causes it, I can deactivate it.\n\nThis is a little bit like thinking you can disarm a bomb that’s already gone off.\n\nStill, I stubbornly hunkered down and tried to grit it out. As I said, it was foolhardy.\n\nI made breakfast, a piece of steak with some grilled tomatoes. Protein fills me up and gives me the energy I need for workouts with coach Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nI watched the clock. The time to go to the gym approached. My thinking cycled. My brain almost screamed at me: “Don’t go. Just stay home. You can’t handle this today.”\n\nThis line of thinking mixed with the usual self-deprecating thoughts that I’m a bad person, that I’m not smart enough for this job and soon the bosses will figure this out and fire me, and that I am simply unworthy of love.\n\nStill, I did not take the pill. I always think the anxiety will pass through my mind like a scattered thunderstorm. It never passes. It’s always a severe thunderstorm and sometimes it’s an EF5 tornado.\n\nI thought of Nate and the guys at the gym. I like them. I like being there the same way I liked being on sports teams as a boy. I’m there to lose weight and get fit, sure. But I have no illusions about being a competitive athlete.\n\n(Nate would argue with me on that point, but the difference of opinion really doesn’t matter. He’s helping me help myself get healthier. That’s the goal.)\n\nThe clock read 1 p.m. I was dressed for the gym. I was ready to go. But I did not want to go. The flesh was willing, but the spirit was weak.\n\nI cannot say with precision what made me decide to go instead of stay. I worry about disappointing Nate. I worry about backsliding on my physical progress. I worry about letting worry control me.\n\nMaybe I went to the gym simply because of reflex action.\n\nAgain, it doesn’t really matter. I went. There is a small victory in that.\n\nI loosened up, but anxiety still swirled in my mind. Nate laid out the goals for the day. We did some squats without weight to loosen my quads.\n\nHe told me what the workout plan was. I was breathing hard. My heart hammered. It wasn’t the workout. It was the anxiety.\n\nNate told me to take a couple minutes before we went through the combination of metabolic conditioning and strength training.\n\nI went over and sat on a box in a dark corner of the gym. My hands shook.\n\nNate spotted me. He asked if I was dizzy or just getting mentally prepared for the workout. I confessed it was a bad day for anxiety.\n\nHe asked if the workouts helped. They do. Anticipation is the worst part of anything: workouts, getting together with my girlfriend, friends or family, or practically going anywhere or doing anything.\n\nMy workout started at the same time as another client doing something far more intense. I was working out for 16 minutes. The set was three burpees — an exercise that sounds like something cute you do with babies but is far less pleasant — with two weightlifting challenges and a walk.\n\nI made it through the first round and was about halfway into the second when I realized I couldn’t control my heart rate anymore.\n\nYes, the workout was getting my heart rate up. The problem was, it was already pounding from the anxiety. I stopped. I finally took the damn pill.\n\nI went back to the workout. I did the best I could. It wasn’t a wonderful performance. But I made almost four complete cycles in the allotted time.\n\nI was disappointed. Nate thought I was upset with the workout. I wasn’t. I was angry at myself for not taking the pill hours before instead of bullheadedly enduring this anxiety.\n\nI finished with a cool-down exercise on the rowing machine. By then, the medicine mixed with the endorphins released from the workout.\n\nCalm settled in, even a bit of whimsy. Nate and a couple of his other trainers had a break before their next client.\n\nWe went out in the parking lot and played catch beside the building. We talked about absolutely nothing important. It was wonderful.\n\nAnd there I was, just one of the guys.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 13, 2016\n\nHard rider\n\nCoach Nate Yoho divides my workouts at CrossFit Merle Hay into two segments.\n\nWe begin with a weightlifting exercise. Then we transition into met-con, or metabolic condition. This phase of the workout includes three or four activities, at least one of which is a cardio challenge mixed with more weightlifting reps.\n\nNate recently added five exercise bikes to his equipment inventory. I hate exercise bikes. They are uncomfortable for my big butt and often don’t adjust properly for someone my height.\n\nBut Nate’s new machines adjusted fine. I would rather work on the rowing machine, but Nate wanted a trio ", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/volusia/2021/01/11/the-gem-next-door-features-daytona-beach-duo-educating-community-healthy-living-and-vegan-cuisine/3817167001/", "title": "Owners of Kale Cafe Juice Bar & Vegan Cuisine educates ...", "text": "DAYTONA BEACH — Camille Holder-Brown and Omar Brown, restaurant owners tackling the taboo associated with vegan cuisine, built their restaurant, Kale Cafe Juice Bar & Vegan Cuisine, on the premise of serving and educating the community.\n\n“Our goal is to get the community healthy by helping to change their eating habits and food consumption,” said Omar Brown, 48.\n\nKale Cafe Juice Bar & Vegan Cuisine is located in Daytona Beach at 116 N. Beach St.\n\nCamille Holder-Brown said there's so much that people don't know when considering the vegan route.\n\n“We offer a healthy option for our community,” said Holder-Brown, 41. “We let people know they don’t have to sacrifice flavor. People are always so surprised that our food tastes good. They think it’s going to taste like grass clippings.”\n\nBefore branching out into the restaurant industry, Holder-Brown spent nine years as a filmmaker while Brown worked as a computer network engineer for 15 years.\n\nThe couple moved to Daytona Beach from New York in 2011. They have six children together.\n\nAnswering a call\n\n“We started it in November of 2013 actually under a different name,” said Holder-Brown. “And then in April of 2014 we switched the name to Kale Cafe. We started as a nonprofit initially called Midtown Eco Village.”\n\nHolder-Brown said the nonprofit was geared toward educating people about healthy eating.\n\n“When we moved from New York, we noticed that there were a lot of people who didn't know what tofu was,” she said. “There was nothing healthy to eat. So we started volunteering a lot. We started the mayor's backpack giveaway, giving out free smoothies. After that, the community embraced it and we just kept growing from there.”\n\nHolder-Brown said some of the popular menu items include the veggie burgers made in-house, made-to-order smoothies and juices. They also have a soy-free mac and cheese that’s made out of coconut milk and potatoes. But the most popular is the kale salad.\n\nAround the U.S.:These Black-owned vegan soul food restaurants are the best in the country, according to PETA\n\nA healthier option with a twist\n\n“The style of cuisine is a mix of Caribbean and soul food,” said Holder-Brown.\n\nOmar Brown said the cafe’s target customers are people who are familiar with the vegan lifestyle and those who are looking to switch it up for whatever reason.\n\n“I would say someone who's looking to change their lifestyle,” he said. “We market to those people who already live that type of lifestyle. It's just the continuation. And of course you have people who are forced to change their diet. They have no other alternative but to change their lifestyle around, if they want to live.”\n\nThe couple said they’re always looking for opportunities to take things to the next level.\n\n“We just started offering meal prep services,” said Holder-Brown. “One of our customers can’t have any carbs or sugar. So we make very specific meals for that client.”\n\nHolder-Brown said customers have the opportunity to select items off the menu.\n\n“For people that want to try new things, we offer free samples so people can taste it and experience it,” she said. “This is what we did when we started at the farmers market. It’s really important for us to continue that education component. People can always ask us questions about the menu.”\n\nMore:Queen's Brian May says a vegan diet is 'the way forward' in response to coronavirus pandemic\n\nHolder-Brown said the meal prep option is great for customers who don't want to worry about cooking.\n\n“We have a meal plan called the Athlete and they get a meal each day,” she said. “They get between 12 juices and smoothies or nut milk. They get three large salads and three desserts. Customers only have to come in every other day.”\n\nHolder-Brown said the meal prep option is available on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Customers can pick up their food for two days at a time.\n\n“They [customers] just keep bringing back their Tupperware and we just kind of rotate it out,” said Holder-Brown. “So there's things like that might have different levels of that program where you don't have to worry about. It's a Chef's Choice so the menu is all 100% vegan.”\n\nMeals made easy\n\nHolder-Brown said they work with people who have specific dietary needs.\n\n“Some people can't have gluten so we make them gluten-free meals,” she said. “We have quinoa and lentils, which is an option. We have a hot bar in addition to our sandwiches that are made to order. So you can come in and grab a plate — called the vegan value meal — and be on your way. If someone has any dietary restrictions, we make it tailored towards their diet.”\n\nThe couple believes is their level of service and ability to customize that separates them from other eateries.\n\nQuality is key\n\n“We're really about quality,” said Holder-Brown. “We don't cut corners. We make everything from scratch. It's what our family eats and I'm really proud of that. We don't serve processed food. We make everything from scratch and that is something that is really important to me.”\n\nHolder-Brown said she and Brown started out doing the cooking, but eventually brought a staff on board to help out. They consider their staff family.\n\n“We have an amazing staff of people that we've trained and they do the cooking,” said Holder-Brown.\n\nGrowing the business\n\nOmar Brown said the pandemic has had both a positive and negative impact on their business.\n\n“I would say positive in that we're able to find out where we have leaks in our business,” said Brown.\n\nHolder-Brown said the pandemic has allowed them to focus on things they’ve put off. The couple is focused on growing their business and figuring out new ways to serve their customers since they can’t come out as often.\n\n“We were able to move forward with bottling our salad dressing,” said Holder-Brown. “It [the pandemic] also allowed us to figure out new ways to serve our customers. I think that has been super helpful in terms of just giving us clarity.”\n\nThe couple partnered with Stage Coach Sauces in Daytona Beach to bottle Judah's salad dressing and marinade in November. The dressing is named after the youngest member of their family.\n\nMore:Plant-based, whole food plant-based, and veganism: here's the difference\n\nServing the community\n\nThere have been some negative aspects in being restaurant owners during a pandemic.\n\n“But negatively, it's cut into our revenue,” said Holder-Brown. “But I would say overall I think it’s more positive than negative. We’re still able to serve our community. We volunteered a lot. We partnered with the Derbyshire Place. For five months, every other week we served between 300 and 500 people free vegan meals. I didn't know how to serve that many people at one time. But it was something we learned how to do.”\n\nHolder-Brown said the important thing is to be of service to the community.\n\n“So any opportunities we get to do that, we do it,” said Holder-Brown. “We were vending at the art show [Nov. 15]. We’ve been vendors at Bike Week, you name it we’ve been there. People from all walks of life are always amazed that our food tastes as good as it tastes. They always underestimate vegan food in general.”\n\nHolder-Brown said the cafe has a Sunday brunch special that allows customers to pay what they can afford.\n\n“We typically have a pay-what-you-can-afford, all-you-can-eat Sunday brunch,” said Holder-Brown. “We’ve only had one since COVID started. We want people to understand that eating healthy is not an elite thing. It's not something that is for wealthy people.”\n\nThankful\n\nHolder-Brown said they’re grateful for the support they’ve received from the community.\n\n“Without our community we wouldn't have weathered all the storms we’ve encountered and stayed in business as long as we have,” she said. “We were definitely underdogs. We started off doing Kickstarter to get the money to start our business. A local teacher gave us money to help us start our business. And we're a Black-owned business. I don't know how many Black-businesses have been on Beach Street. But I'm just super grateful that we're here.”\n\nKale Cafe Juice Bar & Vegan Cuisine\n\n116 N.

Roosevelt.\n\nIt was Lincoln who issued an 1863 proclamation calling on Americans to \"set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving,\" partly to celebrate victories in the then-raging Civil War.\n\n\"He's the father of the whole idea of a nation giving thanks for its advantages and privileges of living in a democracy like this,\" said Harold Holzer, historian and chairman of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation.\n\nDecades later, Roosevelt and Congress acted to establish Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November, in part to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.\n\nInformally, the United States government had recognized periodic days of thanksgiving from the moment of the nation's birth.\n\nIn 1777, a year after the Declaration of Independence, the Continental Congress declared a day of thanksgiving to celebrate a Revolutionary War victory over the British at Saratoga.\n\nThe first president, George Washington, declared a day of thanksgiving and prayer in 1789, partly to honor the new U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt took the trauma of the Civil War to make Thanksgiving a formal, annual holiday.\n\nLincoln issued his proclamation on Oct. 3, 1863, three months after Union Army victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, and at a time in which ultimate triumph appeared in sight. \"There was a lot to be thankful for in the fall of 1863,\" said Allen Guelzo, the Henry R. Luce Professor of the Civil War Era at Gettysburg College.\n\nWriting that the nation's many blessings \"should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged\" by the American people, Lincoln declared: \"I do therefore invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens.\"\n\n(It should be noted that while Lincoln issued this proclamation, most historians believe it was actually written by his secretary of State, William Seward.)\n\nThe proclamation served a familiar purpose for Lincoln. \"He was always looking for ways to unify the nation in a terrible time of war,\" biographer Ronald C. White Jr. said.\n\nStill, the idea of a formal Thanksgiving holiday had been gestating for a long time before Lincoln.\n\nSarah Josepha Hale, editor of the popular magazine Godey's Lady's Book, pushed the idea for years, petitioning Lincoln and his predecessors. (Thanksgiving was only one of Hale's contributions to American culture; she also wrote the poem Mary Had a Little Lamb.)\n\nAfter Lincoln, presidents issued annual Thanksgiving proclamations. In last year's proclamation, President Obama said Thanksgiving Day is \"a time to take stock of the fortune we have known and the kindnesses we have shared, grateful for the God-given bounty that enriches our lives.\"\n\nFor decades after Lincoln, Americans traditionally celebrated Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of November, even if it fell on Nov. 30 -- as happened in 1939, the end of an economically troubled decade.\n\nSome merchants worried that a late Thanksgiving would cut down on Christmas sales and asked President Roosevelt to move the holiday up by a week – which he did, creating unanticipated havoc.\n\nSome state governors objected, issuing proclamations of their own to keep Thanksgiving on Nov. 30. Other states recognized the Nov. 23 date. This created scheduling issues for holiday traditions ranging from family reunions to football games.\n\n\"It was just chaos for a couple of years,\" said Bob Clark, supervisory archivist with the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library & Museum.\n\nCongress eventually stepped in. On Dec. 26, 1941, less than a month after the attack at Pearl Harbor plunged the United States into World War II, Congress passed a law declaring the fourth Thursday of November as Thanksgiving Day, where it remains to this day.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/16/who-owns-title-first-thanksgiving/75880500/", "title": "Who owns the title of first Thanksgiving?", "text": "Gordon Freireich\n\nWith Thanksgiving this Thursday, it may be appropriate to consider who owns the title “The First Thanksgiving”?\n\nThe answer may not be as simple as you think. There are several contenders.\n\nIn school we learned the Pilgrims and the Native Americans gathered for a feast of thanksgiving in the autumn of 1621 at Plymouth, Mass.\n\nThis month’s Colonial Williamsburg magazine puts another spin on history. The early Virginia colonists were just as thankful as their New England counterparts for their survival in the New World, but offered their thanks in 1619.\n\nIn 1962, the magazine article says, when President Kennedy issued his Thanksgiving Proclamation, he mentioned only the Massachusetts (his home state) event. That propelled a Virginia senator into action who claimed his state held the first Thanksgiving. In November of 1963 (just a few days before his assassination), Kennedy’s Thanksgiving Proclamation cited both the North and South for their prayer sessions and celebrations.\n\nNot to be outdone, Florida claims it had the first Thanksgiving when the Spanish settlers at St. Augustine held a gathering with the Native Americans there in 1565.\n\nHold on, partner, Texas says: Spanish explorers held a service of Thanksgiving in what is now Texas in 1541.\n\nYork has always claimed a part of Thanksgiving because the Continental Congress, meeting here in 1777 and 1778, issued the First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving.\n\nHistory says Samuel Adams wrote the first draft. The wordy version – very religious in tone – that was adopted says:\n\n\"For as much as it is the indispensable Duty of all Men to adore the superintending Providence of Almighty God; to acknowledge with Gratitude their Obligation to him for Benefits received, and to implore such farther Blessings as they stand in Need of: And it having pleased him in his abundant Mercy, not only to continue to us the innumerable Bounties of his common Providence; but also to smile upon us in the Prosecution of a just and necessary War, for the Defense and Establishment of our unalienable Rights and Liberties; particularly in that he hath been pleased, in so great a Measure, to prosper the Means used for the Support of our Troops, and to crown our Arms with most signal success: It is therefore recommended to the legislative or executive Powers of these United States to set apart Thursday, the eighteenth Day of December next, for Solemn Thanksgiving and Praise: That at one Time and with one Voice, the good People may express the grateful Feelings of their Hearts, and consecrate themselves to the Service of their Divine Benefactor; and that, together with their sincere Acknowledgments and Offerings, they may join the penitent Confession of their manifold Sins, whereby they had forfeited every Favor; and their humble and earnest Supplication that it may please God through the Merits of Jesus Christ, mercifully to forgive and blot them out of Remembrance; That it may please him graciously to afford his Blessing on the Governments of these States respectively, and prosper the public Council of the whole: To inspire our Commanders, both by Land and Sea, and all under them, with that Wisdom and Fortitude which may render them fit Instruments, under the Providence of Almighty God, to secure for these United States, the greatest of all human Blessings, Independence and Peace: That it may please him, to prosper the Trade and Manufactures of the People, and the Labor of the Husbandman, that our Land may yield its Increase: To take Schools and Seminaries of Education, so necessary for cultivating the Principles of true Liberty, Virtue and Piety, under his nurturing Hand; and to prosper the Means of Religion, for the promotion and enlargement of that Kingdom, which consisteth in Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost. And it is further recommended, That servile Labor, and such Recreation, as, though at other Times innocent, may be unbecoming the Purpose of this Appointment, be omitted on so solemn an Occasion.\"\n\nThere’s a historical marker in the first block of East Market Street commemorating that proclamation.\n\nLeave it to George Washington to be pithier than the Continental Congress. He issued a General Order declaring Dec. 18 as a “Day of Solemn Thanksgiving and Praise” in recognition of the American forces’ victory over the British at Saratoga.\n\nPresidents, beginning with Washington after his election, made a point of issuing Thanksgiving Proclamations for various months and days.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, acting on the petition of magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, set aside the final Thursday in November in 1863 – in the midst of the Civil War – for a Day of Thanksgiving.\n\nIn 1939, Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to move the holiday up a week to allow retailers to have more sales time between Thanksgiving and Christmas (perhaps the prelude to the highly touted and motivational sales event that is today known as “Black Friday.”) That action was met by strong opposition, and in 1941 Congress finally set the holiday as the fourth Thursday in November, where it has been ever since.\n\nAs we gather this coming Thursday, let’s remember to keep the thanks in Thanksgiving for the freedoms we have and the history we enjoy.\n\nThe York proclamation\n\n\"That at one Time and with one Voice, the good People may express the grateful Feelings of their Hearts, and consecrate themselves to the Service of their Divine Benefactor\" – From the Thanksgiving Proclamation issued by the Continental Congress meeting in York in 1777.\n\n\n\nA sign of neglect?\n\nThe marker in the pocket park in the first block of East Market Street (between the M&T Bank and the city parking garage) affirming York’s role in the First Thanksgiving is in poor condition.\n\nInstalled by – as the bottom lines state – “various historical and patriot societies and the National Thanksgiving Foundation,” it has weathered and is not easy to read.\n\nPerhaps the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission should replace it with an official historic marker to match the others around town.\n\nGordon Freireich is a former editor of the York Sunday News.

It was even celebrated on two different dates in the same year before it finally settled on the fourth Thursday of November we now celebrate.\n\nHere's what to know about why our holiday meant to give thanks is always celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nNo more food fights:How to talk politics – or not – with relatives on Thanksgiving\n\nWhen was the first Thanksgiving?\n\nWe don't know the date of the first-ever Thanksgiving where the colonists shared a meal with the indigenous Wampanoag people, but the History Chanel reports it is said to have taken place in 1621.\n\nFor a time, Thanksgiving was celebrated on Nov. 25 beginning in 1668, but that lasted only five years, according to the Farmer's Almanac.\n\nWhy is Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November?\n\nPresident George Washington declared Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789 as a \"Day of Publick Thanksgivin,\" after he was asked by the first Federal Congress, according to the National Archives. It was the first time Thanksgiving was celebrated under the country's new Constitution.\n\nPresidents after Washington would also issue a proclamation for Thanksgiving, but the months and days Thanksgiving was celebrated varied. With President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 proclamation, Thanksgiving became regularly celebrated on the last Thursday in November.\n\nAccording to the National Archives, the last Thursday in November fell on the last day of the month in 1939, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved that year's Thanksgiving to the second-to-last Thursday of November to allow for a longer Christmas shopping season. But not all states followed suit: 32 issued similar proclamations, which 16 kept Thanksgiving as the last Thursday in November.\n\nBy 1941, the House of Representatives passed a joint resolution, declaring Thanksgiving Day to be the last Thursday in November each year. The Senate amended the resolution making the holiday the fourth Thursday in November, and Roosevelt signed it in December 1941.\n\nToday, Thanksgiving is recognized by the federal government to fall on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nWant to save money for Thanksgiving?Here are some ideas for a cheaper holiday dinner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/09/when-what-is-columbus-day-indigenous-peoples-day/8185066001/", "title": "Is Columbus Day offensive?

That presidential stamp of approval was the most significant boost to date of efforts refocusing a federal holiday that for decades celebrated Christopher Columbus' discovery of America.\n\nAlthough few Americans are arguing with the notion of being off work come Monday, Columbus Day and Indigenous People's Day have prompted political debate in states, cities and municipalities around the U.S., especially in the past decade, with some pushing against change and others favoring Indigenous Peoples Day instead.\n\nHistory of Halloween: How well do you know the holiday?\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nWhat is Indigenous Peoples Day?\n\nThe celebrating of an Indigenous Peoples Day took root in 1977 at an international conference on discrimination sponsored by the United Nations. It's grown as a day to honor Native American peoples and commemorates their histories and cultures. South Dakota was the first state to recognize the day in 1989, and the California cities of Berkeley and Santa Cruz followed.\n\nIn 1990, the International Conference on Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations in the Americas, sponsored by the United Nations, began to discuss replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day. California and Tennessee observe Native American Day in September, not conflicting with Columbus Day.\n\nScott Stevens, the director of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Program at Syracuse University, said Indigenous Peoples Day is about resilience of what past cultures have endured as much as it is about honoring heritage.\n\n\"It is the recognition of our survival and, in many cases, resistance and even flourishing,\" Stevens told USA TODAY. \"There still are a lot of social and economic problems that Indigenous communities experience. There's also this idea that American Indians and Native Americans, that we're all one people. But we have diversity and our cultures are vastly different. One thing we all have in common is that our ancestors suffered because of American colonialism, so it serves as an opportunity where we can turn to each other in unity.\"\n\nHow and where is Indigenous Peoples Day celebrated?\n\nWhat states and cities celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day?\n\nOver a dozen states and more than 130 local governments have chosen to not celebrate Columbus Day altogether or replace it with Indigenous Peoples Day. Many states celebrate both. Eleven U.S. states celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day or a holiday of a similar name via proclamation, while 10 others treat it as an official holiday. The 10 states that observe the holiday via proclamation are Arizona, California, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin, plus Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd the 10 that officially celebrate it are Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota and Vermont.\n\nSome tribal groups in Oklahoma celebrate Native American Day in lieu of Columbus Day, with some groups naming the day in honor of their individual tribes.\n\nMore than 100 cities have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, including Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Phoenix and San Francisco.\n\nStevens said that Indigenous Peoples Day being federally recognized paves way for more allies and a space for Americans to educate themselves on a deeper level, as adults, about atrocities throughout U.S. history.\n\n\"Having a federal holiday can serve as less of a celebration but more so a recognition to past and present experiences,\" Stevens said. \"I see (Indigenous Peoples Day) as an opportunity to have more critical discussion about our American history, more than what people learn in the fourth grade about the first Thanksgiving and Pocahontas.\n\n\"Having a day recognized or having critical discussion is not anti-American. What's anti-American is self-censoring what we've been through,\" he said.\n\nWhat's open, closed on Indigenous Peoples' and Columbus Day?:What to know about mail delivery, bank hours\n\nIs it offensive to celebrate Columbus Day?\n\nLast year when Biden issued the proclamation for Indigenous Peoples Day, he also issued a proclamation of Columbus Day, established by Congress and first recognized as a national holiday in 1934 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nIn his 2021 speech, Biden praised the role of Italian Americans in U.S. society, but also referenced the violence and harm Columbus and other explorers of the age brought about on the Americas.\n\n\"We also acknowledge the painful history of wrongs and atrocities that many European explorers inflicted on tribal nations and Indigenous communities,” Biden said. “It is a measure of our greatness as a nation that we do not seek to bury these shameful episodes of our past – that we face them honestly, we bring them to the light, and we do all we can to address them.”\n\nThough some groups argue that Columbus Day, which is still a federal holiday, celebrates Italian American heritage, many say the holiday glorifies an exploration that led to the genocide of native peoples and paved the way for slavery.\n\nStevens said celebrating Columbus Day is outdated because of the cyclical and residual hurt caused from the past: \"To have had American colonialism looked at throughout history as not being a problem and celebrated as a good thing is deeply problematic to any of us who live in a (Native-American) community or reservation.\"\n\nStevens argued some Americans have a tendency to ignore that Native Americans were \"forced to be assimilated into Euro-American culture,\" and hold a misconception that Indigenous communities are only \"set in the past.\"\n\n\"We're a minority of three percent in a land that in 1491 was one hundred percent ours,\" Stevens said.\n\nAlthough Columbus is credited as the \"discoverer\" of the New World, millions of people already inhabited the Americas. Columbus made four expeditions to the Caribbean and South America over two decades, enslaving and decimating populations and opening the floodgates of European colonization.\n\nMany groups have called for the removal of monuments to Columbus.\n\n\"For over 500 years, Indigenous people have been fighting for their survival, land and rights,” Les Begay, a Diné Nation member and co-founder of the Indigenous Peoples Day Coalition of Illinois, said last October. “Each October, when Columbus is honored, it further diminishes and erases Native people, their history and their culture.\"\n\nWhen was Columbus Day established?\n\nColumbus Day celebrations date back to 1792, when New York City celebrated the 300th anniversary of Columbus' landfall. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed Columbus Day a national holiday in 1934 – one of 10 official federal holidays.\n\nEditor's note: A previous version of this story published in 2021.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/11/27/obama-annual-thanksgiving-proclamation/3764677/", "title": "Obama: Thanksgiving is the time to count our blessings", "text": "David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPresident Obama has issued the annual Thanksgiving proclamation:\n\n\"Thanksgiving offers each of us the chance to count our many blessings -- the freedoms we enjoy, the time we spend with loved ones, the brave men and women who defend our Nation at home and abroad.\n\n\"This tradition reminds us that no matter what our background or beliefs, no matter who we are or who we love, at our core we are first and foremost Americans.\n\n\"Our annual celebration has roots in centuries-old colonial customs.

Cows loaf near their barns, deer graze on the corn kernels dropped by pickers, an occasional hawk scans the naked fields for vermin, and we can count among our blessings that we live in a place as beautiful as this.\n\nWe also can give thanks for what those fields and farms represent – the land from which we receive our food for Thanksgiving, Christmas and every other day.\n\nTurkey, chicken, beef, pork, milk, eggs, wheat for flour, fruit and vegetables produced here, combined with the food processing and packaging businesses around all of that farming, make up Ohio's largest industry.\n\nSo in this challenging year of 2021, take a moment to thank a farmer, remember the true meaning of Thanksgiving and consider a little of the history of what has become a national holiday:\n\nPresident George Washington issued a proclamation in 1789 declaring the first national day of thanksgiving, asking people for gratitude to God \"for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country\" and \"the favorable interpositions of his Providence.\"\n\nIn following years, states set their own dates for the day of thanksgiving until President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November for all to give thanks on the same day – \"reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People.\"\n\nHe issued that proclamation on Oct. 3, 1863 – a year in which America was more divided than ever, one in which tens of thousands of American troops died in Civil War battles.\n\n\"In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union,\" Lincoln's proclamation said.\n\nAmid that time of unparalleled division, President Lincoln took time to remind people of the many reasons to be thankful, and he easily could have been talking about Ohio today:\n\n\"The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.\"\n\nAlan D.

Haviland.\n\nHistorians don’t know exactly which day the \"first Thanksgiving\" between the Pilgrims and Native Americans fell on — and it actually happened in October, not November, according to the Farmer’s Almanac. So why do we observe Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November?\n\nThanksgiving 2020:CDC recommends that Americans don't travel for Thanksgiving\n\nHistory:What you learned about the ‘first Thanksgiving’ isn’t true. Here’s the real story\n\nThe Farmer’s Almanac goes on to say that Thursday was a special day for Puritan colonists in New England, with ministers giving a religious lecture on Thursday afternoons, so that could have contributed to the Thursday Thanksgiving tradition (although, for a brief five-year period in the 1600s, Thanksgiving was held on Nov. 25).\n\nAt any rate, Thanksgiving has been held on a Thursday in November since George Washington’s presidency. Washington declared a day of thanksgiving and prayer in 1789, partly to honor the new U.S. Constitution.\n\nBut it was President Abraham Lincoln who proclaimed in 1863 that Thanksgiving would be held the last Thursday of November.\n\n\"He's the father of the whole idea of a nation giving thanks for its advantages and privileges of living in a democracy like this,\" said Harold Holzer, historian and chairman of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation.\n\nIt took the trauma of the Civil War to make Thanksgiving a formal, annual holiday.\n\nLincoln issued his proclamation on Oct. 3, 1863, three months after Union Army victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, and at a time in which ultimate triumph appeared in sight. \"There was a lot to be thankful for in the fall of 1863,\" said Allen Guelzo, the Henry R. Luce Professor of the Civil War Era at Gettysburg College.\n\nWriting that the nation's many blessings \"should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged\" by the American people, Lincoln declared: \"I do therefore invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens.\"\n\n(It should be noted that while Lincoln issued this proclamation, most historians believe it was actually written by his secretary of State, William Seward.)\n\nThe proclamation served a familiar purpose for Lincoln. \"He was always looking for ways to unify the nation in a terrible time of war,\" biographer Ronald C. White Jr. said.\n\nZoom-ing for Thanksgiving 2020? Here's how to make the most of online dinner\n\nNational Day of Mourning:Not all Native Americans celebrate Thanksgiving. Find out why\n\nFor decades after Lincoln, Americans traditionally celebrated Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of November, even if it fell on Nov. 30 — as happened in 1939, the end of an economically troubled decade.\n\nSome merchants worried that a late Thanksgiving would cut down on Christmas sales and asked President Franklin D. Roosevelt to move the holiday up by a week – which he did, creating unanticipated havoc.\n\nSome state governors objected, issuing proclamations of their own to keep Thanksgiving on Nov. 30. Other states recognized the Nov. 23 date. This created scheduling issues for holiday traditions, from family reunions to football games.\n\n\"It was just chaos for a couple of years,\" said Bob Clark, supervisory archivist with the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library & Museum.\n\nCongress eventually stepped in. On Dec. 26, 1941, less than a month after the attack at Pearl Harbor plunged the United States into World War II, Congress passed a law declaring the fourth Thursday of November as Thanksgiving Day, where it remains to this day.\n\nThanksgiving fun facts:How the holiday has changed through the years\n\nEditor's Note: This article was originally published in 2019.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/10/11/indigenous-peoples-day-everything-you-need-know-holiday/6087138001/", "title": "What is Indigenous Peoples' Day?

Roosevelt.\n\nColumbus Day has prompted political debate in states, cities and municipalities around the U.S., especially in the past decade, with many favoring Indigenous Peoples' Day instead.\n\n“For generations, Federal policies systematically sought to assimilate and displace Native people and eradicate Native cultures,” Biden wrote in the Indigenous Peoples’ Day proclamation. “...

The 10 states that observe the holiday via proclamation are Arizona, California, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin, plus Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd the 10 that officially celebrate it are Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota and Vermont.\n\nSome tribal groups in Oklahoma celebrate Native American Day in lieu of Columbus Day, with some groups naming the day in honor of their individual tribes.\n\nMore than 100 cities have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day, including Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Phoenix and San Francisco.\n\nIs Columbus Day gone? Why is it controversial?\n\nThough some groups argue that Columbus Day, which is still a federal holiday, celebrates Italian American heritage, many say the holiday glorifies an exploration that led to the genocide of native peoples and paved the way for slavery.\n\nAlthough Columbus is credited as the \"discoverer\" of the New World, millions of people already inhabited the Americas. Columbus made four expeditions to the Caribbean and South America over two decades, enslaving and decimating populations and opening the floodgates of European colonization.\n\nMany groups have called for the removal of monuments to Columbus, as well as to Confederate generals.\n\nColumbus Day celebrations date back to 1792, when New York City celebrated the 300th anniversary of Columbus' landfall. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed Columbus Day a national holiday in 1934 – one of 10 official federal holidays.\n\nAre businesses closed Monday?\n\nMost banks and post offices in the country are closed on Monday, with the day being recognized as a federal holiday.\n\nAlso closed are any agencies or institutions operated by the government, such as libraries, federal offices, and DMVs.\n\nWhile locally owned businesses are up to the owner, supermarkets and most drug stores are open. Same goes for staples Target, Walmart, Stabucks and Dunkin' Donuts.\n\nNational parks are also open.\n\nContributing: Grace Hauck, Associated Press, Times Record News", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/10/06/texas-marks-second-year-of-indigenous-peoples-day-recognition/69541939007/", "title": "Texas marks second year of Indigenous Peoples' Day recognition", "text": "For the second year, Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples’ Day will both be celebrated in Texas on October 10.\n\nIn 2021, Gov. Greg Abbott, for the first time in the state's history, signed a resolution to recognize the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day.\n\nThe second Monday in October has already been recognized as the federal holiday, Columbus Day. The day was first federally recognized under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937. It became a legal holiday in 1971.\n\nWhile Columbus Day is a federal holiday, states and local governments can choose to not observe it.\n\nMore:Which states and cities officially celebrate Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples’ Day?\n\nIn recent years, several municipalities and states have chosen to note Indigenous Peoples’ Day instead of Columbus Day because of the complicated history of Native American people and Europeans who came here.\n\nTo date, 14 states — Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, D.C. and Wisconsin — do not officially celebrate Columbus Day. South Dakota has Native American Day instead of Columbus Day.\n\nAt least 130 local governments also choose to not celebrate Columbus Day or celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ Day or a different holiday instead.\n\nIs Indigenous Peoples’ Day a new holiday?\n\nIndigenous Peoples’ Day was first considered by the United Nations conference in 1977.\n\nSouth Dakota was the first state to celebrate a Native American Day beginning in 1989.\n\nIndigenous Peoples’ Day was first recognized in Berkley, California in 1992, coinciding with the 500th anniversary of Columbus’ arrival in the Americas Oct. 12, 1492.\n\nThe holiday, which celebrates the history, culture and contributions of Native Americans, has grown in popularity over the years.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is the first U.S. president to issue an official proclamation marking Indigenous Peoples’ Day in 2021.\n\nHe said in the proclamation that it is a day in which the country “celebrates the invaluable contributions and resilience of Indigenous peoples, recognizes their inherent sovereignty, and commits to honoring the Federal Government’s trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations.”\n\nBiden also issued a proclamation Oct. 8, 2021, marking Columbus Day saying, \"Today, let this day be one of reflection — on America’s spirit of exploration, on the courage and contributions of Italian Americans throughout the generations, on the dignity and resilience of Tribal Nations and Indigenous communities, and on the work that remains ahead of us to fulfill the promise of our Nation for all.\"\n\nWhile some states chosen to mark both Columbus and Ingenious Peoples’ Day, such as Texas, other states are doing away with Columbus Day altogether.\n\nStates that did away with Columbus Day\n\nHawaii celebrates Discoverers’ Day in place of Columbus Day in recognition of the Polynesian discoverers that first came to the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nIn 2017, Alaska signed into law recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ Day in Alaska in lieu of Columbus Day.\n\nNew Mexico dropped Columbus Day in 2019.\n\nTennessee moved Columbus Day recognition to the Friday after Thanksgiving.\n\nColorado instead celebrates Cabrini Day, which began in 2020, in the first Monday of October instead of Columbus Day. This celebrates the humanitarian efforts of Frances Xavier Cabrini and is also the first paid state holiday recognizing a woman in the U.S.\n\nOther states that do not officially observe Columbus Day include Arkansas, parts of California, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Washington, D.C., Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, parts of North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nTexas celebrates both but neither is official paid holiday\n\nIn Texas, Indigenous Peoples’ Day does not replace Columbus Day and both are celebrated the second Monday in October. Neither is an official paid state holiday.\n\nColumbus Day is a federal holiday but is not considered a “major” one. There will not be postal service, and banks will be closed. But most businesses will remain open.\n\nMost nonfederal businesses will remain open, and while school is not usually closed for Columbus Day, Wichita Falls ISD students are out of school this Monday for parent-teacher conferences.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}]}

The shooter is also dead, city officials said earlier this morning. Officers responded to the store less than an hour before closing around 10:12 p.m. and found the victims and evidence of a shooting, Chesapeake Police public information officer Leo Kosinski told CNN. Five patients were being treated at Sentara General Hospital in nearby Norfolk, Virginia, a spokesperson for Sentara Healthcare told CNN affiliate WTKR. An update on their conditions was not immediately available. “We’re just a couple hours past the initial incident, so everything is very fluid, very new right now,” Kosinski said earlier. A news conference is scheduled for 8 a.m. ET, the city of Chesapeake said on Twitter.\n\n2. Trump\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for the IRS to release former President Donald Trump’s tax returns to a Democratic-led House committee. The high court’s move is a major loss for Trump, who has sought to shield the release of his tax returns for years and is currently under multiple investigations. Trump’s legal team has continuously sought to keep his returns secret and turned to the Supreme Court – composed of three of Trump’s nominees – after he lost at the lower court level. Separately, a New York state judge set an October 2023 trial date for the New York attorney general’s $250 million lawsuit against Trump, his eldest children and the Trump Organization, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\n3. Student loans\n\nThe Biden administration is yet again extending the pause on federal student loan payments, a benefit that began in March 2020 to help people who were struggling financially due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This latest extension comes as the administration’s student loan forgiveness program remains tied up in the courts. Officials had told borrowers the program, which is worth up to $20,000 in debt relief per borrower, would be implemented before loan payments were set to resume in January 2023. The pause will last until 60 days after the litigation is resolved. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, 2023, payments will resume 60 days after that, according to the Department of Education.\n\n4. Tech layoffs\n\nComputer maker HP said Tuesday that it will lay off up to 6,000 workers over the next three years, becoming the latest tech company to significantly reduce staffing amid fears of an economic downturn. The company disclosed the job cuts in a statement accompanying its lackluster quarterly earnings report, where it also said sales dropped more than 11% compared to the same period last year. The news makes HP the latest in a growing list of once-high-flying tech companies that are now announcing major job cuts. Facebook-parent Meta, Amazon and Twitter all announced large layoffs in recent weeks.\n\n5. Covid-19\n\nThe Biden administration has launched a critical, six-week push aimed at stepping up Americans’ Covid-19 booster vaccinations heading into the holiday season. Biden’s chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, kicked off the campaign on Tuesday during his final White House press briefing before he retires in December. The push comes as more than 35 million Americans have already received the updated, bivalent booster shot – including more than 16 million seniors – White House Covid-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said during the briefing. But that’s a fraction of the 267 million Americans who have received their primary Covid-19 vaccine, according to data from the CDC. The campaign will focus on reaching seniors and the communities that were hardest hit by Covid-19 by expanding access, increasing awareness and more.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nWe now know what Budweiser will do with the beer it can’t sell at the World Cup\n\nBudweiser plans to ship all the unsold Buds to the country that wins the tournament – assuming that country does not prohibit alcohol consumption.\n\nA group of Indonesian islands is about to hit the auction block\n\nTo some billionaires, islands are like potato chips: you can’t buy just one.\n\nYou can thank ‘The Sims’ for the rise of luxury fashion in gaming\n\nLuxury labels like Balenciaga, Burberry and Louis Vuitton want your avatars to look their very best – for a price of course.\n\nHow to answer those dreaded personal questions at holiday gatherings\n\nHere’s what you should do before the dinner rolls start flying.\n\n‘Love Actually’ cast to reunite for 20th anniversary TV special\n\nAll I want for Christmas is … oh you know the rest.\n\nQUIZ TIME\n\nTurkey is typically the centerpiece of Thanksgiving dinner.

But don't worry. We've got you covered. It's not so intimidating once you have a plan.\n\nUSA TODAY tapped chef Michael Symon, of ABC's \"The Chew\", and Herve Guillard, dean of students and director of education at the Institute of Culinary Education, to share their expertise to help you cook the perfect turkey. Plus, we have a few of our own tips. And, if all else fails, just fill your plate with sides. We have plenty of recipes for great sides, too.\n\n'You don't need to make a butter board':How to save money on Thanksgiving dinner\n\nHow do you defrost a turkey?\n\nAccording to the National Turkey Federation, Americans consume 46 million turkeys at Thanksgiving. It's estimated that some 50 percent of those are bought frozen.\n\nThe USDA recommends thawing your frozen turkey in a refrigerator as the safest method of defrosting it and suggests allowing one day for each 4-5 pounds of weight. So if your turkey weighs 16 pounds, it will take about four days to thaw. Once thawed, the turkey is safe for another two to four days before you cook it.\n\nIf you’ve missed that window, you can thaw it in cold water. Place the turkey breast side down, still in its original unopened wrapper, with enough cold water to cover it completely. Change water every 30 minutes.\n\nYou can expect 30 minutes of thawing per pound of turkey. That’s still a long time. If you have a 12 pound turkey, which is on the smaller side, you’re looking at around 6 hours.\n\nHere's a how-to video from Problem Solved to walk you through thawing with cold water:\n\nIf you don’t want to fuss with basically giving your turkey a cold bath, then just cook it from frozen. The USDA says it’s perfectly safe to cook a turkey from the frozen; it just takes longer. They say a solidly frozen turkey takes at least 50 percent longer to cook than a thawed turkey. If your turkey is only partially frozen, there’s not an equation to follow so use a food thermometer, and when your bird hits 165˚F-170˚F in the innermost part of the thigh and the thickest part of the breast, it is ready.\n\nHow to avoid cross contamination while cooking a turkey\n\nOne worry that often comes with prepping raw meat — especially a big bird like turkey — is cross contamination.\n\nBut, according to Symon, there are a few easy ways to avoid any risk while you prep your Thanksgiving meal.\n\nIt's a better-safe-than-sorry situation when working with raw meat. You're better off cleaning more and taking precautions, such as hand washing, throughout your cooking process. Symon walked USA TODAY through the step-by-step process to avoid cross contamination. The process begins with a clean, clear cooking space and washed hands.\n\nHow to brine a turkey\n\nMany birds come pre-brined, Guillard says. So, check to make sure what you've purchased needs a brine before starting. If you do need to brine a turkey, there are a couple ways to do it.\n\nWet brining is the process of soaking meat in a salt-water solution. The salty bath locks moisture into the meat. This method yields tender and tasty turkey, with a crispy golden skin.\n\nA dry brine involves rubbing salt directly on your chosen meat (in this case, turkey), it helps to draw moisture out — and then over time, juices and salt will be reabsorbed into the meat, Southern Living says.\n\nGuillard says he often uses a basic brine with water, salt and sugar, though you can add different seasonings, too.\n\n\"I like to go with flavors that are very typical fall: Mushroom, onions, garlic, thyme, rosemary and brown sugar,\" he says. \"So you can chop up a bunch of spices and aromatics like carrots, onions, garlic, and then fluids in your boiling liquid which releases the flavor and then I would leave them in liquid when you submerged.\"\n\nIf you're looking for an exact recipe, here's Pioneer Woman Ree Drummond's recipe for her favorite turkey brine.\n\n'Loved by absolutely everyone':How did the turkey become the centerpiece of Thanksgiving dinner?\n\nWhat temperature to cook a turkey\n\nThe bigger the bird, the lower the temperature you should cook it (and for a longer time), Guillard says. \"You want to make sure it's (cooked) throughout without getting too brown on the outside,\" he says.\n\nFor example, if he had a 20 pound turkey, Guillard says he would cook it at around 300 degrees. That's less than the 350 degrees people most often cook turkey.\n\nWhen roasting a turkey, Guillard says, some people like to start at a very high temperature and drop it down to a lower temp to finish cooking.\n\nBut not everyone cooks a turkey the same way. And there's no right way, technically.\n\n\"Some people go completely the other way by starting slow at around 250 and then picking it up at the end to get browning on the skin,\" Guillard explains. \"The key thing to balance on this is having the right textures and making sure it's properly (cooked) throughout but to not have a dried meat.\"\n\nThat's why chefs often rely on two temperatures. \"A low temperature will cook the meat very nicely inside and keep it juicy without drying it but you want to high temperature at some point whether it's at the beginning of the end to crisp up the skin and the melted butter to get an extra crispy skin,\" Guillard says.\n\nHow long to cook your turkey\n\nGuillard recommends cooking your turkey 12 to 13 minutes per pound if you're cooking an unstuffed bird it at 350 degrees (that’s about 3 hours for a 12- to 14-lb. turkey). If it's stuffed, up the cooking time to 15 minutes per pound.\n\nBut, size, cook time and temperature change in coordination. So make sure to follow a recipe and adjust accordingly.\n\nHow to garnish your turkey\n\nOnce you've cooked and carved your turkey, there's one final step before it disappears under a mound of gravy or cranberry sauce. You have to garnish the meat.\n\nDecorative accompaniments such as apples, oranges, lemons, limes, and fresh herbs like parsley and chives add to the aesthetics and also help mark the meal and the occasion as something special.\n\nHow to carve your turkey\n\nCarving a turkey, whether for Thanksgiving or any other holiday celebration, is a necessity that somehow became a grandiose tradition. In popular culture, the honor has traditionally gone to the family's patriarch. That practice dates to the Middle Ages.\n\nCheck out the video below for a full how-to:\n\nContributing: Grateful\n\nCheck out these recipes to up your kitchen game:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2016/11/15/taste-cover-local-thanksgiving-locavore-turkey-red-wattle-pork-calabaza-squash-pine-island-botanicals-greens-collards/93490294/", "title": "In SWFL, a completely local Thanksgiving", "text": "ANNE REED\n\nAREED@NEWS-PRESS.COM\n\nThanksgiving is usually celebrated with a large feast, featuring the fruits of the fall harvest.\n\nA roasted turkey surrounded by homemade stuffing, root-vegetable casseroles, pumpkin and apple pies. It makes sense for those up north, where the growing season comes to an end as the leaves fall from the trees.\n\nBut in sunny, sub-tropical Southwest Florida, our growing season is just starting. We won't have green beans for several months and we don't grow pumpkins. This means a trip to a supermarket for canned pumpkin, veggies trucked in from other parts of the country and apples from northern harvests.\n\nA completely local Thanksgiving is possible, though.\n\nFrom Felda-raised turkeys to casseroles made from local squash, you needn't rely on outside harvests to fill your Thanksgiving table. Here's how:\n\nTURKEY\n\nLast year, Nicole Kozak raised and harvested her first flock of turkeys at Circle C Farm in Felda. The test run was a success and this year Kozak has approximately 600 turkeys ready for Thanksgiving. All are raised in open pastures with no antibiotics, and supplemental feed that's not genetically modified.\n\n\"Because there was interest last year, we grew and cultivated that interest,\" she said. \"We have turkeys for the holidays and we are also going to keep turkey available and grow it year round like our chickens.\" The turkeys are available frozen or fresh and Kozak has been taking reservations for more than a month.\n\nIn LaBelle at Waymore Farms, Bryan Beer harvested, processed and froze his turkey last month. Storing them in the deep freeze until Thanksgiving was much easier than staying up each night, protecting the turkeys from coyotes.\n\nTurkeys go local this Thanksgiving\n\nThis was Beer's first year raising turkeys. He raised his turkeys on pasture using supplemental certified organic feed. He gave them no antibiotics.\n\n\"Most people don't know the difference between a store-bought turkey and one raised in the field,\" Beer said. \"There is a reason we do it naturally and we sell it the way we do. It's because it tastes really good and it's better for you.\"\n\nExtras: The price per pound of Circle C Farm's turkeys is $6, and price per pound at Waymore Farms is $7. Both farms sell other products, such as eggs, chickens and beef.\n\nTo order: Call either farm to reserve turkeys or reserve online. For Circle C Farm call 776-9054, visit circlecfarmfl.com or stop by the farm store at 9294 Strike Lane, Bonita Springs. To order turkeys from Waymore Farms, call 863-517-9559 or visit waymorefarms.com.\n\nHERITAGE PORK\n\nIt's not always about the turkey.\n\nAt Rosy Tomorrows Heritage Farm in North Fort Myers, the organically raised and pastured 100 percent Red Wattle pigs are in higher demand than previous seasons. Ham and other cuts of the humanely raised and harvested pork are available year-round. This holiday season, owner Rose O'Dell King and her staff are offering a few special items, starting with whole-roasted hogs.\n\n\"We are doing a lot of whole pigs,\" O'Dell King said. \"People seem to be wanting a memorable and special culinary event but are saying it doesn't need to be turkey.\"\n\nFor the love of lard, Rosy Tomorrows gives pig fat a good name\n\nThe hogs range from 25 to 45 pounds and can be taken home and roasted or, for those nervous about the process, O'Dell King and her staff will roast the hog for you. \"It just takes the guess work out,\" she said.\n\nThis is the first year O'Dell King has offered a crown roast of pork. \"Crown roast is a really spectacular centerpiece presentation,\" she explained. \"When you cook it and bring it out, it has that same wow factor as a turkey.\"\n\nExtras: Rosy Tomorrows Heritage Farm also offers two different seasonings for their pork: Hundred Acres citrus with Walker Farms saw palmetto honey, and a traditional mojo with garlic and lime. They are also selling rice and black-bean stuffing and a sausage-apple stuffing to accompany the pork.\n\nTo order: Whole hogs and half hogs can be ordered online at rosy-tomorrows.com. For Thanksgiving, orders must be placed by Monday. For all other cuts and more information, call 567-6000.\n\nCALABAZA SQUASH\n\nWe may not have piles of pumpkins and gourds growing in Southwest Florida, but we do have calabaza squash.\n\nMichael Wallace of Pine Island Botanicals grows a tropical variety of calabaza year-round. He sells the buttery yellow squash blossoms at local farmers markets and regular customers know to keep their eyes out for the large, long-necked green and yellow squash, which can weigh close to 10 pounds.\n\nA cousin of butternut squash, calabazas can be roasted, mashed, baked into casseroles, stir-fried or blended into a creamy soup.\n\nCaution: Handling the raw calabaza can cause allergic contact dermatitis for some. Once the thick skin is removed, touching the flesh with un-gloved hands can cause itching, peeling and blistered skin in those sensitive to it.\n\nExtras: Pine Island Botanicals shares booth space (and growing space) with The Sprout Queen. Sprouts, shoots and hydroponically-grown lettuces are available as well as tropical fruits such as star fruit.\n\nWhere to buy: Find Pine Island Botanicals at one of these local farmers markets: Surfside Sunset Farmers Market, Tuesdays 2-7 p.m., 2366 Surfside Blvd., Cape Coral; Fort Myers River District Farmers Market, Thursdays 7 a.m.-1 p.m., Centennial Park, 2000 W. First St., downtown Fort Myers; Sanibel Island Farmers Market, Sundays 8 a.m.-1 p.m., 800 Dunlop Road, Sanibel.\n\nCOLLARD GREENS\n\nStop by Brittain Produce stand at the State Farmers Market in Fort Myers and they've got a cooler full of mustard, turnip and collard greens. It's where Farmers Market Restaurant co-owner Betsy Barnwell shops for fresh greens each day.\n\nWhen she took over the restaurant two years ago, she made the switch from frozen greens to fresh. The recipe is simple, and one that cook Bertha Smith knows by heart: collard greens, salt and pepper, fat back and water.\n\n\"And a little bit of love,\" Smith added.\n\nBarnwell has a strong local focus when it comes to ingredients for the restaurant.\n\n\"You know what you're getting and where it's coming from,\" she explained. \"And you get to support the community. I like to buy from people around here and support small local businesses because I'm a small local business.\"\n\nExtras: If you don't plan to cook on Thanksgiving, you can still stop in for Thanksgiving dinner at Farmer's Market Restaurant at 2736 Edison Ave. next to the market, and have some of Smith's collard greens. Call 334-1637 for hours, details or to reserve some of their famous pies.\n\nWhere to buy: Brittain Produce, 2744 Edison Ave. suite 1, Fort Myers.\n\nPerfect time for pie: bakers ready for pie season\n\nEGGPLANT\n\nIf your guests are gluten-free, or you're just looking for a side dish that feels like comfort food, Chef Kristina San Filippo of Purple Spoon in Bonita Springs suggests roasting eggplant for an easy side dish.\n\nOn Wednesdays, she hosts a farmers market at her culinary hub, where she teaches classes, hosts events and sells pantry essentials. Inyoni Organic Farm is currently bringing eggplant to market and last week San Filippo created an easy and hearty side dish.\n\nFarm to Fork: Eggplant confit recipe\n\n\"It's very seasonal,\" she explained. Her instructions are to cut an eggplant into a small dice, toss with grape-seed oil and kosher salt and roast in a pan at 400 degrees for 6 to 7 minutes. \"The last thing you want to do is overcook eggplant.\" She then cooks a mixture of wild rice and brown basmati rice, places the rice in a bowl and mixes in the roasted eggplants with dried cranberries, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt.\n\nSan Filippo sells the rice at Purple Spoon.\n\nWhere to buy: A farmers market is held each Wednesday from 3-6 p.m. at Purple Spoon, 25151 Chamber of Commerce Drive, Bonita Springs. The market will be open the day before Thanksgiving; call 908-3842 for more information.\n\nGRAPEFRUIT\n\nThe first citrus fruits of the season are luring in locals and snowbirds at Sun Harvest Citrus in south Fort Myers.\n\nEasy-to-peel navel oranges and ruby red grapefruit are up first, and while grapefruit may not seem like a traditional Thanksgiving dessert, citrus pies and cakes can give your holiday table a Florida twist.\n\nFlavors of Paradise: Grapefruit cake from early 1980s\n\nGrapefruit halves can be topped with brown sugar and broiled quickly for an easy dessert, juiced and mixed with vodka for a cocktail, or mixed with strawberry gelatin for this chilled pie from floridacitrus.org.\n\nGrapefruit pie\n\nIngredients\n\n2 large or 3 medium Florida red grapefruit, peeled and sectioned\n\n1 6 ounce graham cracker crust\n\n1 cup sugar\n\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\n\n1 1/2 cups water\n\n1 3 ounce package strawberry-flavored gelatin\n\n1 8 ounce container frozen non-dairy whipped topping, thawed\n\nSteps\n\nArrange grapefruit sections in the bottom of the graham cracker crust; set aside.

Heggen's kitchen equipment needed to be up to Harris' standards.\n\nAfter the campaign team approved, they swore Heggen to secrecy. But on Tuesday, during a stop at Boesen the Florist, she could barely contain herself. She didn't provide a name, but she told the owner that a presidential candidate would be eating in her home. She needed the dining room centerpiece to be perfect.\n\nShe showed the owner the napkins she was using for the table — a muted floral pattern. They picked out an arrangement of orange roses, red roses, baby yellow roses, seed pods and burgundy carnations. For the kitchen, where the stakes would not be so high, Heggen created her own arrangement.\n\nOn Wednesday night, while Harris and her family were out on the town, campaign staff gave Heggen the green light to sneak back into her house. She left her special strawberry pretzel Jell-O salad in the fridge for the senator.\n\n\"It's a great year to be involved in politics and the campaign,\" Heggen said. \"How can you not care about what's happening right now? I'll contribute in any small way that I can.\"\n\nAn untapped Iowa tradition\n\nWhile the history of the first-in-the-nation caucuses is filled with small-town, \"only in Iowa\" moments, Thanksgiving is a relatively untrodden territory. Candidates hold events the weekends before and after the holiday, but rarely do they carve their turkeys here.\n\nIn the last two decades, according to Register archives, the rare exceptions occurred in 2007, when Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Chris Dodd celebrated the holiday in Des Moines.\n\nBut this year, Harris and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota both brought their family here for the holiday, hosting dinners 1½ miles from each other. U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, meanwhile, campaigned here Wednesday before flying home. (He made sure to point out that he would be eating the family's cornbread stuffing, a recipe passed down from his grandmother, who grew up in Des Moines.)\n\nHarris' and Klobuchar's families spent Wednesday night together at a Des Moines hotel lounge.\n\n\"We had fun,\" Klobuchar said. \"We got to know each other — Kamala, Cory and I got pretty close during the [Supreme Court Justice Brett] Kavanaugh hearing, being on the front line together.”\n\nKlobuchar, who campaigned throughout Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday, served and packaged meals at the South Des Moines Community Center on Thanksgiving morning. She then ate with about 45 staffers at the South of Grand home of Dr. Andy McGuire, her local campaign chair.\n\nKlobuchar brought a sweet potato casserole that has served as a Thanksgiving staple in her family for about 20 years. In McGuire's kitchen, she pulled out Tupperware with the dish's toppings: coconut, pecans and corn flakes.\n\n\"Of course, there is a lot of butter,\" she said. \"But I won't say how much.\"\n\nUsually, Klobuchar starts Thanksgivings at the United Way's Walk to End Hunger at Mall of America. She then attends a brunch at a neighbor's house before eating dinner with her in-laws.\n\nShe and her husband, John, called his parents on Thursday morning, apologizing for the missed holiday. They also compromised with them this year, offering to spend quality time on another important date.\n\n“They get it,\" she said. \"They’re excited about Christmas, so it’s all good. Those words were mentioned.”\n\nAll in on Iowa is all the time\n\nHarris' husband, Doug Emhoff, said the idea of celebrating Thanksgiving in Des Moines first came up at the end of September, when the senator's staff refocused efforts on Iowa. She asked him how he would feel about leaving California for the Midwest.\n\n\"If we're in, we're in,\" Emhoff said he told her. \"I'm totally behind you.\"\n\nHarris carried sweet potatoes and collard greens on her flight here from South Carolina on Monday night. She and Emhoff then bought arugula and seasoning salt at a local Whole Foods on Tuesday before touring the Evelyn K. Davis Center for Working Families.\n\nLater, she called campaign staffers her office on Ingersoll Avenue.\n\n\"I know it's a great sacrifice,\" Harris told them. \"I know many of you will not be home for Thanksgiving. I know that Thanksgiving is one of those holidays where you really like to be around your family and the people you have grown up with. So many of you have longstanding traditions around Thanksgiving, but you're spending it here in Iowa.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris held a house party for teachers in Waukee, knocked on the doors of registered Democrats and conversed with reporters in her new kitchen.\n\n\"Bacon is a spice,\" she said, while explaining how she planned to make collards this year.\n\n\"Bacon is a spice,\" Emhoff repeated in the back, whispering to staffers. \"That could be our new campaign slogan. 'For the people. Bacon is a spice.'\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, Harris attended the Turkey Trot downtown while her brother-in-law, Tony West, ran the 5K. They then met with residents at Corinthian Gardens, the apartments off University Avenue where Harris campaigned for then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama before the 2008 caucuses.\n\nHer sister, Maya Harris, explained that she and Kamala traditionally split cooking duties. Kamala handles the turkey and gravy; Maya takes care of the stuffing and macaroni and cheese. The two typically split responsibility for greens and sweet potatoes.\n\nThis year, though, Maya is on crutches with a broken foot. She's leaving all the work to the senator.\n\n\"She's an excellent cook,\" Maya said. \"So I'm not unhappy.\"\n\nEmhoff said he doesn't feel guilty about putting so much Thanksgiving responsibility on his wife. Cooking is soothing for her, a trait passed down from her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan.\n\nKamala typically plans the big meal three or four weeks in advance. She scrolls through cooking apps, her mother's old recipes, \"The Art of Cooking,\" \"The Joy of Cooking\" and books by Alice Waters and Marcella Hazan.\n\nThis year's menu includes dry-brined turkey, Honey Baked ham, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, cornbread stuffing, greens with bacon, cranberry sauce, arugula salad, Hawaii rolls and dinner rolls. (She also received a cranberry pecan pie from Susan Gauthier, the mother of her campaign's digital content director and winner of the 2019 Minnesota State Fair pie contest in the \"creative apple\" category.)\n\n\"It was something that was passed on,\" Emhoff said of his wife's passion. \"It's creative. It makes people happy, and she likes to make people happy. It's planning. It's researching. It's a lot of the things she loves to do. And she can put music on. It's a whole process that she just enjoys. And she's good at it.\"\n\nMaya and Kamala usually cook through the afternoon. The family eats around 5 p.m. and ends the evening over games of cards. The Harrises, Emhoff and West have a running game of hearts. West keeps a sheet of paper on him, with the most up-to-date score.\n\nAsked who is currently in the lead Wednesday, he couldn't recall.\n\n\"They're keeping the game running because I won the last time we were playing,\" Maya said. \"It's a running game until someone else gets to win.\"\n\nThe tradition pre-dates Emhoff, who married Kamala in 2014.\n\n\"They're so ruthless and competitive that they didn't really teach me how to play,\" he said. \"And I still had to play and get in there. I learned how to play on my own just to learn how to compete with this very competitive family. There's no lead-in.\"\n\nStaff writer Katie Akin contributed to this report.\n\nTyler Jett covers jobs and the economy for the Register. Contact him at 515-284-8215 and tjett@registermedia.com.

Publix, which has more than 1,280 stores in the southern U.S. including Alabama, Florida and Virginia, started limiting purchases of canned cranberry sauce and some other Thanksgiving essentials, including jarred gravy and canned pie filling, ahead of the holiday.\n\nResearch firm IRI found cranberry sauce available at 79% of retailers across the U.S. during the week ending Nov. 7, down from 89% during the same period a year ago, CNN reported.\n\nThanksgiving dishes:What is your state's favorite?

As a result, some consumers might have to opt for whole berry sauce or homemade sauce instead of jellied sauce, for instance.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to land a can of Ocean Spray cranberry sauce, you might be wondering why is the rounded bottom of the can actually at the top? It's been an anomaly to many shoppers since the early 2000s.\n\nThe cans are \"filled and labeled upside down with the rounded edge on top and the sharp can-like edge on the bottom to keep the jelly whole,\" Ocean Spray said in its statement. \"There’s an air bubble vacuum on the rounded side, so the consumer can swipe the edge of the can with a knife to break the vacuum and the log will easily slide out.\"\n\nWhat's open Thanksgiving 2021:Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot are closed on Thanksgiving but CVS, Walgreens are open.

But one of the biggest factors is cost.\n\nTurkeys are cheaper this year compared with last November, but data shows overall food costs are still high, especially when it comes to popular holiday side dishes.\n\n\"While inflation is not as extreme as last year, it is still present and grocery store prices have still been somewhat variable,\" Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nBut before you go thinking that this Thanksgiving may be a good year to dine out, experts also warn that restaurant menu prices have risen even more drastically.\n\nHere are some things to consider when choosing to cook at home or go out this Thanksgiving.\n\nWhy is Thanksgiving so expensive?As turkey prices drop, cost of some Thanksgiving side dishes go up\n\nTurkey prices are down from last Thanksgiving\n\nRetail prices for turkeys, the holiday's main course for many Americans, have been on the decline after costs for the birds soared in 2022 amid rising inflation and a rapidly spreading avian influenza that limited production. What's more, economists predict that prices could fall even further as Thanksgiving approaches and businesses try to lure customers with special deals.\n\nPer-pound prices for turkey rose more than 20% in 2022 over the previous year, according to an annual Thanksgiving report from Wells Fargo.\n\nThe price increase was spurred in part by overall inflation, but experts say the main culprit was highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The outbreak that began in January 2022 infected 7 million turkeys and wiped out commercial livestock, depleting supplies for last year's Thanksgiving, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nOverall, average turkey prices reached as high as $1.72 a pound just as Thanksgiving approached, Nelson said. As a result, a Farm Bureau survey in 2022 found that a Thanksgiving feast for 10 cost $64.05, a 20% increase from the previous year’s average of $53.31.\n\nShare your shopping plans:How are you feeling about this holiday shopping season?\n\nTurkey production is up just in time for the holiday\n\nAs the avian flu has begun to wane this year, farmers have once again been able to ramp up production. And fortunately for shoppers, that means that turkeys will be ample, with prices falling just in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nTurkey production reached 432.3 million pounds in July − the month turkeys need to be placed on feed so they can be ready for Thanksgiving. That's a 9.7% increase over the previous year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture's September 2023 Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook.\n\nThe average retail cost of a frozen turkey hen at the end of last week was $1.35 a pound, about 8% lower than at the same time last year, according to a USDA report.\n\nBut prices could be even less closer to Nov. 23.\n\nSupermarkets are stocked with plenty of turkeys after last year's supply disruption, which means as Thanksgiving Day approaches, grocers often begin to offer promotions and discounts for the holiday staple. That includes selling turkeys at a cost lower than the wholesale price.\n\n\"Everyone who wants a turkey will be able to get one,\" a spokesperson for USDA told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nPumpkin pie or apple?A state-by-state guide to people's favorite Thanksgiving pies\n\nPrices for ingredients in classic side dishes are still up\n\nTurkeys may be available for a bargain this year, but don't expect any deals on your favorite sides. This year's Wells Fargo report found that the cost of ingredients in classic Thanksgiving side dishes have risen in the last year.\n\nThe cost of russet potatoes is at an all-time high ($1.17 a pound), with costs rising 14% from a year ago.\n\nSweet potatoes increased in price by 4% within the last year.\n\nCanned green beans are up almost 9%.\n\nCanned cranberries increased 60% and canned cranberry sauce is up 7% (though fresh cranberries will cost 20% less.)\n\nAlso rising in price are canned pumpkins, which are up 30%.\n\nAnd who can forget booze? Beer and wine are more expensive this year (up 5.3% and 1.2%, respectively).\n\nWhich grocery stores are open?What to know about Kroger, Publix, Aldi, more for Thanksgiving\n\nWhich restaurants are open?See Starbucks, McDonald's, Cracker Barrel hours for Thanksgiving\n\nDining out is more expensive this year compared with last year\n\nDespite those rising costs, the fact that Thanksgiving's main course is more affordable means that 2023 may be the year to cook at home. That's opposite of 2022, when many economists said consumers may actually have saved money by going to a restaurant.\n\nThe cost of food away from home has increased at a faster rate (about 6%) than food at home from a standard grocery trip (2.4%), Michael Swanson, agriculture economist with Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, told USA TODAY.\n\nMeanwhile, the higher wages restaurants have had to offer to get employees to return to work after the pandemic have led to increased menu prices for diners, Swanson said.\n\n\"That pampering or that convenience has gone up faster than your cost for doing it at home,\" Swanson said in a phone interview. \"It's a foot race and this year, restaurants ran a lot faster than the supermarkets.”\n\nYet because prices for common Thanksgiving side dishes increased in the last year, Swanson said consumers shouldn't expect tremendous savings if making homemade feasts.\n\n“It’s really hard to say to people, 'Hey it’s going to be cheaper to eat for Thanksgiving this year as compared to last year,” Swanson said. “The (cost of) turkey is a nice offset, but in general food is not cheaper than a year ago.”\n\nThe verdict: With turkey prices down and grocery stores pushing deals, 2023 may be the year to cook at home. But overall, food prices are still high, so those wanting to avoid the messy kitchen may opt to head out for their meal.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Drive through Parsippany and you'll find a slew of Southeast Asian restaurants. Visit Teaneck and you'll happen upon numerous synagogues and glatt-kosher spots. Go to Bergenfield and don't be surprised if residents call the town \"Little Manila.\" In Palisades Park, it's \"Little Korea.\"\n\nNorth Jersey is a true melting pot. Here your neighbors might be from China, Cuba, India, Ireland, Jordan, Lebanon, Peru, Russia, Poland... Anywhere, really. So any wonder then that when that all-American belt-loosening holiday known as Thanksgiving rolls around, along with turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and pumpkin pie, your neighbors' tables may well groan with international dishes — dishes they've brought from their homeland.\n\nHere are recipes that we gathered from home cooks that reside in the Garden State's wonderfully diverse community that is North Jersey. Maybe a few of their favorites will make their way onto your Thanksgiving table this year.\n\nSaddle River resident Mary Kate Morgan would visit family in Ireland often. Her parents would go to Ireland in the winter. Two of her children went to school in Ireland. So any wonder that she would bring a dish from her ancestral homeland to her family's Thanksgiving feast?\n\nMorgan serves her Irish brown bread with smoked salmon and Irish Kerry Gold butter, of course.\n\n\"Everyone always wants to take some bread home,\" she said. \"You can never make too much.\"\n\nIrish brown bread\n\n2½ cups all purpose flour, divided\n\n2 teaspoons baking soda\n\n1 teaspoons baking powder\n\n2 teaspoons salt\n\n1 cup whole wheat flour\n\n½ cup oat bran (see note)\n\n½ cup wheat germ\n\n½ cup rolled oats oatmeal\n\n½ cup steel cut oatmeal\n\n2 cups buttermilk\n\n1 egg\n\n¼ cup honey\n\nPreheat oven to 350.\n\nCombine 1 cup white flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, whole wheat flour, oat bran, wheat germ and two oatmeals. In another bowl, mix together buttermilk, egg and honey.\n\nPour buttermilk mixture into flour mixture and stir together as lightly as possible just to combine. Turn out on floured surface (if you have a silicone baking mat that is a great surface to put the dough on). The dough will be very sticky.\n\nFold the dough over on itself a few times, adding as much of the remaining white flour as needed to make a dough that is not too sticky. Divide in half.\n\nForm into two rounds, tucking the dough under to form a taut rounded top. Place on a parchment or Silpat lined cookie sheet.\n\nCut a cross in the top of each loaf. Prick each quarter once to let the fairies out.\n\nBake in the preheated oven for about 40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Internal temperature should be about 190 degrees. Remove to a rack to cool before cutting.\n\nMakes: 2 loaves\n\nNote: You can use any of the following in place of the ½ cup of oat bran:\n\nKing Arthur Harvest grains blend, malted wheat flakes, barley flakes, organic oat bran, whole flax seed or any combination of these. The King Arthur website is a great resource for all these ingredients.\n\nJulia Ferraro, a mother of three in Ridgewood, hails from Moscow, so come most any holiday, or actually any day she and her family have a hankering for it, she makes a big pot of the classic Russian sauerkraut soup, schchi. For those who'd argue that borscht is the traditional Russian soup, Ferraro politely will correct them: \"Borscht is Ukrainian.\" (Check out her blog where she writes about food and travel: juliacore.com/beyondthebarre.)\n\nFerraro points out that the soup was \"favored by Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Nicholas II, Lenin, Stalin, Grigory Rasputin, my parents, me — you name it.\" Adding: \"My mom used to make a large pot of it on a weekend to last through the rest of the week for our lunches.\"\n\nNow she makes it for her family — and friends. How does she know if her schchi s good? \"In Russia we say, in a good schchi, a spoon should stand,\" she said. She assures that a spoon stands ramrod straight in hers.\n\nSour schchi soup\n\nFor the beef broth:\n\n3 pounds beef brisket\n\n3 pounds beef bones (marrow and ribs)\n\n1 large onion, quartered\n\n2 carrots, cut in chunks\n\n2 celery ribs, cut in chunks\n\n1 parsnip, cut in chunks\n\n1 garlic clove, crushed\n\n⅓ large bunch of parsley\n\n⅓ large bunch of dill\n\nA sprig of thyme\n\n3 bay leaves\n\n1 tablespoon black peppercorns\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\nFor Schchi:\n\n1 stick of butter (8 tablespoons), divided\n\n2 two-and-a-half pounds green cabbage, shredded\n\n2 pounds sauerkraut, rinsed, water squeezed\n\n3 tablespoons tomato paste\n\n2 carrots, peeled and julienned\n\n1 large onion, chopped\n\n2 ribs celery, chopped\n\n1 large turnip, peeled and julienned\n\n1 ounce dried porcini, soaked, drained, soaking liquid reserved\n\n1 pound plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, chopped (or canned tomatoes)\n\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n\n⅓ large bunch of parsley, leaves only, chopped\n\n⅓ large bunch of dill, leaves only, chopped\n\n1 large garlic clove, minced\n\nSour cream, for serving\n\n⅓ large bunch of dill and ⅓ large bunch of parsley, chopped, for serving\n\nMake the broth: In a large stockpot, combine all the ingredients for the broth, cover with water, bring to a boil, and simmer for about 2-3 hours, until the brisket is falling apart fork-tender.\n\nMelt ½ stick of butter in a large sauce pan, add cabbage, sauerkraut, tomato paste, and a cup of stock that has been simmering for at least 30 minutes or more, cover and let stew over a very low flame for about 45 minutes, mixing once in a while.\n\nWhile the stock is simmering and the cabbage is stewing, melt the rest of the butter in a large skillet. Add carrots, onion, celery, turnip, mushrooms and sauté until the vegetables start to brown, 15-25 minutes.\n\nWhen the broth is ready, take out the meat and bones and let them cool on a large plate. When cool enough to handle, shake out the bone marrow, separate meat from the ribs, and shred the brisket. Discard bones and fat. Strain the broth through a cheese cloth and de-fat it, if preferred. Blot fat off with paper towels.\n\nAdd to the broth, sautéed cabbages and vegetables, tomatoes, salt and pepper and simmer for about 30 minutes.\n\nAdd shredded meat, bone marrow, minced garlic and herbs to the pot. Remove from heat.\n\nServes: 30 as an appetizer; 10 as a main course.\n\nNote: You can eat schchi with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkling of fresh herbs right away, but the soup tastes much better the next day. It tastes even better on the second day, and the third.\n\nVeronique Deblois, a French-Canadian Mine Hill resident, is a travel industry veteran by day and a food and wine blogger by night. Her family moved to the states more than 30 years ago. This Brown Sugar Pie, known as Tarte au Sucre in French, is a traditional holiday pie in Quebec, from where Deblois hails. She learned to make the dessert from her maternal grandmother — \"a great baker,\" she said. Deblois keeps the tradition of making this special pie, she said, for American holidays. Besides she is not a fan of pumpkin pie so, she said, \"this pie is a sweet replacement.\"\n\nBrown sugar pie (tarte au sucre)\n\n½ cup condensed milk\n\n½ cup whole milk\n\n2 teaspoons butter, softened\n\n1 cup brown sugar\n\n1 teaspoon maple extract\n\n1 tablespoon flour\n\n2 eight-inch pie crusts\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F degrees.\n\nBring the condensed and whole milks, brown sugar and butter to a simmer over medium heat in a heavy saucepan. When small bubbles form at the surface, cook for 2 minutes, whisking occasionally.\n\nIn a small cup/bowl, stir the maple extract, the flour and 2 tablespoons of hot milk-sugar mixture to form a paste. Add this paste to hot mixture and whisk to fully incorporate. Cook until thickened, about 3 minutes.\n\nPour the sugar mixture into an un-baked pie crust and cover with a second crust.\n\nBake until browned, about 25 minutes.\n\nServe with vanilla ice cream at room temperature or warm. The pie keeps well wrapped in foil for up to a week (not that it’ll last that long).\n\nYields: 8 servings.\n\nNote: Be sure to place the sugar pie on a baking sheet as you put it in the over to prevent spills.\n\nMaria Bojekian, a Franklin Lakes resident, and her family celebrate Thanksgiving with up to 35 people each year. And each year, on the table along with the turkey and cranberry sauce, is the traditional Greek baked pasta dish Pastitsio. It's the dish that Bojekian said is served at many, if not all, Greek holidays.\n\n\"My family is Greek and my grandfather and his three children were all chefs,\" Bojekian said. Pastitsio, dubbed the Greek lasagna, is a dish her mom would make nearly every Sunday when their home would be filled with guests. \"It can stand alone with a big salad.\"\n\nBojekian said she would bring it to her kids when they were in college. \"They loved it and shared it with all their friends.\"\n\nThe recipe is her grandfather's, which was handed down to her mom and all her aunts and now her and her kids. The family's recipe calls for ziti, homemade Bolognese sauce, Bechamel, all layered in a pan.\n\nThe dish, she said, \"is awesome.\"\n\nPastitsio\n\nFor Bolognese:\n\n4 tablespoons butter\n\n1 large onion, chopped\n\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n\nSalt and black pepper to taste\n\n2 pounds ground beef (not too lean)\n\n1½ tablespoon cinnamon\n\n1 tablespoon allspice\n\n1 eight-ounce can tomato sauce\n\n1 eight-ounce can tomato paste\n\n2 boxes quality ziti (recipe only uses 1¾ pounds)\n\nGrated Parmesan and/or Pecorino cheese\n\nFor the Béchamel:\n\n4 cups whole milk\n\n5 tablespoons butter\n\n2 tablespoons corn starch diluted in ½ cup water\n\n4 eggs (lightly beaten)\n\n¼ teaspoon nutmeg\n\nThe story continues below the video.\n\nMake the Bolognese: In a large pan, sauté onion in butter on low heat until nearly transparent, add garlic, salt and pepper, beef, cinnamon, allspice, tomato sauce and paste. Turn heat up to medium/high to gently brown. Add ¼ cup of water, lower and simmer about 20 minutes.\n\nCook all pasta in salted water until al dente — a minute or two fewer than the box calls for — rinse in cold water, set aside in colander.\n\nMake béchamel sauce: Add all ingredients into pot on medium-high heat, continually stir with wire whisk, then lower and whisk until smooth and thick bringing to a gentle bubble, until the sauce sticks to back of spoon.\n\nBegin to layer: Spray a 9-inch by 13-inch baking pan with non-stick spray. Place in it half of the cooked ziti, followed by generous amount of grated cheese, all of the Bolognese sauce. Then add more cheese, the rest of the ziti, Bechamel sauce and the remainder of the cheese.\n\nBake at 400 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes until lightly browned. Cover with foil and let cool before cutting.\n\nServes: 15-20.\n\nCelebrity mixologist Carlos Ruiz (he will be concocting drinks at soon-to-open Somos in North Arlington) doesn't just know how to work with liquids; he knows how to work with solids as well.\n\n\"I love to cook,\" said the 26-year-old Morristown resident. Ruiz, who hails from Lima, Peru, has two Thanksgiving dinners: one with his mom and sister on Thanksgiving Eve and another on Thanksgiving Day with his wife's side of the family. \"We go up to Massachusetts and I bring some Peruvian flare to the family,\" said Ruiz, who came to the U.S at age 8.\n\nHe learned how to cook Peruvian food from his uncle, also named Carlos Ruiz, who was a chef at Johnson & Johnson. \"He taught me everything about cooking and flavor combinations,\" Ruiz said. Thanksgiving was at his uncle's house until he passed away.\n\nAmong the Peruvian dishes Ruiz will bring this year to the Thanksgiving table is lomo saltado, a popular stir-fry that combines marinated strips of beef with onions, tomatoes and French fries. It is usually served over rice but, Ruiz said, \"since there are other items being served on Thanksgiving, I like to omit it so people can try more food.\"\n\nLomo saltado\n\nFor the French fries:\n\n2 potatoes peeled\n\n12 cups grapeseed oil\n\nKosher salt\n\nVegetable oil as needed\n\nFor the lomo saltado:\n\n1 pound flank steak cut in strips\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n1 large onion, sliced into strips\n\n3 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, sliced into strips\n\n1 yellow aji amarillo\n\n¼ cup distilled vinegar\n\nSoy sauce to taste\n\n2 tablespoons chopped parsley\n\nThe story continues below the video.\n\nTo make the french fries:\n\nIn a tall 8-quart soup pot, heat the oil over high heat until it reaches 300 F on a deep-fat thermometer. Keep the thermometer attached to the side of the pot at all times. Have a bowl of cold water ready.\n\nScrub the potatoes under cold running water. Cut the potatoes lengthwise into long ½-inch thick batons (sticks). Immediately place them in the bowl of cold water to prevent discoloration.\n\nWhen the oil is at temperature, increase the heat to high. Drain the potatoes well, pat them dry, and carefully drop a third of them into the hot oil. This is the moment when the oil could overflow. If it looks like it might, pull a few potatoes out quickly, using a slotted spoon or tongs, until the oil subsides. Have a baking sheet ready. Keep an eye on the temperature of the oil. It will drop to about 260 F after the potatoes are added. Continue cooking the potatoes without disturbing them until the oil heats back to 300 F, about 5 minutes.\n\nRemove the cooked potatoes carefully with a slotted spoon or tongs. Shake them lightly over the pot to drain excess oil. Place them on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes. Occasionally, between batches, the temperature of the oil can get too high. If that happens, turn off the heat and wait until the oil cools to 300 F before proceeding.\n\nOnce all the potatoes have been fried, fry them all together a second time, this time at 320 F. They will crisp in about 5 minutes. Shake off excess oil, transfer them to a large serving bowl, and sprinkle generously with salt.\n\nWhile french fries are cooking, heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Season the sliced meat with salt and pepper to taste. Fry the meat until just cooked, and the juices begin to release.\n\nRemove the meat from the frying pan, then cook the onions, with additional oil if needed, until they are transparent.\n\nStir in the tomato and aji amarillo; cook until the tomato softens. Pour in the vinegar and soy sauce, add the French fries, cover, and cook until the beef is done, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve.\n\nServes: 2\n\nDanny Chin is a Chinese-American food lover and cook. Come Thanksgiving, the Wayne resident joins his family in Freehold, where he grew up, and cooks for around 20 people. He makes a slew of Chinese dishes, including pan-fried dumplings, which he assures are not difficult to make.\n\nDanny's Pan-Fried Dumplings with 3 Dipping Sauces\n\nFor dumplings:\n\n1 package of Shanghai style dumpling wrappers\n\n¾ pound of ground pork shoulder\n\n1 cup of cabbage\n\n2 scallions\n\n2 water chestnuts (from a can of boiled water chestnuts)\n\n1 tablespoon light soy sauce\n\n1 teaspoon dark soy sauce\n\n1 tablespoon corn starch\n\n1 egg\n\n½ teaspoon chili oil (optional)\n\n½ teaspoon sesame seed oil (optional)\n\n2 tablespoons canola oil\n\n¼ cup of water\n\nFor dipping sauces (3 types):\n\n1 large lime\n\n1 tablespoon hoisin sauce\n\n1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce (or sriracha)\n\n½ cup sweet chili (spring roll) sauce (or duck sauce)\n\nToasted sesame seeds (optional)\n\n¼ scallion\n\n¼ teaspoon sesame seed oil\n\n2 tablespoons light soy sauce\n\nMake the dumplings:\n\nFinely chop pieces of cabbage, scallions, and water chestnuts. Combine with ground pork shoulder in a mixing bowl.\n\nAdd to the mixing bowl light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and optional chili oil if you'd like a bit of heat. Mix to combine, then add enough cornstarch (up to 1 tablespoon) until the mixture resembles the consistency of a meatloaf.\n\nCover your mixing bowl and set in the refrigerator for an hour (overnight is better) Before making the dumplings, mix in sesame seed oil to ensure maximum flavor. Unpackage the Shanghai Style dumpling wrappers and beat an egg in a small bowl. Place ¾ of a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper and egg wash half the wrapper. Then fold over i half and crimp with a fork.\n\nTo make a fancier dumpling, hold the filled dumpling wrapper in you hand a taco. Pinch the bottom corner and feed the front of the wrapper towards the corner and pinch to create pleats.\n\nTo cook dumplings: Add 2 tablespoons canola oil to a 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat\n\nAdd dumplings to the frying pan and be careful not to overcrowd them. Pan-fry over medium-high heat.\n\nWhen the bottoms are a golden brown, add in 1/4 cup of water and cover for 3 minutes allowing the dumpling to steam.\n\nWhen the water is almost evaporated, uncover and toss. The remaining oil in the pan will brown continue to brown the dumplings. Continue pan-frying for 1-2 minutes.\n\nRemove the dumplings from the frying pan and serve hot.\n\nFor dipping sauces:\n\nSweet and Sour Dipping Sauce: Juice ½ a lime and mix with sweet chili sauce (or duck sauce)\n\nSesame Soy Dipping Sauce: Combine light soy, sesame seed oil, finely chopped scallions, and some toasted sesame seeds\n\nSpicy Peking Dipping Sauce: Juice ½ a lime and add hoisin and chili garlic sauce (sriracha can be substituted)\n\nYield: about 32 dumplings (serves 4-6 people)\n\nLaura Kraytem of Emerson recalls the first Thanksgiving she celebrated with her Lebanese-born husband, Awsaf. \"He stuffed the bird with rice,\" she said. \"I never let him do that again.\" Her husband is the family's chef (\"He's a great cook,\" Kraytem declared) — and for Thanksgiving he makes mezze (a bunch of small plates) that includes that Lebanese staple fattoush, a refreshing salad that features toasted or fried pieces of pita.\n\n\"We always have the traditional turkey on the menu, with sometimes not too traditional stuffing,\" said Kraytem, the mother of three and grandmother of one. \"But we like to add Middle Eastern dishes.\"\n\nFattoush\n\n⅓ cup lemon juice\n\n⅔ cup extra virgin olive oil\n\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n\n2 teaspoons sumac powder\n\nSalt to taste\n\nGround black pepper\n\n2 heads romaine lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces\n\n2 large tomatoes, diced\n\n4 green onions, chopped\n\n1 small onion\n\n¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley\n\n¼ cup chopped fresh mint\n\n1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped\n\n1 cup chopped purslane (optional)\n\n4 radishes thinly sliced\n\n4 pita rounds, toasted and torn into pieces\n\nMix in lemon juice, garlic, sumac, salt, and pepper.\n\nToast the pita bread or deep fry until golden brown\n\nIn a large bowl, toss together the lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, green onions, parsley, mint, bell pepper, purslane.\n\nToss with the dressing, and mix in the bread.\n\nSprinkle more sumac on the top before serving.\n\nServes: 6\n\nAngie Sosa came to the United States 18 years ago but that doesn't mean that the mother of one has forgotten her Buenos Aires roots. She frequently makes empanadas, savory Latin American turnovers. \"They're not difficult to make,\" she said, \"if you know how to cook.\"\n\nSosa makes them for Thanksgiving, of course, when up to 10 of her friends along with her 16-year-old son gather at her table. \"You can stuff them with anything -- ham and cheese, chicken, potatoes, beef.\"\n\nEach of her guests brings a dish. And no matter what, empanadas have to make it onto her table. \"Everyone loves the empanadas,\" Sosa said. \"Everyone always says, 'Please make empanadas.'\"\n\nSosa notes that Argentinians tend not to fry the pastries but bake them instead.\n\nBeef Empanadas\n\n1 pound ground beef\n\n1 white onions\n\n1 green pepper\n\n1 fresh tomato\n\n1 tablespoon fresh oregano, finely chopped\n\n1 tablespoon Adobo all-purpose seasoning\n\n1 bunch green onions, finely chopped\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nFor the dough:\n\n3 cups flour\n\n1 egg yolk\n\n½ cup butter\n\n¾ to 1 cup of warm milk\n\nMake the dough:\n\nMix the flour and salt in a food processor, pulse until well combined. Add the butter, blend well. Add the egg yolk and the milk in small amounts, pulse until small dough clumps start to form. Make a couple of balls, flatten into disks and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. On a lightly floured surface roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut out round disc shapes for empanadas (use round molds or a small plate). Use the empanada discs immediately or store in the refrigerator or freezer until ready to use.\n\nMake the beef filling:\n\nCombine the ground beef, oregano, Adobo all purpose seasoning, salt and pepper in a large bowl, mix all the ingredients together and chill until ready to use. Add 5 teaspoons vegetable oil in a large frying pan or sauté pan, add the onions and salt, cook until the onions are soft, about 6-8 minutes. Add the meat mixture to the onions and cook on medium heat until the meat is done, stir frequently. Let the meat mixture cool down, and then mix in the chopped green onions.\n\nTo assemble the empanadas, add a spoonful of the meat mixture on the center of each empanada disc.\n\nBrush the edges of the empanada discs with the egg whites; you can also use water but the egg white is a good natural “glue” that helps seal the empanada.\n\nFold the empanada discs and seal the edges gently with your fingers, twist and fold the edges of the empanadas with your fingers. As a final step use a fork to press down and finish sealing the empanadas.\n\nLightly brush the top of the empanadas with the egg yolk; this will give them a nice golden glow when they bake.\n\nLet the empanadas rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes or until ready to bake.\n\nPre-heat the oven to 400 F and bake for about 20-25 minutes, until golden on top. Serve.\n\nYields: 30 medium/20 large empanadas.\n\nKrakow-born Renata Martin's American in-laws love her pierogies, filled Polish dumplings. \"It's kind of exotic, different,\" said the mother of three who lives in Ridgewood and teaches Polish literature in Mahwah. \"\n\nAnd perfect for Thanksgiving, when, she said, they can be stuffed with turkey.\n\n\"Pierogies are very versatile,\" Martin said. \"You can fill them with pork or veal or beef. I make them with turkey. It makes it more delicate.\"\n\nMartin rotates hosting Thanksgiving with her mother-in-law.\n\nPierogies\n\nFor the dough:\n\n4 cups flour\n\n1 cup water\n\n2 eggs\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\nFor the filling:\n\n1½ cups leftover mashed potatoes, chilled\n\n½ cup cooked turkey meat, shredded or chopped\n\n¼ cup very finely diced or grated onion\n\n3 tablespoons cranberry sauce\n\n1½ cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n\nFor the dipping sauce:\n\n½ cup sour cream\n\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n\n1 teaspoon whole grain mustard\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nButter, for the pan\n\nDried cranberries, for serving\n\nChopped parsley or chives, for serving\n\nMake the dough: Mix the flour, water, egg, and salt together in a bowl until dough forms. Place the dough on a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes.Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover. Let it rest for 30 minutes.\n\nMake the filling: In a bowl, mix together the potatoes, turkey, onion, cranberry sauce, and cheese until combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\nMake the dipping sauce: Whisk together the ingredients and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Set aside until you are ready to serve.\n\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Set up a large skillet and add a couple tablespoons of butter.\n\nDivide the dough ball in half and roll each half out to an ⅛-inch thickness. Using a knife or biscuit cutter, cut the dough into 3-inch circles.\n\nSpoon 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling on each circle and then fold the dough in half, pinching together the edges to seal in the filling. Continue until all the pierogies have been formed.\n\nIn batches, add the pierogies to the boiling water. Cook for 8 minutes. Meanwhile, turn on the heat to medium under the skillet and melt the butter.\n\nRemove the boiled pierogies from the water with a slotted spoon, allowing the excess water to drip off, and then add them to the skillet with the butter. Cook in the butter until crispy and golden, about 2-3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining pierogies.\n\nGarnish with the dried cranberries and herbs.

This year, with COVID-19 most parades across the country have been cancelled. I’m making sure the Sun Bowl Parade tradition continues by sponsoring the first ever Oscar Leeser‘s Hyundai Of El Paso‘s Virtual Parade, so our kids and families will get to enjoy it in safety ... it’s worth every penny.”\n\nLeeser is again seeking the office after choosing not to run for reelection in the previous mayoral election.\n\nOscar Leeser’s Hyundai of El Paso became the title sponsor in 2019 after being the title sponsor of the Sun Bowl football game for 10 years.\n\n“Due to the uncertainty with COVID, we want to give the El Paso community something to look forward to and continue an 84-year-old El Paso tradition,” Sun Bowl Association President Natalia Flores said in the news release. “The parade will go on for all to view in the comfort of their own homes.

There was the Grinch (several of 'em actually), and an appearance from the big man himself, Santa Claus, who was accompanied by Mrs. Claus.\n\nUnlike the tragedy that was last year, when a red SUV driven by Darrell Brooks Jr. killed six people and injured dozens of others. Brooks faced 76 charges, including six for first-degree intentional homicide, and was found guilty of all of them at the end of October.\n\nBut an attack that devastating didn't stop groups — even the ones most severely impacted — from again taking part in this long-standing Waukesha tradition.\n\n'Entire community is not afraid'\n\nThe Catholic Community of Waukesha, candles in hand, and the Waukesha Blazers Baseball Club marched on. Both groups had multiple members among the injured, including baseball player Jackson Sparks, 8, who later died.\n\nThe beloved Milwaukee Dancing Grannies — who lost three dancers and the husband of a fourth — performed. So did the Xtreme Dance Team, whose members were among the most seriously injured.\n\nMirjam Haubert, who walked with Waukesha State Bank this year, recalled watching the 2021 parade unravel with her family. After the SUV plowed through and a young girl from the Xtreme Dance Team was laying in front of her, Haubert's motherly instincts took over.\n\n“She was seizing on the street, so I put her head in my lap,” Haubert said.\n\nHaubert sat with the girl and, with the help of a few others, kept her warm with jackets. When a police officer offered to drive the girl to the hospital, Haubert went along.\n\nAt the hospital, the girl fell into a coma. Around Thanksgiving last year, she woke up, surviving her injuries.\n\n“I don't know what I would have done if she would have not made it,” Haubert said.\n\nHaubert’s teenage daughter, who also attended last year's parade, still dislikes large crowds and decided to not attend this year's. But Haubert felt she had to come and walk with her coworkers.\n\n“I have to force myself to go through this and show that we are not afraid and the entire community is not afraid,” she said.\n\n'GRANNY STRONG!': A year after deadly parade tragedy, 'Dancing Grannies' will march again\n\nOnce again, the Dancing Grannies demonstrated their resilience\n\nA banner with the names of the members they lost, along with large individual portraits of them, led the Dancing Grannies through Sunday's parade route. Those members were Virginia \"Ginny\" Sorenson, Tamara Durand, and Leanna Owen, and the husband of a fourth, William Hospel.\n\nTime and time again over the past year, the treasured troupe — a fixture at Wisconsin parades for nearly 40 years — has demonstrated its resilience.\n\nNearly two weeks after the attack, the group marched in the Franklin Christmas Parade. They walked arm-in-arm, waving at the cheering crowds along the parade route. The names of the members who died were emblazoned on the back of their matching blue sweatshirts.\n\nTheir first performance back was in March for Milwaukee's St. Patrick's Day Parade.\n\nFor a while, member Betty Streng wasn't sure she'd be well enough to perform for St. Patrick's Day. She suffered a skull fracture and brain bleed in the attack and required emergency surgery. She has since fully recovered.\n\nIn November, Streng and her gals gave a special performance at St. Luke's in Milwaukee to honor the medical professionals who saved her life. To honor their fallen, members of the group have been wearing a No. 4 on their matching hats, including the white, fluffy ones they donned Sunday.\n\nWAUKESHA PARADE HEARING: 'I saw pure unrepentant evil': Waukesha parade attack victims share lasting pain at sentencing hearing\n\nA look at this year's parade\n\nNikki Petrie, who walked with Waukesha State Bank this year and last, said that seeing the chairs set up for the parade took her back to what she witnessed in 2021.\n\n“I remember walking back home and seeing all of the blankets, chairs, wagons — everyone just leaving everything behind,” Petrie said. Her decision to walk was made to honor those whose lives were lost.\n\n“I feel like I do, you know, owe it to the lives that were lost,” Petrie said. “I was lucky enough to walk away.”\n\nThe parade — themed \"Peace on Earth\" — began by remembering those who died in last year's tragedy and honoring first responders. A banner read: \"In remembrance of the 2021 parade victims, survivors, families and first responders.\" It was followed by a blue and white memorial float with snowflakes and the words \"In remembrance\" and \"Peace to all.\"\n\nNear the front of the parade, Waukesha Police Chief Daniel Thompson shook hands with parade watchers as Mayor Shawn Reilly waved to participants. The ReMax float, which again featured hot-air balloon flame-makers atop the bed of a pickup truck, was a welcome presence. “I wish they’d stop right here,” said one woman standing on the sidewalk as the warmth of the flames penetrated the crowd.\n\nAs the skies darkened, the parade route brightened with lights from the floats and watchers adorned with lights on the curbs. Parade-goer Kimberly Quartullo wore blue Christmas lights around her neck. Blue lights have become a symbol of strength and unity in the community.\n\nShe set up in front of Mama Ducky’s, just as she has for the past 15 years. Last year, that's where she witnessed members of the Xtreme Dance Team land in front of her. What played out before her was like “a silent movie,” she said.\n\n“Because I am deaf, I did not hear much except for a big boom,” Quartullo said. Her hearing aid helped her hear the SUV’s impact and the screams of the crowd.\n\nShe's attended every Waukesha parade since.\n\n“I came back to this one because, why not keep the community strong?” Quartullo said.\n\nMORE: Darrell Brooks sentenced to life in prison in Wisconsin Christmas parade attack that left 6 dead\n\nChanges to the parade\n\nThe first parade Waukesha held following the tragedy was for Memorial Day.\n\nFor the parade, the city debuted new MVB3X barriers, portable devices capable of disabling vehicles as large as semitrailers from sudden and unauthorized access to key points along the parade route. Public safety vehicles were also used as guards for access points necessary for parade vehicles.\n\nPolice now routinely create a perimeter that is cleared of vehicles ahead of any event. The parade also had a new route.\n\nThis year's Christmas parade was held two weeks later than it had been for nearly 60 years. That way, police and other critical staff were not fighting holiday schedules that could have made an emergency response more difficult.\n\nReflecting on the past, moving forward\n\nLast year, Znidorka, a mentor for Lad Lake, a Wisconsin youth residential care center, brought a 12-year-old boy he mentors to enjoy the parade and help him feel more comfortable in crowds.\n\n“At first, it was really fun,” Znidorka said. “It was a joyous day.”\n\nWhen the SUV came barreling through, he was in shock at first and unable to comprehend what had just happened.\n\n“Right away, the boy I was with, ran to the doors (of Burlap and Lace) and said, ‘Jerry, get in here,’” Znidorka said. “And then we were locked down in the store for 45 minutes to an hour.”\n\nThis year, Znidorka again stood in front of Burlap and Lace. This time, he was by himself. “As you can see, the boy is not with me this year,” he said. “He wanted to hold back this year.”\n\nOver the past year, Znidorka confided in mental health professionals that have helped him prepare for facing the scene of the tragedy again.\n\n“I wanted to not just get past it, but I also want to realize that sort of thing shouldn't stop us,” Znidorka said.\n\nWaukesha Girl Scouts leader Bonnie Stojadinovic had been helping out at United Church of Christ when the troupe was marching in the 2021 parade. After the attack, police sought her help, given her background as a health care provider in the ICU of Children’s Wisconsin.\n\n“They asked me to help triage patients at the scene,” Stojadinovic recalled. “After it was all said and done, I came back, but we were in lockdown in our church. So I received a police escort so that I could go home and change and go into work at the ICU to help care for the kids who were being triaged from the scene that I had taken care of here.”\n\nThis year, she set up a table outside United Church of Christ with one purpose: to call attention to canine officers who were “unsung heroes” in last year’s parade attack.\n\n“(The Girl Scouts) recognized there were so many people who were praising the nurses, paramedics, firefighters and police officers, but nobody mentioned the canine heroes who were at the parade the day of (the attack) and in the days that followed, supporting the community and supporting the kids who had been traumatized,” Stojadinovic said. “So they decided their Silver Award was going to be dedicated to these unsung heroes.”\n\nContributing: Sarah Volpenhein and Sophie Carson, Journal Sentinel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2020/11/09/holiday-events-2020-memphis-germantown-collierville-christmas-parades-events/6160665002/", "title": "Memphis Christmas lights and holiday events to do this 2020 season", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly all public events in 2020, and the holiday offerings will be no different.\n\nHowever, several events are still on tap for the upcoming Yuletide season, with some moving to an online format.\n\nHere is a look at some of the events planned in the Memphis area.\n\nGraceland Holiday Events\n\nThe home of the King kicked off the holiday season on Nov. 19 as Elvis Presley's Graceland hosted its annual Christmas Lighting Ceremony.

(By comparison, 33.8 million tuned in to President Joe Biden’s inauguration).\n\nBut how did America’s favorite sport become so linked to the holiday? CNN spoke with experts to find out.\n\nFootball started out as an amateur sport — played mainly in elite northeastern colleges like Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Columbia, said Matthew Andrews, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe Thanksgiving tradition began back in 1876, when the Intercollegiate Football Association began hosting their championship game on the holiday. But the tradition didn’t begin to pick up steam until 1880, Andrews said, when the association moved the end-of-season game to New York.\n\nIt’s this game, Andrews said, that took football from a sporting event to a social one.\n\n“This game was sort of the unofficial start of the winter holiday social season,” he said. “People from the different colleges and universities would flood New York City, and there would be pregame Wednesday night dinners and Friday and Saturday night there would be post-game balls and trips to the theater. And that’s when it really takes off, in the 1880s and the 1890s.”\n\nAnd so, by the mid-1890s, college football and Thanksgiving day were synonymous.\n\nNot everyone approved of the new tradition\n\nThanksgiving didn’t really become an annually celebrated holiday until 1863, when Abraham Lincoln encouraged its recognition as a way to promote unionism during the Civil War, Andrews said. The rise of Thanksgiving, then, is almost congruent with the rise of football: the holiday helped fuel the popularity of the sport, Andrews said, and in turn football made Thanksgiving a little more secular and more widely appealing.\n\nA wood engraving from \"Once a Week\" magazine shows the onfield action during a football match between Yale and Princeton, in the late 19th century. Stock Montage/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nAnd their alliance makes sense, Andrews said. Professional football didn’t exist yet, so the sport was intrinsically tied to communities at the high school and college level, which can foster fierce loyalties. School colors are often linked to football teams, and landmark events like homecoming are typically tied to a football game.\n\n“Football is the sport around which communities revolve,” Andrew said. “This holiday in which we’re celebrating community, I think it makes sense that football would seamlessly fit into that culture.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean everyone celebrated the shift.\n\nIn 1893, the New York Herald condemned the rise of football on Thanksgiving, arguing that the sport was ruining the holiday.\n\n“Thanksgiving is no longer a solemn festival to God for mercies given,” the paper printed. “It is a holiday granted to the state and nation to see a game of football.”\n\nNFL teams began playing on Thanksgiving to increase their popularity\n\nAt that point, football was still an amateur sport. When the NFL was founded in 1920, no one was really interested in professional football, Andrews said.\n\nSo, the league started scheduling games on Thanksgiving — drawing on pre-existing traditions to help establish the league into American consciousness. In the first decade, the NFL would schedule as many as six games on Thanksgiving, a far cry from the three games they schedule now. It was all an attempt to bring interest and notability to the sport, Andrews said.\n\nA Detroit Lions football team photo from circa 1934. That year, the Lions began their annual Thanksgiving game tradition, which has continued to this day. Sports Studio Photos/Getty Images\n\n“Of course they played on Thanksgiving, because by 1920 Thanksgiving meant football and football meant Thanksgiving,” Andrews said. “The NFL would’ve been missing a critical opportunity to popularize the game if they had not played on Thanksgiving day. It almost would’ve been un-American.”\n\nAnd the strategy worked. The Detroit Lions, who play every year on Thanksgiving, first began that tradition in 1934 — done in an effort to increase their brand and put fans in the stands.\n\nStill, professional football hadn’t really exploded in popularity just yet. Baseball was still the most popular sport in the US. But by the 1960s, that had begun to shift, Andrews said.\n\nIt’s during that shift that the Dallas Cowboys, who also play every year on the holiday, started their Thanksgiving tradition. At the time, the Cowboys were a new team looking to build their brand and their fanbase. So in 1966, they began to host a Thanksgiving game, Andrews said, bringing instant exposure to the team.\n\nBy the 1970s, the Cowboys were the most famous football team in the US, and Thanksgiving and professional football were intrinsically linked. And still, per tradition, the Lions and the Cowboys continue to play every year on the holiday.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' Bob Hayes, pictured in action against the Washington Commanders in Dallas on December 11, 1996. James Drake/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images\n\nBut eventually, other teams complained, arguing that they didn’t “get a piece of that Thanksgiving pie,” Andrews said. As a result, in 2006, the NFL added a third Thanksgiving game to the lineup, featuring rotating teams.\n\nAnd these Thanksgiving games are important to fans. In 2021, the Thanksgiving matchup between the Raiders and the Cowboys was the fourth most-watched telecast of the year, behind the Super Bowl and the AFC and NFC Championships. Aside from the presidential inauguration, the top-10 most watched telecasts that year were all NFL games. That dominance continued in 2022, according to Statista, when the eight of the top 10 most-watched telecasts were NFL games, including a Thanksgiving game.\n\n“Right or wrong, football is a religion in this country,” Andrews said. “And so football on Thanksgiving is sacred.”", "authors": ["Leah Asmelash"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/11/22/lions-cowboys-thanksgiving-football-history-records-ratings/71660938007/", "title": "Lions or Cowboys: Who has the more storied Thanksgiving history?", "text": "Thanksgiving Day is all about football. What? You thought it was about family, sharing, and being thankful for the life you have? Incorrect. The truth of the matter is that football was the only reason those pilgrims and Native Americans shared that feast. They knew that nothing was more important than letting their ancestors watch Derrick Henry stiff arm Earl Thomas into oblivion.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions have kept that tradition alive by offering to play on Thanksgiving every year until the end of time. The tradition started in 1934 when the Lions played the world champion Chicago Bears in an instant classic that ended with the Bears winning 19-16. Since 1945, the Lions have not missed a single holiday (no Thanksgiving games were played from 1941-1944).\n\nThe Cowboys joined the Lions later, in 1966. They have since missed two Thanksgivings, in 1975 and 1977. While the Lions may have started this tradition, their consistently disappointing performances and failure to win a Super Bowl has forced many fans to lean in favor of the Cowboys every Turkey Day. So, who actually owns Thanksgiving? The Detroit Lions or the Dallas Cowboys?\n\nBeast mode:NFL Pick 6 record: Cowboys' DaRon Bland ties mark, nears NFL history\n\nRecords on Thanksgiving\n\nWhile the Lions have played the most Thanksgiving Day games of any NFL team (89), they haven't been immune to controversy in that time. Most notably, many NFL fans wanted the Lions removed from Thanksgiving primetime in 2008. The Lions were 0-11 at the time, and were trounced by the Tennessee Titans that year 47-10. Obviously, the NFL decided to let Detroit keep their Turkey Day tradition.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe Lions have a record of 37-44-2 on Thanksgiving. Since 2000 though, the Lions are an abysmal 6-17 on Thanksgiving. Currently, the Lions have lost six straight, most recently a 28-25 loss to the Buffalo Bills in 2022.\n\nThe Cowboys on the other hand, have a record of 32-22-1 on Thanksgiving. While they have lost three of their last four Thanksgiving Day contests, they've proven much more capable of living up to the Turkey Day privilege than Detroit in recent years.\n\nDallas Cowboys Thanksgiving Record: 32-22-1\n\n32-22-1 Cowboys Record in Last 5 Thanksgivings: 2-3\n\n2-3 Detroit Lions Thanksgiving Record: 37-44-2\n\n37-44-2 Lions Record in Last 5 Thanksgivings: 0-5\n\nThat could change this season though. The Lions currently hold the second-best record in the NFL and their matchup is against the Green Bay Packers, a team they've already beaten this year. The Cowboys get a matchup against divisional adversary, the Washington Commanders. The Commanders dominated the Cowboys on Thanksgiving in 2020 to the tune of a 41-16 beatdown led by halfback Antonio Gibson. That said, things have changed since then. The Cowboys are much improved, while the Commanders just lost to the woeful New York Giants.\n\nWhich team gets more viewers:\n\nThanksgiving Day games are often some of the most-watched NFL games every season. Last year was no different. In fact, the 2022 game between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants set an NFL regular season viewership record with 42.1 million viewers tuning in, beating out the previous NFL record-holder, a 1990 matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants. It goes without saying that it was also the most viewed Thanksgiving Day game of all-time, beating out the Cowboys 2021 game against the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nFor comparison, the 2022 Lions-Bills Thanksgiving Day game earned 31.78 million viewers. That's still a lot. In fact, it was the most-watched early Thanksgiving Day game of all-time.\n\nWith that in mind, there's an argument to be made that the Lions would have earned more viewers if they were given the afternoon or evening time slot. At the same time though, the NFL knows which games will garner the most viewers and tend to flex the best in the best time slots. If the Lions would draw more viewers, they likely would have been given the afternoon slot.\n\nWith all that said, it's pretty easy to tell which team gets more viewers. The Cowboys are \"America's Team\" after all, while the Lions had many fans begging the NFL to remove them from the Thanksgiving slot because of how bad they had been for most of the 2000's.\n\nThanksgiving Day Odds:\n\nThe Lions and Cowboys are favorites to defeat the Packers and Commanders, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.

The Lions have already beaten the Packers handedly this season, 38-20. Now get to face them at home. The Packers will likely be without both star running back Aaron Jones and star cornerback Jaire Alexander as well.\n\nAs bad as the Lions have been on Thanksgiving, the Packers haven't been much better, boasting just a 14-20-2 record all-time. Give me the Lions (-7.5) all day.\n\nPrediction: Lions 29, Packers 16\n\nWashington Commanders @ Dallas Cowboys:\n\nThe Commanders are one of the toughest teams to predict in all of football. Their 4-7 record would have you thinking they're a middle-of-the-road, maybe even low-tier team. However, they were also very close to defeating the Philadelphia Eagles, forcing the reigning NFC champs to overtime in Week 4. Washington always seems to play to their level of competition, and while that doesn't mean they will beat the Cowboys, they will probably keep it close.\n\nThe Commanders are a dreadful 4-8 all-time on Thanksgiving. That's the second-worst record of any team with at least ten Thanksgiving Day games played. Only the Arizona Cardinals (6-15-2) are worse. That said, I like the Commanders to keep this one a one-possession game. Divisional games are always tougher than the rest because each team knows the other so well.\n\nPrediction: Cowboys 31, Commanders 24\n\nNFL Week 12 schedule:What to know about betting odds, early lines, byes\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Before that, and dating back 100 years for Passaic and a bit less for Clifton, the teams each faced a number of worthy opponents.\n\nPassaic's Indians took the field for the first time on Thanksgiving Day in 1915 against Rutherford.\n\nClifton's Mustangs played their first game in 1927 against Garfield.\n\nIt was the tradition to watch or play in the game, then walk home and enjoy the Thanksgiving feast.\n\nOn Thursday the two teams will come together at Clifton Stadium one last time. They haven't missed a battle against each other since 1992. The current players and officials said the end of the tradition is bittersweet.\n\nOn Tuesday, players from both teams gathered for the annual Sportsmanship Breakfast in Clifton. It's traditionally hosted by the home team to encourage good sportsmanship between the neighboring lower Passaic County cities.\n\n\"This is a big deal,\" Clifton Athletic Director Tom Mullahey told players. \"This is the end of an era. This is a piece of history.\"\n\nPassaic tackle Kevin Bovier said he hates to see the tradition come to an end. \"Not only does it mean something to us, but to our city as well.\"\n\n\"Nobody works that day,\" Bovier said. \"A lot of my family members come up that day.\"\n\nClifton players, who lost to Union last weekend in the sectional finals, were more reserved about the end of the tradition.\n\nStill, senior Clifton Mustangs Eddie Maldonado III, Bob Urban and Chris Boneparte said they look forward to taking part in the final Thanksgiving Day game.\n\n\"I've been playing with some of these guys since I was 6 years old,\" Maldonado said.\n\nFrom a coaching and an athletic director's perspective, scrapping the Thanksgiving games made the most sense.\n\nPassaic finished its season on Nov. 7. The players would have been able to move on to their winter sports teams if it weren't for this final game, said Clifton coach Ralph Cinque. Instead, they have practiced just to play against Clifton. That's an inordinate amount of time between games, especially because tryouts for track, basketball and wrestling started on Monday, he said.\n\n\"It's unfair to the kids,\" Cinque said.\n\nPassaic coach William Widener said his team ended the season 6-3. If the team had played Clifton earlier, he said, the power points earned would have pushed his team into the playoffs. Clifton was a top-ranked team this year, and just playing it would have earned Passaic extra points.\n\nAs for Clifton, this is the first time since 2006 that the team reached the sectional finals. Clifton won the championship in 2006.\n\nThe fans\n\nThose who attended and looked forward to the rivalry game between the cities will be the most unhappy.\n\nPassaic's Ron Smith has been to every one of the city team's Thanksgiving Day games since 1962. He said he is very disappointed to see such a longstanding tradition end.\n\n\"It is ridiculous,\" Smith said. \"It is ending because the state wants it to.\"\n\nSmith is referring to the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, which regulates state high school athletics. The association has not stopped the teams from playing, but some officials feel the playoff schedule makes the holiday game impractical.\n\nIn North Jersey, there are still two Thanksgiving games played — Teaneck-Hackensack and Dumont-Tenafly. The Thanksgiving Day game between Paterson's Kennedy and Eastside high schools was switched to Thanksgiving eve as of last year.\n\nStill, it's a long way from 30 years ago, when Thanksgiving Day high school football was the norm. In the 1980s and 1990s, the football season started later in the school year, so Thanksgiving was still part of the season, rather than postseason. Seasons that once started in mid-September now have games in late August.\n\nStory continues below the gallery.\n\nClifton's Keith Oakley is also distressed about the end of the tradition.\n\n\"Everyone's disappointed by this,\" Oakley said.\n\nJust as family members gathered around the dinner table on Thanksgiving, the day was a great time to catch up with old mates, Oakley said.\n\nThe trend to do away with the holiday games has also been seen in Central and South Jersey, although it is not as prevalent as in North Jersey.\n\nClifton versus Passaic\n\nPassaic's Thanksgiving Day game predates the Macy's parade. In 1915, Passaic played Rutherford in its first Thanksgiving game. The Macy's parade marched in Manhattan for the first time in 1924, and three years later, Clifton played its first holiday game against Garfield.\n\nClifton and Passaic have matched up 90 times, with 32 played on Thanksgiving. Clifton won 48 games and Passaic 37. They tied five times.\n\nWhile Clifton holds a quantitative advantage, some argue that Passaic holds the qualitative one.\n\nPassaic boasted both legendary teams and players. The city has had 14 players who made it to the NFL, according to bergenpassaicfootball.com.\n\nSome remember watching the Indians play on Thanksgiving morning and NFL greats Craig \"Ironhead\" Heyward and Jack Tatum later in the afternoon.\n\nStory continues below the gallery.\n\nCity Historian Mark Auerbach said Tatum, also known as \"the Assassin,\" was among the best ever to play in the NFL. He played for Passaic High School, then Ohio State, and was in the NFL from 1971-1980.\n\nPassaic Thanksgiving game fans witnessed some great football in 1981, '82 and '83, as the team won every game except two in 1982. They lost that year to Belleville and Montclair. They won three sectional championships, according to bergenpassaicfootball.com. During those championship years, Passaic was helped by RB Craig \"Ironhead\" Heyward and LB Tyronne Stowe. They eventually went on to have long NFL careers.\n\nAuerbach said the 1936 Turkey Bowl game may have been the greatest ever: the year of the 45-yard drop kick by Augie Lio, which won the game 3-0.\n\nLio went on to play at Georgetown and then in the NFL for seven seasons. He eventually became the sports editor and columnist for the Herald News.\n\nClifton football produced 13-year NFL veteran David Szott as well as Bob Holly and Larry Mialik. Clifton won section titles from 1951 through 1953 and from 1957 through 1959, and took back-to-back titles in 1968 and 1969 and in 1972 and 1973.\n\nThe last Thanksgiving Day game appears to be promising. A rising Passaic team faces Clifton, which was just eliminated from the playoffs. Both sides want to win.\n\nThe winning team is sure to make history as the last to win the Clifton-Passaic Turkey Bowl.\n\nBoneparte said if you are going to play, then play to win. \"Why not come away with a big W?\" he asked.\n\nNote: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of years since Clifton had reached sectional finals. Clifton last won the championship in their section in 2006.\n\nMatt Fagan is a reporter for NorthJersey.com.

Smith had 180 passing yards, no touchdowns and one interception. The Seahawks’ lone touchdown came on defense.\n\nSeahawks: The Seahawks are 1-3 in the NFC West.

Seattle had a chance to add a field goal at the end of the second quarter, but Jason Myers’ 53-yard field goal was wide right. Myers’ miss was a microcosm of Seattle’s terrible first half.\n\nThe Seahawks' Stone Forsythe was penalized for unnecessary roughness on the missed field goal attempt after flipping the 49ers' Javon Kinlaw and slamming him into the ground, inciting a brief on-field scuffle. — Tyler Dragon\n\n49ers recover DeeJay Dallas' muffed punt\n\nIt went from bad to worse in Seattle.\n\nJust when the Seahawks defense was feeling good about themselves after a stop, Seattle punt returner DeeJay Dallas muffed a punt, and it was recovered by the 49ers’ Ronnie Bell at the Seahawks’ 22-yard line.\n\nThe turnover was Seattle’s second of the half.\n\nThe 49ers offense didn’t get a first down after the muffed punt, but they did connect on a 32-yard field goal to add three points to their lead.

He completed 22-of-32 passes, resulting in a 142.1 passer rating. Ten different Cowboys players had at least one reception.\n\nDaRon Bland makes history: Bland set an NFL record with his fifth pick-six of the season.

They were completely overmatched against the Cowboys defense. Wide receiver Curtis Samuel had nine catches for 100 receiving yards, but he was the lone bright spot on Washington’s offense.\n\nCommanders QB Sam Howell was up and down throwing the football. He had several inaccurate throws. He finished 28-of-44 passing for 300 yards. He was sacked four times.\n\nCommanders' coaching staff: The blowout loss felt more and more like the Ron Rivera and the Commanders coaching staff are on borrowed time. Rivera is rumored to be on the hot seat this year.\n\nThe loss dropped the Commanders to 3-8 on the season. Washington’s lost three straight games and they are 0-5 in the NFC East. — Tyler Dragon\n\nDallas Cowboys defender DaRon Bland lassoed in his fifth pick-six on Thanksgiving, and he is now the NFL record holder for most pick-sixes in a season.\n\nWith the Cowboys already headed toward a Thursday win over the Washington Commanders, Bland capped off the victory by picking off Sam Howell with less than five minutes left and returned it 63-yards into the end zone. — Victoria Hernandez and Jordan Mendoza\n\n49ers vs. Seahawks inactives: Geno Smith is active\n\nSeahawks quarterback Geno Smith, who hurt his elbow in last week's loss to the Los Angeles Rams, is active for his team's Thanksgiving Day game against the 49ers.

Dak Prescott tossed another touchdown, finding KaVontae Turpin for a 34-yard touchdown pass to extend the lead.\n\nLike how former Cowboy Ezekiel Elliot did years before, Turpin celebrated by jumping in the famous Salvation Army bucket on the field, as Dallas heads toward its eighth win of the season.\n\n7:13 p.m.: Fourth down stop leads to Cowboys score. The Dallas defense is flexing its muscle, as a stop led to another score.\n\nWith little time left, Washington opted to go for it on fourth down on its own 34-yard line, needing just a yard. The Commanders went for the pass, but the Cowboys defensive line rushed and got to Sam Howell for a 10-yard sack to give the offense great field position.\n\nDak Prescott and company made the most of it, as three plays later, he found CeeDee Lamb in the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown pass, the third scoring toss of the day. The two-point conversion was good, and the Cowboys have all but wrapped up another Thanksgiving victory, leading 31-10 with 10 minutes to go.\n\n7:06 p.m.: Cowboys up 23-10 after successful field goal. Kicker Brandon Aubrey converted a 52-yard field goal to give Dallas a 23-10 advantage with 13:36 remaining in the final quarter.\n\nDak Prescott had a long 25-yard completion to Brandin Cooks and another 14-yard pass to CeeDee Lamb to get the Cowboys in scoring possession.\n\nCooks has a team-best 64 receiving yards.\n\nAubrey’s made all 22 of his field goal attempts this year.\n\n7:00 p.m.: Dallas holds 10-point lead heading into fourth quarter.

They’ve picked up 42 yards on their current drive, and will start the fourth quarter at the Washington 41-yard line.\n\n6:39 p.m.: Dallas defense stops Washington on fourth down. Down by 10, Washington had a chance to make it a one score game in the third quarter, but the Dallas defense stood tall to get the ball back to its offense.\n\nThe Commanders got into Dallas territory after starting inside their own 10-yard line, but faced a third-and-one at the 39-yard line. Sam Howell went for a deep ball but Stephon Gilmore was able to break up a pass to Terry McLaurlin to force a fourth down. The Washington offense stayed on the field, and the lauded Cowboys defensive line didn’t even let Brian Robinson Jr. get to the line of scrimmage, forcing a turnover on downs.\n\nIt was the third time Washington got into Dallas’ side of the field and didn’t come up with points.\n\n6:09 p.m.: Cowboys 20, Commanders 10 at halftime. The Dallas offense has picked up steam as they take a 10-point lead into halftime. Washington has dominated time of possession as it held the ball for 18 of the first 30 minutes, but Dallas has marched right down the field on its three touchdown drives, with the last one taking only 85 seconds. Dak Prescott has been stellar so far, continuing to make a case for the MVP award with 221 yards and two touchdown passes on 13-for-18 throwing. Tony Pollard also got back into the endzone on a rushing score, with 34 yards on six carries. Despite the firepower Dallas has shown in the game, Washington is hanging around, thanks to a solid first half from quarterback Sam Howell. He is 16-for-23 with 170 yards and a rushing score. Dallas had led at halftime in nine of its 11 games this season and is 7-1 when heading into the locker room with the lead. The lone loss came against the Eagles in Week 9.\n\n5:57 p.m.: Cowboys extend lead late in first half. The Cowboys didn’t need a full two minutes during their two-minute drill. Dallas got the ball on its own 24-yard line with 1:51 left in the second quarter, and only needed five plays to get into the end zone. The Cowboys had a dose of luck on their way to paydirt. Dak Prescott had a deep pass deflected, and the football fell into the hands of Jalen Brooks for a 24-yard gain. A few plays later, the Cowboys scored on a 7-yard run by running back Tony Pollard. Pollard’s score gave Dallas a 20-10 advantage. Cowboys kicker Brandon Aubrey missed the extra point.\n\n5:50 p.m. Commanders score touchdown late in second quarter. The Commanders pulled within four after scores on back-to-back possessions. Washington went on a 13-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that was capped off by a Sam Howell one-yard touchdown run. Howell’s touchdown made the score 14-10 Cowboys with under two minutes remaining in the first half. Commanders wide receiver Curtis Samuel had a couple catches during Washington’s touchdown drive. Samuel now has five catches and 65 yards in the game to lead the Commanders. Howell is 15-for-21 passing for 159 yards.\n\n5:35 p.m. Cowboys strengthen lead: The Cowboys offense has found its rhythm. After a 90-yard touchdown on the second drive of the game, Dallas added another touchdown on a 75-yard drive to make it 14-3. It was a quick, six-play drive with Dak Prescott accounting for 73 of the yards on the drive, 10 of which came with his legs. Prescott capped the drive by finding Brandin Cooks for a 31-yard touchdown pass.\n\nPrescott is clicking on all cylinders in the first half, as he is 10-for-14 with 158 yards and two touchdowns going into the midway point of the second quarter.\n\n5:30 p.m.: Commanders connect on field goal in second quarter. The Commanders finally got on the board. After punts on their first two drives, the Commanders went on a nine-play, 50-yard drive that ended in a 43-yard field goal by kicker Joey Slye with 11:27 to go in the second quarter. Commanders quarterback Sam Howell threw a deep 30-yard pass to wide receiver Curtis Samuel to get into field goal range. The field goal cut Washington’s deficit to 7-3.\n\n5:15 p.m.: Cowboys go right down the field for first score: After forcing Washington to punt inside Dallas territory again, the Cowboys offense put up an impressive 90-yard drive for the first touchdown of the game and take the early lead. Starting at the 10-yard line, Dak Prescott got Dallas out of its own endzone with a precise 35-yard pass to Jake Ferguson. Despite penalties backing them up, the passing and ground attack from Tony Pollard led Dallas into Washington territory. The drive was capped off on a screen pass from Prescott to Rico Dowdle for a 15-yard score. Prescott delivered another impressive performance on the drive, going 5-for-7 with 82 yards and the passing touchdown on the 11-play, five minute drive.\n\n4:51 p.m. Both teams punt on their first possessions. Washington got going quickly with Brian Robinson Jr. picking up 28 yards on the first three plays of the game, but the drive stalled after Sam Howell took a sack in Dallas territory. The Cowboys did the same thing, picking up yards and moving the ball on their opening drive, but back-to-back overthrown passes from Dak Prescott stalled the drive. Star wideout CeeDee Lamb was open for what looked to be a sure touchdown, but Prescott missed him by a few yards.\n\nMove over Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, Dolly Parton is here.\n\nThe country music icon and Tennessee native performed during the halftime show for the Thanksgiving Day game between the Cowboys and Washington Commanders on Thursday. Parton was dressed in an iconic Cowboys cheerleader uniform, complete with a star-studded white vest, white short shorts and a star belly button embellishment. — Cydney Henderson\n\nLions vs. Packers winners and losers\n\nWINNERS\n\nPackers backups: Green Bay was significantly undermanned, missing key players on both sides of the ball: cornerback Jaire Alexander, linebacker De’Vondre Campbell and safety Rudy Ford on defense and running back Aaron Jones on offense. In their place, players like Anthony Johnson, AJ Dillon and Carrington Valentine stepped in just fine.\n\nRashan Gary: The Green Bay linebacker recorded three sacks on Jared Goff, two of which resulted in forced fumbles. One of those fumbles was recovered by safety Jonathan Owens and returned for a touchdown. Gary also recovered a fumble of his own.\n\nChristian Watson: The Packers have been looking for a top receiver to emerge and Watson, 24, has been the most likely candidate. Watson had his best game of the season, being a steady option for Jordan Love in both the deep and intermediate passing game. He finished with five catches on seven targets for 94 yards and one touchdown.\n\nLOSERS\n\nDan Campbell: His decision to go for a fake punt deep in Detroit’s own territory late in the third quarter proved to be rather costly. At the time, the Lions were down nine points and the failed attempt gave Green Bay the ball at the Detroit 23. Three plays later, the Packers scored another touchdown. The Lions ended up 1-for-5 on fourth down attempts.\n\nDetroit pass pro: The Lions are known for having a very good offensive line, but Jared Goff was under constant pressure Thursday, and it wasn’t just Rashan Gary. The Lions allowed 12 quarterback hits and Goff could never get comfortable in the timing and rhythm of Detroit’s offense. Goff lost three fumbles on the day.\n\nMORE:Catching up with Lions great Calvin Johnson, who has five tips for raising young athletes\n\nLions vs. Packers highlights\n\n(All times are Eastern)\n\n3:40 p.m. END OF GAME: Detroit did score a final late touchdown — a 12-yard pass to receiver Josh Reynolds — and converted the two-point try to make it a one-score game, but Green Bay recovered the onside kick to all but end the game.\n\nThe Packers won 29-22 to improve to 5-6. The Lions dropped to 8-3.\n\n3:16 p.m.: Playing with a little more urgency, the Lions opted to go no huddle midway through the fourth quarter. They had some success, moving the ball, but their execution stalled deep in Packers territory. Detroit was forced to go for it on fourth-and-7 from the Green Bay 12, but Jared Goff's pass to the right side of the end zone fell incomplete. That marked the third consecutive failed fourth down try for Detroit, which is now 0-for-4 on the day.\n\n2:57 p.m. END OF THIRD QUARTER: The Lions are running out of time, as the third quarter ended with Detroit unable to overcome its failed fake punt and still facing a 15-point deficit.\n\n2:48 p.m.: Both teams appeared as if they would be trading punts, but Lions coach Dan Campbell opted to call a fake punt on a fourth-and-4 from deep in their own territory. The attempt wasn't even close, giving the Packers the ball at the Detroit 23-yard line.\n\nIt would prove to be very costly; three plays later, on a third-and-3, Jordan Love found receiver Christian Watson for a beautiful connection in the corner of the end zone. The Packers went for a two-point conversion, attempting a trick play, but. itwas stuffed.\n\nGreen Bay took a 29-14 lead.\n\n2:31 p.m.: Detroit came out of the half with a lot more intention and pace, ripping through the Packer defense.\n\nIt started with the first offensive play of the half, a toss left to Lions rookie running back Jahmyr Gibbs, who slipped past Green Bay defenders for a 23-yard gain. On the next play, quarterback Jared Goff found receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for 28 yards, putting Detroit just outside of the red zone.\n\nRunning back David Montgomery finished. the drive, scoring on a six-yard touchdown rush and then finding the end zone again on a two-point conversion. The Lions closed the margin, 23-14, on the seven-play, 72-yard drive.\n\n2:05 p.m.: The first half ends with the Lions struggling to execute their offense with precision. Green Bay takes a 17-point lead into intermission and is outgaining Detroit by a margin of 247-146.\n\nThe Packers have recorded 13 first downs compared to Detroit's eight. Packers quarterback Jordan Love is 15-of-20 for 189 yards with a pair of touchdowns, while Lions quarterback Jared Goff is 8-of-16 for 100 yards with one touchdown, but two fumbles lost.\n\n2:02 p.m.: The Packers attempted a 63-yard field goal at the end of the first half, but Anders Carlson's try was well short. Lions receiver Kalif Raymond fielded the attempt and tried to make magic happen, but he was eventually brought down after a 50-yard return.\n\n1:53 p.m.: Green Bay's impressive first half rolls on. With the Lions mounting a small drive, the Packers held Detroit on third down, setting up a fourth-and-4. But with the Lions down 17 and Detroit at the far end of field goal range, coach Dan Campbell opted to go for it on fourth down.\n\nGreen Bay's pass rush — which has been a factor all game — pressured Goff and hit him just as he was about to attempt a pass, turning the ball over on downs.\n\n1:40 p.m.: The Lions have now stopped the Packers twice in a row, as this game has settled some. Green Bay did march into Detroit territory, but Jordan Love's pass attempt to receiver Christian Watson sailed incomplete at Watson and a Lions defensive back got tangled up. Officials ruled that the contact was incidental.\n\nPackers place kicker Anders Carlson connected on a 43-yard field goal to give Green Bay a 23-6 lead.\n\n1:26 p.m.: The aggressive Packers opted to go for it on fourth down, but there was some miscommunication between quarterback Jordan Love and running back AJ Dillon, who appeared to go the wrong way when trying to receive a handoff. The Lions stuffed it and Green Bay turned the ball over on downs.\n\n1:18 p.m.: A wild first quarter ended with the Packers holding a 14-point lead and facing a fourth-and-1 deep in Detroit territory.\n\n1:15 p.m.: Green Bay is on an absolute tear. On Detroit's possession following the scoop-and-score, the Packers stripped the ball out of Jared Goff's hand once again. This time it came on a third-and-5, as Goff tried to scramble for more yards. Packers defensive end Karl Brooks was credited with the forced fumble and the recovery.\n\nGreen Bay got possession from the Detroit 23-yard line.\n\n1:10 p.m.: Even when there's defense in this game, there's scoring, too. Facing a second-and-long, Lions quarterback Jared Goff dropped back to pass and climbed into the pocket before Packers linebacker Rashan Gary dislodged the ball out of Goff's hand. Green Bay safety Jonathan Owens alertly scooped the ball and returned it for a 27-yard touchdown.\n\nThe play was reviewed and appeared to be close, as Goff was just about to start his throwing motion, though his hand was empty as it started to move forward. The ruling stood, though the Packers missed the extra point attempt to give them a 14-point lead, 20-6\n\n1:03 p.m.: Fans of defensive play won't be pleased with this start. Both offenses are getting whatever they want, as the Packers again rolled down the field for another touchdown drive. Green Bay converted a pair of third downs, including one on the final play of the series, a nine-yard touchdown grab on a play-action rollout to tight end Tucker Kraft.\n\nJordan Love is now 8-of-9 for 124 yards and two touchdowns and a perfect 158.3 QB rating. Green Bay has 150 yards of offense, eight first downs and a 14-6 lead.\n\n12:51 p.m.: Not to be outdone, the Lions answered Green Bay's impressive opening drive with one of their own. Quarterback Jared Goff completed a couple of key passes early in the series — an 11-yard third-down crossing route to receiver Jameson Williams and a 31-yarder to tight end Sam LaPorta.\n\nOnce Detroit got into a goal-to-go scenario, Goff found LaPorta for a seven-yard score. Kicker Riley Patterson's extra point attempt sailed right, putting Detroit in a one-point hole, 7-6.\n\n12:40 p.m.: The Packers came out swinging. Winners of the coin toss, Green Bay elected to receive the ball and proceeded to march down the field in a five-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 10-yard touchdown pass to receiver Jayden Reed. The play that opened up the series was a 53-yard deep ball to receiver Christian Watson.\n\nThe point after touchdown was converted to give the Packers a 7-0 lead.\n\n12:23 p.m.: All teams playing in Thursday's Thanksgiving games are honoring late NFL coaching legend John Madden with a circular patch on their jerseys.\n\nMadden died December 2021 but was a prominent presence during the FOX broadcast of Thanksgiving games, alongside long-time play-by-play partner Pat Summerall.\n\nA commemorative Madden coin is also being used in all three games for the coin toss; the heads side features a silhouette of Madden's face and the tails side features an image of a six-legged turducken.\n\nNoon: The Packers will be without some stars on the offensive and defensive sides of the ball: Running back Aaron Jones is out with an MCL sprain, while cornerback Jaire Alexander will miss the matchup with a shoulder injury.\n\n11:52 a.m.: With just over a half hour until kickoff, there are no real surprises on the Lions inactive list.\n\nOlympic gold medal gymnast Simone Biles was certainly in the holiday spirit watching her husband, Packers safety Jonathan Owens, play against the Lions on Thanksgiving in Detroit.

Packers-Lions is the NFL's second-most played rivalry; Packers-Bears is the most-played (207 meetings, including playoffs). So, it should come as no surprise to learn that the Lions have met the Packers the most of any team on Thanksgiving (22 times, counting this Thanksgiving).\n\nThe Lions have prevailed in the majority of those matchups, too, owning a 12-8-1 record against the Packers on the holiday. The most famous of those wins came in 1962, which is a season Detroit fans have become familiar with over the last week. The Lions currently own an 8-2 record, the team's best start since that 1962 season.\n\nAfter opening the 1962 season 8-2, the Lions hosted the defending NFL champion Green Bay Packers at Tiger Stadium in what might be Detroit's most famous win on Thanksgiving. The Packers of 1962 were at the height of their power under the guidance of legendary coach Vince Lombardi. After steamrolling the New York Giants, 37-0, in the 1961 NFL title game, the Packers were a tour de force in 1962 en route to a title repeat. The Packers went 13-1 that season before defeating the Giants again in the championship game. That one blemish? It came against the Lions on Thanksgiving Day … and the game wasn't even close. The Lions stormed out to a 26-0 lead before the Packers scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns to make the final 26-14 tally look closer than the actual game. It was a particularly rough game for Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr, who threw two interceptions and was sacked 10 or 11 times (depending on the source; sacks didn't become an official statistic until 1982).\n\nThe 1962 Lions managed to get to 11-2 before losing the regular-season finale against the Chicago Bears, finishing second to the Packers in the NFL's West Division. — Jim Reineking\n\nThe NFL on Thanksgiving Day has featured some memorable moments, from Clint Longley leading a Cowboys comeback in 1974 and a national TV showcase for the incomparable Barry Sanders to the infamous Butt Fumble in 2012 and Leon Lett's blunder in 1993.\n\nNFL games on Thanksgiving have been a tradition since the league's inception in 1920 (there were six games that first season!). — Jim Reineking\n\nFour of the top six seeds in the NFC (if the season ended before the Thanksgiving Day games) are in action on Thursday, which means the tripleheader could profoundly impact the playoff picture.\n\nNFL Thanksgiving games odds\n\nAccording to BetMGM NFL odds, the Lions, Cowboys and 49ers are favored on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nPackers at Lions:\n\nSpread: Lions (-7.5)\n\nMoneyline: Lions (-375); Packers (+290)\n\nOver/under: 47\n\nCommanders at Cowboys:\n\nSpread: Cowboys (-12.5)\n\nMoneyline: Cowboys (-700); Commanders (+500)\n\nOver/under: 48.5\n\n49ers at Seahawks:\n\nSpread: 49ers (-7)\n\nMoneyline: 49ers (-350); Seahawks (+270)\n\nOver/under: 44\n\nThe Detroit Lions are among the best bets for NFL Week 12 in their Thanksgiving Day game against the Green Bay Packers.

It was Detroit's third consecutive victory on Thanksgiving after nine straight losses.\n\n\"One of my favorite games to play in every year,\" Stafford said. \"It's a big-time tradition being a Dallas kid growing up. I always watched football on Thanksgiving. I had a vested interest in it — it was a different team, but Thanksgiving football was always a big deal to me and my family.\"\n\nThe Lions snapped their run of Thanksgiving futility in 2013 when they beat Green Bay 40-10, outgaining the Packers 561-126. This game against the Eagles (4-7) was similar. Detroit (4-7) scored 38 consecutive points and cruised through most of the second half with the outcome all but assured.\n\nJohnson came into the game with eight receiving touchdowns on Thanksgiving, the most in league history. He added three to that total in what was easily Detroit's most complete performance of the season.\n\n\"This is an unusual day, this is not a typical day,\" Lions coach Jim Caldwell said. \"Most games in this league are decided by a touchdown or less, and that's the norm.\"\n\nCaldwell's future has been uncertain ever since the Lions got off to a 1-7 start. They fired their general manager and team president and have won three in a row since.\n\nThe Eagles may be facing some changes of their own if they don't recover from this skid. They've lost three games in a row, allowing 45 points in each of the last two.\n\n\"I just think we got outcoached today and didn't do a very good job,\" Philadelphia coach Chip Kelly said.\n\nHere are a few things we learned from Detroit's rout of the Eagles:\n\nRISING STAR\n\nZiggy Ansah has become one of the game's top pass rushers. He had 3 1/2 sacks for the Lions and now has 11 1/2 on the season.\n\n\"The whole team came out here to play,\" Ansah said. \"Defensively, we stopped them on the run, offense moved the ball, special teams gave us great field position, so overall I think it's a great team win.\"\n\nOTHER OPTIONS\n\nTheo Riddick is somebody Detroit's opponents now have to account for. The unheralded RB caught five passes for 62 yards and a touchdown against the Eagles after a solid performance in a win over Oakland last weekend.\n\nINJURIES\n\nQuarterback isn't the only position where the Eagles are dealing with health problems. Sam Bradford sat out a second straight game with a shoulder issue — Mark Sanchez played instead and was sacked six times. Philadelphia also lost CB Nolan Carroll to a broken ankle, and T Jason Peters hurt his ankle in the first quarter.\n\nBLEAK\n\nThe Eagles were only a game out of first place in the NFC East coming into the day, so their season isn't over, but this is not a team that looks ready to make any kind of December run. Philadelphia plays at New England next.\n\n\"It is getting late,\" S Malcolm Jenkins said. \"There are a lot of things that we need to get corrected and the road is getting no easier from here on.\"\n\nNEW APPROACH?\n\nDetroit is 3-0 since its front office shakeup and 3-1 since firing offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and putting Jim Bob Cooter in that role.\n\n\"Jim Bob and I have a good relationship,\" Stafford said. \"He's a smart guy, he communicates well with the guys in our offense. He's young in this job, but he's not afraid, he's aggressive and that's fun. That rubs off on guys when a guy's aggressive and trusts us as players to go out and make those decisions.\"\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/ole-miss/2019/11/28/is-the-egg-bowl-always-on-thanksgiving-ole-miss-vs-mississippi-state/4290793002/", "title": "Mississippi State, Ole Miss want to keep Egg Bowl on Thanksgiving", "text": "It is unclear if the rivalry game will be played on Thanksgiving beyond 2020.\n\nFans have complained about the game being played on a holiday instead of Friday or Saturday.\n\nPlayers are excited for the opportunity to be the center of attention.\n\nOXFORD — There aren't many things the Ole Miss and Mississippi State athletics departments agree on. But playing the Egg Bowl on Thanksgiving is one of them.\n\nOle Miss and Mississippi State will play the Egg Bowl on Thanksgiving for the third consecutive year today and again in 2020, because of a verbal agreement made by the two schools' athletics departments and the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThe agreement extends through 2020, so it's unclear how much longer the in-state rivals are scheduled opposite tryptophan hangovers, family reunions and an NFL primetime game.\n\nOle Miss athletics director Keith Carter said he believes renewing the deal would be good for the future of the rivalry.\n\n\"I think when it is the only college game on the schedule, I think people are going to sit down after their lunch or early dinner and they're going to watch the game,\" Carter told the Clarion Ledger. \"I think it's being watched in California, it's being watched in New York. All across the country. Having that one game on can showcase Ole Miss, our state and the rivalry we have. That means a great deal.\"\n\nWhy Thanksgiving?\n\nNo one sums up the relationship between Thanksgiving and football with quite as much pith or quotability as Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead.\n\n\"Two great American pastimes: turkey and football,\" Moorhead says. \"So let’s combine them together.”\n\nThe truth is Thanksgiving and college football have been intertwined for more than a century. Michigan started playing Chicago on Thanksgiving Day as long ago as 1893. Alabama State and Tuskegee started playing the annual Turkey Day Classic in 1924, a decade before the Detroit Lions started the tradition in the NFL.\n\nOle Miss and Mississippi State have a long Thanksgiving history, too. The two schools first played on Thanksgiving in 1905 and continued every year through 1911. The tradition picked up again for one year in 1918 and then for a stretch from 1926-32. The schools played another one-off Thanksgiving game in 1937 then skipped a few decades before resuming the rivalry on Thanksgiving from 1969-71.\n\nIn the modern era, Ole Miss and Mississippi State played a six-year Thanksgiving stretch from 1998 to 2003. The Rebels and Bulldogs split those six meetings three-apiece.\n\nAfter 2003, no two SEC schools played another on Thanksgiving Day again until 2014 when LSU and Texas A&M squared off. In 2017, Ole Miss and Mississippi State took over the SEC's Thanksgiving Day slot.\n\nThat year, the Battle of the Golden Egg was the only FBS game scheduled on Thanksgiving Day. The same is true this year. It's a huge reason why Ole Miss athletics department supports the holiday game.\n\n\"I like the rivalry and the tradition of having it on Thanksgiving night,\" Ole Miss coach Matt Luke said. \"I think it's a great opportunity to showcase Mississippi. I think the players look at it as an opportunity to play a football game. I don't think they look at it as a negative. It's a great opportunity to go play and showcase yourself on national TV.\"\n\nCarter, Mississippi State athletics director John Cohen and SEC commissioner Greg Sankey have already started preliminary discussions about whether to extend the Egg Bowl Thanksgiving agreement past 2020. Carter said he expects an answer by this summer.\n\n\"From an SEC perspective, from an ESPN perspective, they just know that there's going to be great viewership and it's going to give our league and ourselves a chance to showcase on a national scale,\" Carter said.\n\nCOLUMN:Egg Bowl has created, and continues to create, family memories\n\nNaturally, there's disagreement\n\nNot everyone is keen on playing the Egg Bowl on Thanksgiving Day. Some people don't want to upend family plans to go to a football game.\n\n\"The game needs to be played on Saturday,\" Mississippi State fan Grant Fox told the Clarion Ledger via email. \"Many fans cannot go due to family obligations and Thanksgiving Day commitments. The schools' focus is on being the only game that is televised on Thanksgiving, rather than making it convenient for middle class fans and students to attend the most important rivalry game of the year.\"\n\nSome Ole Miss fans have supported the move to Thanksgiving, Carter said, but others have complained about the inconvenience, whether the game is in Oxford or Starkville.\n\nThat said, Carter presents a logical alternative to that complaint. When the game is scheduled on Thanksgiving, fans have at least a year to decide whether they want to go to the game. The date and time are set in stone.\n\nBut when the game is played on Saturday, all that's known is the date. Kickoff time for Saturday after Thanksgiving games isn't announced until two weeks before the game. And in years like 2019 where Ole Miss and Mississippi State both have losing records, that could mean having the game buried at 11 a.m. on the SEC Network or at 3 p.m. opposite the CBS game of the week, often the Iron Bowl between Auburn and Alabama.\n\n\"I'm not sure the fans would like that either,\" Carter hypothesized. \"So I think taking some of the uncertainty out of it and knowing exactly when the game time is and that you're going to get some of that national pop plays heavily into it.\"\n\n'The Super Bowl for us':How Egg Bowl outsiders learn to love the rivalry​​​​​​​\n\nThe player perspective\n\nOle Miss players spoke positively about the chance to play a primetime game on Thanksgiving.\n\n\"I'm really excited about it,\" freshman quarterback John Rhys Plumlee said. \"Growing up, you're with your family and you're always around a TV at some point in the day. You're eating and you're eating and you're eating and then at some point everybody is on the couch just kind of chilling.\n\n\"You're kind of tired. So I can picture everybody around a TV watching us playing. That's really exciting for me to know that a lot of people are going to be watching us play.\"\n\nFor Plumlee and the most of the rest of Ole Miss' freshmen, this week will mark the first time they've ever spent Thanksgiving night away from family. Something Luke and his staff are trying to make easier.\n\nPlumlee said Luke hosted Ole Miss' freshman class for dinner at his home Sunday night, where he served Abner's chicken tenders instead of turkey and stuffing. At the dinner, Plumlee said Luke made it clear how important the Egg Bowl is for him.\n\n\"He just goes, 'Guys, I just want you guys to realize how big of a game this is,'\" Plumlee said. \"He said, 'Growing up, this was always the game that determined if I had a good or bad year.' Now, especially since he's the head coach, it really determines whether he has a good or bad year. We really want it for him.\"\n\nMore:Ole Miss vs Mississippi State: Clarion Ledger writers discuss Egg Bowl 2019\n\nMississippi State wide receiver Malik Dear has a different perspective on playing on Thanksgiving night. Like Americans everywhere, Dear grew up with Thanksgiving traditions he had to sacrifice in order to play in this game.\n\n\"Every Thanksgiving before I got to college, right down the road in Ackerman me and my papa and my dad and brothers, we always go hunting on Thanksgiving,\" Dear said. \"To play a game on Thanksgiving, it kind of sucks that I can’t go hunting. At the same time, it’s really fun because the only other sport playing games on Thanksgiving is the NFL. You can watch them, watch us play, and then watch them again.”\n\nOle Miss senior linebacker Willie Hibbler said he thinks the stakes of being the only college football game on helps the rivalry. He said he likes playing on Thanksgiving because that's when the team is the \"center of attention\" and is when the Rebels get a chance to \"beat up on the school down south a little bit.\"\n\nThen there are the running backs. All they want to do is get the ball. Doesn't matter when.\n\nMississippi State senior Nick Gibson said he'll play the game \"however, whenever\" and wants to put on a show for the fans.

In their 2018 Thanksgiving game against Washington, the Cowboys now had the lead. Prescott celebrated with his trademark kiss to the sky, a nod to his late mother and celebratory embraces with his offensive linemen.\n\nThen running back Ezekiel Elliott raced to the end zone, lifting Prescott into his arms before promptly dumping — donating? — him into the Salvation Army red kettle.\n\n\"At the point he lifted me up, I’m like, 'I better not resist or I might hurt something,' \" Prescott said. \"Zeke’s a person and player I’m very thankful for.\"\n\nGIVING THANKS:One thing for each NFL team to be thankful for\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nINSPIRATION:Cowboys channel legacy of late strength coach\n\nThe antics marked Elliott’s third touchdown celebration with the red kettle, the Salvation Army’s annual holiday collection campaign that launched in 1891. The Cowboys will host their 25th nationally broadcast Red Kettle Campaign Kickoff on Thursday, complete with kettles in the end zone and a halftime performance by country music entertainer Luke Combs.\n\nThis year’s red kettle involvement remains up in the air after Prescott and Elliott were fined in 2018 for what the league deemed unsportsmanlike conduct. But the Cowboys value what has become a source of team energy and philanthropic spirit. The campaign has served more than 748 million people with donations totaling $2.86 billion since 1997.\n\n\"It has become that tradition,\" Cowboys Executive Vice President and Chief Brand Officer Charlotte Jones told USA TODAY Sports. \"It’s as much a part of who we are with the Cowboys as eating turkey is on Thanksgiving Day.\"\n\n'A completely authentic moment'\n\nPerhaps Combs’ recognition of the red kettle antics illustrates that reach. The multiplatinum artist and 2021 CMA Entertainer of the Year said he’s \"used to seeing\" Elliott jump into the red kettle.\n\n\"How many times you jumping in this tomorrow, @ezekielelliott?\" Combs posted to Instagram on Thursday.\n\nIt’s possible Elliott hasn’t decided yet.\n\nWhen he first took the plunge in December 2016, the scheme materialized during warmups. Elliott saw the kettle and thought: \"That bucket’s just sitting right there by the end zone, so it’s only right someone jumps in it.\"\n\nHe checked before warmups to ensure nothing dangerous was inside.\n\nHis moment came after he scored 2-yard touchdown run against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Still holding the ball, Elliott hopped in. He then peeked his head over the top as if checking for a clear coast, which became an iconic meme. A longtime friend texted Elliott’s mother, Dawn, who was at the game and said: \"That is totally something you would have done.\"\n\nDawn Elliott saw how quickly her son beelined for the kettle and figured he had eyed such an opportunity.\n\n\"I know my child: He was waiting to do that,\" she told USA TODAY Sports by phone. \"He’s been always a big kid. He’s acted like that ever since he was little. He kind of never grew up.\"\n\nJones said that contagious spirit paired with Elliott’s characteristic \"Feed Me\" gesture to form an eye-catching Salvation Army pitch. Watching from the owner’s box, she breathed a sigh of relief when Elliott emerged uninjured. After all, she said, the kettles were initially used to store pyrotechnics for the team’s halftime performance. Jones also laughed when someone suggested she had put Elliott up to it as a marketing ploy.\n\n\"It was just a 20-year-old kid who thought it was a good idea to jump inside the kettle,\" Jones told USA TODAY Sports. \"I almost think if it had been anybody else, it would not have been near as clever. But he has to even come up out of there peering, his full personality. To me, that’s just such good spirit, such great generosity.\n\n\"It was a completely authentic moment.\"\n\nElliott subsequently donated $21,000 to the Salvation Army and solicited $21 donations from fans to help feed families in need. The campaign generated an additional $250,000 in donations, the team said.\n\nAnd Elliott brought back the $21 donation in 2018 when he scored the game’s first touchdown. This time, Elliott had planted cash with an on-field photographer, donating the $21 after his own score a couple quarters before he’d ultimately donate Prescott. The Prescott donation, Elliott concedes, was not preplanned.\n\n\"It was kind of spur of the moment,\" Elliott said. \"Just remember I threw him in there. It was fun. We had a good time.\"\n\nLooking for a run\n\nOn Thursday, the 7-3 Cowboys will look to rebound from a loss at the Kansas City Chiefs when the 5-5 Las Vegas Raiders visit. The Cowboys struggled to establish the offensive rhythm and physicality they expect. Outside of one explosive 31-yard rush, their remaining 15 carries amounted to 51 yards.\n\n\"We need to re-establish our identity just being physical, obviously setting the tone at the line of scrimmage,\" Prescott said. \"From there, after we do that, we can re-establish our pace of play, get some plays going, get some momentum.\"\n\nPrescott's and Elliott’s ground game can create that momentum on the field and off for the Salvation Army’s campaign. The kettles will be there, the social service provider collecting for Christmas gifts, food, shelter, rent and utility assistance with heightened need due to pandemic poverty. The Salvation Army estimates it will need $175 million to keep Americans in their homes this holiday season, the organization said. Prescott said Elliott can be counted on for \"always great spirit.\"\n\nJones said she would encourage a red kettle-involved celebration even as the league has penalized taunting more ardently this season. Her father, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, has said he’d love to sue the league for such a penalty and bring even more awareness to the Salvation Army’s cause.\n\n\"I encourage their ingenuity,\" Jones said. \"It’s certainly been something that’s used our visibility to inspire others to want to help and give back, but equally as important to us, it’s inspired an ethos in our organization in how important it is and the responsibility we have to be part of this team.\n\n\"Every year, us building upon this and letting the guys understand how important it is. They truly have embraced it.\"\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/25"}]}
