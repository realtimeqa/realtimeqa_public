She has limited mobility and relies on medications for her health.\n\n“We do believe that Nancy was taken from her home against her will, and that’s where we’re at,” Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told reporters on Tuesday, Feb. 3.\n\nNow, there are reports that TMZ and CBS News affiliate KOLD News have received ransom notes related to Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Savannah Guthrie shared a statement on Instagram asking for prayers for her mother:\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n“We believe in prayer. We believe in voices raised in unison, in love, in hope. We believe in goodness. We believe in humanity. Above all, we believe in Him. Thank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy, a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant. Raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie's year was off to a great start – until now\n\nThings were looking up in 2026 for Savannah Guthrie before this horrific incident. Just days before her mother’s disappearance, she had returned to her TV role after taking several weeks off for vocal cord surgery.\n\nShe was also set to head to Italy to host the Winter Olympics opening ceremony on Feb. 6.\n\nNBC has confirmed she will no longer be doing this as the search for her mother continues.\n\nEven President Donald Trump has weighed in. On Feb. 3, he told reporters in the Oval Office that he thinks what’s happened is “terrible” and that he had plans to call the morning show host.\n\nIn the more than 14 years Savannah Guthrie has appeared on the “Today” show, viewers have gotten to know her mother. Nancy Guthrie made a few appearances, including taking part in a cooking demonstration, and has shown up to surprise her daughter on special occasions.\n\nAnyone with an elderly mother can empathize with Guthrie\n\nThe mother and daughter are clearly close, which makes me think of my own relationship with my mother, who is in her 70s.\n\nI would be beyond heartbroken if anything like this happened to her.\n\nWhile a kidnapping at any age is horrific, there is an extra vulnerability when considering an elderly person.\n\nThe journalist and her family must feel so helpless as law enforcement tracks all leads – and the hours tick by.\n\nThis tragedy has also made me think about the dangers of having such a public job, as Guthrie does.\n\nAnyone in the public eye can become a target for a demented or evil person. We saw this in September, when conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated while speaking before a large crowd. Trump himself nearly was killed, too, in 2024, while on the reelection campaign trail. Many others – on the left and right – have faced threats on their lives.\n\nAs an opinion columnist, I get my share of threats. While discouraging, it’s kind of expected in this job. What I didn’t expect was threats against my family – and those have come, too. It’s made me very careful about what I write and what I post online.\n\nNo one should have to fear for their lives – or the lives of their loved ones – just for doing their jobs. Yet, that is the sad state of our society.\n\nMy heart goes out to Savannah Guthrie. I pray for her mother’s safe return and justice for whoever did this horrible act.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department is investigating Guthrie's disappearance alongside the FBI, which is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to her recovery.\n\nGuthrie takes daily medication, and it could prove fatal if she does not receive it, according to law enforcement. Anyone with information is asked to contact the FBI at 800-CALL-FBI.\n\nOn Feb. 7, the Sheriff's Department said detectives and agents are continuing to conduct follow-ups at Guthrie's residence and the surrounding areas, and law enforcement was seen at the home of Nancy's daughter Annie Guthrie on Saturday, Feb. 7, according to CNN.

The church had just finished its contemporary service, and people were arriving for the traditional service.\n\nThe service, presented in person and streamed online, began with a prayer for Guthrie. Lead pastor Rev. Dr. John Tittle spoke about the vigil for Guthrie held on Thursday, Feb. 5, that took place at St. Phillips in the Hills Episcopal Church. After songs led by a choir and prayers, he spoke about forgiveness and the challenge of “the journey of forgiveness.”\n\n\"Right now, we are heartbroken about the inhumanity and the evil done to Nancy and her family. What do we do?\" Tittle said.\n\nNancy Guthrie latest news: Family says 'we will pay' in new video\n\nOn Saturday, Feb. 7, Savannah Guthrie and her siblings, Annie and Camron, released a new video addressing their mother's kidnapper.\n\n\"We received your message and we understand,\" Savannah Guthrie said in the video, in which she spoke directly into the camera with her brother and sister by her side.\n\n\"We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her.

This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.\"\n\nThis was the third video the family has released directly addressing a possible abductor.\n\nOn Feb. 4, Guthrie and her siblings read a lengthy statement addressing reports that media outlets had received alleged ransom letters.\n\n\"We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media,\" Guthrie said. \"As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she's alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please reach out to us.\"\n\nThe second video, released on Feb. 5, featured only Savannah's brother Camron, who told the kidnapper that \"we want to hear from you.\"\n\n\"We haven't heard anything directly,\" he said. \"We need you to reach out, and we need a way to communicate with you so that we can move forward. But first, we have to know that you have our mom. We want to talk to you, and we are waiting for contact.\"\n\nAlleged ransom notes, deadlines: What we know\n\nMultiple media outlets, including TMZ and KOLD, have reported receiving ransom notes from an alleged kidnapper in the case.\n\nIn a Feb. 5 briefing, FBI special agent in charge Heith Janke said the bureau was investigating a ransom note that had \"facts associated with a deadline\" and a \"monetary value they were asking for.\" The note mentioned two deadlines: one on Feb. 5 and another on Monday, Feb. 9.\n\n\"The ransom note that was distributed to the media did make a demand for 5 p.m. [on Feb. 5], and if a transfer wasn't made, then I think a second demand was for next Monday,\" Janke said on Feb. 5.\n\nHowever, the note did not provide proof of life or establish a way for the family to communicate with the alleged kidnapper.\n\nOn Feb. 6, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said investigators were aware of a \"new message regarding Nancy Guthrie\" and were \"actively inspecting the information provided in the message for its authenticity.\"\n\nNancy Guthrie disappearance timeline\n\nNancy Guthrie was last seen on Jan. 31, when she was dropped off at her home by family members.

Officials believe she was \"taken from her home against her will.\" The 84-year-old mother was residing outside of Tucson, Arizona, and police said she had some physical and medical issues that could make her capture more dangerous.\n\n\"I think it's a terrible thing. I always got along very good with Savannah,\" Trump said on Feb. 3 while answering questions from reporters in the Oval Office. The White House said he spoke with the anchor on Feb. 4. \"Very unusual situation but we're going to find out.\"\n\nTrump's sympathy toward Guthrie is somewhat of an anomaly for the president. In the same gaggle, Trump criticized CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins for \"not smiling\" as she asked questions about Jeffrey Epstein's survivors. Last year, when pressed on the Epstein files, he told another woman journalist, \"quiet, piggy.\" Here is what to know about Trump and Guthrie's history:\n\nSavannah Guthrie has interviewed Donald Trump in the past\n\nGuthrie, who was an NBC News White House correspondent prior to joining the \"Today\" show, has interviewed Trump before. She has also spoken with former President George W. Bush, President Barack Obama, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former first lady Michelle Obama throughout her career.\n\nGuthrie hosted a town hall with Trump in October 2020, the same night as then-candidate Joe Biden had a town hall with ABC News.\n\nGuthrie was lauded for her tough interviewing skills, pressing Trump at one point on his sharing conspiracy theories online by saying, \"You're the president. You're not like someone's crazy uncle who can just retweet whatever.\" The moment was spoofed by \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nAt a rally days later, he said she was acting like a \"crazed lunatic,\" and in a different rally had said he told her she did a good job with the interview.\n\n“I approach it the same no matter what,” Guthrie told the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, about the town hall. “I think preparation is the key. Interviewing any president is difficult. It's one of the most high-pressure situations you can find yourself in. And, every president, every political figure, they're all different. And they all present a different set of challenges. So I think it's just one of those occasions where you always have to study really hard and, no matter who it is, you have to be just ready for the unpredictable.”\n\nShe also said she goes by the \"tried-and-true ideals of journalism — fairness, accuracy, precision.\"\n\nGuthrie also interviewed Trump on the \"Today\" show with former co-anchor Matt Lauer a few times leading up to the 2016 election.\n\nGuthrie asks for prayers, is out of NBC Olympic coverage\n\nGuthrie posted on Instagram on Feb. 2, asking followers to \"please pray,\" and \"bring her home.\"\n\nTMZ and CBS affiliate KOLD News have both reported that they received ransom notes demanding payment for Nancy Guthrie's return, but they have not been verified.\n\n\"We don't know where she is,\" Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said in a press conference Tuesday, Feb. 3.\n\nNBC also confirmed that Guthrie would no longer host the 2026 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Italy.\n\n\"Savannah will not be joining us at the Olympics as she focuses on being with her family during this difficult time,\" an NBC spokesperson told USA TODAY in a statement. \"Our hearts are with her and the entire Guthrie family as the search continues for their mother.'\n\nContributing: Melina Khan, Bill Goodykoontz, Justin Ravitz, Shawn Raymundo, USA TODAY Network\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

What to know about Savannah's family, siblings\n\nNancy Guthrie is the mother of Savannah Guthrie, brother Cameron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie. Nancy's husband and father to her children died of a heart attack when Savannah was 16 years old.\n\n\"She has met unthinkable challenges in her life with grit, without self-pity, with determination, and always, always with unshakeable faith,\" Savannah said in a tribute on her mother's 80th birthday in 2022.\n\nIn 2019, Nancy appeared on the fourth hour of \"Today\" to discuss how she took a \"laissez-faire\" approach to parenting when she was raising Savannah. \"Your kids won't like [hovering],\" she said. \"All my kids are absolutely amazing.\"\n\nSavannah explained on \"Today\" in 2022 that she lived at home through college, in part because she wanted to \"stick with my mom and not leave her alone\" after the death of Savannah's father.

They spent some time looking for her themselves before they called us, so I'm guessing maybe they got there around 11 (a.m.),\" Nanos said.\n\nJeff Lamie, one of Guthrie’s neighbors, told The Arizona Republic – part of the USA TODAY Network – that her disappearance was surprising. \"It’s a very quiet neighborhood. It’s a very safe neighborhood.

Since then, the details of the case have become increasingly tragic and concerning, as authorities now say Guthrie was \"taken from her home against her will\" and two unverified ransom notes were delivered to media outlets TMZ and CBS's Tucson affiliate, KOLD News.\n\nNeither the public nor investigators know exactly what happened to Guthrie at this point. All we know for sure is that the devoted mother and grandmother didn't make her Sunday Church service, and her family has asked for prayers from the public. And we know that it is an incident that is deeply, horrifically sad and frightening. And we can't stop watching and waiting for news.\n\nAmerica can't look away from celebrity tragedy\n\nCrime relating to celebrities and public figures always becomes a huge news story in the United States, all the way back (at least) to the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's baby in 1932.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nWhen tragedy hits the lives of the rich and famous, the American public can't help but tune in. The murders of celebrated director and producer Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle Reiner Singer became the biggest celebrity news story of 2025 when the news broke in December. Every update on the release of government files about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein includes the names of celebrities to the dismay of fans and viewers. The trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs for sex-related charges in 2025 attracted full courtrooms and daily updates from news outlets, fans and amateur \"sleuths.\" The list goes on and on.\n\nThere's something about bad things involving people we're used to seeing on a big screen or listening to sing in our headphones that feels almost personal to fans and even casual observers. Audiences feel a deep connection with movie and TV stars, musicians, athletes and the news anchors they wake up to every single morning. A \"Today\" fixture since 2011, Savannah Guthrie is the centerpiece of a show that is intimate and casual, meant to be a jovial companion to Americans as they eat breakfast and sip their coffee. The anchors are newspeople and performers, but they also feel like friends and companions.\n\nWhen \"Today\" host Matt Lauer was accused of multiple counts of sexual abuse, harassment and assault in November 2017 as part of the #MeToo movement, viewers of the program were shocked, appalled and fascinated. Lauer was a paternal figure who represented stability and safety. To see him as a criminal, a perpetrator and villain, was a cognitive dissonance that demanded our attention. (Savannah Guthrie was part of this moment, too, tearfully processing the shocking news on live TV alongside cohost Hoda Kotb.)\n\nSimilarly, to see Savannah Guthrie, 54, normally a joyful and smiling companion who narrates the major events of our day-to-day lives, in such a vulnerable and upsetting position is jarring. She reports the news, but she doesn't typically become it. Similarly the vulnerability of Nancy Guthrie, an elderly woman described as having mobility problems, as a possible victim of a violent crime, is sickening and deeply uncomfortable. Our society is supposed to protect the young and the old, and somehow Nancy Guthrie became endangered anyway. How safe is anyone?\n\nThe 'Today Show' has covered the story with somber grace\n\nPerhaps one of the most unique aspects of this story versus other instances of celebrities involved in tragic crime is that some of Guthrie's closest friends are required to report the latest updates in the case.\n\n\"The Today Show\" is among the many national news outlets following updates on Nancy's disappearance, and so the news anchors who work with Savannah day in and day out must also report soberly on this difficult news story.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 2, asking fans to pray, Savannah's \"Today\" coanchors shared they were doing just that. \"Her faith leads us, and Nancy leads us as well,\" Jenna Bush Hager said, close to tears.\n\n\"And it's the one thing we all have, and we can do,\" Sheinelle Jones added. \"Doesn't cost a thing.\" (Jones opened up to fans about her own family tragedy last year following the death of her husband at age 45.)\n\nCraig Melvin said many fans of the show, from social media to on the street, have shared that they were praying for the Guthrie family.\n\n\"And that's exactly what Savannah and the family needs to hear,\" he continued. \"My pastor used to have this saying years ago. He's like, 'It's easy to be faithful when things are going well in your life. You have to be faithful when you're at the top of the mountain, but the God of the mountain is the God of the valley.'\"\n\nCarson Daly added, \"It's easy to be pessimistic and negative at a time like this, but I feel like you have the same option to still think about a positive outcome. Through our faith, let's get Nancy home. It just takes one phone call.\"\n\nIn addition to these emotional and personal updates, the anchors, particularly Melvin and Jones, have been able to pivot to their important jobs as reporters when the time calls for it. Each \"Today\" episode since Feb. 2 has fully reported the latest updates on the case with the impartiality and professionalism viewers expect from the hosts. The anchors have gracefully code-switched from objective anchors to concerned friends as best they can in this deeply unique and unsettling situation. Viewers could hardly ask for anything more from them.\n\nCan America give Savannah Guthrie the privacy and dignity she deserves?\n\nIt's easy to be grimly fascinated and horrified by what has happened to Nancy Guthrie. It's easy to keep up with the case, to share terrible updates on social media and to talk about it with friends and family. It's harder to know when to stop.\n\nWild rumors, accusations and conspiracy theories have already been flooding the internet since the case has taken the spotlight, to the point where local law enforcement has been forced to deliver further statements underlining the truth of what we do know, and what we don't.\n\nOn Feb. 4th the Pima County sheriff's department, for instance, released a statement underlining that there are no persons of interest yet in the case, and scolded the public for platforming \"unverified accusations.\"\n\n\"Detectives continue to speak with anyone who may have had contact with Mrs. Guthrie,\" the statement read. \"Detectives are working closely with the Guthrie family. While we appreciate the public's concern, the sharing of unverified accusations or false information is irresponsible and does not assist the investigation.\"\n\nEvery crime that garners national attention brings this kind of questionable theorizing and back-seat investigating. But as the sheriff's department pointed out, guessing at what happened doesn't help anyone find the truth. And it could be deeply hurtful to the family involved.\n\nAs law enforcement searches for Guthrie and any potential perpetrators, and the news media reports on the truth, it is our job at home not to make things worse; not to guess or speculate or cause harm.\n\nThis story is already tragic enough. No need to speculate on how much worse it could be.\n\nContributing: Taijuan Moorman, Brendan Morrow, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2026/02/05/savannah-guthrie-nancy-mom-caregivers-nightmare/88494998007/", "title": "Savannah Guthrie, her missing mom and why so many feel her pain", "text": "Updated Feb. 5, 2026, 7:26 p.m. ET\n\n\"Today\" show anchor Savannah Guthrie is living every adult child's worst nightmare.\n\nGuthrie's mother, Nancy Guthrie, 84, was reported missing from her home outside Tucson on Feb. 1. Police have since confirmed they believe she was kidnapped or abducted, as she has limited mobility. On Feb. 4, Savannah Guthrie posted a video addressing media reports of ransom notes and begging for her mother to be returned, while sitting between her sister Annie Guthrie and brother Camron Guthrie.\n\nMany aspects of the story read like a Hollywood script and are unfathomable to the average American. But the \"Today\" anchor's pain is also palpable and relatable, especially for anyone who's experienced the struggles of caring for an aging parent from afar.\n\n\"Thank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy, a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant,\" Guthrie said in a Feb. 2 Instagram post. \"Raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment.\"\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nGuthrie lives in New York. Her mom lives in Arizona. It's not uncommon − AARP reports 1 in 10 caregivers live at least an hour away from the person they care for. A recent study by Choice Mutual insurance agency found a third of Americans say their parents live more than 100 miles away. But no matter the distance between sandwich generation caregivers and their aging parents, many adult children are anxious about their parents' care and safety.\n\n\"There's also a constant worry about if an emergency happens,\" said Rita Choula, senior director of caregiving at the AARP Public Policy Institute. Choula said that long-distance caregivers are more likely to use remote monitoring and other technologies to try and mitigate those concerns. Still, Choula said, long-distance caregivers are often grappling with not having enough information to accurately assess their parents' needs.\n\nLong-distance caregivers also often feel guilt, Choula said, about not being able to get to their parent quickly when they need help.\n\n\"What happens if there's a crisis?\" Choula said. \"If something happens to my mom, if something happens to my granddad, and I am a plane ride away versus a car drive away, I have to leave work. I might not have paid leave.\"\n\nThe strange shift from being cared for by your parent to worrying about your parent's care is universal. Celebrities have come forward in recent years to talk about it, and everyday Americans are becoming more vocal about the role reversal, too, and the challenges that come along with it. Taylor Swift talked about caring for her father after his quintuple bypass surgery last summer.\n\n\"I'm having these moments where I'm like, this dude built play sets and swing sets and cribs for me. I'm building his shower chair and his walker and his bed,\" Swift said on her fiancé Travis Kelce's podcast. \"It's just surreal, man.\"\n\nWhen you don't live near your aging parents, Choula said, it's important to have other supports in place for them and people who can check in on them − especially if they live alone.\n\n\"These are huge issues,\" Choula said, especially for sandwich generation caregivers who are caring for their children while caring for their aging parents. \"When you're a long-distance caregiver, you really are oftentimes trusting and relying on others to be able to fill that gap for you. And so you're managing the scheduling and coordination of all of those individuals, and again you just have that overall concern of, 'Is this enough? Are they OK? Will they be OK?'\"\n\nMadeline Mitchell's role covering women and the caregiving economy at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal and Journalism Funding Partners.

And why, since her disappearance, investigators have struggled to come up with answers.\n\nAnd whether she’d be found before going too long without her vital daily medication.\n\n'My mom still lives there'\n\nNearly three months before her mom vanished, \"Today\" show main anchor Savannah Guthrie kicked off a new segment, \"Hometown Today,\" on NBC's marquee morning program on Nov. 5.\n\nThe aim of the show was to give viewers a behind-the-scenes look of where the series' beloved anchors had grown up.\n\n\"Savannah, we’re going to start with you,” cohost Carson Daly said from the show’s curvy couch. \"You took us back to your old stomping grounds.\" Surrounded by her \"Today family\" – Craig Melvin, Jenna Bush Hager, Al Roker and Daly – Guthrie said that she traveled back for an Arizona homecoming.\n\n\"I grew up there, went to college there, my mom still lives there and, honestly, a part of me has really never left,\" Guthrie, 54, told viewers.\n\nIn a jean jacket and black dress, she walked through prickly pear cactus fields, even pausing to poke the thorny plants. She introduced herself, and viewers, to local muralist Joe Pagac. Guthrie went back to her alma mater, the University of Arizona, greeting President Suresh Garimella in one spoof and meeting sorority sisters at her own Pi Beta Phi in another skit.\n\nSavannah Guthrie speaks out on reports of ransom letters for missing mom\n\nThen she sat down for lunch at El Charro, a Mexican restaurant, with her mom and older sister, the 56-year-old poet Annie. The trio shared margaritas, as Guthrie sipped on a prickly pear beverage during the segment, and caught up with executive chef Carlotta Flores.\n\n'We're just praying'\n\nBack on Feb. 4, a dozen patrons stood in line at the same location, run by Flores since 1972. Waiters inside carried dishes during lunch rush, including Carlotta’s Chicken Mole and shrimp tamales.\n\nFlores comes in and out these days, and one of her sons said she wasn’t there around 12:45 p.m.\n\n\"Everyone has their own opinions about [what happened], but when it comes right down to it, this is a lady who is missing,\" Flores told The New York Post. \"It's their mother missing.\" That was felt all over the community, including at St. Andrew's, where the pastor was prepping to attend the vigil and staff were juggling nonstop calls.\n\nIt was at her church that a fellow churchgoer called Nancy Guthrie’s family Sunday, Feb. 1, after she failed to attend a service there. Her home is about 12 minutes away, a short 5 mile drive in her close-knit neighborhood.\n\nHer \"children left her off\" at her home around 9:45 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 31, according to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos. Then, the apparent abduction.\n\n\"We're just praying,\" a staffer at St. Andrew's told USA TODAY hours before the vigil, praying for good news while respecting the family’s privacy.\n\nWhat to know about Savannah Guthrie's family\n\nNot far away, outside the Guthrie home around 5 p.m. Feb. 4, neighbor Chris Wilkey said the move by investigators to return to the home only deepened the mystery.\n\n'Soon as the sun goes down, everybody gets home'\n\nLate in the afternoon, there was what appeared to be renewed law enforcement interest at the home. Crime scene tape was placed along the front of the residence. Investigators, one of whom wore a Pima County Sheriff's Department vest, took equipment out of plastic bins in a truck.\n\nThey entered the garage of the home and went in and out. When they left, they carried at least one box and large brown envelopes. The crime scene tape went down again after the investigators left.\n\nThe sought-after neighborhood has stucco homes and acre plots. Yards are landscaped with rock and cactuses; black bark Mesquite and palo verde trees line yards.\n\nWilkey, 50, said the area gets \"very dark\" at night and lacks streetlights – likely helping obscure whatever transpired and making the case harder to crack. As the days tick by without any suspects, unknowns have put the neighborhood on edge.\n\n\"Soon as the sun goes down, everybody gets home,\" he said.\n\n'I love you'\n\nWhen \"Today\" filmed at El Charro, Flores served the Guthrie family tequila in teacups, a tradition dating back to Prohibition when women playing cards would hide their liquor with a little help from dishware.\n\n“Cheers, I love you,” Savannah Guthrie said, before quipping \"don't drink the whole thing\" to her mom. She then turned and asked her mom why she'd moved to Tucson.\n\n\"It's so wonderful – just the air, the quality of life is laid back and gentle,\" Nancy Guthrie said. \"I like to watch the javelina eat my plants,\" she added to laughs from her daughters.\n\nNancy Guthrie moved to the area in the 1970s alongside her husband, Charles, who suffered a fatal heart attack when Guthrie was 16. \"The best part about Tucson is coming home and seeing you guys,\" Savannah Guthrie told her mom and sister.\n\nWhy Savannah Guthrie's missing mother is captivating the nation\n\nThey clinked their margs in tall glasses, and the show shifted back to the curvy white couch in Studio 1A at NBC's 30 Rock headquarters in New York City.\n\nSavannah Guthrie surprised her four \"Today\" costars with tequila and teacups gifted from Flores and El Charro. \"And as my mother said, it's quite smooth,\" she told the group. “Cheers!” former first daughter Bush Hager proclaimed. \"For Nancy!\"\n\n'Bring her swiftly to safety'\n\nAt 6 p.m., as the sun was dipping behind mountains, several hundred residents streamed into St. Philip’s in the Hills Episcopal Church.\n\nThey were there for a candlelight invocation and prayer service. Organizers said it was meant to raise voices for Nancy Guthrie and her family.\n\nIn a mostly hushed service, supporters and worshipers held lit candles, reciting the Lord’s Prayer and walking single file to the altar as quiet organ hymns filled the sanctuary. \"Bring her swiftly to safety for those who she loves,\" a service leader said in prayer.\n\nSavannah Guthrie speaks out on reports of ransom letters for missing mom\n\nInvestigators including the Pima County Sheriff's Department are expected to hold a news briefing on Feb. 5. But so far, police haven't identified any suspects. While many in town speculated, few had answers.\n\nThe date also marks three months since the \"Today\" segment aired, listing the reasons why Guthrie still loves Tucson.\n\n\"From the love of family to the familiar beauty of the scenery, I will always be a daughter of the desert,\" Savannah Guthrie said. But the scenery she loved so much conjured the backdrop of her mother’s disappearance.\n\nWhile parishioners gathered at a church near her mother’s home for intercession, Savannah Guthrie pleaded on Instagram. To viewers. To captors. To anyone who'd listen.\n\n\"We need to know without a doubt that she's alive and that you have her,\" she said into the camera. \"We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.

When the shooting started, the 21-year-old helped concertgoers over the barricade so they could escape through a nearby exit.\n\nThen he was shot.\n\nSilva, a Las Vegas resident and three-year employee of Contemporary Services Corporation (CSC) Nevada, was the “epitome of integrity,” according to CSC vice president Jay Purves.\n\n\"He was always the first one there and the last one to leave and went above and beyond what we ever asked of him,\" Purves said.\n\nIn an interview with KTNV, Silva's mother wept, saying her son had \"a bright future\" and that she was still expecting him to walk into the room and say her name.\n\nRead more about Erick Silva.\n\nSusan Smith\n\nAge: 53\n\nCity: Simi Valley, Calif.\n\nWithin hours of learning about the shooting, visitors started dropping off flowers outside Vista Elementary School, where Susan Smith was a popular office manager.\n\n\"She's the hub...really the heart of the school,\" said Jake Finch, a spokesperson for the Simi Valley Unified School District. \"She had a great sense of humor. She's patient and kind.\"\n\nSmith, an ardent country music fan who was married with two adult children, attended the music festival with two friends from the school district. Lesley Prince, a father of a Vista Elementary student, added flowers to a growing memorial to Smith.\n\n\"She was just such a sweet person,\" Prince said with tears welling in his eyes. \"She's the one who told me my daughter was accepted here.\"\n\nRead more about Susan Smith.\n\nBrennan Stewart\n\nAge: 30\n\nCity: Las Vegas\n\nFriends and family of Stewart described him as a rowdy, fun-loving singer who was always the life of the party. But when the gunfire started, another side of Stewart came out.\n\n\"Brennan was the kind of guy who always put others before himself, including up to the moment he lost his life,\" read a family statement. \"Brennan shielded his girlfriend and helped others to safety.\"\n\nThe amateur country-music songwriter has been the focus of a wide variety of tributes. Many people are rewatching his YouTube videos, including his rendition of \"You Should Be Here\" by Cole Swindell. Some are wearing cowboy boots in his honor. Others are planning a karaoke night to sing songs and collect donations for his large, extended family.\n\nFor the family of Stewart, who worked for a custom-home builder in Las Vegas, that focus on the music is a perfect way to honor him. \"If country music ever disappeared, I feel like I would too,\" he once wrote.\n\nRead more about Brennan Stewart.\n\nDerrick “Bo” Taylor\n\nAge: 56\n\nCity: Oxnard, Calif.\n\nThe 29-year veteran of the Nevada Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation attended the concert with his girlfriend, Denise Cohen. By the time the chaos was over, both were dead.\n\nTaylor was a lieutenant and the commander of the state's conservation center, which houses inmates who fight wildfires.\n\nHis supervisor, Capt. Timothy Ellis, called Taylor an \"outstanding\" officer. \"He ran an absolutely great camp,\" Ellisa said.\n\nTaylor was survived by two adult sons.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\n2022 was supposed to be a triumphant year for China and its leader Xi Jinping, as he began his second decade in power with a pledge to restore the nation to greatness.\n\nInstead, China had its most difficult year under Xi’s rule as it reeled from his costly zero-Covid policy – from months of overzealous enforcement that crushed the economy and stoked historic public discontent, to a wholesale abandonment so abrupt that left a fragile health system scrambling to cope with an explosion of cases.\n\nThe chaos and disarray is a stark contrast to the start of the year, when Beijing showcased the success of its Covid containment measures by keeping the coronavirus largely at bay from the Winter Olympics.\n\nOver the span of a year, Xi’s hallmark pandemic policy has turned from a source of legitimacy for the ruling Communist Party into a spiraling crisis that threatens to undermine it.\n\nAs an unprecedented wave of infections – and deaths – sweeps the country, many have questioned why after sacrificing so much under zero-Covid and waiting for so long to reopen, the government ultimately let the virus rip through a population with little prior warning or preparation.\n\nAs 2022 draws to a close, CNN looks back at five key events of the year for China’s zero-Covid policy.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China's reported less Covid deaths since scrapping zero-Covid.

CNN is seeing a different story 03:06\n\nBeijing Winter Olympics\n\nThe Games proved to be a resounding success for China’s zero-Covid strategy.\n\nIn its tightly sealed, meticulously managed Olympic bubble, the ubiquitous face masks, endless spraying of disinfectant and rigorous daily testing paid-off. Any infected visitors arriving in the country were swiftly identified and their cases contained, allowing the Winter Olympics to run largely free of Covid even as the Omicron variant raged around the world.\n\nThe success added to the party’s narrative that its political system is superior to those of Western democracies in handling the pandemic – a message Xi had repeatedly driven home as he prepared for a third term in power.\n\nIt also boosted China’s confidence that its well-honed zero-Covid playbook of lockdowns, quarantines, mass testing and contact tracing could build an effective defense against highly transmissible Omicron and contain its spread. In the lead-up to the Games, these measures worked in January to tame the country’s first Omicron outbreak in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.\n\nBeijing kept the Winter Olympcis largely free of Covid inside a strictly managed bubble. Thomas Peter/reuters\n\nShanghai lockdown\n\nBut it didn’t take long for Omicron to seep through the cracks of zero-Covid. By mid-March, China was battling its worst Covid outbreak since the initial wave of the pandemic, reporting thousands of new cases a day, from northern Jilin province to Guangdong in the south.\n\nThe financial hub of Shanghai soon became the epicenter. Local officials initially denied a citywide lockdown was necessary, but then imposed one after the city reported 3,500 daily infections.\n\nThe two-month lockdown became a glaring symbol of the economic and social costs of zero-Covid. In the country’s wealthiest and most glamorous city, residents were subject to widespread food shortages, lack of emergency medical care, spartan makeshift isolation facilities and forced disinfection of their homes. The draconian measures triggered wave after wave of outcry, severely eroding public trust in the Shanghai government.\n\nThe lockdown also wracked havoc on the economy. China’s GDP shrunk by 2.6% in the three months ending in June, while youth unemployment hit a record high of nearly 20%.\n\nBut the costly lockdown did not prod China to shift away from its zero-tolerance approach. Rather, officials hailed it as a victory in the war against Covid. Other local governments came away with the lesson that they must curb infections at all cost, before outbreaks spiraled out of control.\n\nCovid workers disinfect a residential community under lockdown in Shanghai in April. VCG/Visual China Group/Getty Images\n\nParty Congress\n\nAs the party’s all-important national congress approached, the pressure only grew.\n\nHaving tied himself so closely to zero-Covid, Xi was stuck in a trap of his own making. He couldn’t afford to move away from it, the potential surge of infections and deaths posing too great a risk to his authority before he secured his norm-shattering third term at the congress.\n\nAnd so instead of vaccinating the elderly and bolstering ICU capacity, authorities wasted the next crucial months building larger quarantine facilities, rolling out more frequent mass testing, and imposing wider lockdowns that at one point affected more than 300 million people.\n\nBut even the most stringent measures failed to tame Omicron’s spread. By October, China was reporting thousands of daily infections again. Amid mounting public frustration, the People’s Daily, the party’s main mouthpiece, insisted zero-Covid is “sustainable” and the country’s “best choice.”\n\nAt the opening of the congress, Xi gave a sweeping endorsement of his Covid policy, saying it had “prioritized the people and their lives above all else.” He scored a big political victory, securing a third term and stacking the party’s top ranks with staunch allies – including those who had loyally carried out his Covid policies.\n\nOfficials took the hint and became ever more zealous in enforcing zero-Covid, dashing hopes that the country could open up after the congress.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping emerges from the 20th Party Congress with more power than ever. Tingshu Wang/Reuters\n\nNationwide protests\n\nAs restrictions tightened, more suffering and tragedy emerged from the unrelenting lockdowns.\n\nMigrant workers abandoned a locked-down Foxconn factory en masse, walking for miles to escape an outbreak at China’s largest iPhone assembling site. A 3-year-old boy died of gas poisoning in lockdown after he was blocked from being taken promptly to a hospital. A 4-month-old girl died in hotel quarantine after a 12-hour delay in medical care.\n\nThen, in late November, a deadly apartment fire in the western city of Urumqi finally ignited public anger that had been simmering for months. Many believed lockdown measures had hampered rescue efforts, despite official denials.\n\nProtests erupted across the country, on a scale unseen in decades. On university campuses and the streets of major cities, crowds gathered to call for an end to incessant Covid tests and lockdowns, with some decrying censorship and demanding greater political freedoms.\n\nIn Shanghai, protesters even demanded that Xi step down – an unimaginable act of political defiance toward the country’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades.\n\nThe nationwide demonstrations posed an unprecedented challenge to Xi. By then, Omicron had seemingly spun out of control, with the country logging a daily record of more than 40,000 infections, and the economic strain becoming too severe, with local governments running out of cash to pay huge lockdown bills.\n\nProtesters march down the streets of Beijing to call for an end to zero-Covid on November 28.

Conflicting stories emerge", "text": "Updated Feb. 11, 2026, 1:55 p.m. ET\n\nEL PASO, TX – The airspace over this border city's international airport was briefly closed on Feb. 11, although conflicting explanations have emerged about why. An administration official told USA TODAY that drones controlled by Mexican cartels had breached U.S. airspace, and the military took action to disable them.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nLate Feb. 10, the Federal Aviation Administration shut down the El Paso International Airport for 10 days – a massive and near-unprecedented amount of time to shutter a major U.S. airport. Within hours, the ban was suddenly lifted.\n\n\"The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on X, citing the acronym for the Department of War, the Trump administration's new name for the Defense Department.\n\n\"The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region. The restrictions have been lifted and normal flights are resuming.\"\n\nLater on Feb. 11, a conflicting account about the closed airspace closure began to emerge. CBS News and the New York Times reported that the military's failure to coordinate with aviation officials to test counter-drone technology had prompted the shutdown.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that the technology in question was a high-powered laser used to shoot down cartel drones that the military pushed to test before the FAA could lock down safety procedures.\n\nAsked about those reports, the Pentagon told USA TODAY it had \"nothing further to provide at this time.\"\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Feb. 11 that there was no information about drones on the border – if the United States had information, it could ask the Mexican government, she told reporters.\n\n\"The Mexican airspace did not close... We will learn what the reasons are for why the airspace closed,\" she said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, said at a news conference the same morning that she learned of the closure not through the Trump administration but through a contact within the federal workforce. According to Escobar, the Federal Aviation Administration did not notify local officials in advance and made the decision independently.\n\n“There’s no threat. There was not a threat, which is why the F.A.A. lifted this restriction so quickly,” Escobar said. “The information coming from the administration does not add up.\"\n\nEscobar said there is information she could not share publicly at this time but hoped to do so in the future. She also noted that if a drone incursion had occurred, she would have been informed.\n\n“This is not the way the federal government should function,” Escobar said, adding that the full impact of the closure remains unclear. “We have to see what this is.”\n\nTrump has threatened land strikes in Mexico\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to launch military strikes on cartel-linked land targets in Mexico.\n\n\"We are going to now start hitting land with regard to the cartels,\" he told Fox News last month.\n\n\"The cartels are running Mexico. It's very, very sad to watch and see what's happening to their country.\"\n\nExperts said drone incursions across the U.S.-Mexico border are not new, but announcing that an airspace will be closed for 10 days is highly unusual.\n\nU.S. military and local law enforcement officials have in recent years aired growing concerns over encounters with drones controlled by criminal organizations at the U.S.-Mexico border. In New Mexico, for instance, lawmakers are weighing a bill to crack down on drones used by criminal organizations.\n\nHenry Ziemer, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Americas Program, said \"thousands\" of drones cross the U.S.-Mexico border every year, and \"thousands more\" are used on the Mexican side by organized crime to monitor border patrol, look for weak spots on the border, or fly over drugs.\n\nThe 10-day airspace closure announced by aviation officials \"seems out of sync with what we know the threat to be,\" Ziemer said.\n\nZiemer said that opened two possibilities – that the drone incursion that triggered the closure was uniquely dangerous, or that the Trump administration was \"experimenting with airspace closures along the border as a means of being able to take more forceful actions against cartels.\"\n\nTrump has reportedly mulled the idea of direct strikes on cartels since his first term. Mark Esper, his then-defense secretary, recounted in his memoir that Trump asked him at least twice in 2020 whether the military could \"shoot missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs.”\n\nIn the past year, multiple news outlets have reported that Trump was reconsidering the idea. The New York Times reported in February of 2025 that the CIA had expanded secret drone flights over Mexico to search for fentanyl labs.\n\nAdam Isacson, the director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the U.S. military has shared intelligence from surveillance drone flights over Mexico with the Mexican government for decades. But deploying U.S. armed drones within Mexican airspace would cross a line.\n\n\"It would blow to bits the multifaceted relationship\" between the United States and Mexico, he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has launched 38 known strikes on boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific that have killed at least 130 people, whom it claimed were trying to bring drugs to the United States. Those strikes have been widely decried as illegal and inhumane, and the administration has never provided evidence that the boats carried drugs. The family members of two men killed in the strikes sued the Trump administration last month.\n\nDays before the military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3, Trump also publicly revealed a CIA-led drone strike on a Venezuelan port. The reason for that strike is not clear, but news outlets reported that U.S. officials believed the port was being used for drug trafficking.\n\nJeff Abbott reports for El Paso Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/11/06/airports-flights-affected-by-shutdown-cuts-updates/87123116007/", "title": "Flight cuts live updates; Delta cancelations; how to request refunds", "text": "Nov. 6, 2025 Updated Nov. 7, 2025, 8:55 a.m. ET\n\nEditor's note: Read USA TODAY's live coverage of flight cancellations due to the ongoing government shutdown for Friday, Nov. 7.\n\nAmericans are bracing for flight cancellations at dozens of major airports across the country due to the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that there would be a 10% reduction in flights at 40 airports, and Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford told CEOs of major airlines the cuts would start at 4% on Friday. They'll rise to 5% on Saturday and 6% on Sunday before hitting 10% late next week.\n\nThe announcement sent airlines scrambling to rework schedules and field a flood of questions from consumers as concern grows about how the move will affect travelers. The news comes just weeks ahead of a busy holiday travel season.\n\n\"I think it's going to lead to more cancellations, but we are going to work with the airlines to do this in a systematic way,\" Duffy said at a Wednesday news conference.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nThe cuts come days after Duffy warned air travel could be disrupted due to the mounting pressure on the country's air traffic controllers. The government shutdown, which has lasted 37 days, has forced about 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 security screeners to work without pay.\n\nThursday evening, Duffy and Federal Aviation Administration administrator Brian Bedford cited the 40 high-traffic airports affected by flight reductions as part of a statement outlining proactive steps they said they were taking to maintain safety standards.\n\n\"Since the beginning of the shutdown, controllers have been working without pay, and staffing triggers at air traffic facilities across the country have been increasing,\" the statement said. \"This has resulted in increased reports of strain on the system from both pilots and air traffic controllers.\"\n\nLast week, it said, more than 2,700 delays were reported at various airports.\n\n\"My department has many responsibilities, but our number one job is safety,\" Duffy said. \"This isn't about politics. It's about assessing the data and alleviating building risk in the system.... It's safe to fly today, and it will continue to be safe to fly next week because of the proactive actions we are taking.\"\n\nThe statement said airlines would be required to issue full refunds and would not be required to cover secondary costs -- the standard procedure when flight cancellations or delays are not the carrier's fault.\n\nThe order does not affect international flights but airlines are free to cancel such flights at their own discretion, it said.\n\n'I didn’t want to be stranded at the airport'\n\nChicago O’Hare International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the country, serving as a popular hub and a destination. On Thursday, the eve of the FAA flight cuts, people were still arriving as usual.\n\nMembers of a boys hockey team from Florida collected their hockey sticks from the oversized baggage area. Some teenage girls in matching hoodies chatted near the baggage claim carousel, and a group in traditional Orthodox Jewish garb congregated on the curb outside terminal 3.\n\nTravelers told USA TODAY they were anxious but hopeful they would get home without issue. Three women waiting by the door in arrivals said they all traveled from different places for a religious gathering.\n\n“I’m concerned about Monday,” Sister Carol Weaver from Connecticut said of her return flight. “I thought about canceling two nights ago. I didn’t want to be stranded at the airport with my medical issues. I do hope there’s some progress between now and Monday.”\n\nO’Hare is expected to be one of the 40 airports to have flights reduced due to the air traffic controller shortage, made worse by the government shutdown.\n\nWhat should you do if your flight is delayed or canceled? Latest on rebooking, refunds\n\nIf your flight is canceled, Scott Keyes, founder of Going, recommended using the airlines' mobile app to rebook as soon as possible. If passengers need to speak with someone by phone, Keyes suggested calling one of the carrier’s international lines.\n\n\"The best thing travelers can do is to be as proactive as possible switching to a new flight,” Keyes told USA TODAY. “When a flight gets canceled, all of a sudden hundreds of passengers need new itineraries. There may only be a handful of seats left on the best flights, and it's a first-come, first-(served) endeavor.”\n\nIf your flight is affected by shutdown-related staffing issues, you may not be entitled to much. FAA staffing is considered outside of an airline’s control, so carriers aren’t on the hook in the same way they would be for delays caused by mechanical issues or other problems on their end.\n\nStill, if your flight is canceled for any reason, including a shortage of air traffic controllers, you’re entitled to a full refund if you choose not to fly on alternative itineraries offered by your airline. The same goes for “significant” delays or changes.\n\nFAA sets sights on flight cuts\n\nThe FAA plans to direct airlines to begin cutting flights beginning at 6 a.m. ET on Friday, Reuters reported. The outlet cited a draft order.\n\nThe FAA did not immediately respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment. The Department of Transportation previously said the cuts would impact 40 high-traffic airports around the U.S.\n\n– Nathan Diller\n\nDelta Air Lines cancels 170 flights ahead of Friday\n\nDelta Air Lines said Thursday that it will begin reducing some flights on Friday while maintaining access to all the cities it currently serves.\n\n“We’re operating the vast majority of our schedule and intend to keep access to all of the markets we serve, though frequency may be affected,” the airline said in a statement.\n\nTo minimize last-minute disruptions, Delta said it is treating these reductions similarly to how it would handle weather-related events. The carrier plans to cancel flights a day in advance so travelers have time to rebook before arriving at the airport. That approach is meant to reduce crowding and prevent day-of travel surprises.\n\nDelta said it expects to cancel approximately 170 flights on Friday, across both Delta and Delta Connection services. Saturday should see fewer cancellations, the airline said, because demand and daily departures are typically lower on weekends. Delta operates about 5,000 flights a day system-wide.\n\nA travel waiver is now in place to offer customers additional flexibility to rebook without change fees.\n\nUnited plans to cut hundreds of flights\n\nUnited Airlines started canceling flights scheduled for the weekend in light of the FAA directive, the carrier said.\n\nUnited said on Thursday it plans to cut 4% of its flights over the weekend. United operates around 4,500 flights a day, and the cuts will result in less than 200 daily cancellations, the carrier confirmed.\n\nDenver seeks to supports air traffic controllers amid shutdown\n\nIn Denver, city officials are seeking permission to pay the airport’s air traffic controllers during the shutdown. Area leaders are also running a special food bank at the airport for federal workers impacted by the shutdown.\n\n“As the shutdown drags on, air traffic controllers, in particular, are being stressed unnecessarily,” said DEN CEO Phil Washington in a statement. “As part of our airport family, it’s our hope that we can reduce the hardship on them by covering their wages during the shutdown, with reimbursement by the FAA later.\"\n\n\"We would love to be able to do more and provide wage support for all the federal workers at DEN, as they are all critical to our operation, but given the number of federal employees, we are only able to support controllers at this time,” he added.\n\nWhile airport officials had not yet heard back on the pay issue, donations were piling up at the airport inside black plastic totes: diapers and canned goods, stuffing and ramen noodles.\n\nHow do I check if my flight is canceled?\n\nWith airlines reducing flights due to air traffic control staffing shortages, travelers shouldn’t wait until they’re already at the airport to learn whether they’re affected. The most important step, experts say, is to monitor your flight early and often.\n\nStart by downloading your airline’s mobile app and turning on push and text notifications. Hopper economist Hayley Berg says travelers should be checking days in advance — not just the night before.\n\n“If you have a flight scheduled or you’re scheduling one, sign up for text message notifications or sign up for alerts from the airline on the app on your phone,” Berg said. “A couple of days before your flight, just check in. Make sure that there haven’t been any changes that haven’t been communicated to you yet.”\n\nMany airlines also offer a “Where’s My Plane?” feature in their apps. This lets you see whether the aircraft scheduled to operate your flight has arrived, is delayed en route, or hasn’t departed yet from its previous airport — an early signal of trouble.\n\n−Josh Rivera\n\nFlyers fret about flight cuts at Denver airport\n\nAt Denver International Airport, no flights appeared to have been canceled as of noon on Thursday, but flyers were concerned about the potential impacts.\n\n“I’d say wary,” said Anna Gionfriddo, 26, an environmental engineer who flew in from Charlotte earlier in the day.\n\nThe Denver airport is one of United Airlines’ busiest hubs. It served more than 82 million passengers last year.\n\nSitting near a Southwest baggage claim, Gionfriddo and Margot Childs, 27, chatted as they waited for the remaining members of their bachelorette party to arrive from Texas.\n\nChilds, who flew in from Atlanta, said her flight was delayed due to aircraft issues. But she wasn’t sure it was related to ongoing air traffic delays.\n\nThe “mountains and martinis” themed party weekend in the mountain town of Breckenridge is set to end on Sunday, and both women said there would be worse things than staying a few extra days.\n\n“It’s definitely a concern flying back but we’re already here, and I’ll guess we’ll hope for the best,” Childs said.\n\nIs it safe to fly during the shutdown?\n\nYes. Despite concerns about staffing issues at airports during the government shutdown, experts have stressed that airline travel remains safe.\n\nBedford said during a Wednesday news conference that the agency has seen \"some evidence that fatigue is building in the system\" as the shutdown drags on. The cuts, he said, are designed to relieve pressure for air traffic controllers who are covering longer hours and working more days.\n\nSome airline CEOs have pressed Bedford for more details on the undisclosed safety data that led the FAA to take such drastic action. U.S. Representative Rick Larsen, the top Democrat on the committee that oversees the FAA, also called on the agency to explain its \"dramatic and unprecedented step.\"\n\nAtlanta, Boston brace for flight cuts\n\nA spokesperson for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport − the nation's busiest by passenger volume − said in a statement to USA TODAY the airport is currently operating without disruption. But officials are aware it has been identified as one of those that will be affected by the shutdown-related flight cuts.\n\n\"Therefore, we are preparing to activate measures to ensure that passengers who may be affected by the FAA flight reductions continue to have an optimal experience,\" the statement said.\n\nBoston's Logan International Airport confirmed it is among those the FAA says will see flight reductions \"to maintain the operational safety of the nation’s airspace,\" Samantha Decker, a spokesperson for Massport, said in a statement.\n\n\"For those traveling over the next few days, we do anticipate delays and cancellations and strongly urge passengers to check with their airline before coming to the airport,\" Decker said.\n\nOne-way car rentals surging, Hertz says\n\nAs travelers face potential disruptions to flight schedules, some appear to be opting to drive to their destination instead. Car rental company Hertz reported seeing an increase in one-way bookings for Saturday, when air traffic is set to be cut by 5%.\n\nReservations for one-way rentals for through Sunday have spiked over 20% year-over-year since the announcement, according to the company. Hertz CEO Gil West joined airlines in calling for an end to the government shutdown in a statement.\n\n\"We join the airlines in urging Congress to swiftly pass a clean continuing resolution and restore certainty for travelers,\" West said. \"Every day of delay creates unnecessary disruption.\"\n\nWhich 40 airports are facing flight reductions?\n\nMajor airports in New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles and more are included in the list of 40 sites facing flight reductions, according to reports from ABC News and CBS News, which cited anonymous sources. USA TODAY has reached out to the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe other airports named to face flight cuts are listed here, but could change when an official list is released by the FAA, according to reports from ABC News and CBS News.\n\nWhich airports will be affected? Here's a full list of the 40 airports facing flight reductions, per reports\n\n‒ James Powel and Jay Cannon\n\nWhat are the airlines saying?\n\n▶ Delta Air Lines in a statement shared with USA TODAY said it expects to operate the vast majority of its flights as scheduled, including all long-haul international flights.\n\n▶ United Airlines said that the airline will make rolling updates to its schedule as the record-breaking government shutdown continues and will provide travelers \"several days' advance notice\" of changes to minimize disruption.\n\n▶ Southwest Airlines said it is evaluating how the flight restrictions will \"affect our schedule and will communicate directly with customers as soon as possible,\" the company told USA TODAY in an emailed statement.\n\n▶ American Airlines told USA TODAY that flights on Thursday will operate as planned and they are waiting for the FAA to provide additional information to \"determine which flights will be impacted.\"\n\n\"We expect the vast majority of our customers’ travel will be unaffected,\" American Airlines said. \"We will proactively reach out to customers who are impacted.\"\n\n▶ Alaska Airlines said it and Hawaiian Airlines, which it acquired last year, had begun canceling a limited number of flights beginning Friday. The airline said it was working to ensure \"smaller and remote communities... reliant on air travel\" would be protected. In a statement posted on X, the airline said most cancellations would be on routes with a higher frequency of flights, \"allowing most guests to be reaccommodated with as little disruption as possible.\"\n\n'Disruption Assistance' sales soar\n\nFollowing the announcement of impending flight reductions, travel platform Hopper said it saw a 40% surge overnight in flyers adding Disruption Assistance, which allows travelers to re-book their flight on any airline if their flight is canceled or delayed for at least 2 hours by the airline, according to the company's website. Passengers can also opt for a 100% refund for their ticket and keep their original reservation.\n\nSince the start of the shutdown, Hopper said sales of Disruption Assistance have skyrocketed over 60%.\n\nWill cuts affect FedEx's shipping operations?\n\nAmong the 40 affected high-impact airports is Memphis International Airport, a critical hub for Memphis-based FedEx's global shipping operations. The airport is North America's busiest cargo airport and the world's second-busiest behind Hong Kong International Airport.\n\nThe logistics behemoth leases more than 34 million square feet of space from the airport and operates nearly 400 flights daily from Memphis — most of them overnight,outside the FAA-restricted time frame.\n\n\"We are monitoring the FAA’s plans to adjust flight capacity across the U.S. and are developing the necessary operational modifications to ensure our shipments continue to move safely and swiftly through our network,\" FedEx said in a statement issued Thursday. \"Our contingency plans will flex our integrated air and ground network to help protect time-sensitive, critical shipments such as lifesaving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other products moving through our network.”\n\nContributing: Eve Chen, Karissa Waddick and Nathan Diller, USA TODAY; Bailey Allen, USA TODAY Network - New England; Corey Davis, USA TODAY Network - Memphis; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/25/israel-war-college-protests-live-updates/73449767007/", "title": "College protests live updates: USC cancels main graduation ...", "text": "April 25, 2024 Updated April 26, 2024, 12:41 p.m. ET\n\nEditor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the college campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war for Thursday, April 25. For the latest news on the protests view our live updates file for Friday, April 26.\n\nNEW YORK − Protesters at Columbia University, an epicenter of growing student dissent against the war in Gaza, faced a deadline Thursday to dismantle their encampment as protests and arrests intensified across the nation.\n\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik warned students that if the tents aren't moved by Friday, \"we will have to consider options for restoring calm to campus.\"\n\nIn an update late Thursday, the university said talks between student protestors and the school have \"shown progress and are continuing.\" The school, the scene of more than 100 arrests in recent days, also shut down rumors that the New York City Police Department was invited to the campus on Thursday night.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson lashed out Thursday at Columbia protesters, who booed him during his visit to the school a day earlier. Johnson had criticized students and faculty who participated in the protest and called for Shafik's resignation.\n\n\"Hamas backed these protests at Columbia,\" Johnson said in a social media post. \"The things that have happened at the hands of Hamas are horrific, and yet these protestors are out there waving flags for the very people who committed those crimes. This is not who we are in America.\"\n\nDemonstrators across the nation are protesting the civilian toll in Gaza, where more than 34,000 people have died since the Israeli invasion that followed a Hamas-led attack that killed almost 1,200 people in Israel. Students oppose U.S. military aid to Israel and want their schools to stop investing endowment money in companies with Israeli links.\n\nMeanwhile, amid the turmoil, the University of Southern California said it was canceling its main commencement ceremony, citing safety concerns.\n\nColumbia says encampments will shrink: Scores of protesters arrested at USC\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Protesters were shoved with riot shields and handcuffed with zip ties by state police at Indiana University on Thursday after being told by officers to take down tents that had been set up for a Gaza solidarity encampment. Officers detained 33 people after they refused to take down the tents and disperse, according to an Indiana University Police statement released Thursday night.\n\n∎ In Columbus, Ohio, hundreds of Ohio State University students, faculty and members of the local Arab community rallied Thursday and set up tents outside the student union. Shortly before 11 p.m. local time, protestors were starting to leave the area after nearly six hours of chants, prayers and construction of tents. Columbus Dispatch, part of the USA TODAY Network, reporters at the scene witnessed police arresting more than a dozen people.\n\n∎ At UCLA, Students for Justice in Palestine set up an encampment Thursday on Royce Quad. \"We are not leaving until our demands are met,\" the group said in an Instagram post. Also in Los Angeles, the University of Southern California declared its campus closed and asked the L.A. Police Department to clear a demonstration after it arrested 94 people linked to a protest Wednesday.\n\n∎ Two graduate students at Princeton University were arrested for trespassing and tents were taken down Thursday after scores of students attended a rally, the university said. At another Ivy League school, Cornell, students set up a pre-dawn encampment demanding the university divest from companies with links to the war in Gaza and end its relationship with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.\n\n∎ About 70 students from Washington, D.C.-area universities, including Georgetown and the George Washington, formed an encampment of 25 tents on GW’s campus early Thursday morning. They are protesting their schools’ investment of funds in companies doing business with Israel, the Georgetown Voice reported.\n\n∎ In Boston, Emerson College President Jay Bernhardt canceled classes Thursday \"as we respond to, and process, the events of last night.\" Police spokesperson Michael Torigian said 108 arrests were made and four officers injured late Wednesday when police took down an encampment. Emerson Students for Justice in Palestine was encouraging protesters to rally at police precincts across the city.\n\nFrom Harvard to UT Austin to USC, college protests over Gaza are spreading. See our map.\n\nPro-Palestinian advocacy group files federal complaint against Columbia\n\nA pro-Palestinian advocacy group filed a federal civil rights complaint against Columbia University in response to last week's mass arrest of protesters after the university called police to clear encampments, the group said Thursday.\n\nPalestine Legal urged the U.S. Education Department to investigate the university's actions, which the group alleged as \"discriminatory treatment of Palestinian students and their allies.\" The organization said they're representing four students and Students for Justice in Palestine, a student group that the university suspended.\n\nUSC calls off main graduation ceremony over safety concerns\n\nTen days after revoking the valedictorian’s speech, the University of Southern California went a step further Thursday and canceled its main graduation ceremony amid the series of pro-Palestinian protests roiling college campuses, including USC’s own.\n\nAs it did when announcing April 15 that biomedical engineering student Asna Tabassum would no longer deliver her address at commencement, the school said security challenges prompted the decision. Tabassum, who is Muslim, had drawn strong backlash the school said had \"an alarming tenor\" after espousing pro-Palestinian views on social media.\n\n\"With the new safety measures in place this year, the time needed to process the large number of guests coming to campus will increase substantially,\" USC said in Thursday's announcement. \"As a result, we will not be able to host the main stage ceremony that traditionally brings 65,000 students, families, and friends to our campus all at the same time and during a short window.\"\n\nThe university said the usual individual-school ceremonies, where students have their names called, walk across the stage and pick up their diplomas, will still be held, along with other graduation events.\n\nTwo weeks ahead of the May 8-11 commencement, the university was rocked Wednesday by antiwar demonstrations that led officials to call in the Los Angeles Police Department and close campus. It remained shut Thursday.\n\nColumbia negotiation clock ticks amid more protests\n\nColumbia administrators said Thursday evening they remain in contact with New York City police amid a planned extremist protest just outside campus gates, happening with just hours left in the university’s two-day timeframe for negotiating with organizers of the student encampment.\n\nThe university remained committed to removing the encampment, spokesperson Ben Chang said in a press briefing, noting, “We have our demands, they have theirs.” Columbia did not clarify its timeframe for clearing out the tents, but said it remains in \"constant contact\" with the NYPD.\n\nBen Chang said in a press briefing that Mayor Eric Adams earlier convened a meeting of university presidents, including Shafik, about the ongoing campus demonstrations. A campus alert encouraged people to avoid streets just outside of the grounds, where far-right Christian activists planned to gather to support Israel while pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel demonstrators rallied in front of a heavy police presence.\n\nStudents have said the negotiating period was stopped as a result of what they described as threats from the university to send in the National Guard and NYPD. Negotiations resumed as of 10 a.m. Thursday, said organizer Sueda Polat, a graduate student.“We believe we are making progress, and the rest is yet to be seen,” she said. Polat declined to say when the 48-hour window ends, but said the timeline is being negotiated. “If there is involvement of police or National Guard − or the threat of involvement of police or National Guard − that is clearly a violation of good-faith negotiations, and negotiations would not proceed,” she said. “It's why they stopped in the first place.''\n\nChang said there's no reason to believe Columbia would call for the National Guard.\n\nEmory student newspaper: Police using 'gas' on protesters\n\nAt Emory University in Atlanta, The Emory Wheel reported officers from the Emory Police Department, Atlanta Police Department and Georgia State Patrol \"began using gas and arresting protesters\" Thursday morning, a few hours after protesters set up tents in the school's Quadrangle. University President Gregory Fenves said most of the protesters were not associated with the university. Videos from the scene showed chaos as police arrived and students began running. One person appeared to be held down by three officers.\n\nThe Council on American–Islamic Relations in Georgia condemned the use of force at Emory.\n\n\"Protesters shared a day of cultural learning and community despite which Emory deployed excessive use of force, tear gas, and rubber bullets,\" CAIR said in a social media post.\n\nColumbia trustees express support for president Shafik\n\nColumbia’s board of trustees threw its weight behind Shafik on Thursday ahead of the threat of a censure vote. The board said in a statement it “strongly supports” Shafik, the former president of the London School of Economics who, in her first year on the job, is steering Columbia through its most tumultuous school year since the Vietnam War era.\n\n“During the search process for this role, President Shafik told us that she would always take a thoughtful approach to resolving conflict, balancing the disparate voices that make up a vibrant campus like Columbia’s, while taking a firm stance against hatred, harassment and discrimination,” the board wrote in the public announcement. “That's exactly what she's doing now.”\n\nThe support came amid expectations the university senate, Columbia's main governing body, may vote Friday on a resolution to formally censure Shafik over her decision to call the New York City Police Department to the Manhattan campus last week. The move must be sponsored by a committee, which hasn't happened yet, decreasing the likelihood it will come up for a vote.\n\nThe resolution, obtained by USA TODAY, accuses Shafik of a “violation of the fundamental requirements of academic freedom and shared governance” and an “unprecedented assault on students’ rights.”\n\nThe motion deliberately does not call for her resignation, though. Some faculty leaders think Shafik’s departure would hand a win to politicians that have, in their view, improperly interfered in campus affairs, as expressed by the American Association of University Professors.\n\n− Zachary Schermele\n\nJill Stein, other politicians visit students at Columbia encampment\n\nDr. Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, spent 45 minutes Thursday speaking and taking photos with students at the encampment in Columbia's West Lawn. U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, whose daughter attends the all-women's Barnard College − affiliated with Columbia − also visited.\n\nIn a brief interview with USA TODAY, Stein said, “We are seeing courageous young people with a clear vision standing up to say these are our First Amendment rights.\n\n“These are absolutely essential, that we have a right to debate and to discuss these critical actions that are taking place right now,” Stein added. “We have a right to oppose them.''\n\nCornel West, another third-party candidate and a philosopher, visited a week ago after the university called New York City police, who arrested more than 100 students in a smaller encampment nearby. He also spoke to students occupying the West Lawn, where the current encampment now stands. Students have since formed a gathering space on the grass with rows of tents, along with food distribution, first aid and clothing.\n\nTroopers in riot gear break up University of Texas protest\n\nAt the University of Texas in Austin, the Palestine Solidarity Committee posted a call to \"Stand with the Arrested, Stand with Gaza,\" urging professors and students to join a rally Thursday. On Wednesday, state troopers in riot gear and police on horseback broke up a protest at the school, and 57 people were booked into the Travis County Jail in connection to the protest, Travis County sheriff's office spokesperson Kristen Dark said.\n\nPavithra Vasudevan, a professor at UT, said students had planned an educational event about Palestinians for the afternoon and had asked faculty members to lead workshops. Vasudevan said he was present when police began arresting protesters.\n\n“The president and university administration chose to militarize our campus in response … to students gathering to express themselves,” Vasudevan said.\n\nAll 57 people have had their charges disposed of, Dark said, but it was unclear how many people had been released from the jail as of Thursday morning.\n\nUniversity of Texas President Jay Hartzell told a state lawmaker that he and other officials sought help from state law enforcement for the protest Wednesday because “our police force couldn’t do it alone,” according to text messages obtained by the American-Statesman, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nHours after state troopers marched to the University of Texas campus to disperse the crowd, Texas state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt sent a message to Hartzell and University of Texas System Chancellor J.B. Milliken questioning the law enforcement response.\n\n“It appears the state is treating UT Austin differently than other campuses,” Eckhardt wrote at 6:07 p.m. Wednesday, according to the message, obtained under the Texas Public Information Act. “I’ve not seen reports of DPS in tactical gear sent to other campuses. Did UT Austin ask for this heightened presence?”\n\nMichigan State president considering action on encampment\n\nAt Michigan State University, a student coalition set up a Gaza solidarity encampment, asking for the school to divest from Israeli firms and weapons manufacturers. Students from the coalition have attended every Board of Trustees meeting since October pressing for the change in investments.\n\nMSU President Kevin Guskiewicz told the State Journal, part of the USA TODAY network, that he respected student rights to protest but was concerned about safety. He said he would follow local ordinances in deciding whether to take action.\n\n\"I don't want to be known as a place that has shut down free speech, or one's ability to express themselves,\" he said. \"College campuses have been the epicenter for activism and protests for decades.\"\n\n− Sarah Atwood, Lansing State Journal\n\nBrandeis University reaches out to Jewish students elsewhere\n\nBrandeis University, a Massachusetts school founded by the American Jewish community to counter antisemitism 76 years ago, is extending it's transfer application period to May 31 because of the \"current climate\" at other schools. School President Ron Liebowitz issued a statement Tuesday saying it is \"unacceptable\" that protests on some campuses have resulted in Jewish students being attacked physically and verbally because they are Jewish or support Israel, he said.\n\nHe said the school welcomes \"Jews and students from every background\" who are looking for an educational environment striving to be free of \"Jew-hatred.\"\n\n\"Brandeis has been committed to protecting the safety of all its students,\" Liebowitz said. \"In the current atmosphere, we are proud of the supports we have in place to allow Jewish students to thrive.\"\n\nHamas, Iran applaud US protests: Militant groups offer public support\n\nHamas, Iran express support for US protesters\n\nA senior Hamas official and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly applauded the growing number of protests against the war in Gaza and encampments that have sprung up on college campuses from California to Massachusetts and have become a flashpoint in the U.S.\n\nIzzat Al-Risheq, a member of the militant group's Political Bureau, said Wednesday that President Joe Biden's administration is violating the rights of students and faculty members and arresting them \"because of their rejection of the genocide of Palestinian people\" in Gaza.\n\nKhamenei issued a statement on social media celebrating the flying of Hezbollah's flag in the streets of the U.S. \"The people of the world are supporting the Resistance Front because they are resisting & because they are against oppression,\" the post read.\n\n− Romina Ruiz-Goiriena\n\nWhy are students protesting on college campuses?\n\nThe protesters opposed to Israel's military attacks in Gaza say they want their schools to stop funneling endowment money to Israeli companies and other businesses, like weapons manufacturers, that profit from the war in Gaza. It is not easy to define what an \"investment\" in Israel entails, said economist Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies college finances. She said bigger investments are more obvious than smaller ones tucked away in mutual funds.\n\nColumbia University, a focal point for the protests, has one of the largest school endowments in the nation at more than $13 billion.\n\n\"Why is our money being used to fund bombs overseas?\" said Layla Saliba, a student protester researching endowment investments with the group Columbia University Apartheid Divestment. \"Let's reinvest this money in our community instead.\"\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; Lily Kepner, Tony Plohetski and Bayliss Wagner, Austin American-Statesman; Shahid Meighan and Cole Behrens, Columbus Dispatch; Brian Rosenzweig, The Herald-Times; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/16/business/airline-pilots-fatigue-safety", "title": "Fatigue is starting to put safety at risk, pilots say | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nPilots at Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines say pilot exhaustion is on the rise, and they’re pressing the airlines treat fatigue and the mistakes that result as a safety risk.\n\n“Fatigue, both acute and cumulative, has become Southwest Airlines’ number-one safety threat,” the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, or SWAPA, told airline executives in a letter this week.\n\nThe causes, the pilots say, include cancellation chaos caused by severe weather, and climbing demand for air travel testing the mettle of still-recovering airlines.\n\nPassenger numbers are about 90% of 2019 levels this month, according to Transportation Security Administration data, but major US passenger airlines are about 3,000 employees short from that time period, according to Bureau of Transportation Statistics data. Thousands of pilots retired – either by choice or aging out at 65 – during the pandemic, and research presented by the Regional Airline Association says 2,000 pilots reach mandatory retirement age this year. Mandatory retirement numbers are expected to grow over the next 6 years.\n\nSouthwest executives identified staffing as one of their key priorities this year, setting a goal of hiring 8,000 new employees. Forty percent of those will be flight crews.\n\nMore hiring alone will not solve the fatigue issues, SWAPA president Casey Murray says.\n\n“A lot of our delays and issues that we’re having have to do more with scheduling and connecting pilots with airplanes,” Murray told CNN in an interview. “It is inefficient scheduling processes that are affecting when we work in a very dynamic environment.”\n\nThe union wrote in the letter to executives that the number of pilots who reported being unable to work because of fatigue skyrocketed last fall, including a 600% spike in October, and hit “another staggering 330% increase” last month. “April is already setting fatigue records,” SWAPA wrote.\n\nFederal rules set baseline limits on hours pilots may work and require rest periods. The limits for major US airlines include 30 hours of flying time each week and at a minimum 9 hours of rest between shifts.\n\nBut pilots report the stresses of the job and changes because of storms can leave them worn out before hitting those benchmarks.\n\nSouthwest Airlines acknowledged a climb in fatigue reports filed last month – 35 reports for every 10,000 duty periods, compared to 10 reports for the same metric in March 2019. Spokeswoman Brandy King said the numbers show an effective system.\n\n“The increase is expected, as it’s common to experience an elevated level of fatigue calls during irregular operations and in March, the industry faced weather and airspace delays that resulted in disruptions across the network,” King wrote in a statement to CNN. “The March increase in Pilot fatigue calls is a result of the system working as designed, allowing Crew to determine if they are too fatigued to fly.”\n\nDelta Air Lines pilots are holding a series of demonstrations at airports this month drawing attention to their fatigue concerns.\n\n“Our pilots are tired and fatigued,” Evan Baach, a captain at Delta and official with Air Line Pilots Association, or ALPA, told CNN affiliate KSL at a Salt Lake City airport protest. He said pilots are working “longer days with shorter nights at home.”\n\nJason Ambrosi, chairman of the Delta group at ALPA, said that pilots are responsible as “the last line of defense” in aviation safety but “too often we are being pushed to our limits as Delta tries to add back flying and capture revenue.”\n\nALPA wrote in a message to Delta members last month that the pandemic presented “several opportunities for Delta to re-set its broken pilot staffing issue.” As air travel rebounds now, the union wrote, unresolved problems are becoming more apparent: The number of pilots available to step in and cover for an issue caused by weather, maintenance, or a sick colleague is significantly smaller.\n\n“Delta Flight Operations continues to run the operation at red line,” the union note reads. “So, if it feels like you are working more and seeing less control over your schedule – you are right; you are.”\n\nDelta told CNN that its scheduling follows federal rules for pilot work and rest hours.\n\n“We continuously evaluate our staffing models and plan ahead so that we can recover quickly when unforeseen circumstances arise, and the resilience of the Delta people is unmatched in that regard,” spokesman Morgan Durrant said. “All of our people, including our pilots, are working hard to restore our airline and deliver for our customers as we emerge from the pandemic. We are grateful for and proud of their efforts.”\n\nLast year, pilots from all carriers filed about 60 reports of mistakes or other incidents involving fatigue to the federal Aviation Safety Reporting System. The reports are posted to a federal website anonymously, without identifying names or airlines.\n\nSome pilots wrote they were tired after handling training responsibilities. Others said airline managers asked them to handle too many extra flights because of short staffing.\n\n“Both of us were yawning and eye rubbing halfway through our 6+ hour flight… I was physically unable to keep up,” one captain wrote in November, despite having “appropriate, average sleep the night before.”\n\n“But ‘we’ press on - don’t we?” the pilot continued. “Our threats are threefold of the pre-Covid environment. We’ve been facing delays, shortages, planning and staffing issues that are NOT being taken into account in building schedules. Why? Because we pilots are counted upon to make it work.”\n\n– CNN’s Pete Muntean and Raja Razek contributed to this report", "authors": ["Gregory Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/business/tesla-elon-musk-pay-trial-final-day", "title": "Elon Musk's $50 billion trial comes to an end today | CNN Business", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nThe trial for the Tesla shareholder lawsuit examining CEO Elon Musk’s unprecedented compensation package wrapped up Friday afternoon. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick did not issue a ruling from the bench, and it could be weeks to months before a ruling.\n\n“We have a lot of work ahead of us,” McCormick told both side’s attorneys as the trial concluded. “I won’t insult you with the typical talk I give at this point which is settlement is still achievable.”\n\nTesla awarded Musk a pay package in 2018 that helped make him the richest person on Earth. The net value of the compensation package is $50.9 billion today, after Tesla’s valuation soared more than 1,000% at its peak since shareholders approved the package.\n\nPlaintiff Richard Tornetta originally filed the lawsuit in June 2018, alleging that Musk exploited his control of Tesla and the board of directors to secure the compensation to “fund his personal ambition to colonize Mars.” The Delaware Court of Chancery has heard arguments this week in Wilmington.\n\nTornetta and his lawyers allege that Musk and the board failed to uphold their financial responsibilities to shareholders. Tesla says its board of directors has a legal responsibility for shareholders’ money in addition to overseeing management, which includes Musk.\n\nTornetta argued that the huge pay package wasn’t needed to incentivize Musk as he already owned the largest stake of Tesla.\n\nTestimony was heard this week from a who’s-who of Tesla insiders including Musk, board chair Robyn Denholm, former chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja, former board member Antonio Gracias, and board members Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch.\n\nThe trial Friday included testimony from expert witnesses.\n\nKevin Murphy, a University of Southern California business school professor, testified on behalf of Tesla and the other defendants that the pay package was reasonable. He also said that Tesla’s board members were considered independent under NASDAQ’s standards. The independence of the directors is a central theme of the case.\n\nTornetta’s lawyers have highlighted the friendships between Musk and many of his board members who created the deal. Some have vacationed together in places like magician David Copperfield’s private island in the Bahamas, where Musk summoned his brother Kimbal and Gracias in 2017 to determine if James Murdoch should join Tesla’s board, according to Kimbal’s deposition which played in court this week. Murdoch, who described himself as a friend of Elon Musk’s since 2006, joined them on Copperfield’s Island for part of the trip, and joined the board shortly thereafter.\n\nSeveral corporate governance experts told CNN Business that it’s clear Tesla’s board of directors lacks independence from Musk.\n\n“It’s safe to say that Musk has a lot of power – and probably too much power – over the Tesla board,” George S. Georgiev a professor who studies corporate governance at Emory University school of law, told CNN Business. “The Tesla board has been extremely indulgent despite Musk’s many transgressions over the years, including his skirmishes with the SEC.”\n\nDenholm, chair of Tesla’s board, revealed after extensive questioning in her testimony that she was unaware of the details of how Musk handles an SEC settlement that required him to not tweet about certain topics, such as Tesla’s financial condition and new business lines, unless he obtained pre-approval from an “experienced securities lawyer.”\n\nMusk explained in his deposition that he sends certain tweets for approval, and publishes them if he hasn’t heard back in an unspecified amount of time. That arrangement leaves open the possibility of Musk’s tweets being published without the required review.\n\nDenholm first joined Tesla’s board in 2014 and became its chair in 2018 when Musk agreed to step down from that position following SEC charges. She said in her testimony that she interviewed with Musk before joining the board of directors.\n\nGeorgiev said there’s not a lot of precedent for cases like this one because they are either dismissed or settled.\n\nGeorgiev also said this makes an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court more likely, so the case may stretch on. He pointed to a case the compensation of Michael Ovitz, a briefly-tenured Disney CEO, which stretched on for about a decade.\n\nThe Tesla board members who testified generally spoke of the huge pay package as necessary to keep Musk engaged at Tesla.\n\n“He’s got 100 company ideas in his mind. I promise you he’s only done very few of them,” Gracias testified. “And we wanted him focused. We needed him focused.”\n\nMurphy, Tesla’s expert witness, also pushed back Friday on the idea that Tesla shareholders are subsidizing Musk’s Mars mission.\n\n“I don’t think that’s any more true than USC is subsidizing my vacation.

The thing is: When you reach the top, there’s nowhere to go but down. And that’s exactly where oil is going.\n\nThe price of crude has taken a drastic plunge amid worries about slowing demand for fuel and the prospect of further tightening by the Federal Reserve leading to recession. But at the same time, shares of energy companies have continued to climb.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down more than 17% this year while shares of Exxon, Halliburton and Chevron are all up more than 45%.\n\nOil prices and energy stocks are closely interlinked — so this discrepancy is an odd one and could mean that lower gas prices may not be here to stay.\n\nWhat’s happening: The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the US benchmark, which is a large driver of gas prices, has fallen to its lowest level of the year this week — under $72 a barrel. It was trading above $120 a barrel in the summer.\n\nThe average price for gas was $3.33 a gallon on Thursday, down from its mid-June peak of more than $5 per gallon, according to AAA. That’s just under what it cost a year ago, when the national average was $3.34.\n\nBut even though gas prices are falling, they’re still higher than they have been over the past few years. That’s contributed to record-breaking profits at major energy companies like Chevron and Exxon. The net income of global oil and gas producers is expected to double in 2022 to a record $4 trillion, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nIn the third quarter, 81% of all energy companies in the S&P 500 reported earnings above estimates, the highest of any sector, according to Factset data. The energy sector reported the highest year-over-year earnings growth of all 11 sectors, at 137.3%.\n\nWhile crude prices are dropping, equities traders appear to be taking on a different bet: They’re hoping that OPEC’s recent decision to stick with supply cuts and Europe’s agreement to cap the price of Russian oil at $60 a barrel will keep the global supply of oil very tight, even if demand drops.\n\nAnd demand may not drop. Recession isn’t a given just yet, and the reopening of China from restrictive Covid-zero shutdowns could increase demand for fuel.\n\nExxon and Chevron are also speculating that crude prices will remain elevated and that demand will grow.\n\nExxon announced Thursday that it will lift capital spending next year by 10% to between $23 billion and $25 billion, with the goal of raising oil and gas production to a record 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2027. Chevron said Wednesday that it expects to spend $14 billion in 2023, adding $2 billion, or 14%, to this year’s budget.\n\nWhat’s next: In the end, the divergence may be temporary: In four of the five major splits between oil and energy stock prices since 1990, oil returned to a rally in the year that followed, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nMortgage rates fall for the fourth week in a row\n\nMortgage rates dipped again this week, dropping for the fourth week in a row, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.33% in the week ending December 8, down from 6.49% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate was 3.10%.\n\nMortgage rates have risen throughout most of 2022, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented campaign of hiking interest rates to tame soaring inflation. But mortgage rates have tumbled in the last couple of weeks, following reports suggesting inflation may have finally reached its peak.\n\nThe rate drops come amid concerns over lackluster economic growth, said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.\n\n“Over the last four weeks, mortgage rates have declined three quarters of a point, the largest decline since 2008,” said Khater. “While the decline in rates has been large, homebuyer sentiment remains low with no major positive reaction in purchase demand to these lower rates.”\n\nFTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried agrees to testify\n\nSam Bankman-Fried appears to have changed his mind about testifying before Congress.\n\nA group of prominent US lawmakers are demanding that the founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, appear before the Senate Banking Committee next week to answer “significant” questions around the collapse of his crypto empire, reports my colleague Allison Morrow.\n\nThe committee’s Democratic chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania delivered a letter to SBF and his lawyer on Wednesday demanding answers on behalf of the American people about alleged “misconduct” that led to the collapse of FTX and its sister hedge fund, Alameda.\n\n“You must answer for the failure of both entities that was caused, at least in part, by the clear misuse of client funds and wiped out billions of dollars owed to over a million creditors,” the senators wrote.\n\nBrown and Toomey said in their letter that the committee would “consider further action if he does not comply.”\n\nWill he or won’t he: A representative for his attorney referred Allison to Bankman-Fried’s tweet on Sunday in which he told Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, that he couldn’t commit to testifying at a hearing scheduled for December 13, one day before the Senate committee’s hearing.\n\n“Once I have finished learning and reviewing what happened, I would feel like it was my duty to appear before the committee and explain,” Bankman-Fried wrote. “I’m not sure that will happen by the 13th.”\n\nBut in another tweet early on Friday, Bankman-Fried said he was willing to testify on December 13. “I still do not have access to much of my data — professional or personal. So there is a limit to what I will be able to say, and I won’t be as helpful as I’d like,” he added.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/economy/xiaomi-layoff-china-tech-unemployment-intl-hnk", "title": "Xiaomi layoffs: Thousands of tech jobs cut as China's unemployment ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nXiaomi, one of the world’s largest smartphone makers, has begun layoffs in China at a time when the world’s second largest economy is grappling with an enormous unemployment crisis.\n\nThe Chinese company’s decision to slash jobs comes soon after tech giants across the world, including Meta and Twitter, have laid off thousands of workers.\n\nThe Beijing-based firm recently conducted a “routine personnel optimization and organizational streamlining,” a Xiaomi spokesperson told CNN. The measure affects less than 10% of its total workforce, the person added.\n\nWhile the company did not share any other details, multiple state media outlets in China have reported this week that Xiaomi would cut thousands of jobs across multiple departments, including its smartphone and internet business units.\n\nThe company has already made significant cuts earlier this year. In the first nine months of 2022, Xiaomi reduced its workforce by nearly 1,900, according to its financial documents. By the end of September, it had around 35,000 full-time employees, most of whom were based in China.\n\nThe company’s revenue fell nearly 10% in the third quarter of this year from a year earlier, hurt by China’s Covid restrictions and softening global demand for electronics. Sales from smartphones, which account for 60% of its revenue, dropped 11%.\n\nDiminishing tech jobs\n\nThe layoffs at the Chinese smartphone giant come at a time when the country is struggling with mounting economic challenges.\n\nNearly three years of stringent pandemic restrictions have disrupted factory and consumer activities, hitting small businesses particularly hard.\n\nThe urban unemployment rate, the broadest official measure of jobs, rose to 5.7% in November, the highest in six months, according to most recent government statistics.\n\nJob prospects for young people are especially gloomy. The jobless rate for those aged 16 to 24 reached 17.1% in November, hovering near July’s record level of 19.9%.\n\nThe situation could become worse next year, as 11.6 million college graduates are expected to enter the job market — a fresh record, according to the education ministry last month.\n\nChina’s official measures of unemployment do not break down data by industry, but company results and private surveys suggest that jobs are being lost across the economy, and perhaps nowhere is the crisis more visible than in the tech sector.\n\nThe once freewheeling industry has taken a deep hit from Beijing’s effort to crackdown on internet giants, with companies like Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) posting zero growth or even contraction in revenue for the first time in decades.\n\nAlibaba slashed its workforce by more than 15,000 in the first nine months of this year, and Tencent laid off about 4,000 employees during the same time period, according to CNN’s calculations.\n\nThe layoffs could be a big headache for the government, which says preventing job losses will be its top policy priority for next year.\n\nChina has witnessed some unprecedented protests in recent months. In November, street demonstrations erupted in multiple cities in a rare show of public anger against the country’s stringent zero-Covid policy, which was abruptly reversed in early December.\n\nIn July, disgruntled home buyers across the country threatened to stop repaying mortgages for unfinished home projects.

Later that season, she also deferred from Wimbledon, and the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\n“I felt exhausted and I felt that there is no chance I can be in the top anymore,” Halep told CNN Sport’s Christina Macfarlane in an exclusive interview with her new coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. “It was really tough to look on the bright side.”\n\nHaving dropped outside the coveted top 10 world rankings for the first time since January 2014, Halep was falling out of love with tennis.\n\nHowever, since she started working with Mouratoglou earlier this year Halep says her passion for the sport has been reignited.\n\n“I didn’t really expect that because I’m not very open to people and it’s not easy for me to trust in somebody. But it was just a great connection since the first moment I met him,” Halep says of Mouratoglou.\n\n“I was almost done before coming here because I didn’t have that fire anymore and I didn’t trust that I’m able to play at the highest level again. So coming here I found it and I discovered again why I play tennis,” she adds. “I play tennis because I love it … He brought that fire back.”\n\nSimona Halep hits a backhand return to Iga Swiatek of Poland in their WTA semifinal match at the Indian Wells tennis tournament on March 18, 2022.

Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNew beginnings\n\nIn April, Mouratoglou announced on social media that he would start coaching Halep full-time, after she visited his prestigious training academy in France ahead of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California.\n\n“I always love to watch her play. I think she has an incredible game, so she’s super exciting as a player,” Mouratoglou tells CNN Sport. “She was playing great already, but she could play much more. I could see the progress she could make.”\n\nKnown by his moniker, “The Coach,” Mouratoglou is one of the most sought-after instructors in tennis.\n\nHe started coaching in 2005, working with Marcos Baghdatis on the junior circuit and helping him get to world No. 1 at youth level, according to his official website.\n\nA year later Baghdatis got to the Australian Open final before losing to Roger Federer and also reached the Wimbledon semifinal that same season.\n\nSince then, Mouratoglou has helped an array of promising young players elevate their game, including Grigor Dimitrov, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and most notably 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams, the website adds.\n\nThe secret to his success? “Of course the passion is the most important. (If) the players don’t have the passion, they’re not going to achieve anything great,” said Mouratolgou. “So that’s the key.”\n\n“People also in their life go through moments in which they kind of maybe lose their love for the game for a period of time or have less love for the game,” he adds. “I don’t think she (Halep) lost it.”\n\nWhat makes a champion\n\nTennis students train at the Mouratoglou Academy in Biot, southeastern France, on September 23, 2021. NIcolas Tucat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEven though Romania’s Halep has 23 singles titles under her belt – including two grand slam wins – she had to adapt to an especially rigorous form of drilling at the Mouratoglou Academy.\n\nShe spent two weeks starting a new training schedule at 8:30 a.m., something she told reporters she “never did in my life,” the WTA reported.\n\n“I did it with pleasure and I did it easy. So that made me think that I still love it and I still can do it. So if I’m healthy, I think I can have a good game,” she added, according to the WTA website.\n\nAlongside her physical rehabilitation, Halep has worked with Mouratoglou on rebuilding her confidence.\n\n“He’s super open, so it’s super easy to talk to him,” she tells CNN. “I’m very emotional. I have many fears in general and I doubt myself most of the tim. And it was easy for me to actually express myself the way I am.”\n\nWhen Mouratoglou appeared in the Netflix series, “The Playbook,” in September 2020, he spoke about how a player’s mental strength can make or break their ability to become a champion.\n\nThe series follows world-renowned sports coaches as they share their personal rules for success both inside and outside the arena.\n\nSimona Halep shares a light hearted moments with coach Patrick Mouratoglou during preparation for Roland Garros on May 18, 2022 in Paris, France. Tim Clayton/Corbis Sport/Getty Images\n\n“Everyone has limits, and the limits of everyone are not technical, tactical, physical. They’re mental,” Mouratoglou told the documentary.\n\n“And when you don’t think like a champion, you don’t act like a champion and don’t win like a champion. So it’s very important to make sure the mind works right.”\n\nMouratoglou tells CNN that he has a similar approach to rebuilding a player’s psychological resilience as legendary football manager José Mourinho, who also appeared in the Netflix series.\n\n“He said something like, ‘Soccer starts with the foot, continues with the heart and finishes with the head.’”\n\n“The head is the most important … because if you don’t deeply believe that you can achieve something, you’re not going to go full. You’re going to go halfway. You’re going to find reasons not to do things. You’re going to find excuses,” Mouratoglou says.\n\n“I think a big part of my job to help people, in this case Simona, believe in themselves and their ability to achieve what they want to,” he adds. “I always tell Simona how strong she is mentally because I really believe it.\n\n“She made my job super easy, in a way, by being so open and trusting me so much.”\n\nPartnership with Serena Williams\n\nMouratoglou is no stranger to reinventing players who have hit rock bottom.\n\nIn 2012 he approached a turning point in his career, when he started coaching Williams, who had just suffered an unprecedented defeat at Roland Garros to France’s Virginie Razzano. It was the first time in Williams’ career that she had lost in the first round of a major competition.\n\nSerena Williams training with coach Patrick Mouratoglou in preparation for the 2020 French Open at Roland Garros on September 26, 2020. Tim Clayton/Corbis Sport/Getty Images\n\nShe was also in search of a grand slam victory, having gone for two years without winning a major.\n\nMouratoglou and Williams were dubbed the “Dynamic Duo” on tour and ended up tallying 10 grand slam victories together, as well as a women’s singles title at the London 2012 Olympics.\n\n“I’m super proud with what we’ve done with Serena. Now, of course, I’m super thankful for those 10 years that were incredible,” Mouratoglou says. “She’s trusted me for 10 years, which is something that you don’t see very often in the tennis world.”\n\nWilliams has not played since she retired from her first-round Wimbledon match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich in June 2021, during which she sustained a leg injury.\n\n“It’s not easy to tell someone you worked with for 10 years that you’re going to start something with someone else,” Mouratoglou adds. “It’s a 10-year relationship … where you share so many things and so many emotion and so many moments.”\n\n‘I’m ready to give my best’\n\nWhen Mouratoglou and Halep speak to CNN they’re prepping for Roland Garros, where the 30-year-old Romanian is scheduled to play against Croatia’s Ana Konjuh in the first round on Sunday.\n\nHalep has fond memories of the French Open, having won her maiden grand slam title in Paris after beating Sloane Stephens in 2018.\n\n“The French Open is my favorite grand slam,” she says. “I love the city. I feel great. I like the vibe. So everything gets together and I just feel great. It’s going to be a big challenge, this tournament, for me. I’m ready mentally. I’m ready to give my best.”\n\n“I really thought I would be done by 30,” Halep says. “I was wrong.”\n\n“I want to play few more years. I feel like I can,” she adds. “My body is okay. You know, I feel healthy. I feel that my energy level is high. So I don’t see any reason to stop now.”\n\nSimona Halep hugs the trophy as she celebrates victory following the ladies singles final against Sloane Stephens at the French Open final on June 9, 2018 in Paris, France. Cameron Spencer/Getty Images\n\nHowever, there’s one player who could stand in the way of a third grand slam tittle for Halep.\n\nPoland’s Iga Swiatek has had a meteoric rise to become world No. 1 over the past year.\n\nIn April, she clinched her fourth straight title of the 2022 season at the Stuttgart Open final, pushing her winning streak to 23 matches.\n\nAt just 20 years old, Swiatek has shown no sign of wavering. If she wins the French Open, she’ll equal Venus Williams’ record this millennium of 35 successive victories.\n\n“For the last month, Iga has shown a lot of stability physically, mentally and tennis wise. She’s super solid in everything. That’s why she’s been winning so much. But I think everybody is beatable,” Mouratoglou says.\n\nAnd Mouratoglou is confident that Halep’s mental fortitude could rival Swiatek.\n\n“She’s also a great player, but what makes her special is the fact that she’s extremely strong mentally,” he says. “I feel that also she believes in herself and the combination can do wonders.”", "authors": ["Christina Macfarlane Sana Noor Haq", "Christina Macfarlane", "Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/politics/russia-us-cyberattack-infrastructure-invs", "title": "US has 'significant' cyber vulnerabilities, but a sweeping Russian ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn the winter of 2015, computer hackers working for the Russian government attacked Ukraine’s power grid and switched off the lights and heat to more than 200,000 consumers.\n\nLast year, a cybercriminal group with operatives in Russia launched a successful ransomware attack on a key East Coast pipeline that forced the company, Colonial Pipeline, to temporarily close the spigot and pay 75 bitcoins – or $4.4 million – to bring it back online. It was the largest cyberattack on an oil facility in US history.\n\nAnd it was a Russian government lab that built tools used in one of the most dangerous cyber offensives in the history of the digital age, penetrating the control systems of a Saudi petrochemical plant in 2017 for the purpose of setting off an explosion that, had it succeeded, could have killed people.\n\nSo established is Russia’s reputation for cyber sabotage that on February 24 – as its troops began rolling into Ukraine – President Joe Biden issued a warning to the country and its autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin.\n\n“If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,” he said during remarks from the White House.\n\nBut now, even as the Russian army drops bombs and mortar shells on civilians in hospitals and neighborhoods and its invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week, no known nightmare cyber scenario — a widespread power outage, a poisoned water system, a crippled supply chain – has come to pass in Ukraine, the US or elsewhere.\n\nTo be sure, a ripple of smaller cyberattacks ricocheted through the websites of Ukrainian banks and government agencies just before the invasion, and larger attacks may still be in store for the besieged country of 43 million people.\n\nBut the general consensus among the nearly 20 experts who spoke with CNN for this story is that while Russia is well positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the US, it is not likely to do so.\n\n“We do need to consider this possibility as a low probability but high-impact scenario,” said Paul Prudhomme, the head of threat intelligence advisory at the cybersecurity firm IntSights.\n\nThe prospects for a grand-scale cyberattack in America are low, experts say. For one, Putin understands that his country’s cyber capabilities, though formidable, are outmatched by those of the United States, which is generally thought to be the most sophisticated player in the domain.\n\nThe federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told CNN it hasn’t yet received any credible cyber threats resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, but it emphasized that the energy sector has been bolstering its defenses in recent years and is on high alert as it urgently prepares for any attempted breach.\n\nExperts say Russia’s ability to conduct an impactful cyberattack in the US shouldn’t be underestimated.\n\n“If we look at just what they’ve been able to do, there is only, according to public knowledge, one country out there that has any experience taking down electric systems – that’s Russia,” said Robert M. Lee, a cybersecurity expert who investigated the 2015 attack in Ukraine.\n\nTesting the waters\n\nCyberattacks against the US by Russia are more than merely possible – they’ve been happening for years on a low-grade scale.\n\nThe country has been testing the waters in the US, laying the groundwork, experts say, for a much more extensive cyber campaign.\n\nFor instance, in 2018, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that a group of state-sponsored hackers from Russia had compromised the networks of multiple US electric utilities the year prior and allowed intruders to gather detailed information on the control systems that US electric utilities use to power American communities.\n\nThat same year, the Department of Justice announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers for carrying out large-scale cyber operations against the Democratic Party in advance of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThen, in late 2020, came the most advanced cyber-op yet: About 100 organizations around the world – including multiple US government agencies – were revealed to have been breached by Russian hackers who compromised the software provider SolarWinds and exploited their access to monitor internal operations and withdraw data.\n\n(L-R) FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna and Microsoft President Brad Smith testify during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on February 23, 2021. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nPutin has been systematically testing vulnerabilities in Europe and the US for the past four years, and is in a position to cause all sorts of economy-crushing problems, experts say.\n\n“They know how to weaponize these things – they’ve done it,” said Melissa Hathaway, who led cybersecurity initiatives in the presidential administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “If I need to cause a national crisis in another country, they know how to do this, they’ve systematically been testing the system.”\n\nPrudhomme said a stealthy Russian hacking group called Energetic Bear – which has been tied to Moscow’s Federal Security Service, or FSB – is the most likely Russian third-party, state-sponsored actor to execute any high-level attack.\n\nThe group, which industry analysts refer to by several aliases, including “Dragonfly” and “Berserk Bear,” has carried out a number of successful hacks in recent years. In 2017, it targeted a nuclear power plant in Kansas in what cybersecurity experts refer to as a “watering hole”-type attack – a practice where hackers place malicious links on websites frequently visited by employees.\n\n“The group has a history of gaining access and maintaining access to US and European utility companies, but they don’t do anything with it,” Prudhomme said. “They want to have that access ready at a moment’s notice so, if and when they get the order on demand, they can flip the switch.”\n\nIn 2020, another state-sponsored Russian group identified by analysts as Cozy Bear, believed to be within Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, likely orchestrated the SolarWinds hack. US officials said the group used SolarWinds software to breach internal email systems at the US Treasury and Commerce departments, among other key agencies, in what was one of the largest-ever cyber attacks.\n\nBut it’s a two-way street. Experts say that while it’s true Russians are lurking in the software of various structural areas, Americans are also lurking in theirs.\n\nIt’s the “cyber equivalent of mutually assured destruction,” said Karen Walsh, CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Allegro Solutions, using a term that historically described a philosophy of deterrence during the nuclear standoff of the Cold War.\n\nAnd the Americans, experts say, are currently the more capable threat.\n\nWhile Russian cyberattacks tend to attract headlines, experts told CNN, the most sophisticated hacks are often carried out in a more professionalized manner by countries such as the US and Israel, which are good at hiding their tracks. One secret operation that spilled into public view in 2010 was known as Stuxnet, in which the US and Israel are widely believed to have jointly sabotaged a nuclear facility in Iran with a computer virus that temporarily hampered the country’s nuclear program.\n\nPutin, experts say, understands the extent of this sophistication and is likely loath to poke the bear.\n\n“He seems to recognize that that’s a different level of escalation,” Timothy Frye, Columbia professor and author of “Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin’s Russia,” said of a crippling cyberattack on a major electric utility in the US or another NATO country. “That might be part of the calculations as well.”\n\nStill, some experts say, Europe’s critical infrastructure could be an enticing target for Russia. That’s in part because the continent is far more dependent on Russian oil than the US is.\n\n“I don’t think anyone’s thought through how much control Russia has over the future of Europe,” said Hathaway, now the president of Hathaway Global Strategies.\n\nPutin has been most willing to wreak havoc on the Ukrainian power grid, which the Russians also hacked in 2016 – just a year after shutting off power to more than 200,000 consumers.\n\nLee said the second attack – which reportedly took out about a fifth of the power consumption in Kyiv for an hour – was by far the more impressive of the two.\n\n“That one scared the hell out of everybody,” said Lee, now CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Dragos and a former cyber warfare specialist with the Air Force. “That was a capability they developed that could be deployed on any electric transmission site in the world and have reliable effects everywhere. Like, it was – it was bad.”\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom also have blamed the NotPetya hack of 2017 – which the Trump administration called “the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history” – on Russia.\n\nThe NotPetya attack was launched against a Ukrainian accounting software firm, but the malware spread to companies across the globe, resulting in billions of dollars in damage.\n\n“It was part of the Kremlin’s ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia’s involvement in the ongoing conflict,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in 2018.\n\nSome experts say the extensive meddling in Ukraine is due in part to how the country is seen as a kind of testing ground for belligerent cyberactivity. This is because the country’s power grid is in some ways similar in structure to those in the US and other Western countries, but Ukraine’s ability to retaliate has historically been minimal.\n\nStill, the US has seen a rise in high-profile cyberattacks. The growing threat prompted Biden to issue an executive order in May to shore up the nation’s cybersecurity and protect federal government networks. And it is a reminder that cyber defense in the United States has troubling vulnerabilities.\n\nThe US has ‘significant’ cyber vulnerabilities\n\nIf the Colonial Pipeline breach demonstrated anything, it is the extent to which critical infrastructure in America is susceptible to cyberattacks.\n\nThat event in May prompted the Georgia-based company to shut down the pipeline for the first time in its 57-year history. The six-day shutdown scrambled logistics for several airlines and caused a panic at the pump that led to shortages and briefly raised gas prices. But while it was allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker group called DarkSide, authorities haven’t been able to link it to the Kremlin. (In fact, the Russian domestic intelligence agency arrested the alleged culprit – though the hacker was not extradited.) The ordeal ended when Colonial ponied up the $4.4 million ransom — more than half of which was later recovered by the Justice Department.\n\nMotorists wait in line at a gas station on May 12, 2021 in Fayetteville, North Carolina, following the Colonial Pipeline hack. Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nThat attack, Prudhomme stressed, was financially motivated. The hackers, he said, used a compromised password found in a dark-web data dump and were able to employ an inactive VPN account to penetrate the Colonial Pipeline’s network, which didn’t use multifactor authentication.\n\n“Criminal hackers will tend to go for low-hanging fruit,” he said. “The point of entry here was fairly simple.”\n\nAnother sensitive breach happened in early 2021, when hackers – whose country of origin isn’t known – were able to gain access to a Florida water treatment facility by using dormant remote access software for the purpose of poisoning the water supply. The hack was quickly caught by a human operator at the facility. But the incident illustrates the dangers of remote access work without proper security: The plant had used multiple computers running an aging version of Microsoft Windows to monitor the facility remotely. All of the computers shared a single password.\n\nAbout a year later – this past January – the Biden administration announced a plan to shore up the cyber defenses of the nation’s roughly 150,000 public water systems.\n\nBut even if localized networks are vulnerable, experts say that the American power grid is far too complex to shut down in one simple motion.\n\n“For a successful attack to be able to take the lights out, they need to gain access to a lot of different points … and nobody is looking,” said Vikram Thakur, technical director at cybersecurity company Symantec. “We don’t think it’s plausible.”\n\nSophisticated hackers could, however, still seize on any vulnerabilities to cause smaller-scale damage to the electrical grid and other means of energy production.\n\nSmaller utility companies may not be able to make enough of an investment in cybersecurity, potentially making their systems more vulnerable to attacks. The equipment and devices specifically used to distribute electricity to consumers are also more at risk, experts say, because they are not required to adhere to federal cybersecurity standards that apply to the higher-voltage generators and transmission lines in the electrical industry.\n\nAnd while new cybersecurity requirements were introduced for certain oil and gas pipelines last year, they are not as comprehensive as the electrical industry standards and there aren’t federal cybersecurity regulations for water systems, said Ernie Hayden, who has spent decades working in the power sector, identifying risks to energy and electric providers as a chief information security officer, cybersecurity engineer and consultant.\n\nIf networks aren’t properly secured, a hacker could not only launch a ransomware or malware attack but directly infiltrate systems, known as operational technology, that control critical equipment, said Hayden.\n\nDepending on the location of the attack and the lack of controls, this could result in a range of potential outcomes. If hackers get into the operational controls of a water system – as nearly happened in Florida last year – they could potentially poison a water supply by causing chlorine to be injected at a dangerous level, said Hayden. They could cause short power outages if they found a way to access devices that control the circuit breakers at one of the country’s tens of thousands of substations, which are used to transform voltage before electricity is delivered. And turning off the ventilation controls or valves that control the flow of chemicals, gas and oil at refineries could cause equipment failures and leaks, he said.\n\nEven these smaller-scale, localized disruptions are unlikely, however, and experts said they would not cause the cascading blackouts or mass destruction that many fear. But they could still have a psychological impact, which may be the intent of the attacker.\n\nTom Alrich, a cybersecurity risk management consultant specializing in supply chain threats to software, said he doesn’t believe hackers, including any from Russia, would be able to cause outages by accessing electrical infrastructure. Even if they could, he said, they would get nothing out of it. Instead, Alrich said, the focus should be on ransomware attacks that shut down a company’s operations without directly attacking the systems that control the physical infrastructure, which is what happened in the case of the Colonial Pipeline, or cyberattacks that “poison” the software developed by a given company or organization, such as the infamous SolarWinds hack.\n\nMax Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service – a nonpartisan non-profit that promotes better government – pointed to some federal failures. He noted that the Department of Energy has some key positions unfilled because the US Senate has been slow to confirm nominees.\n\n“The notion of cyber risk is profound,” Stier said. “It’s a battlefield that doesn’t respect physical boundaries, one where we know the Russians already have been playing, and not just the Russians; and it’s one where we have significant vulnerability.”\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of organizations breached in the SolarWinds hack.

That list includes the USA's Breezy Johnson, Alysa Liu and Jackie Wiles, Swedish cross‑country skier Ebba Andersson, plus Dutch skater Jutta Leerdam and German biathlete Justus Strelow.\n\n\"It's definitely heavy. Heavier than I expected,\" Johnson said after winning the women's Olympic downhill. \"I think that's maybe why it broke.\"\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the cords on the medals are fitted with a breakaway mechanism. It's reportedly required by law. The medal's built-in system is designed to release if it gets pulled by any force. Ultimately, the design is meant to keep the athletes from choking.\n\nThe Olympic committee appears to be aware of the problem and working to address it. − Meghan L. Hall\n\nTeam Canada captain to miss women's hockey clash vs. USA\n\nThe Canadian women's hockey team is gearing up for its toughest matchup of the 2026 Winter Olympics, and the reigning champions will be without their trusted leader.\n\nCaptain Marie-Philip Poulin has been ruled out of Canada's preliminary matchup against the United States on Tuesday due to a lower body injury suffered in the team's 5-1 win over Czechia on Monday, Team Canada announced hours ahead of puck drop at the Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena in Milan at 2:10 p.m. ET.\n\nTuesday's matchup against the USA was supposed to be Canada's final preliminary matchup in Group A play, but the Canadians will now play Finland on Feb. 12 after the game was rescheduled due to a norovirus outbreak among the Finnish team. − Cydney Henderson\n\nAmerican trio advances in women's moguls, Kauf still possible\n\nThree Americans punched their tickets to the finals of the women’s moguls competition.\n\nJaelin Kauf, arguably the best of the bunch, was not one of them – and was not particularly close, either.\n\nKauf finished 27th of 30 racers and will have to be in the top 10 of the second qualifier – held before the finals Wednesday – to advance.\n\nOther than Kauf, it was a phenomenal showing for the Team USA in Livigno. Elizabeth Lemley and Olivia Giaccio finished second and third, respectively, and Tess Johnson came in ninth. The top 10 automatically qualified for finals. − Chris Bumbaca\n\nUtah governor urges Olympic reporters to stick to sports\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox chided reporters at the 2026 Winter Olympics on Tuesday when asked about President Trump calling a US athlete “a real loser’’ and political division in the United States.\n\n“I hate the questions you ask the athletes,\" Cox said at a press conference in Milan about the 2034 Winter Olympics that will be hosted in Salt Lake City, Utah. \"These are kids out there competing. I think you should be asking them about their sports and about their competition and let the politics take care of the politics.\"\n\nHunter Hess, an American freestyle skier, was asked in a press conference Feb. 4 about representing the United States at a fraught time that includes ICE agents killing two protesters in Minnesota during immigration raids. Hess said he had “mixed emotions” and it was “a little hard.\"\n\nTrump lashed out with a Truth Social post, writing in part that Hess was “a real Loser.’’\n\nCox, a Republican, sidestepped controversy when asked if Olympic athletes were losers.\n\n“Look, we love our athletes and we’re grateful for our athletes,’’ he said. “We recognize there are lots of divisions in our country and in our world today and I love that we get to live in a country where people get to speak their minds.\" − Josh Peter\n\nSchiffrin falters in team combined; Wiles/Moltzan win bronze\n\nJacqueline Wiles and Paula Moltzan upstaged their Olympic champion teammates, Breezy Johnson and Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\nWiles and Moltzan won bronze in the women's team combined event on Tuesday, Feb. 10. It was the first Olympic medal for both and comes two days after Wiles finished fourth in the downhill, missing the podium by 0.27 seconds.\n\nWiles was fourth in the downhill portion of the event, 0.45 seconds behind fellow American Breezy Johnson. Moltzan laid down a slalom time of 44.87 to vault the pairing one spot higher with a combined time of 2:21.91.\n\nJohnson and Shiffrin were the prerace favorites after winning the event when it made its debut at last year’s world championships, but Shiffrin posted a slow slalom score (45.38) to drop the team off the podium and into fourth.\n\nAustria's Ariane Raedler (1:36.65) and Katharina Huber (45.01) won gold with a time of 2:21.66. Germany's Kira Weidle-Winkelmann (1:37.33) and Emma Aicher took silver in 2:21.71. − Nancy Armour\n\nUSA's Ben Ogden skis to historic silver\n\nTeam USA has its first cross-country skiing medal of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nAmerican cross-country skier Ben Ogden captured the silver medal in the men's sprint classic, finishing with a time of 3:40.61, less than a second behind Norwegian star Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo. Norway's Oskar Opstad Vike took the bronze medal with a time of 3:46.55.\n\nOgden's silver ends a nearly 50-year Olympic medal drought for the American men. He becomes just the second American man to win an Olympic cross-country skiing medal, and the first to make the podium since Bill Koch captured silver in 30km at the 1976 Innsbruck Winter Olympics. — Cydney Henderson\n\nLindsey Vonn swaps texts with downhill medalist Sofia Goggia\n\nLindsey Vonn is feeling well enough to text with friends.\n\nItalian skiing star Sofia Goggia, one of Vonn's closest friends, said Tuesday that she and Vonn had texted a day earlier.\n\n\"I'm really sorry for her. She didn't deserve this,\" Goggia said after crashing in the downhill portion of the team combined event. Goggia won bronze in the individual downhill two days prior and lit the cauldron in Cortina during the opening ceremony.\n\nVonn suffered a complex tibial fracture in a crash during the Olympic downhill on Sunday, and she said it will require multiple surgeries. Goggia said Vonn has since undergone a second operation.\n\n\"I'm really sorry for her,\" Goggia said. \"I feel the suffering that she has inside of herself.\" − Nancy Armour\n\nNo repeat medal for Jessie Diggins\n\nU.S. cross-country skier Jessie Diggins failed to make it out of the women's sprint classic quarterfinals, the same event she medaled in at the 2022 Beijing Games.\n\nDiggins finished fourth out of six racers in her quarterfinal heat with a time of 3:59.33. In the sprint classic, the top two finishers from five different quarterfinal rounds advance to the semifinals, plus two \"lucky losers\" with the fastest time that didn't already qualify. American Julia Kern was one of the \"lucky losers\" to advance, but she finished the final in last place as Sweden swept the podium.\n\nThe result ended Diggins' streak of finishing in the top 10 in all six women's events in both the 2018 and 2022 Games. − Cydney Henderson\n\nItaly wins short-track speed skating gold\n\nThe first gold medal in short-track speed skating goes to the host country.\n\nTeam Italy won the mixed team relay, beating out favorite Canada in the final and improving on the silver medal it won in 2022. The Chinese team had the early lead but near the midway point Italy took over, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.\n\nCanada was well behind and was able to close the gap as the final laps approached, but the Italians didn’t seize control and crossed the finish line in emphatic fashion.\n\nItaly won gold and Canada took silver while Belgium got bronze. China, which won gold in this event in 2022, didn’t make the podium. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTeam USA eliminated in mixed team relay\n\nDifferent Olympics, same result for the U.S. in the short-track speed skating mixed team relay. It failed to make the final, faltering in the semifinal due to a fall.\n\nThe U.S. actually had an early lead thanks to some quick work from Kristen Santos-Griswol. But like in the quarterfinals, Corrine Stoddard fell on lap No. 12, and this time she wouldn’t get bailed out. It set the team back tremendously and the gap was too far to recover from.\n\nThe finish is similar to what happened in the inaugural event in 2022, when the U.S. was penalized in the semifinal and prevented itself from contending for a podium finish.\n\nTeam USA finished in last place in the event and will skate in the Final B, meaning they will not have a chance at a medal and is just racing for standings. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTwo Americans advance to men's moguls finals\n\nLIVIGNO, Italy — Two Americans advanced to the finals during the first stage of qualification of the men's moguls at Livigno Aerials & Moguls Park, with Nick Page (fifth, 77.50) and Dylan Walczyk (seventh, 76.67) finishing above the cutline in the top 10.\n\nThe two other U.S. skiers in the field – Charlie Mickel (11th, 75.31) and Landon Wendler (12, 75.08) – barely missed qualifying initially, but they can still advance through the second stage.\n\nJapan's Ikuma Horishima was first in qualifying with a score of 85.42, nearly six points clear for the rest of the field. Of the 30 athletes in the qualifying, Team USA comprised four of the top 12.\n\nThe men's moguls finals will be Feb. 12 in Livigno. — Gentry Estes\n\nTeam USA squeaks by in mixed team relay\n\nTalk about a last second of hope.\n\nThe U.S. looked done in the short-track team relay when a slip by Corrine Stoddard on the tag dropped it all the way in last place. Luckily, Japan and France each had late crashes that opened the door for Team USA.\n\nIt capitalized on the opportunity, jumping into second place to secure its spot in the semifinals, behind Korea. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nUSA in prime position for women’s team combined medals\n\nTeam USA is in prime position to collect multiple medals in the women’s team combined event, which pairs up two skiers – with one racing downhill and the other skiing a slalom run.\n\nBreezy Johnson, who won the women’s downhill two days ago to give the USA its first medal of the Milano Cortina Winter Games, posted the fastest time again today and will hand off a lead to superstar Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\nJohnson finished in 1:36.59 to top the leaderboard, 0.06 seconds ahead of Austria’s Ariane Raedler. Italy’s Laura Pirovano put the host country in medal position, posting the third-best downhill run, 0.27 behind Johnson.\n\nAmerican Jackies Wiles is 0.45 seconds back in fourth place and will hand off to Paula Moltzan, a very strong technical skier. Keely Cashman finished 21st and will give way to AJ Hurt. Bella Wright crashed, meaning she and Nina O’Brien are done. — Nancy Armour\n\nTeam USA’s Clayton Declemente advances in short-track speed skating\n\nThe U.S. will send a skater to the men’s short-track speed skating 1000m quarterfinals with Clayton Declemente moving on.\n\nThe first time Olympian was in a close battle in his heat and looked like he would miss out from qualifying, but Steven Dubois (Canada) and Niall Treacy (Great Britain) got tangled and ended up crashing. That paved the way for Declemente and Japan’s Kazuki Yoshinaga to cruise the rest of the way, with Declemente finishing in second.\n\nAnother U.S. skater in Brandon Kim didn’t advance. He had a brief lead toward the end of the race but suddenly fell in fourth to knock him out. He was later assessed a penalty for bumping into another skater. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOlympics schedule today\n\n2 a.m.: Luge – Women’s Doubles Official Training Runs 5 & 6 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina)\n\nLuge – Women’s Doubles Official Training Runs 5 & 6 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina) 2:53 a.m.: Luge – Men’s Doubles Official Training Runs 5 & 6 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina)\n\nLuge – Men’s Doubles Official Training Runs 5 & 6 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina) 3 a.m.: Nordic Combined – Normal Hill Official Training 2 | Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium (Predazzo)\n\nNordic Combined – Normal Hill Official Training 2 | Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium (Predazzo) 4:30 a.m.: Short Track Speed Skating | Milano Ice Skating Arena (Milan) Women’s 500m Heats, 4:30 a.m. Men’s 1000m Heats, 5:08 a.m. Mixed Team Relay Quarterfinals + Semifinals, 5:53 a.m. & 6:23 a.m. Mixed Relay Final B, 6:48 a.m. Mixed Relay Final A, 6:56 a.m. | medal event\n\nShort Track Speed Skating | Milano Ice Skating Arena (Milan) 4:30 a.m.: Alpine Skiing – Women’s Team Combined Downhill | Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nAlpine Skiing – Women’s Team Combined Downhill | Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 5 a.m.: Skeleton – Women Official Training Heats 3 & 4 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina)\n\nSkeleton – Women Official Training Heats 3 & 4 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina) 5:15 a.m.: Freestyle Skiing – Men’s Moguls Qualification 1 | Livigno Aerials & Moguls Park (Livigno, Valtellina)\n\nFreestyle Skiing – Men’s Moguls Qualification 1 | Livigno Aerials & Moguls Park (Livigno, Valtellina) 6:10 a.m.: Ice Hockey – Women’s Preliminary | JPN vs. SWE | Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena\n\nIce Hockey – Women’s Preliminary | JPN vs. SWE | Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena 6:30 a.m.: Freestyle Skiing – Men’s Slopestyle Final | medal event | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno, Valtellina)\n\nFreestyle Skiing – Men’s Slopestyle Final | | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno, Valtellina) 7:30 a.m.: Biathlon – Men’s 20km Individual | medal event | Anterselva Biathlon Arena (Antholz)\n\nBiathlon – Men’s 20km Individual | | Anterselva Biathlon Arena (Antholz) 7:30 a.m.: Skeleton – Men Official Training Heats 3 & 4 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina)\n\nSkeleton – Men Official Training Heats 3 & 4 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina) 3:15-7:45 a.m.: Cross-Country Skiing – Sprint Classic Qualifications, Rounds, Finals | medal events | Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium (Val di Fiemme) Women’s Sprint Classic Final, 7:13 a.m. Men’s Sprint Classic Final, 7:25 a.m.\n\nCross-Country Skiing – Sprint Classic Qualifications, Rounds, Finals | | Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium (Val di Fiemme) 8 a.m.: Alpine Skiing – Women’s Team Combined Slalom | medal event | Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nAlpine Skiing – Women’s Team Combined Slalom | | Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 8:05 a.m.: Curling – Mixed Doubles Bronze Medal Match | GBR vs. ITA | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nCurling – Mixed Doubles Bronze Medal Match | GBR vs. ITA | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 8:15 a.m.: Freestyle Skiing – Women’s Moguls Qualification 1 | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno, Valtellina)\n\nFreestyle Skiing – Women’s Moguls Qualification 1 | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno, Valtellina) 10:40 a.m.: Ice Hockey – Women’s Preliminary | ITA vs. GER | Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena\n\nIce Hockey – Women’s Preliminary | ITA vs. GER | Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena 11 a.m.: Luge – Women’s Singles Runs 3 & 4 | medal event | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nLuge – Women’s Singles Runs 3 & 4 | | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 11:30 a.m.: Ski Jumping – Mixed Team Finals | medal event | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) Mixed Team Trial Round, 11:30 a.m. First Round, 12:45 p.m. Final Round, 2 p.m.\n\nSki Jumping – Mixed Team Finals | | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 12:05 p.m.: Curling – Mixed Doubles Gold Medal | USA vs. SWE | medal event | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nCurling – Mixed Doubles Gold Medal | | | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 12:30–4:45 p.m.: Figure Skating – Men’s Short Program | Milano Ice Skating Arena (Milan)\n\nFigure Skating – Men’s Short Program | Milano Ice Skating Arena (Milan) 2:10 p.m.: Ice Hockey – Women’s Preliminary | USA vs. CAN | | Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nIce Hockey – Women’s Preliminary | | | Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena 3:10 p.m.: Ice Hockey – Women’s Preliminary | FIN vs. SUI | Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena\n\nOlympics TV schedule today\n\nPeacock is streaming every event live.\n\nOlympics medal count\n\nEntering Tuesday, Italy leads the medal count with nine (one gold, two silver, six bronze).

Former NHL player Frans Nielsen and Markus Lauridsen had goals for Denmark.\n\n\"This is a huge moment for Danish hockey. We're not usually at the Olympics,\" coach Heinz Ehlers said. \"We're so happy and proud right now.\n\n\"It's not like we win here today and we think we're Olympic champions,\" Ehlers continued. \"We're realistic and know that we have to work really hard and get a little bit of luck to win hockey games.\"\n\nThe Danish women claimed their first Olympic win earlier this week 3-2, also against the Czech Republic.\n\n-- Analis Bailey\n\nBiney advances in thrilling short-track finish\n\nBEIJING – U.S. short-track speedskater Maame Biney was in last place entering the final curve of her 1000-meter heat Wednesday night.\n\nShe ended up winning – by three thousandths of a second.\n\nBiney, 22, and teammate Kristen Santos both advanced to Friday's quarterfinal round, the latter in far more comfortable fashion than the former. While Biney eked out a win, Santos led for much of her heat before crossing the finish line first.\n\nThe American women had much better luck Wednesday than the men, both of whom failed to advance in the 1500. Andrew Heo and Ryan Pivirotto each made the quarterfinals but did not go any further, with Heo placing fifth of six skaters in his race and Pivirotto disqualified for an infraction.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nTeam USA finally won its first gold medal. Here's what you missed overnight Wednesday:\n\nLindsey Jacobellis wins snowboardcross, Team USA's first gold medal\n\nLindsey Jacobellis is golden, and so is Team USA.\n\nJacobellis, 36, won gold in women's snowboardcross at the Beijing Olympics. France's Chloe Trespeuch finished in second.\n\nJacobellis is one of the most successful snowboarders in her sport but most Americans remember her for the 2006 Olympic race in which she held the lead late before falling performing a method on the last jump. She settled for silver.\n\nAt the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, Jacobellis finished fourth.\n\nShe's the most decorated bordercross athlete of all time.

She won her heat by more than one second. Meghan Tierney entered the round in 16th and held onto the final spot in the quarterfinals by outlasting Lara Casanova of Switzerland despite the two bumping while coming around the second-to-last bend.\n\nStacy Gaskill also won her heat handily, and Faye Gulini’s victory made it a clean sweep for the U.S.\n\nSixteen riders remain in the competition.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nShaun White leads trio of Americans who qualify for halfpipe final\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Shaun White will have one more competition in the halfpipe, only a few runs remaining between him and the end of a competitive snowboarding career.\n\nThe three-time Olympic gold medalist advanced to Friday’s final at the Beijing Olympics, qualifying fourth at Genting Snow Park.\n\nFellow Americans Taylor Gold and Chase Josey also qualified for the final, ranking seventh and 12th, respectively. Lucas Foster had a hard fall on his second run and finished in 17th. Only the top 12 advance to the final.\n\nWhite, 35, is competing in his final Olympics and last snowboarding competition.

Details of the case were not specified.\n\n“We have athletes that have won medals involved,” Adams said at the daily news briefing.\n\nIn a one-line statement, the International Skating Union also cited ongoing legal talks.\n\nIf any athlete and team were disqualified, an appeal would likely follow to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Canada placed fourth and would be in line to be upgraded.\n\nSome skaters in the men’s competition are due to finish their events Thursday and leave China soon after.\n\n“Everyone is doing absolutely everything that the situation can be resolved as soon as possible,” Adams said.\n\nHowever, he cautioned “as you know, legal issues can sometimes drag on.”\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nMikaela Shiffrin on Beijing disappointment: 'It feels like everything, but it's not'\n\nBEIJING – Two races, 10 gates.\n\nThat’s the sum total of Mikaela Shiffrin’s performance so far at the Beijing Olympics, a Games where she was expected to contend for multiple medals. Two days after skiing out in the first run of the giant slalom, Shiffrin did the same in the first run of the slalom Wednesday.\n\nAfterward, she sat in the snow for several minutes, crying and looking despondent. These were her two best events, races in which she has won gold medals, and she didn’t even get through the first run. It’s the first time she has failed to finish back-to-back technical races since December 2011, when she was 16 years old.\n\n“We came all this way. We’re not done yet but GS and slalom, those were my biggest focuses, so it really feels like a lot of work for nothing,” Shiffrin said afterward, still appearing shell-shocked. “(People) will try to say, `This happens’ and `It’s OK’ and `Don’t be too hard on yourself’ and all of that, but it is a lot of work for a grand total of five gates in the GS and five gates in the slalom. So that is not lost on me.\n\n“It feels like everything,” she added, “but it’s not.”\n\nThere are still three races left: the super-G, the Alpine combined and the downhill. While Shiffrin didn’t rule out competing in all three, she didn’t rule it in, either, saying the U.S. team has others who are just as capable.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nFreeskier Colby Stevenson adds another silver to USA's collection\n\nBEIJING – American Colby Stevenson took home the silver medal in the big air men’s freeskiing final, putting down two monster runs after crashing on his first attempt.\n\nStevenson’s impressive switch left 1800 on his last run – five full rotations in the air – launched him onto the podium but he had to survive seven skiers with an opportunity to pass him. In the end, none of them did, including teammate Alexander Hall.\n\nStevenson, 24, nearly died in a car crash six years ago that left him with a fractured skull and multiple other injuries.\n\n-- Dan Wolken\n\nStunned Mikaela Shiffrin still 'processing' after slalom exit\n\nMikaela Shiffrin said she's \"second guessing the last 15 years\" of her skiing career after falling in women's slalom, the second consecutive race she did not finish at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nDuring an emotional interview with NBC following the race on Wednesday, the two-time Olympic champion said she's questioning \"everything I thought I knew about my own skiing and slalom and racing mentality.\"\n\nShiffrin said she's still \"processing\" what happened on the mountain after she skied out after the fifth gate in the first run of the slalom Wednesday. The DNF comes two days after she skied out after the fifth gate in the first run of the giant slalom.\n\n-- Cydney Henderson\n\nChloe Kim eyes another gold in halfpipe\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Chloe Kim is in position to claim gold again.\n\nThe Olympic champion in Pyeongchang four years ago, Kim easily advanced in qualifying on Wednesday at Genting Snow Park. That gives her the opportunity to become the first woman to win two gold medals when she competes in the final on Thursday.\n\nKim moved on to the final with a mellow, for her, first run that included two 720s and a 900. She’ll be expected to do tricks with 1080 degrees of rotation, and possibly higher, in the final.\n\n“I was really nervous my first run because we’re at the Olympics, but I’m so happy I put one down,” Kim told NBC after qualifying. She did not take questions from print media after the competition.\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nTriple corks could make – or break – halfpipe hopefuls\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Perhaps it was Shaun White toying with the triple cork in the halfpipe that made this day inevitable.\n\nMaybe it was the march of progression as snowboarders attempted and mastered difficult double corks. Perhaps it was having the right riders to push it there.\n\nWhatever the causes, the triple cork in the halfpipe is here – and it’s very likely to play a role in the Olympic final. (Qualifying begins Wednesday in Beijing, late Tuesday in the U.S.)\n\nThe trick requires three off-axis flips with varying degrees of rotation.\n\n“If you’re a strategist, you’re going save that in your arsenal and use it if you need to,\" said NBC snowboarding analyst Todd Richards. \"That trick could take you out for the day.”\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nShocking disappointment for Mikaela Shiffrin in women's slalom\n\nBEIJING – Mikaela Shiffrin’s second race ended even sooner than her first.\n\nThe two-time Olympic champion skied out after the fifth gate in the first run of the slalom Wednesday. She had appeared to slip around the second gate, but kept her balance, only to ski off the course shortly afterward.\n\nAfterward, she sat in the snow and took a long look at the course.\n\nThe DNF comes two days after she skied out after the fifth gate in the first run of the giant slalom. Shiffrin called that a “huge disappointment” and said she would never get over it, but would have to put it to the side because she still had races left at the Beijing Olympics. Clearly, though, she wasn’t unable to get past it, and now the pressure on Shiffrin, who was predicted to win multiple medals here, will only grow.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nMikaela Shiffrin seeks redemption in women's slalom\n\nDespite wiping out in her first event in Beijing, Mikaela Shiffrin still needs just one more Olympic gold to put her all alone among American alpine skiers. She currently has two gold medals, tying Americans Ted Ligety and Andrea Mead Lawrence.\n\nHer journey, however, has been anything but smooth. From a back injury late last year to a COVID-19 diagnosis, to Monday's disappointment, Shiffrin has experienced a wealth of emotions.\n\nAs USA TODAY's Nancy Armour writes, Shiffrin can't let her earlier mistake carry over into the other races on her Olympic schedule.\n\nChloe Kim defending 2018 Olympic title in women's halfpipe\n\nChloe Kim the first athlete to hold snowboarding titles from all four major events: the Olympics, World Championships, X Games, and Youth Olympics. She is also the only athlete in X Games history to win three gold medals before the age of 16.\n\nShe'll compete in the women's snowboarding halfpipe in Beijing, with qualifying alread underway.\n\nSince halfpipe snowboarding debuted in the Olympics in 1998, no woman has won two gold medals. But Kim isn't just aiming for a medal. She's trying for three new tricks.\n\nThough she hasn't said what they are, it's safe to guess they would progress the sport since she is already doing some of the hardest tricks in halfpipe snowboarding.\n\n--Analis Bailey, Rachel Axon\n\nShaun White's last Olympics and chance for gold\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing will be Shaun White's final ride.\n\nOne of the most recognizable figures in Team USA history, thanks to his flowing red hair and podium success, the legendary snowboarder said on Dec. 15 these Olympics – his fifth – will be his last.\n\nBy now, the sport has caught up to White, and he would be the first to say so. That won't stop him from seeking a fourth gold medal in the men's halfpipe in Beijing to add to his legacy.\n\nOutside of the Olympics, White has 15 Winter X Games golds, in addition to five Summer X Games medals in skateboarding.\n\nAnother Russian women's hockey player out due to positive COVID test\n\nBEIJING – Confusion and controversy surrounding the Russian women’s hockey team’s COVID-19 situation took another turn Tuesday in Beijing.\n\nA day after Russia’s game against Canada was delayed an hour as the teams awaited that morning’s test results, another Russian player – forward Polina Bolgareva -- tested positive for the virus, coach Yevgeni Bobariko told state news agency RIA Novosti, according to The Associated Press and Reuters.\n\nThat brings the total number of Russian players out due to COVID isolation – meaning they’ve tested positive and have not received two negative tests more than 24 hours apart – to eight, per the AP.\n\nCanada and Russia played their game, a 6-1 Canadian victory, with KN95 masks on their faces. Russia removed the masks prior to the third period because the test results came back, they said afterward. Canada left the masks on.\n\n\"Everybody saw how we played against Canada with masks and took them off after the second period, when we received the results of our tests. They were all negative,” Bobariko told the state news agency, per Reuters.\n\nBut Bolgareva’s results “turned positive” upon returning to the Olympic Village after the game, the coach said.\n\n“I don’t understand how this is happening,” he added.\n\nBolgareva played 17:39 against the U.S. on Saturday, a 5-0 U.S. win.\n\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation attributed Monday’s delay, officially, to “health and safety issues.”\n\nRegarding Bolgareva’s reported positive, the IIHF referred USA TODAY Sports to the International Olympic Committee, which still has not commented on Monday’s events.\n\nCanada forward Emily Clark, who was infected with the virus in December and whose results came back inconclusive on Monday, did not play against Russia. She played 19:39 against the U.S. in the Canadians’ 4-2 win Tuesday.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhat's with all those stuffed pandas at the medal ceremonies?\n\nIf you’ve been keeping up with the Winter Olympics in Beijing, you might have noticed Olympians from countries around the world posing with a plush toy panda after they compete.\n\nBut why are some of the winning athletes posing with the toy after their events instead of immediately receiving their medals?\n\nAfter some of the competitions, the champions receive the panda mascot of the games, Bing Dwen Dwen, and are given their medals later at a special ceremony.\n\nThe Bing Dwen Dwen toys come stuffed inside a plastic shell that represents ice and is decorated with a gold wreath. Bing means “ice” in Mandarin Chinese, though it also symbolizes purity and strength. Dwen Dwen means robust and lively and it also represents children.\n\n-- Marina Pitofsky\n\nWomen ski jumpers disqualified for baggy uniforms\n\nFive female competitors were disqualified from the mixed team ski jump final in the Beijing Winter Olympics over uniform violations.\n\nTheir jumpsuits were allegedly deemed too large, which could give a skier a leg up during the event, according to multiple reports.\n\nKatharina Althaus of Germany told reporters after she was disqualified, “We were looking forward to the second competition at the Olympics. [The International Ski Federation] destroyed that with this action – they destroyed women's ski jumping.\n\n\"Our names are now (out) there and we just pulled the crap card. That is how you destroy nations, development and the entire sport,” she added, Reuters reported.\n\nThis year marked the first time the mixed team ski jumping event was included at a Winter Olympics. All of the competitors who were disqualified are women.\n\n-- Marina Pitofsky\n\nNathan Chen in in great position to win skating gold\n\nBEIJING – Nathan Chen’s four-year quest now has less than 48 hours to go.\n\nWith a massive fist pump following some of the most beautiful jumps ever landed under the unforgiving spotlight of the Olympic Games, Chen exorcized the demons from Olympic short programs past to skate a world-record-breaking men’s short and put himself in position to win the gold medal in Thursday’s long program.\n\nChen, 22, received more points from the judges than any man ever has – 113.97 – for his soaring quadruple jumps and exquisite artistry to “La Boheme” to take an almost six-point lead over his closest challenger, Japanese 18-year-old Yuma Kagiyama.\n\nNOTE: USA Network replays Chen and the other top skaters' short programs starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2026/02/12/winter-olympics-live-updates-medal-count-schedule-results/88631173007/", "title": "Winter Olympics highlights: Chloe Kim wins silver, US ... - USA Today", "text": "Updated Feb. 12, 2026, 8:06 p.m. ET\n\nMILAN — Another day of competition at the 2026 Winter Olympics is in the books.\n\nChloe Kim came up short of picking up her third Olympic gold medal, as she came up with silver in the women's halfpipe event. The U.S. snowboarder posted a score of 88.00 on her first run, but experienced falls in her final two runs of the event. South Korea's Gaon Choi bounced back from falls in the first two runs with a strong third run to finish ahead of Kim for the gold medal.\n\nThe day began with U.S. Alpine skier Breezy Johnson getting engaged by her boyfriend, Connor Watkins, following her run in the women's Alpine super-G medal event, which she did not finish after a crash.

The United States outshoots Latvia 48-18 to win its Olympic opener. Next up for the United States is Denmark at 3:10 p.m. ET on Saturday, Feb. 14 in Milan.\n\nUSA men's hockey is one period away from first win\n\nThe Americans could finally celebrate a second goal midway through the second period: This time, there was nothing to challenge. Vincent Trocheck found Jack Hughes with a pass behind the net, Hughes found Brock Nelson in the low slot, and he maneuvered the puck past Elvis Merzlikins and into the net. Merzlikins had a busy period trying to give his teammates a chance as the Americans took command, swarming around with the puck. Brady Tkachuk delivered a big hip check and made a nuisance of himself around the crease.\n\nThe U.S. moved further ahead on a power play with 2:25 to play in the period. Tage Thompson took a pass from Jack Eichel by the net, pivoted and got the puck on his backhand to make it 3-1.

She crashed multiple times in her three races before five other skaters moved on to the final race without her.\n\nAnd so Santos-Griswold have to live not only with that but what took place four years ago.\n\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics, Santos-Griswold led the1,000 meters heading into the final lap before she was taken out by another competitor.

Kim's score is good enough to put her in first place on the leaderboard; she'll have two more runs, with her highest score being used.\n\nOnly five snowboarders posted runs in their first run due to crashes on the course.

Woods bested Kingsbury by .70 – 48.4 to 47.7 – in turn score, leaving Kingsbury with a third Olympic silver medal (he also won gold in PyeongChang, South Korea in 2018) in the event.\n\n\"It was very close,\" Kingsbury said. \"You can’t get any closer than that.

But the controversial storyline of the event was that his USA teammate, Nathan Pare, crossed the line first in his quarterfinal — only to be disqualified on review after he and another rider appeared to come into contact during the race.\n\nSpain’s Lucas Equibar Breton wiped out as a result, and controversially, Pare was bumped to last place. From him, it was a brutal shift of emotion after he’d won the quarterfinal, overtaking two French riders with a dramatic comeback in the stretch run. Instead, those two French riders advanced as the top-two finishers. Pare was eliminated by a decision, not by the result.\n\n\"It's super frustrating,\" said Pare, a 21-year-old from Bethel, Maine. “It's hard to handle and to accept. … Contact is racing. It's part of the sport. To have a call like that, though, at the Olympics and pretty much strip it away from me is hard to deal with.” Click here to read more here. – Gentry Estes\n\nRich Ruohonen, oldest American Winter Olympian, gets Olympic moment\n\nTeam USA curler Rich Ruohonen is officially an Olympian.\n\nOn Thursday, Ruohonen, 54, made history as the oldest American Winter Olympian to touch the ice.

The decision stirred sharp reaction from American fans and fellow U.S. figure skaters on social media and elsewhere. The enduring sentiment is that Chock and Bates performed a flawless free dance strong enough to lock up gold.\n\nBeaudry and Cizeron, who carried a 0.46-point lead entering the night, had a good but not as sharp skate. However, they ended up with a better score: a 135.64 to Chock and Bates' 134.67 – a victory margin of 1.43 points.\n\nHow did it happen?

But that's Nick Page.\n\nThe American, who hails now from Park City, Utah, made it to the moguls finals at the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics on Thursday, but didn't turn in the run he would've wanted, scoring a 75.00 and finishing in seventh.\n\nAustralia's Cooper Woods skied last and pulled out a gold medal run with a score of 83.71, which actually tied Canada's Mikael Kingsbury's score. But the tiebreaker goes to the skier with the higher score on turns. Woods put up a 48.4 turns score to Kingsbury's 47.7 turns score. So, Kingsbury walked away with silver, and Japan's Ikuma Horishima earned bronze with an 83.71.\n\nUSA's Nick Page advances to men’s moguls finals\n\nLIVIGNO — Nick Page will be the lone \"Stars and Stripes\" representative in the men’s moguls final after three of his teammates did not place in the top eight during the first run of finals.\n\nPage placed sixth in the first final with a score of 80.08 and has some work to do to make the podium.\n\nUS skiers shut out of women's super-G medals\n\nThere’ll be no medal for the American women.\n\nJackie Wiles, the last U.S. skier to go in the super-G, skied into 13th place, one spot ahead of Keely Cashman. There are still more than a dozen skiers to go.\n\nBut at least Wiles and Cashman finished. teammates Breezy Johnson and Mary Bocock both crashed during their runs.\n\nBocock has crashed in her Olympic debut. She got too much air off a jump, was already off-balance in the air and landed sideways, her skis splayed in front of her.\n\nAbout 20 seconds into her run, Johnson got off her line off a jump and clipped the next gate. It spun her around and launched her into the safety netting at the side of the course.\n\nJohnson, who won the gold medal in downhill earlier this week, was able to get back up and ski away from the fence.\n\nWhere to watch Olympics today\n\nWatch all 2026 Winter Olympics events on NBC and Peacock.\n\nOlympics schedule today\n\nAll times Eastern\n\n3:05 a.m.: Curling – Women’s Round Robin | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo) KOR vs. USA ; JPN vs. SWE; ITA vs. SUI; CAN vs. DEN\n\nCurling – Women’s Round Robin | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 3:30 a.m.: Skeleton – Men’s Heats 1 & 2 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nSkeleton – Men’s Heats 1 & 2 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 4 a.m.: Freestyle Skiing – Men’s Moguls Qualification 2 | Livigno Aerials & Moguls Park (Livigno, Valtellina)\n\nFreestyle Skiing – Men’s Moguls Qualification 2 | Livigno Aerials & Moguls Park (Livigno, Valtellina) 4 a.m.: Snowboarding – Men’s Snowboard Cross Seeding Runs 1 & 2 | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno, Valtellina)\n\nSnowboarding – Men’s Snowboard Cross Seeding Runs 1 & 2 | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno, Valtellina) 5:30 a.m.: Alpine Skiing – Women’s Super-G | medal event | Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nAlpine Skiing – Women’s Super-G | Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 6:10 a.m.: Ice Hockey – Men’s Preliminary | SUI vs. FRA | Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nIce Hockey – Men’s Preliminary | SUI vs. FRA | Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena 6:15 a.m.: Freestyle Skiing – Men’s Moguls Final Runs 1 & 2 | medal event | Livigno Aerials & Moguls Park (Livigno, Valtellina)\n\nFreestyle Skiing – Men’s Moguls Final Runs 1 & 2 | | Livigno Aerials & Moguls Park (Livigno, Valtellina) 6:50 a.m.: Bobsleigh – 2-man Official Training Heats 1 & 2 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nBobsleigh – 2-man Official Training Heats 1 & 2 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 7 a.m.: Cross-Country Skiing – Women’s 10km Interval Start Free | medal event | Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium (Val di Fiemme)\n\nCross-Country Skiing – Women’s 10km Interval Start Free | | Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium (Val di Fiemme) 7:45-9:15 a.m.: Snowboarding – Men’s Snowboard Cross Quarters, Semis, Finals | medal event | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno)\n\nSnowboarding – Men’s Snowboard Cross Quarters, Semis, Finals | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno) 8:05 a.m.: Curling – Men’s Round Robin | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo) SUI vs. USA ; NOR vs. GER; GBR vs. SWE\n\nCurling – Men’s Round Robin | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 9:30 a.m.: Bobsleigh – Women’s Monobob Official Training Heats 1 & 2 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nBobsleigh – Women’s Monobob Official Training Heats 1 & 2 | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 10:30 a.m.: Speed Skating – Women’s 5000m | medal event | Milano Speed Skating Stadium (Rho, Milan)\n\nSpeed Skating – Women’s 5000m | | Milano Speed Skating Stadium (Rho, Milan) 10:40 a.m.: Ice Hockey – Men’s Preliminary | CZE vs.CAN | Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nIce Hockey – Men’s Preliminary | CZE vs.CAN | Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena 11 a.m.: Ski Jumping – Women’s LH Official Training 1 | Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium (Val di Fiemme)\n\nSki Jumping – Women’s LH Official Training 1 | Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium (Val di Fiemme) 12:30 p.m.: Luge – Team Relay | medal event | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo)\n\nLuge – Team Relay | | Cortina Sliding Centre (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 1:05 p.m.: Curling – Women’s Round Robin | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo) SWE vs. USA ; CHN vs. GBR; ITA vs. KOR; DEN vs JPN\n\nCurling – Women’s Round Robin | Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium (Cortina d’Ampezzo) 1:30 p.m.: Snowboard – Women’s Halfpipe Final Runs | medal event | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno, Valtellina)\n\nSnowboard – Women’s Halfpipe Final Runs | | Livigno Snow Park (Livigno, Valtellina) 2 p.m.: Ski Jumping – Men’s LH Official Training 1 | Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium (Val di Fiemme)\n\nSki Jumping – Men’s LH Official Training 1 | Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium (Val di Fiemme) 2:15 p.m.: Short Track Speed Skating | medal events | Milano Ice Skating Arena (Milan) Women’s 500m Quarterfinals, 2:15 p.m. Men’s 1000m Quarterfinals, 2:49 p.m. Women’s 500m Semifinals, 2:58 p.m. Men’s 1000m Semifinals, 3:05 p.m. Women’s 500m Final A, 3:31 p.m. Men’s 1000m Final A, 3:43 p.m.\n\nShort Track Speed Skating | | Milano Ice Skating Arena (Milan) 3:10 p.m.: Ice Hockey – Men’s Preliminary | LAT vs. USA | Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nIce Hockey – Men’s Preliminary | | Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena 3:10 p.m.: Ice Hockey – Men’s Preliminary | GER vs. DEN | Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena\n\nFollowing Winter Olympic action in Milano Cortina on Wednesday, Feb. 11, Norway and Italy lead the medal count with 13 apiece (Norway has more golds, however, with seven).

It’s the latest high-profile acquisition by real estate magnate Dan Gilbert and his wife, Jennifer Gilbert.\n\nThe sculpture will be placed at the south side of the building as a permanent installation overlooking downtown’s Campus Martius Park.\n\nCreated over the span of a year on the East Coast and made from more than 2 tons of bronze, the statue, entitled “Waiting,” will be finished in black patina. With its sleek, modern look, towering size and place in contemporary art’s zeitgeist, there’s nothing quite like it in downtown Detroit.\n\nTo put its size into context, just head south on Woodward to see the 26-foot-tall bronze \"Spirit of Detroit\" by Marshall Fredericks, which stands just 8 feet taller than the soon-to-be-installed Kaws statue.\n\nUnlike with the \"Spirit of Detroit,\" the public will be able to touch and interact with “Waiting.”\n\nIt’s the first piece of work in Detroit for the Brooklyn-based artist Brian Donnelly, who, in the past 15 years, has cemented himself as a bona fide brand name in contemporary art under his alias Kaws.\n\nThe statue will also be the first time Donnelly’s signature “Companion” figures — think Mickey Mouse action figures in form but featuring skull-and-crossbones faces with crossed-out eyes — have been arranged to resemble a parent and child caught in a moment of pause. Its installation in Detroit will likely draw attention from art world watchers nationwide.\n\nThe cost of the statue was not released, but other Kaws works sold at auction provide an idea of the possible value of “Waiting.” While the notoriety around Donnelly’s work as Kaws has grown, so have the price tags for his work. Even some of Donnelly’s smaller acrylic on canvas paintings can fetch $400,000 at auction; one painting sold earlier this year for more than $1.2 million. Smaller statues made from less expensive materials like resin or wood have sold for more than $350,000.\n\nStarting his career as a graffiti writer in New Jersey before heading to New York City in the early 1990s, Donnelly is known for street-art beginnings and pop-art influences. His background in animation and affinity for vinyl toy design have set him apart from his contemporaries.\n\nDonnelly’s work has appeared everywhere from subway advertisements to galleries and museums around the globe — and even as a float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York, demonstrating the range of his work and the ubiquitousness of street artists working in mainstream channels today.\n\n“I’m excited to bring my newest large-scale sculpture ‘Waiting’ to Detroit,” said Donnelly via written statement. “Detroit has an incredible cultural history and I’m proud to have my work permanently displayed in the city.”\n\nDonnelly will be in attendance for a public unveiling of the statue at 6 p.m. Tuesday outside of One Campus Martius.\n\n“Waiting” is another high-profile acquisition by real estate magnate Gilbert and his wife, who purchased the statue for their growing Detroit Art Collection — a wide-ranging portfolio of immersive installations and public art that span Bedrock’s real estate portfolio downtown. The previously most high-profile piece commissioned by Gilbert — a 184-foot-by-60-foot mural by street artist Shepard Fairey — is on the opposite side of the same building where Kaws’ new work will be installed.\n\nShepard Fairey finishes huge mural at One Campus Martius; exhibit opens tonight\n\n“It is very important to us that the works we choose for the collection are both approachable and strategically located where everyone can enjoy them,” said Jennifer Gilbert via written statement. “We chose One Campus Martius as the location for 'Waiting' because it is in the heart of the action, where the sculpture can become synonymous with downtown’s momentum.”\n\nAcquired with the help of contemporary art gallery Library Street Collective, which regularly collaborates on Bedrock-led art initiatives downtown, the Gilbert’s downtown art collection is wide-ranging and represents a sizable financial commitment.\n\nPieces range from the Fairey mural to the nearby Wayfinding skate park overseen by legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk to the Belt Alley — an immersive re-imagining of a public alley into a pedestrian destination for art, entertainment and dining.\n\nThe collection was officially started just two years ago but dates to the construction of the Z Garage parking garage in 2013, which enlisted 27 acclaimed artists to paint the interior walls of the garage with original works of art.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/01/07/fort-collins-developments-windsor-loveland-the-ranch-montava-foothills-mall/4103863001/", "title": "Fort Collins developments: Updates from Foothills mall to RainDance", "text": "Jan. 7, 2021, 9:34 a.m. ET\n\nCOVID-19 hasn't paused the number of residential and commercial projects planned in Northern Colorado, but it has slowed down exactly when residents will see new buildings rise out of the ground.\n\n2021 appears to be shaping up as a \"prep\" year, in which several planned projects wait for final approval or complete preliminary work before full construction can begin.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/02/12/muncie-mall-50-years-timeline/4466975002/", "title": "50 years of Muncie Mall: A timeline of retail trends and turnover", "text": "Feb. 12, 2020 Updated June 15, 2021, 4:09 p.m. ET\n\nThroughout its half-century-long history, the Muncie Mall has embodied the economic and social trends of changing times, an impression driven home by a search through its years of local news coverage.\n\nWhen it was first proposed for the outskirts of town, the new-fangled indoor shopping mall — heavily promoted with the promise of air-conditioning and plenty of free parking — had to battle through zoning issues, years of delays and rumors the project was “dead” before construction finally began.\n\nLuring stores from downtown starting with Sears, the mall was blamed from its earliest days and for decades after for having “killed downtown Muncie.” But by 2020, downtown Muncie had seen an economic resurgence of sorts with restaurants, breweries and other locally owned businesses populating its storefronts, while the mall’s lineup of mostly national chain stores visibly hollowed out — even as McGalliard Road remained a busy commercial strip essentially created by the mall’s presence.\n\nIn its earliest incarnation, the mall’s offerings included a drugstore, a supermarket, a fabric store, a pet store and a bank, categories no longer represented among the stores selling clothing, shoes, jewelry and other items now.\n\nEven when some specific businesses in the mall remained through the decades, their offerings gradually changed to fit the era’s expectations. When the mall first opened in 1970, each of its three anchor department stores included its own restaurant; the availability of “ample eating facilities” inside the mall in its early years was blamed in part for the closure of the first restaurant located in the mall’s parking lot, apparently just too far away to tempt hungry shoppers outside. By the ‘80s, clothing stores aimed at “juniors” or “younger women” were increasingly visible among the mall’s offerings that had previously been designated for women, men and children.\n\nBy 2020, the periodic closure of yet another Muncie Mall store because of the financial failure of a national or regional company felt like a recent trend that was gathering momentum. But in fact, the mall had seen just such losses within its first decade, as anchors and smaller stores disappeared from its halls, only to be replaced by others. The difference in 2020, however, is the question of what, if anything, might be the replacement this time.\n\n►MALL STORES STATUS: What's the outlook for companies behind some of Muncie Mall's remaining stores?\n\nThe '60s: The mall that almost never was\n\n1964: Indianapolis developer Melvin Simon and Associates begins waging \"a long hard battle\" over zoning to build a shopping mall on 56 acres at McGalliard Road and Granville Avenue, according to The Muncie Star. \"Original plans called for a four-story office and medical building, plus three high-rise apartment units,\" in addition to retail, a 1967 article notes.\n\nApril 1965: Muncie government officials and businessmen — including Edmund F. Petty, president of Ball Stores — visit the \"brand new air conditioned downtown shopping mall\" in Urbana, Ill., looking for ways to revitalize Muncie's downtown. Continued efforts by the \"Muncie Foresight\" group to boost downtown in subsequent years, even after construction begins on the northeast-side Muncie Mall, ultimately result in the closure of part of Walnut Street downtown for a pedestrian mall, but fail to halt the migration of numerous businesses over the years from the city's center to the mall and the eventual northside business corridor.\n\nJanuary 1967: The metro plan director says a northside shopping mall appears to be dead after rezoning for the land expires, but just two weeks later he reverses that, giving Simon the go-ahead to apply for a building permit.\n\nJuly 1967: Sears announces it will close its downtown store at 115 S. Walnut St. to move into the new mall.\n\nDecember 1967: A Muncie Star article about local development — which cites not only the long-awaited Muncie Mall but also plans for a South Walnut Street K-Mart and the nearly-completed Zayres at the Meadows Shopping Center west of downtown — is accompanied by a photo of a \"Coming Soon, Muncie Mall Shopping Center\" sign in an overgrown field at the corner of McGalliard and Granville.\n\nMay 23, 1969: A formal groundbreaking ceremony is held for the \"multimillion-dollar Muncie Mall... (a) 550,000-square-foot shopping complex at Granville and McGalliard,\" The Muncie Evening Press reports. When completed, the mall is slated to have 45 retailers and \"service firms\" with parking for 3,200 cars. Department stores are Sears, W.T. Grant Co. and Britt's Department Store. Other tenants lined up so far include Standard Supermarket, Osco Drugs, Steck's, Singers, Paul Harris Co., Jonathans, Zales, National Shirt, Kinney Shoes, Goodman Jewelry, Nobil Shoes, Hoyt Wright, Goodyear, Fabric Lane and Neumode Hosiery.\n\nThe '70s: Santa, Sears and so much more\n\nFebruary 1970: Mall construction progresses toward a possible grand opening in August, The Muncie Star reports, noting McGalliard and Granville will be altered by the mall developers later in the year to accommodate expected heavier traffic.\n\nAug. 5, 1970: Sears officially opens its new store, the first Muncie Mall merchant to do so. Muncie Star coverage warns of possible inconvenience for customers during the first few days of Sears' operation since entrance roads from McGalliard to the parking lot are still being completed. Ads for Sears later in the month don't hesitate to promise \"acres of free parking.\" An Evening Press item also published Aug. 5 offers directions for those wondering \"How do you get to the Muncie Mall.\"\n\nSeptember 1970: A Muncie Star article cites the new mall as the major reason that two-lane McGalliard Road has become \"a bottleneck\" between Wheeling Avenue and Broadway, especially during peak traffic hours. \"...With the prospect of the (four-lane) Tillotson-McGalliard extension opening and the increasing traffic to the Muncie Mall, McGalliard Road may prove to be Muncie's road-to-avoid-if-at-all-possible,\" the article states with startling foresight.\n\nOctober 1970: Zales Jewelers opens in Muncie Mall at the start of the month at the same corner it still occupies 50 years later, according to a map published in 1970. In mid-October, Britts department store opens off the center court, featuring \"the only two-way escalator in Muncie.\" Grants advertises for a \"Doorbuster sale\" Oct. 22-24 (a wig case for only $4.44!) at its new Muncie Mall store (later the site of JCPenney).\n\nNov. 2, 1970: The Goodyear Service Store opens at the mall, offering not only tires and auto service but also G.E. major appliance, TVs and stereos.\n\nNovember 1970: An ad for Merchants National Bank promotes its new branch in the mall near Sears with a drive-up window in the parking lot.\n\nNov. 27, 1970: Santa Claus arrives at the new Muncie Mall at 11 a.m., according to an ad in the Thanksgiving paper promoting the appearance the next day. The Thanksgiving ad lists mall businesses open by this time: Merchants National Bank, Steck's Men's Shop, Kinney Shoes, National Shirt, Mode O'Day, Lloyd's Shoes, Osco Drugs, Suzy Boutique, Father and Son Shoe, Zales, Regal Shoes, Regis Beauty Salon, Sears, The Book Shelf, Hickory Farms, Standard Supermarket, Orange Julius, General Nutrition, 33 Flavors Ice Cream, Junior Threads, Michael Thomas, Musicland, Britts, Brooks Fashion, Hoyt Wright, Nobil Shoes, Russell Stover Candies, Neumode Hosiery, Mangels, So-Fro Fabrics, Dean's Magnavox, W.T. Grant, Goodyear, Paul Harris, Singer, Barker's Shoes, Goodman Jewelers, Hot Sam Pretzels and Children's Photographer.\n\nMarch 1971: Holland House Cafeteria opens by the main entrance, down the hall from the center courtyard and Britts. The restaurant closes in 1975.\n\nJune 1971: King's Food Host, a national hamburger chain, opens a standalone restaurant in the mall's parking lot. (During construction, dynamite attached to one of the non-union construction company's trucks in the mall parking lot explodes on a Friday night, shattering windows in the King's building and knocking some mall doors askew.) The restaurant closes in February 1974.\n\nAugust 1971: In the wake of annexation that makes McGalliard Road the city's responsibility, Mayor Paul Cooley says widening McGalliard to four lanes between Wheeling and Ind. 67 to relieve the traffic bottleneck is a top priority, but finding the funds to do so will take at least two years.\n\nSeptember 1971: A first-anniversary celebration for the mall includes the giveaway of a 1971 Vega.\n\nOct. 29, 1971: Late-night TV \"spook show\" host Sammy Terry is featured at the mall's Halloween \"Spooktacular,\" along with a costume parade and contest for kids.\n\nNovember 1973: Mall merchants announce that Christmas decorations this year will be lighted only during peak customer traffic hours in order to save electricity during the nation's energy crisis.\n\nFebruary 1974: An ad from the Muncie Mall Merchants Association lists current businesses in the mall: The Animal Fair, Barker's Shoe Store, Bresler's 33 Flavors, Britts, Brooks, Check'rd Flag, The Children's Photographer, Dean's Magnavox and Frigidare Center, Grant City, Hickory Farms, Cinderella Shoppes, Holland House Cafeteria, Dr. Tavel, Father and Son Shoes, General Nutrition Center, Goodman Jewelers, Goodyear Service Stores, Hot Sam's Pretzel, Hoyt Wright, Junior Threads, Keros Coney Island, King's Food Host, Kinney Shoes, Lloyd's Shoes, Mangels, Merchants National Bank, Mode O'Day, Motherhood Maternity Shop, Musicland, National Shirt Shop, Neumode Hosiery Shop, Nobil's Shoes, Orange Julius, Osco Drug, The Party House, Paul Harris, Regal Shoe Shop, Regis Beauty Salon, Russell Stover Candies, Sears Roebuck and Co., The Singer Company, So-Fro Fabrics, Stecks, Stecks Tree House, W.K. Stweart Book Store, Sultan's Castle, Tiffany Bakery, Tony's Pipe Towne, Town Finance and Zales Jewelers.\n\nMarch 1974: A business column in The Muncie Evening Press notes the Muncie Mall's concourse is being used by people who specifically walk laps for exercise, perhaps the first mention of local \"mall walkers.\"\n\nAugust 1974: Robert Hall Clothes moves into the space previously occupied by Standard Food Market.\n\nJune 1975: A consumer survey conducted for Muncie Mall merchants shows about half of the mall's shoppers are from Muncie, and the other half are \"mainly (from) Albany, Anderson, Dunkirk, Eaton, Gaston, Hartford City, New Castle, Parker City, Portland, Redkey, Winchester and Yorktown,\" The Muncie Evening Press reports.\n\nJuly 1975: The Movies at Muncie Mall, a three-screen United Artists cinema, opens for business, showing \"Funny Lady,\" \"Bite the Bullet\" and \"The Wild McCullochs\" its opening weekend.\n\nOctober 1975: Perkins Pancake and Steak House opens in the former King's Food Host restaurant building in the mall parking lot.\n\nOct. 31, 1975: About a month after starting bankruptcy proceedings, the struggling W.T. Grant Co. closes 280 of its stores in the Midwest, including both Muncie stores, one at the Southway Plaza and the other in one of the anchor spots at Muncie Mall.\n\nDecember 1975: MCL Cafeteria opens in the space formerly occupied by Holland House.\n\nDecember 1976: Plans for a \"major facelift\" for the mall are announced, including a new color scheme of yellow, beige, burnt orange and brown, live-landscaped seating areas and a fountain in the center commons area in front of Britts, which is \"soon to be taken over by L.S. Ayres.\" The rededication ceremony for the newly renovated mall in April 1977 features celebrity guest Ed McMahon.\n\nJanuary 1977: J.C. Penney moves from its downtown store at Charles and Mulberry streets to the former Grant department store's space at the mall, a move that nearly doubles its floor space and allows the store to offer more than 40 retail departments, a hair salon and a 100-seat restaurant.\n\nApril 1977: L.S. Ayres opens at the mall in the former Britts space. Rezoning of land adjacent to Muncie Mall is approved to permit construction of a new building for more retail space, development that eventually becomes Muncie Mall Shoppes to the west along McGalliard.\n\nJune 1978: Ball Stores announces plans to open a shop specializing in men's and women's clothing at Muncie Mall while continuing to operate its existing stores downtown and in The Village. Ball will take over the space previously occupied by Robert Hall Clothes and several other nearby storefronts, making it the fourth largest mall retailer, The Muncie Evening Press reports.\n\n1979: Members of the Mall Merchants Association are told confidentially that three more large stores — Block's, Lazarus and Montgomery Ward — will be added in an extension of the mall concourse, The Muncie Evening Press reports. Simon declines to discuss the expansion publicly; a mall manager later says that plan was put on \"the back burner.\"\n\nOctober 1979: The mall cinema offers midnight showings of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" every Friday and Saturday night.\n\nThe '80s: '53 Muncie Mall merchants to serve you'\n\nDecember 1980: L.S. Ayres at the Muncie Mall advertises special breakfasts with Santa for kids and senior citizens in its in-store restaurant, and features singers from local schools, churches and other groups caroling through the store during the Christmas shopping season.\n\nAugust 1982: The mall announces that Tex Critter's Pizza Jamboree, a chain of \"youth oriented\" restaurants featuring mechanized animals and video games, will open in an empty space next to Sears. That will bring the mall's total occupancy to 58 businesses; the only vacancy is a 250-square-foot stall near Osco Drug, The Muncie Evening Press reports.\n\nFebruary 1983: Naturalizer shoe store opens at Muncie Mall in the spot formerly occupied by Regal Shoes. Sporting goods chain store the Athletic Department announces plans to open that spring in space occupied by Western World, a mall tenant since the mid-1970s that is moving to the long-vacant building last occupied by Perkins Pancakes in the mall's east parking lot.\n\nApril 1983: Mutual Home Federal Savings and Loan Association advertises free \"play money\" demonstrations for those who want to try out its new MoneyMover 24-hour Automatic Teller beside Osco Drug at the Muncie Mall entrance.\n\nNovember 1983: Tex Critter's Pizza Jamboree closes amid its parent company's financial troubles.

From the large parlor floor windows, a curious person can catch the hustle and bustle of the square — tourists snapping photos in front of Mercer House, worshippers filing into Mikve Israel, horse-drawn carriages clomping, and the not-so-occasional trolley slowing to give a glimpse of history.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, John Duncan watched and delighted in Monterey Square's comings and goings, its changes and its scandals. He often stood outside his home, where the garden level doubled as a shop filled with historic ephemera, and regaled tourists with talk of \"Midnight\" and the unusual historical bits that trolley guides often overlooked. His neighborhood changed over the years, with die-hard downtowners ceding to seasonal renters, and Armstrong students disappearing as pierced-and-tattooed art students passed by with portfolios tucked under their arms.\n\nNeed a news break?

John Duncan died on Sept. 21 after a battle with illnesses. He was 84.\n\nEverybody knew John Duncan at Armstrong College, even the FBI\n\nArmstrong College was founded in 1935 in the white brick mansion at the northwest corner of Bull and Gaston streets. When a lanky 6-foot-7-inch, 27-year-old John Duncan arrived to teach history in the fall of 1965, the college only recently had become a non-residential four-year institution recognized by the University System of Georgia. Along with the fledgling academician arrived the civil rights movement, led in many ways by former Savannah Mayor Otis Johnson, who remembers vividly being the first African American student admitted to Armstrong.\n\n“(John) was one of the initial professors that were cordial to me as I was matriculating over there,” he said. “Some of them went out of their way to be friendly and others just bade their distance. (John) was one who was on the friendly side and that carried over through the years.”\n\nBlack youth are thriving in Savannah: Here are 8 young people leading the way.\n\nWhile Johnson said he wouldn’t categorize what Duncan did as extraordinary, the support Duncan and other teachers offered helped Johnson through the college experience.\n\n“He was a liberal. I think it took some courage on the part of white folks to be liberal and to stand up for certain causes. I’m not sure what (political) organization he was a member of, but he let it be known where his politics were, and so I respected him for that.”\n\nDuncan’s height and intellect created a presence around Armstrong and immediately drew Tom Kohler to the history professor when he entered campus in Sept. 1970. “I walked into a Western Civilization 114 class and John was the professor. He was memorable because he was very tall, and immediately irreverent in a sort of wonderful way.”\n\nBut it wasn’t just charm and sarcasm that dictated a John Duncan lecture.\n\n“We go to class and he introduces himself, and he explains that many people think that history has been written; it simply is,” Kohler recounted. “Not so. History is evolving. We’re going back, we’re revisiting (and) we’re understanding (history) in different ways. It’s a dynamic and wonderful subject.”\n\nKohler, a Savannah native said he wasn’t happy to be at the Savannah-based college. He originally wanted to go to the University of Georgia, but that plan didn’t pan out. The flipside: the smaller college allowed more time with the professors, and his time with Professor Duncan fostered a longtime friendship with both John and Ginger once he graduated.\n\n“John was one of the first adults that I met, where I realized, ‘Oh, you can be like an adult, and be like him,’” he said. “Maybe this isn’t gonna be so bad.”\n\nWhile Duncan engaged Kohler’s – and many others’ – minds, that didn’t mean the Armstrong professor of 32 years was beloved by all on campus.\n\n“He wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea,” Kohler said. “He once said in class, ‘Let’s get this straight. Jesus was his name and Christ was his game.’ Many people were offended…the class just kind of roiled up, and then he said, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve just helped you understand the difference in being in high school and in college…\n\nFrom the Archives: Monterey and Madison Squares in Savannah\n\n“He said you could have me fired, but we’re in college, and I have something called tenure. So, I get to say what I want to say, and you get to think what you want to think about it.’”\n\nGinger Duncan said when she met John in 1975, he talked about his long-haired ‘60s days fighting for civil rights in his native Charleston, South Carolina, which garnered the attention of the FBI. “At some point, someone who probably shouldn’t have told him this, told him that he had an FBI file,” Ginger said. “They had read it, and it said that he had colored beads hanging in his apartment. That was his FBI file. He was kind of proud of that.”\n\nBetween Duncan’s sympathies towards students such as Johnson and his irreverence in lectures, he would experience some rocky times at Armstrong College, but nothing that ever tipped the boat completely over.\n\n“Although the parents didn’t necessarily respond well to him, he got called into the president’s office a couple of times from parents who were disapproving of ideas that he had presented, or that he didn’t back up what they believed,” Ginger Duncan said. “That was (his) intention. He wanted the students to have to think about it.”\n\nKohler said he talked a lot with Duncan late in his life about the legacy he would leave — whether it would be the antiques store, his wealth of historical knowledge or his contributions to Savannah. None of those met the mark.\n\n“I taught over 3,000 students at Armstrong; that’s my legacy.”\n\nGiving the writer a look at the Garden of Good and Evil\n\nIn the mid-1980s, some writer from New York made his way to the Hostess City, and Ginger Duncan wasn’t immune to the kerfuffle.\n\n“I think we reacted like a lot of civilians did. It was like, ‘Oh, another (writer).’ Because it seemed like for a while there, everybody and his cousin was writing a book about Savannah.”\n\nBoth John and Ginger warmed up to John Berendt when they finally met him, and Berendt said he immediately took to John due to his endless knowledge of history.\n\n“One of the things I did (when I got to Savannah), because Jim Williams and Mercer House were right in the center of Monterey Square, (was) I walked to every house on the square and interviewed everybody. That’s how I met John and Ginger. And immediately, he was fascinating,” he said.\n\nJohn Duncan had one request, however.\n\n“Before I left, he said, ‘If you don’t mind, would you please not mention our name.’ I asked why and he said, ‘Well, you’re passing through doing this book, we have to go on living here when the book comes out.’”\n\nGinger did not share the same restrictions, Berendt added, and she would go on to make a cameo in both the book version of “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” and the 1997 movie directed by Clint Eastwood. John, though, despite not wanting a presence in the actual book, developed into a “character” once the book came out and was a hit.\n\n“When the book came out, it was a huge response and people from the newspaper would call and ask him various things. Before he knew it, he was a source of information about the book, and I had never quoted him,” Berendt said. “He was so forthcoming that he was assumed by much of the press media to have been a character in the book.”\n\nEventually he was: About a year after the book was released in 1994, Duncan appeared alongside the real-life characters in “Midnight” in a one-year retrospective in an issue of the Savannah Morning News.\n\nBerendt said Duncan’s importance to in the process of writing “Midnight” cannot be overstated. He remembered sitting in the Duncans’ East Taylor parlor and reading aloud chapters of “Midnight” once he’d finished writing them. Ginger recalled taking the pages later and reading them as she worked out in the morning, trying her best not to let them fall off the stationary bicycle as she exercised.\n\nNeither John nor Ginger imagined the book would rise to the popularity it did.\n\nBoo Business: Sometimes the ghost story is too good to lose even if the truth of the Espy House is lost\n\n“I have to be honest, because of the gay content and the time period it was, (I doubted) that (‘Midnight’) would take off, that it would have any significance,” Ginger said. “We had a small gathering for dinner, and after dinner we toasted and I said, ‘Well, here’s to John’s first week on the New York Times bestseller list.’ And everybody laughed, because that seemed like such an extravagant claim at the time. And then, of course, the rest is history.”\n\n“Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” dominated the New York Times bestseller list for 216 weeks.\n\nBerendt said that despite his initial request, John Duncan loved the attention after the book brought people in droves to Savannah. “(‘Midnight’) has been described in the press as a love letter to Savannah and (John) felt that way.”\n\nA shop like one you’d find in a London alleyway\n\nAlthough the East Taylor row house recently sold (though the store is still operational), the V&J Antique Maps sign still hangs above the shop that occupied the garden level of their home.\n\nLongtime friend and Savannah realtor Robert Jones remembers the beginnings of the map emporium because it began in his own antique porcelain shop at 137 Bull St, which the Duncans frequented. “I kept telling him and Ginger that with all these maps and all of his collection, they really should open a shop and they were afraid to do it.”\n\nThey finally relented, adding some of their items to a section of Jones’ store.\n\n“John never would fail to say to anybody that was willing to listen (that) we wouldn’t have ever had that business (and) we would never had done what we’ve done without Robert,” Jones said.\n\n“Most people don’t remember how something happened. If it goes badly, then they certainly remember, but when it goes well, they forget to credit somebody. John never failed to credit me for getting them started and I appreciate it very much.”\n\nEventually the Duncans expanded into the ground floor of their residence, where it became known as a treasure trove of all types of history. John sought out the unusual, preferably on a deal, and something unique to the region, Jones said. The three of them traveled to England to find objects to add to their collections and, on occasion, bring objects from Savannah.\n\n“There was a blue and white porcelain bowl at the Davenport House, and when you’d go there on a tour, all the docents would tell you, ‘Oh, this bowl, we think, is probably attributed to [Colonial American potter] Andrew Duche,’” Jones said, before adding. “The bowl was absolutely Chinese; there was no question in the world about it.”\n\nJones said he convinced a docent friend to allow him to get the bowl appraised on one of his trips to London. In tow were the Duncans to find other items for their collection and the store. The three stayed in an apartment together. Jones came out of his room one morning to find John Duncan eating grits out of the Duche bowl.\n\n“(He had) the biggest grin on his face you have ever seen,” Jones said with a chuckle. And yes, the appraiser confirmed the bowl was of Chinese origin.\n\nFor David Levy, owner of D Levy Antiques & Appraisals and longtime friend of the Duncans, the store was a unique experience for Savannah residents and visitors because there wasn’t anything quite like it in the region.\n\n“It was just filled to the rafters with old stuff, prints, maps, books as well as photographs and other small items that he might come across…,” Levy described. “He had everything divided into different cities or states, or even colleges, and you’ll have different sections for more natural history-type prints versus prints of famous people or architectural scenes.”\n\nHow do we honor its conflicted history?: State's oldest plantation subsumed by industry\n\nLevy said sometimes folks just stopped by on their way through town while international guests visited the city to see what John and Ginger had to sell. “He had customers that spanned probably decades, people that would come into town, discover the shop (and) come in a few years later, and John would remember they had been there (and) sometimes remember what they had bought.\n\n“He had an incredible memory, and he loved sharing knowledge and sharing what he had, and if he found something and knew you collected it, he would tell you that you had to have it. He wanted you to have it, and you worked out a deal.”\n\nLevy said Duncan encapsulated “the last, true Southern gentleman.”\n\n“He had a presence,” he said. “When you opened the door (to the shop), he was sitting right there at the desk and you didn’t realize how big he was until he totally stood up. But he was happy to show people around the shop and tell people where to find something and tell them about it.”\n\nWillis Hakim Jones, Jr. was one of those who received calls from Duncan. Hakim Jones, a collector who credits John for really getting him going, worked at International Paper when he met John Duncan. Because of their shared historical curiosity, they clicked instantly and Duncan took the young historian under his wing to help him navigate the world of antiques.\n\n“He took a lot of time with me, he showed me a lot about collecting and he educated me,” said Hakim Jones, who focuses on regional Black history, specifically items related to the Gullah Geechee.\n\nMaxine L. Bryant: Our youth need to learn about the Reconstruction era Black leaders that helped define Savannah\n\n“‘Don’t try to collect everything,’” Jones remembered Duncan telling him. “He told me to stick with Gullah Geechee, and he was right. I know some well-seasoned collectors that have fabulous collections, but they don’t have the Gullah Geechee story and the Gullah Geechee story is the beginning of African American history in America.”\n\nPast collecting, Jones found inspiration from Duncan as someone who saw promise in him.\n\n“I used to work at Union Camp and he knew I made a pretty decent salary, and [Duncan] used to say, ‘When are you going to stop making money for those white people?’” said Hakim Jones. “So, I don’t know whether it affected me or not, but my wife and I have had a business for almost 15 years now, and I think partially part of that is because he inspired me to go out on my own. His thing was [African Americans] have been mistreated and cheated, so you need to take advantage of this situation that hasn’t been taken advantage of to the fullest.\n\n“So, he was an inspiration in life, not just education.”\n\nAdding to the collection of the city\n\nA lot of that education is available to everyone now. Make an appointment at the Georgia Historical Society or walk through exhibitions at the Telfair Museums, and John Duncan’s name will probably pop up more often than not. The professor never stopped wielding the lecture notes and providing knowledge for others.\n\nNovelist and founder of The Moth, George Dawes Green, credits John Duncan not only with helping him on his latest novel but also inspiring the premise during a lunch one day.\n\n“I was really interested in the question of marronage, which was the maroon communities in South Carolina and Georgia. So, he mentioned to me that there had been a group of Black soldiers who fought for the King of England in the Revolutionary War, and afterwards, they refused to go back into slavery and that they set-up a community on a swamp island, somewhere around Savannah, and I was so intrigued by it.”\n\nDuncan gave Green a college paper he had worked on, and after 20 years, Green finally turned the initial piece of history into “The Kingdoms of Savannah.”\n\n“He was always planting seeds and ideas in students and in writers, and he was so good at connecting people not only with ideas, but connecting people with other people.”\n\nFor Green, John and Ginger Duncan epitomized Savannah. “I always thought John and Ginger’s house has been the center of this really vibrant, gracious Savannah that we all would love Savannah to be,” he said. “It isn’t always (that) we think of Savannah as this great, gracious place, but some of that is fictional. When you’re at John and Ginger Duncan’s, you always felt like this is just a beautiful community of historians, artists and compassionate people.”\n\nA lifelong Savannahian, Harry DeLorme remembers the extensive work of John Duncan — not just as his late brother’s Armstrong professor but Duncan’s later contributions to Telfair Museums.\n\nDeLorme, Telfair’s director of education and senior curator, said he wasn’t there when John started teaching at Armstrong, but he did get to work closely with the old professor. “I started working with him going back to 1989, 1990, I would say. I curated my first sort of larger exhibition here and John was one of the lenders to that.\n\n“For decades, (John) really was the go-to guy in Savannah for information on the city’s history, particularly on materials, archival materials (and) images related to the city’s history.”\n\nAccording to Telfair’s records, the Duncans lent 112 items to the museum, including a large collection of glassware and furniture that can be found at Telfair Academy, walking canes from Willis Hakim Jones, Jr., paintings and drawings from Myrtle Jones and Christopher Murphy, and photography of Savannah by George N. Barnard.\n\nDeLorme echoed many others when he said that John had a keen eye for artists, especially those around the region. “He just participated in so many ways to, I think, the culture of the city and his collecting, his research (and) his archives have really contributed a lot to how we understand the city and how we think about the city visually.”\n\nTodd Groce, executive director of the Georgia Historical Society, said the historical knowledge of the city is what Savannah is losing most with Duncan’s passing. He was always someone Groce would send a curious student or visitor to if they had a question that he couldn’t quite nail down.\n\n“I think it’s a loss for them, I mean, we’ve lost a lot of the historical memory of the state. He was here for a long time and he understood the city.\n\n“He was a very shrewd observer of people and I think he could really read people. I think he understood that the real essence of history is people and it’s the story. In history, the word story is in (the name) because it’s about people and it’s about stories, and John could bring out that color.”\n\nThe old timbers are falling in Savannah\n\nGinger Duncan remembers the square around the “Midnight” years. They were familiar and (for the most part) friendly faces.\n\n“I remember I was gonna get some t-shirts made and it was gonna say: 1) the big, red brick house across the square and 2) what kind of dog is that?” she said, remembering how fans of “Midnight” would stop by inquiring where the Mercer House was and what breed their movie star dogs were (trivia answer: Cavalier King Charles Spaniel).\n\n'Savannah is a writers' town': The creative spirit of the city influences local authors\n\nBut that all still brought change, Ginger said. “It’s interesting that something (“Midnight”) that reflected so accurately a part of what Savannah was, also changed it so much because of the effect it had on the city; bringing people in and raising property values and the whole business.”\n\n“After the book came out, I couldn’t go anywhere without being recognized; restaurants, anywhere. It was always nice to have a little spark of recognition,” said Berendt, a vaunted celebrity after the book was published. “I now have white hair, or what’s left, and some people still recognize me. But I could walk past some people who know the book very well and were very used to seeing my picture in the paper or on TV, who would walk right by me (now).”\n\nBook or no book, people knew and feted John Duncan. He was a professor, a historian, a collector, a father figure, a mentor, a researcher, a personality, a (brief) actor but most importantly, he was a Savannahian.\n\n“The old guard always passes and something new will come, I’m sure it will,” Ginger Duncan said with a sigh. “But it won’t be the same. It won’t be the same city at all.”\n\nZach Dennis is the editor of the arts and culture section, and weekly Do Savannah alt-weekly publication at the Savannah Morning News.

Delaware?\n\nLong a darling of secretive limited liability companies, the First State is building a reputation as a prime location for out-of-state art collectors and investors to park their multimillion-dollar masterpieces and reap the tax benefits.\n\nIn the last two years, New Castle County has seen a proliferation of maximum-security art storage companies, including several Manhattan offshoots, that lock up hundreds of millions of dollars worth of paintings and sculptures by Old Masters and buzzworthy emerging artists.\n\nBut ordinary citizens will likely never see this work, including a 10-piece rocket installation.\n\nThat's because many of these one-of-a-kind creations will never leave their crates.\n\nArt buyers, including those more passionate about diversifying their portfolios than enjoying their artwork, can ship their purchases directly to Delaware storage facilities and avoid paying sales tax for as long as the items remain here. For the Manhattanite, that amounts to a nearly $900,000 savings on a $10 million painting.\n\nThe advantages don't stop there. Delaware doesn't tax inventory, it recently repealed its estate tax and it offers less expensive land for storage facilities ideally situated between New York and Washington, D.C., art experts say.\n\nAs Geneva and New York crack down on an opaque art market reeling from money laundering and tax evasion scandals, Delaware shines as a pro-business beacon, one that is, arguably, less likely to suffer loss from terrorists, natural disasters or art capers.\n\nSTORY: Delaware's unemployment rate continues to climb, bucking national trend\n\nSTORY: DTC's 'Something Wicked': Dazzling theatrical rocket ride\n\nSeveral storage companies offer direct, weekly shuttle service from Delaware to New York –– and back again. Masterworks are transported from cavernous warehouses straight out of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" to New York City showrooms crawling with potential buyers.\n\n\"I've never been treated so courteously, friendly and positively than in Delaware,\" said Fritz Dietl, who owns the Delaware Freeport in a Newark, one of at least five art storage companies in Delaware. All are located in New Castle County.\n\n\"There's no better place to do business in the world.\"\n\nDietl, an Austrian-born New Yorker, went one step further than his local competitors by securing a Foreign-Trade Zone designation from U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 2015. That means art shipped from abroad enters duty-free to his 36,000-square-foot warehouse.\n\n\"Think about it like playing Monopoly,\" says Patricia Cannon of the state Division of Small Business, Development and Tourism. \"No one can hurt you on home base.\"\n\nSince touting tax savings is considered gauche, Dietl and others emphasize that their facilities, collectively totaling more than 200,000-square-feet, benefit the broader community — not just their ultra-wealthy clientele — by bringing in new jobs, investment in derelict buildings and spinoff business for local accountants, lenders, lawyers and art conservators.\n\nDelaware also gains notoriety by catering to the high-powered art world, the business owners claim.\n\nBut local art lovers question the direct benefit to the First State. Each storage facility employs only a handful of people, their high-value holdings do nothing to boost government coffers and few, if any, storage sites have partnered with area museums to develop a lending program, which has been established in other states.\n\nRepresentatives from the Delaware Art Museum, Winterthur Museum and the Brandywine River Museum said they haven't been approached to display the stockpiled art, and they don't even know what's there.\n\nWinterthur has paid a couple of local facilities to store empty crates during temporary exhibitions, according to museum registrar Beth Parker Miller.\n\n\"Having someone in our backyard is a little more convenient,\" she said. \"Winterthur doesn't generate that much business for them.\"\n\nArt storage operators say their clients are a mix of dealers, pure investors, museums, inheritors of art both local and abroad, and collectors who own multiple homes with limited wall space.\n\n\"You keep collecting. That's an addiction,\" Dietl explained. \"That addiction feeds our warehouse.\"\n\nLocal gallery owners report they don't know any Delawareans who would want their collections stuffed in crates rather than on display.\n\n\"The people I know aren't buying paintings of mass value so they can store them and resell them,\" said Vicki Manning, co-founder of Somerville-Manning Gallery in Greenville.\n\n\"My clients are buying the work for their enjoyment.\"\n\nBehind the iron curtain\n\nLike bars of gold at Fort Knox, Delaware's hidden treasures are buried in unmarked, video-monitored fortresses in large industrial parks with multiple barriers to entry.\n\nThink of them as offshore banks for art, flush with million-dollar fire suppression systems and industry-validated climate controls — all in an effort to provide maximum assurance that their precious cargo is safe and secure.\n\nCompanies refrain from listing exact locations on their websites. Of the four that granted access to The News Journal, two refused to allow photographs of the actual storage areas. Others obscured packing slips.\n\nClient identities, along with the provenance of the art and the total value, remain a mystery.\n\n\"Discretion is a huge concern for our clients,\" acknowledged Derek Jones, executive director of Atelier Art Storage and Services near New Castle.\n\nEach storage facility is slightly different in terms of size, layout and market niche, but all sell square footage in large, open-air rooms filled with racks of artwork and unopened boxes, along with handling packing and shipping. Most also offer private rooms that function as glorified safety deposit boxes for customers seeking an added layer of security and anonymity.\n\nIntimate gallery spaces within the warehouses allow clients to have pieces inspected and appraised away from prying eyes.\n\nThat's where Kristin deGhetaldi comes in — escorted, of course.\n\nA graduate of the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, deGhetaldi can size up an easel painting's condition, analyze particular pigments and document any travel damage (which, she says, rarely happens).\n\nThe painting conservator has expanded her business by servicing local art storage facilities about once a month. The facilities, in turn, appreciate the local expertise and use it to help recruit clients.\n\n\"It's a particular niche that Delaware can fill,\" explained deGhetaldi, who also teaches at UD.\n\nLaunched in 1991, Bayshore Fine Art Storage is among the oldest of Delaware's art storage facilities and one of two local, family-owned businesses, along with Hopkins & Sons in New Castle. Both were longtime moving and storage companies that carved out a specialty in art.\n\n\"My stepfather got a call out of the blue one day from a private collector in California who asked if we could build him a room,\" said Bayshore Vice President Matt Larmore, who now operates two art storage facilities near Glasgow totaling 60,000 square feet. \"We've been growing the business ever since.\"\n\nThe company constructed vaulted chambers within its warehouses – described as buildings-within-a-building – to maximize security.\n\n\"The insurance guys like to tease me,\" Larmore said. \"We've built in so much redundancy but we are constantly asking ourselves what we can do better.\"\n\nLarmore admits he's not an art aficionado, but three of his competitors are. All came to Delaware within a six-month span in 2015.\n\nFirst was Philadelphia-based Atelier, which oversaw the relocation of the Barnes Foundation's 4,000-piece collection from Lower Merion to Philadelphia in 2012. Atelier put down roots in Delaware in the summer of 2015, largely thanks to Mati Bonetti de Buccini, wife of real estate developer Chris Buccini whose company The Buccini/Pollin Group has spearheaded the redevelopment of Wilmington.\n\n\"When we moved from New York City, I saw that Delaware had something unique to offer when it came to art storage,\" recalls Bonetti de Buccini, now director of Atelier's 40,000-square-foot space. \"I met with Derek and instead of competing we decided to partner up.\"\n\nAtelier's facility comes equipped with a fleet of 15 GPS-monitored vehicles that resemble refrigerated trucks to appear inconspicuous. Some big-ticket collections inside the warehouse necessitate their own heads of security and biometric readers that authenticate fingerprints.\n\nShortly after Atelier moved in, Crozier Fine Arts, a known commodity on the Manhattan and Hamptons art scenes, opened its seventh U.S. facility four miles away. The company was recently acquired by Iron Mountain, a $10 billion Boston-based document storage company.\n\nCrozier's more unusual art occupants have been Napoleon Bonaparte's hat and an enormous painting made of bubblegum that had to be stored flat.\n\nThe 41,000-square-foot New Castle warehouse is run by Randall Brockett, a striking figure with chin-length hair and a slight European accent whose romance with a Russian-born real estate magnate briefly captured the attention of New York City gossip columnists.\n\nWhile giving a tour to U.S. Sen. Chris Coons last month, Brockett noted that Crozier previously leased space from Bayshore to test the market. He applauded Delaware for its panoply of tax advantages, explaining that short-term clients are lured here because they can get in and out quickly with minimal fuss.\n\n\"All we want is for them to have their private jet serviced and incorporated in Delaware,\" the Democrat senator joshed.\n\nInternational intrigue\n\nPrivate jets are a fixture at Le Freeport Luxembourg, conveniently located next to the country's only airport with a paved runway.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, Christie's operates a fine art storage facility within the Singapore FreePort. An auction house spokeswoman declined comment for this story.\n\nGeneva pioneered the freeport concept more than a century ago with bonded warehouses that temporarily housed commodities like grain and tea. Today, more than $100 billion in goods, including Van Goghs, Picassos and Gaugins, are believed to be held in Switzerland's custom-free zones. Freeports also store fine wines, diamonds, rugs, vintage cars, musical instruments, cigars and taxidermy.\n\nThe difference between a freeport and a regular art storage warehouse is that freeport clients are exempt from paying import taxes or duties, which can be 5 to 15 percent of the work's value. And if an artwork is sold at a freeport, the transaction tax is waived.\n\nNot surprisingly, this high-roller world has attracted controversy. The leaked Panama Papers in 2015 revealed that an alleged Nazi-looted painting by Modigliani had been stored in Geneva's tax-free vaults.\n\nFor the past two years, Yves Bouvier, owner of Geneva Freeport and partner in a Singapore facility, has been embroiled in a high-profile dispute with a Russian billionaire over selling works at huge markups. Bouvier has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSimilarly, billionaire international art dealer Guy Wildenstein was accused of hiding art and assets in a maze of foreign trusts and moving millions of dollars in artworks from New York to Switzerland. He was cleared of tax fraud earlier this year.\n\nArt storage is definitely a rich man's game, acknowledged Dietl, who wears a pressed shirt and sparse beard. \"When you invest in stocks, you don't pay use or sales tax. Art has become an asset in the same way.\"\n\nEdged with sunflowers, the Delaware Freeport shares grounds with a purveyor of forklifts and rail siding. Just past the loading dock and stark white viewing room, Dietl offers a glimpse behind the steel veil: Art stored at a comfortable 69 degrees with 50 percent relative humidity.\n\nA high school dropout who launched an art transportation company a quarter-century ago, Dietl says he has worked with every major museum around the world and relies on word-of-mouth advertising. Clients are charged a few dollars per square foot a month.\n\nDelaware art storage facilities generally charge customers 20 percent less than equivalent facilities in New York, according to Karen Boyer, founder of Elements in Play, a New York-based art advisory firm.\n\n\"If you're buying a $3 million painting and don't plan to hang it for a period of time, it makes perfect sense,\" she said.\n\nDelaware Freeport is one of only five sites in the state certified as a foreign-trade zone, along with the Port of Wilmington, the juice importer Citrosuco, the Delaware City Refinery and the Wilmington pharmaceutical company Noramco. Dietl pays the state $10,000 a year for the designation, according to Cannon, director of intergovernmental relations and special projects for the state economic development office\n\nIt's a \"marketing pitch,\" she said. Art has to be more than 100 years old for the customs duty to apply, anyway, \"and they’re not moving in and out of Delaware too often.\"\n\nBut the pitch apparently worked. Dietl says he's at capacity and is scouting a second Newark location to double his storage space.\n\nShipping art two hours south from New York is safer and more cost-efficient than sending it to halfway around the world, he said.\n\n\"It makes us the absolute equivalent to the Geneva Freeport.\"\n\nSoon, New York's first freeport could give Dietl and Delaware a run for the money.\n\nThis fall, ARCIS will open a 110,000-square foot facility in Harlem that can store as much as 2.5 billion worth of goods duty-free. Like the Delaware Freeport, ARCIS clients' valuables will be exempt from U.S. duty and excise taxes until they exit; New York state sales tax may still apply.\n\nLocated at a global epicenter for art and finance, the four-story, sustainable building is responding to pent-up demand after about 165,000-square-feet of art storage space that disappeared from Manhattan last year because of property turnover, according to ARCIS Executive Director Tom Sapienza.\n\n\"I don't see Delaware as competition,\" he said, explaining that ARCIS boasts the largest dock in the tristate area and was built to conform with the strict specifications of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Security features include both retina and vascular scanning upon entry.\n\nThe art storage market is boundless, according to Sapienza, because \"every day more art is being created.\"\n\nMarket research backs him up. While the mercurial art market contracted in 2015, global art sales are still estimated to be from $45 billion to $57 billion annually.\n\nLast year, nearly two-thirds of art collectors reported that investment returns were an important motivating factor in purchasing art compared to 47 percent in 2014, according to a Deloitte Luxembourg & ArtTactic Art & Finance Report.\n\nThat's troubling to art buffs like Barry Schlecker, who has been known to hyperventilate in the presence of a folk art piece made of mud or molasses. He now owns more than 400 of them and estimates his collection is worth around $50,000.\n\n\"To buy a piece of art and stick it in a vault so you can't see it and enjoy it – I don't get it,\" said Schlecker, who produces the Brandywine Festival of the Arts.\n\nHe acknowledged the lucrative business potential, however.\n\n\"I guess whenever you go to McDonald's, you're going to find a Wendy's or Burger King.\"\n\nHome-court advantage\n\nDespite the saturated landscape, Delaware's five art storage facilities have yet to join forces with dozens of museums across the state.\n\nOther states, like California, offer collectors tax exemptions if they ship an artwork to a museum in a state without sales tax and display it there for 90 days. When the piece is ultimately sent back, California waives its 7.25 percent sales tax and the museum exposure can boost the value of the art.\n\nBoth the Portland Art Museum and Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art at the University of Oregon have benefited from this arrangement. The Schnitzer Museum advertises on its website the tax benefits of its Masterworks on Loan program.\n\nBut don't expect the Delaware Art Museum to try something similar.\n\n\"We only take loans when the loans make sense for us,\" said Heather Campbell Coyle, the museum's chief curator.\n\nThe museum already displays less than 5 percent of its collection due to space constraints, she continued. Loaned artwork must fit into the exhibition schedule and allow \"us to present something meaningful to our community.\"\n\nTwo years ago, Manning said she agreed to present works loaned to her by California collectors looking for a tax break. She won't do it again.\n\n\"I can bring in work of that quality and have it for sale in my gallery,\" she explained.\n\nJohn Schoonover, grandson of popular Wilmington illustrator Frank Schoonover, said he doesn't begrudge art storage companies and their clients for making a buck.\n\nAsked how his grandfather, a former pupil of Howard Pyle, would react if his Hopalong Cassidy and Joan of Arc images were heaped in a plywood crate somewhere, the gallery owner responded diplomatically.\n\nIt \"goes with the territory\" of being a commercial artist, he said.\n\n\"Most of my artists are dead so they're not going to complain.\"\n\nTax deferral or tax dodge?\n\nThe art owners aren't complaining either. Experts say Delaware offers collectors – particularly pure investors – a number of tax advantages found in few other states.\n\nChief among them is Delaware’s lack of sales or use tax. Delaware is one of only five states hawking that benefit, and the only one in the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n“It’s a huge difference, especially over a place like New York City where most of the art transactions originate,” said Jack Sullivan, a tax and corporate law attorney based in Manhattan.\n\nNew York City’s sales tax is 8.875 percent. Buy a $10 million painting in the Big Apple and have it shipped to Park Avenue? That’s an $887,500 tax bill.\n\nBut ship it to the home of tax-free shopping and the tax bill is a whopping zero.\n\nThere’s only one catch:\n\nThe sales-tax savings evaporates if the same New York City collector decides to retrieve the work from Delaware and hang it on his living room wall. That event is supposed to be reported in tax filings, but it's an honor system that experts say often gets ignored.\n\n\"It’s no different than when someone from Pennsylvania buys a TV at Best Buy in Wilmington and does not pay tax on it once they get home,” Delaware accountant Jordan Rosen said. “Enforcement is not what it could be and people are not as honest as they could be.” The system is fraught with \"chicanery,\" Sullivan agreed. Auction houses may claim to ship art to Delaware or a tax haven in Europe, but \"it really goes out the back door.\"\n\nSince gaming the system with a flat-screen TV is less of a financial hit to the government than, say, an N.C. Wyeth painting, state attorneys general have stepped up their investigations of tax-dodging art collectors.\n\nLast year, the Swiss Parliament also tightened regulations for freeports, after clients began shipping their work to less scandal-tainted locations, including in Delaware.\n\nTodd Levin, director of Levin Art Group consultancy in New York, advises his clients to just pay the sales tax in their home state and be done with it.\n\n\"In most cases, I'm not convinced that every T is crossed and every I is dotted,\" he said of the storage facilities.\n\nThat's a non-issue in tiny Delaware. Even the dead here get a tax break.\n\nThe General Assembly last summer voted to repeal Delaware’s estate tax, which tops out at 16 percent. Starting Jan. 1, that could save millions of dollars for the estates of the deceased that own more than $5.5 million worth of paintings and antiques stored here.\n\n“The repeal of the estate tax is a huge, huge thing that was on my wishlist for the past year,” said Brockett, the Crozier manager.\n\nAnother incentive for out-of-staters is that if they form a trust in Delaware, they can avoid paying estate taxes in their home state, according to legal experts.\n\nA trust is a legal entity similar to a small corporation that can hold assets, such as cash or property, and \"lend\" it to heirs tax-free. Trusts can last forever in Delaware, unlike in most states.\n\n“Artwork is something of a natural fit for a dynasty trust,” said Scott Swenson, a partner at Connolly Gallagher who heads the Delaware Bar Association’s estates and trusts section. “It means your family can retain it in perpetuity as long as it is legally owned by the trust.\"\n\n\"And the art can physically reside anywhere.”\n\nDespite those advantages, New York lawyers who work closely with high-wealth art collectors claim that Delaware's tax benefits are a bit overblown.\n\nSteve Schindler heads the art law group for the firm Schindler Cohen & Hochman and chairs the art law committee for the New York City Bar Association. Collectors often ignore the sales tax imposed by their home states, he said, and hire competent professionals to mitigate estate taxes and other costs.\n\n“I think there’s some clever marketing going on here,\" the Manhattan attorney said. “In my personal experience, I’m not seeing clients overwhelmingly gravitating to Delaware.”\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.

Early bellows probably were a bag made from the skin of a small animal and a piece of metal, usually brass, to direct the gust of air created by squeezing the bellows.\n\nLater examples had stiff wooden boards and leather sides. Nails rust, and leather and wood dry out, crack and have to be replaced, so most of the antique bellows found today are repaired or made in the 19th century.\n\nMany were hand-decorated, and some even had wooden sides carved by cabinet makers. Many antique bellows have attractive folk art decorations and are wanted for the art, not for use with a fireplace. Most new and many old bellows sell for under $100, but in April 2014, an unusual 1800s bellows with original leather painted to look like a man's face had a bid of $2,700 at a Showtime auction.\n\nQ: I inherited a framed painting that hung in my grandfather's living room since at least the 1920s. It's a painting of a gondola with a few passengers and a standing gondolier. But they're not riding on a canal; instead, they're floating down what appears to be an underground cave. The painting is signed \"M. Gianni\" in the lower left corner.\n\nA: Here are a few things to do to learn more about your painting:\n\nFirst, make sure it really is a painting and not a print. If you can't tell, take it to an expert in your area.\n\nThen check online artist databases. You can find some information online, but you can learn more if you go to your local library and ask someone there to help you search databases that the library subscribes to. \"M. Gianni\" may be an Italian artist named Maria Gianni, who was born in the 19th century but worked into the 20th. She painted using watercolors and gouache.\n\nIf you have an original painting, its value depends on its condition and size. Some Maria Gianni paintings have auctioned for prices in the low hundreds, but others have topped $1,000.\n\nQ: I have a 6-foot-tall cardboard cutout of Elvis Presley wearing his black leather outfit. I've had it for 20 years. What is it worth?\n\nA: Life-size cardboard cutouts of Elvis still are being made and sell for about $20-$30 today.\n\nQ: I bought some green frosted pressed-glass dishes at an estate sale. They are clear glass on the inside and frosted green-blue on the outside. The frosting looks green from the front and bluish from the back. The plates have \"KIG Indonesia\" in raised letters on the surface on the outer edge. Can you tell me anything about them? Are they safe to eat from?\n\nA: Most frosted glass dishes are safe to use. Frosted glass is made by acid-etching or sandblasting clear glass. Since the \"inside\" of your dishes are clear and are the surface the food touches, you can be sure they are OK. \"KIG\" stands for Kedaung Industrial Group, which was founded in Jakarta, Indonesia, by Agus Nursalim in 1969. The company started out making glass and tableware for Indonesia but was soon exporting goods throughout the world.\n\nEventually the Kedaung Industrial Group included more than 30 companies that made glassware, enamel cookware, ceramic housewares, stainless-steel flatware, glass blocks, ceramic tiles and other products. It claimed to be one of the world's largest manufacturers of glass, and had retail stores in several cities. The company also made reproduction early-American glass. In the United States, products were sold at Walmart and other stores.\n\nQ: We have an oak hanging map cabinet that's 51 inches wide by 21 inches high. It holds seven large pull-down canvas maps printed by W. & A.K. Johnston of Edinburgh, Scotland. They include maps of Asia, Africa, Europe, North and South America, the United States and a couple of the two hemispheres. The maps of Europe show the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Russian Empire, not the Soviet Union. The map of Africa is barely recognizable. There's a large country in the center of the continent labeled \"Congo Free State.\" How old are the maps, and what is the full cabinet worth?\n\nA: Look for a copyright date on the maps to date them more precisely. They predate World War I, which ended the Austro Hungarian Empire and saw the formation of the Soviet Union. The Congo Free State existed from 1885 to 1908, so the maps can more precisely be dated as pre-1908.\n\nWilliam Johnston (1802-1888) and Alexander Keith Johnston (1804-1871) were partners in a printing business that they founded in Edinburgh in 1826. Alexander became a respected geographer, and the brothers' firm eventually printed and sold maps, atlases, guidebooks and globes. Some very old maps can sell for millions. Your maps, designed for educational purposes, are not worth that much, but your cabinet and maps could sell for hundreds of dollars if the maps are in excellent condition.\n\nTip: When rewiring an old Arts and Crafts lamp, use fabric-covered wire that looks very much like the silk-wrapped cord used at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nCurrent prices\n\n• Coal scuttle, tole, painted landscape, cutout handles, France, 12 inches, $70.\n\n• Wooden egg crate, J.G.

A result of a cooperative partnership by the city of Great Falls, Cascade County, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Department of Transportation, PPL Montana and the volunteer trail advocacy group, Recreational Trails Inc., it is one of the urban delights of Great Falls that blends the city with its rural surroundings. Some of its \"splashy features include Black Eagle Falls, Rainbow Falls, Crooked Falls, Ryan Falls (the \"great falls of the Missouri\") and Morony Falls, outdoor art and memorial benches and tables and picnic shelters.\n\nIn 1990, Recreational Trails Inc. formed to help forge the riverside route, which grows each year with new places and trails to explore. The paved, wheelchair-accessible trail runs along the south shore of the river, from Oddfellows Park, which is near the Warden Bridge on 10th Avenue South, past Broadwater Bay, Mitchell Pool, Gibson and Elks Riverside Parks, Black Eagle Falls, the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, Giant Springs Heritage State Park and Rainbow Falls to the Crooked Falls Overlook. The asphalt ends there, but the trail doesn't. A dirt trail stretches along the cliffs another three miles to Cochrane Dam.\n\nEast of Great Falls, the North Shore Trail follows along Cochrane, Ryan and Morony reservoirs. The trail begins at the end of Rainbow Dam Road and includes gravel and single track segments totaling more than 13 miles. A single-track trail now runs between Rainbow and Morony dams, and a trailhead has been established at Rainbow Dam. An expert single-track trail between Ryan and Cochrane dams provides an exceptional way to explore the river canyon east of town. Interpretive signs describing the ecology of the area have been provided by the Cascade Conservation District and the Missouri River Council, and QR Code signs along the trail make information about the trail and dams available to smartphone users.\n\nThe Montana Department of Transportation has completed the design of the Sun River Connector Trail to extend a separated bike and pedestrian connection along Country Club Blvd., between the west approach of the Warden Bridge and 6th Street Southwest, and construction will begin in 2016. This summer's improvements will include a paved loop from Heritage Park down to Giant Springs, a new trail between the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center and Giant Springs and the opening of a 2.1-mile loop linking the Heritage Center, Giant Springs and Heritage Park. Paving will be done to the parking area at Bay Drive, and United Materials will be redoing the shoulders along the trail from 15th Street to Giant Springs.\n\nSummer 2015 activities include Audubon West Wednesday Walks for bird watching along the river and on Sacajawea Island, Cochrane Dam crossings on July 11 and Aug. 22 and a number of \"fun runs\" and mountain bike activities. For details call 788-3313 or read more about the trails at www.thetrail.org.\n\n2 The C.M. Russell Museum\n\nVisitors from all over the world enjoy the Great Falls museum named after the famous cowboy artist who adopted Great Falls as his home more than a century ago. They also can enjoy the Russell Rider Sculpture Garden, a place \"families can come, free of charge, all four seasons\" to picnic, roam the garden and appreciate wonderful art including five major bronze pieces. Five galleries have been installed to showcase the \"astonishing depth and range\" of Russell's art, which ranged from paintings and sculpture to illustrated letters and pen-and-ink drawings during his lifetime (1864-1926). The museum has some 2,000 Russell artworks, personal objects and a \"permanent collection of more than 12,000 objects\" including works of such well-known artists as O.C. Seltzer, Winold Reiss, J.H. Sharp and Frank Tenney Johnson.\n\nDon't miss \"The Bison: American Icon, Heart of the Plains Indian Culture,\" the most ambitious permanent exhibition ever displayed at the C.M. Russell Museum. With about 500 artifacts and a thundering buffalo diorama that shakes as you walk over it, the $1.5 million exhibition is a fitting subject because three-quarters of the Russell Museum's entire collection of paintings and sculpture involve Indians and bison. The \"Browning Firearms Collection\" of rifles, shotguns and handguns surveys the significant developments made by the Browning, Winchester and Colt companies. New this season is \"Harmless Hunter: The Wildlife Work of Charles M. Russell,\" runs through Sept. 13, and \"focuses for the first time on Russell's painting of wildlife.\"\n\nRight beside the museum is Russell's Log Studio, built in 1903. The artifacts in it belonged to Russell and were used for reference in his artwork. The Russell home next door was built in 1900 under the supervision of his wife, Nancy. During the summer, the museum, located at 400 13th St. N., is open Tuesday to Sunday. Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the cabin studio is open 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and the home is open 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Admission is $9 for adults, $7 for seniors, retired military and schedule tour groups, $4 for students and is free for active military and kids under age 5. Call 727-8787, or visit www.cmrussell.org.\n\n3 Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center is nestled into the bluffs of the Missouri River overlooking a section of river where the famed explorers portaged two centuries ago to avoid the nearby waterfalls. Black Eagle Falls, the uppermost of the five falls, is visible from the big windows of the interpretive center. Outside, four pedestrian trails connect the interpretive center with Giant Springs Heritage State Park, and a bicycle-pedestrian trail connects the interpretive center with the River's Edge Trail via a tunnel beneath Giant Springs Road.\n\nInside the center, the exhibits are educational and interactive. The ground floor includes the ornate Compass Rose, with a list of private contributors who helped finance the original construction. Only half of the construction cost was funded with federal money. Pictographs tell the explorers' story in Indian drawings. Grabbing the most attention as visitors enter the center is a striking life-size diorama of buckskin-clad explorers hefting a 30-foot canoe up a ravine in their portage around the falls. The exhibit stretches two stories and is framed by vast windows overlooking the Missouri.\n\nThe center \"imparts to the public a personal sense of President Thomas Jefferson's vision of expanding America to the west; it inspires awe and awakens curiosity toward the challenges faced by the expedition as they portaged the great falls of the Missouri river and explored the 'unknown'; brings to life the daily experiences of the expedition and the environment and native peoples of the 'uncharted West'; and celebrated the indomitable spirit of human discovery we all share,\" according to the center's mission statement.\n\nThe 26th Annual Lewis and Clark Festival is taking place June 19-21 and promises to deliver participants \"back to ways of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and life out on the open frontier of the West.\" This special event includes historical programs, children's activities, Native American cultural programs, artisans and local craftspeople and a variety of local food vendors.\n\nOn Fridays beginning June 26, \"Riverside Voices,\" staff of the center and guest presenters, offer evening programs in the amphitheater on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River or in the indoor theater. Topics include medicine on the expedition, the boats used in the journey, changes in the river since the exploration and more Lewis and Clark history and related subjects. A \"Star Party Extravaganza\" for learning about our night sky with the Central Montana Astronomy Society, is Sept. 25 in the center's parking lot.\n\nSummer hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m. daily. Costs are $8 for adults and free for those 15 and younger. Federal Interagency Annual, Senior, Military and Access Passes are honored for free entry.\n\nContact Information: 4201 Giant Springs Road, Great Falls, MT 59405. Phone: 406-727-8733.\n\n4 Alive @ Five\n\nIf you enjoy live music, street dancing and great food, friends and fun, plan to attend Alive @ 5, a \"big city experience in the heart of Great Falls.\" Every Thursday from June 11 through Aug. 6 (except for July 30), one designated area of downtown comes alive with \"the finest street music tradition\" of food vendors, liquid refreshments, live music and activities for children. The June 18 date was reserved for \"Taste of Great Falls,\" a sampling of fare from local restaurants, and Aug. 6 also will be a fundraiser for Roberts Park. The events are held from 5 to 9 p.m. Call 406-453-6151 or visit downtowngreatfalls.net for more information.\n\n5 Giant Springs State Park\n\nFirst documented by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805, Giant Springs is one of the largest freshwater springs in the world. This is also the site of the Roe River, once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's shortest river. Giant Springs flows at a measured 7.9 million gallons per hour or 156 million gallons of water per day. The water stays at a temperature of 54 degrees and has been carbon dated to be about 3,000 years old. More than a quarter of a million lovers of nature visit Giant Springs Heritage Park each year. Many come to marvel at this remarkable feature, or to view the 80-plus species of birds, mammals and reptiles. On any day you may find bicyclists, fishing enthusiasts, photographers and many others; some come to visit the nearby Rainbow Falls Overlook, the visitor center and the fish hatchery.\n\nThe fish hatchery program raises from 700,000 to 800,000 fish annually. They are then distributed to areas in central Montana from the Canadian border to the Wyoming border. A group picnic site is also available. The Fish, Wildlife and Parks visitor center (right across from the roadway from the springs) features taxidermy mounts of grizzly and black bears, educational features on fish and bird recognition, wildlife photographs, and a mini-theater that shows wildlife videos. Pets on leash are welcome.\n\nEvents at the park include ranger talks dealing with the wildlife of the area, bird strolls and kids activities. Check the website at stateparks.mt.gov for specific dates. Concerts will be held in the park on July 12 and Aug.9, and visitors may want to plan to attend Movie Night in the Park on Aug. 21 or the Fall Family Fest on Oct. 17.\n\nLocated off U.S. Highway 87 in Great Falls, then a mile east on River Drive to Giant Springs Road. The park is open year-round from are 8 a.m. to sunset; the visitor center is open Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free for vehicles with Montana plates and $6 per vehicle for those from out-of-state.\n\n6 Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art\n\nOne of Great Falls' oldest and most recognizable landmarks, the Square, at 1400 1st Ave. N., has served as a center for learning and growth for more than 100 years. Built of native gray sandstone, the structure was completed in 1896 and served for 34 years as a high school and for 45 years as a junior high. \"Art is for everyone\" is the premise of the Square; since 1977, it has provided a \"dynamic program of exhibitions, classes, lectures, tours and performances designed to nurture the region's creative spirit.\"\n\nThe \"Val Knight Retrospective,\" a new permanent exhibition has been added to the Square and includes 25 remarkable works done from the 1960s to the 1990s by the late Great Falls artist in a variety of media that includes encaustic paintings, ceramic figurines and graphic drawings. Other summer exhibitions include \"The Blind Men & the Elephant: Drawings by Steven Glueckert\" until Aug. 1; \"Artist in Residence – Danielle O'Malley\" until Sept. 1; \"Alas, the Pelicans: Randi O'Brian\" until Sept. 11; and Manel Alvares: A Journey\" July 28-Oct. 16.\n\nHome-style cooking with an international flair is the forté of Café Paris, which is open for two lunch services, at noon and 12:30 p.m., on Wednesdays and Thursdays of each week. Lunches are priced at $15. Reservations are required.\n\nAdmission is free as a gift to the community from Farmers Union Insurance. Open Monday to Friday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesday, 5-9 p.m. and Saturday, noon-5 p.m. Closed Sundays, July 4 and Labor Day. Call 406-727-8255 or visit www.the-square.org.\n\n7 The History Museum\n\n\"When you enter the History Museum, you walk back in time in North Central Montana!\" promises the 47,000-square-foot museum at 4223 2nd St. S., in the old Northern School Supply building. Permanent exhibits on Cascade County and northcentral Montana are featured, and temporary exhibitions on topics ranging from Montana history to local art augment the collection. Current exhibits include a salute to the history of nursing at the Columbus Hospital from 1900 to 1968 and a new exhibit centered around the history of downtown Great Falls. Permanent exhibits include the Bovey carriage, models of the Opera House and Park Hotel and displays on the Ozark Club and Native Americans. As well as \"Under the Big Stack: the Great Falls Smelter\" about the Anaconda Copper Mining Company's history in Great Falls.\n\nThe Museum also houses the Archival Research Center on the second floor, a gift shop and space available for special events. Museum hours are Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and by appointment on weekends. Admission is free with donations welcome. Call the History Museum at 452-3462 or visit www.thehistorymuseum.org.\n\n8 Children's Museum of Montana\n\nThe Children's Museum is a wonderland where \"please touch\" is one of the most important rules. The museum, which turned 14 in February, is an educational and community resource \"dedicated to the notion that children learn best by doing.\" Exhibits and programs focused on history and culture, science and technology, health and nutrition, visual and performing arts and regional culture offer a unique hands-on adventure.\n\nLocated at 22 Railroad Square, the museum is just northwest of the Civic Center and within a Frisbee flip of Gibson Park.

The facility, which is open from dawn to dusk, is free for skateboarders, in-line skaters and roller skaters. The skaters' paradise is in Elks Riverside Park, 500 River Drive N., behind the Girl Scout cabin and near the Gibson Park underpass.\n\n12 Great Falls Pools\n\nFour city-run aquatic facilities offer lessons and programs year round:\n\nElectric City Water Park can be found at River Drive and 1st Avenue South. Beat the heat with as many ways you can get wet, including body-boarding on the \"Flow Rider\" where 36,000 gallons of water rushes through every minute, riding the \"Power Tower Plunge\" and ending up in the \"Lazy River,\" which circles a quarter-mile around the \"Flow Rider\" or swimming in \"Mitchell Pool,\" Montana's largest public heated outdoor pool.

He demanded parks, and that's what we got. His namesake is the centerpiece of the park system. Located at Park Drive and 1st Avenue North, Gibson Park features a duck pond, flower gardens, a walking path, basketball courts, restrooms and a playground. Summertime concerts take place at an outdoor band shell. A pedestrian underpass from Gibson Park takes you to Elks Riverside Park, a lesser-known but huge park along the river that features tennis courts, horseshoe pits, a skate park, playground equipment and large expanses of grass where you can fly a kite, play catch or simply relax.\n\nAny sunny day, you'll also find people picnicking, playing games or simply lounging in the rest of the city's 400 acres developed into 57 parks. Two dozen usable public tennis courts also are scattered around the city. A complex of eight courts is available for public use at C.M. Russell High School. In addition, there are three on River Drive North near the 6th Street underpass; four at Montana Park; two each at Lions, West Kiwanis and Jaycee parks; and one each at Sunrise, Charles Russell and North Kiwanis parks. Call Parks and Recreation Administration at 771-1265 for more information.\n\n14 Pacific Steel and Recycling Trailside Dog Park\n\nAn attractively fenced and landscaped area where dogs can \"run free and play 'off leash' with their canine and human friends,\" the dog park, located at 800 River Drive North alongside River's Edge Trail, was opened July 15, 2009. The park was built for less than $100,000 and was financed by gifts to the Animal Foundation of Great Falls, which donated the park to the city of Great Falls. The park features a small pavilion in the middle and separate fenced and landscaped areas equipped for small and large dogs. The dividing line for dog size is 25 pounds. A paved path in the large-dog park was recently installed to protect the turf, and agility equipment on both sides of the park allows for better exercise.\n\nDog owners will find there is no charge to use the park, but they are still responsible for proper pet etiquette and obeying the rules of the Dog Park. Disposal bags and garbage cans are readily available, but drinking fountains for both humans and dogs are rather temperamental, so it's wise to bring your own water. The park is open from dawn to dusk, but it may be closed on occasion for maintenance or improvements. Watch the Tribune for announcements or call the Park and Recreation office at 771-1265. For more information, visit the foundation's website at www.theanimalfoundation.com.\n\n15 First Peoples Buffalo Jump State Park\n\nFormerly called \"Ulm Pishkun,\" it is believed to be the largest prehistoric bison kill site in North America and has now been nominated to be designated a National Historic Landmark. The site, at 342 Ulm-Vaughn Road, consists of a mile-long sandstone cliff, remnants of drive lines and up to 18 feet of compacted buffalo remains as well as \"expansive panoramic views\" of the Rocky Mountain Front, the Missouri River valley and characteristic buttes and grasslands of the High Plains. Plan at least two hours at this day-use-only park for enjoying the interpretive trail, picnic tables and a protected black-tailed prairie dog town.\n\nThe site is open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. until October. Admission is free for state residents or $6 per vehicle for out-of-state visitors. Call 866-2217 for more information.\n\n16 Farmers Market\n\nNo longer just about the abundance of vegetables sold here, the Great Falls Farmers Market is held on Saturdays beginning June 6 through Sept. 26, from 7:45 a.m. to noon, in the Civic Center's Whittier Park. As the popularity of the market has grown, so has the number of vendors, so much that the market has expanded from Civic Center Park onto Park Drive and into the parking lot across the street, and a Wednesday market has been added to the schedule from July 18 to Sept. 23, 4:30-6:30 p.m. More than 100 vendors are expected to bring unique hand-crafted items of all kinds, baked goods, jams, jellies, syrups and all kinds of ready-to-eat foods.

Eagle Falls, adjacent to Legion Park at 25th Street and River Drive North, and Anaconda Hills, a short, hilly course in Black Eagle on the north side of the Missouri River, 2400 Smelter Ave. Both courses offer driving ranges as well as full pro shops and concessions. Other courses include Hickory Swing, a public course at 1100 American Ave., and Meadow Lark Country Club at the confluence of the Sun and Missouri rivers at 300 Country Club Blvd.\n\nEagle Falls Golf Club is an 18-hole course open to the public. Opened in 1953, it underwent a major re-design in 1999 and now plays from 5,234 to 6,571 yards as a par 71. Four sets of tees make it inviting for the casual player and extremely challenging for the avid golfer. There is also a newly designed chipping green, a putting green, practice bunker and a limited driving range. Reserve tee times two days in advance by calling 761-1078.\n\nAnaconda Hills Golf Course is also a city-run course opened originally in the 1920s as a nine-hole course for the employees of the Anaconda Copper Co. The city acquired the course in the 1970s, and nine new holes and grass greens were added in 1992. Hilly and tree-lined with natural rough and water, the par 69 course is slightly less than 5,700 yards. Call 761-8459.\n\nFounded in 1919, the private Meadow Lark Country Club is recognized as having one of the great classic designs with a reputation for sleek, undulating greens. The 18-hole championship course is considered one of the top 10 places to play in Montana. The club also includes a clubhouse, \"award-winning pro shop, formal dining room and more casual grill room, three indoor and four outdoor tennis courts and a swimming pool open Memorial Day to Labor Day. Call 453-6531.\n\nHickory Swing is an 18-hole par 60 executive golf course in west Great Falls. It plays 3,731 yards over 86 acres. It was built in 1992 as a course for all skill levels. A back nine was opened in 1999, and the course has 12 par-3s and six par-4s. Hickory Swing also offers a clubhouse with pro shop and snack bar and a driving range. Open from February (weather permitting) through October, the course now opens at 6 a.m. for early-bird golfers. $20 for 18 holes, $12 for nine; call 452-9400 for available tee times.\n\n19 The Great Falls Dams\n\nThe beautiful waterfalls east of Great Falls now are mostly covered by a series of hydroelectric dams. But glimpses of the falls so famously journaled by Lewis and Clark remain, especially when water is running high on the Missouri. Visitors have several opportunities to view these dams. Perhaps the easiest is Black Eagle Dam, which can be seen close up on the River's Edge Trail or from an overlook on River Road. Just downstream, Rainbow Dam has also been offering beautiful views since 1910 and has undergone a construction project increasing its generating capacity by 70 percent. Between these two is Cochrane Dam, part of the Great Falls Portage National Landmark, which produces 64 megawatts of electricity. Ryan Dam, the original \"great falls of the Missouri,\" is an especially fun destination. A suspension foot bridge leads to an island from which visitors can climb to an observation point and get a full-on view of the dam. The island has a picnic and cooking area very popular with families. Morony Dam is 15 miles northeast of Great Falls. It's classified as a \"run-of-river\" project because it can generate electricity using the water that flows down the river without need to store additional supplies. Boaters, hikers and fishermen should call 454-5840 for current trailhead, boat launch and parking closures.\n\n20 Black Eagle Memorial Island\n\nBlack Eagle Memorial Island opened to the public for the first time in 2005. Located just below Black Eagle Falls, the man-made island was created from material dredged out of the tailrace below the Black Eagle Dam's generation station. In the past, it was used as a parking lot for smelter workers at the former Anaconda Mining Co. complex. Today the area features a restored truss bridge, exceptional stone walls, a launch for non-motorized boats and an interpretive viewing plaza below the falls. The area is open for hiking, biking, kayaking, canoeing and fishing and is part of the new River's Edge Trail section that links West Bank Park to the island.\n\n21 Missouri River Breaks National Monument\n\nOn a topographical map of Montana, the Missouri River Breaks look like a crumpled brown grocery bag extending west to east along the Missouri River from Fort Benton to Fort Peck. The Arrow Creek Breaks and the Musselshell Breaks contribute to the larger geographic area from the south. The Breaks, located in northcentral Montana, offer some of the finest recreational opportunities in the entire state, from river floating to hiking to hunting to horseback riding.\n\nOn the ground, the Breaks consist of rough ridges separated by steep — sometimes almost vertical — coulees. The vegetation consists of scattered Ponderosa pine, juniper, Douglas fir and mixed grasses growing in a shale/gumbo soil type. While not the most hospitable region for humans, the Breaks provide suitable habitat for an impressive list of wildlife species.\n\nThe Breaks mean different things to different people. It is defined, in part, by the history of Lewis and Clark, as a sanctuary for desperados staying a step ahead of the law and as a source of hope and inspiration for several generations of homesteaders. Some enjoy the remote area mostly for the solitude and recreational opportunities provided by the Upper Missouri River, Fort Peck Reservoir and a mixture of public and private lands. Others see the Breaks as a source of grass for livestock, natural gas, timber products and other vital pieces of our economic puzzle.\n\nIn 2001, a portion of the public land in the Breaks managed by the Bureau of Land Management, roughly 375,000 acres, was designated as the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.\n\nU.S. Highway 87 accesses the western portion of the monument at Fort Benton. On the eastern edge, U.S. Highway 101 crosses the monument and the Missouri at the James Kipp Recreation Area, and Montana Highway 236 also provides access through Lewistown, Winifred and Big Sandy.\n\nThere are no motels, service stations or restaurants in the interior of the Monument. The Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center in Fort Benton is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday Call 622-4000.\n\n22 Monarch and Neihart\n\nAn hour's drive from Great Falls, these neighboring mountain towns are located in a historic mining district. The mines are closed, but the surrounding mountains are open to fun. Local creeks offer excellent fishing. There are scores of trails and backcountry roads to explore on foot, mountain bike or all-terrain vehicle. Check at trailheads for info on motorized access. Check out the easy, half-mile hike to popular Memorial Falls. Camping is available in some areas. The wildlife viewing is terrific. And winter offers a wide range of activities, including snowmobiling, downhill skiing, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.\n\n23 Sluice Boxes State Park\n\nJust south of Belt, where Belt Creek slices out of the Little Belt Mountains is an area of soaring limestone cliffs and precipitous ledges, the Belt Creek Canyon and Sluice Boxes State Park. Rich in history and geologic features, the park provides excellent hiking and viewing of abundant wildlife in a wide range of habitats from shaded rock walls and miniature waterfalls to open, sun-baked slopes covered in prairie grasses. Enjoying the park, however, is not for the faint of heart. Because the train bridges were removed, hikers must ford the creek. That's nearly impossible during high water, so hiking in the Sluice Boxes is limited to the low-water season — usually mid-July through September. The creek is spring-fed and cold. Backcountry camping is allowed with permit year-round. The only facilities are the parking lot, vault toilet and the trail which follows an abandoned rail grade. Call 454-5840 or visit stateparksmt.gov/sluice-boxes.\n\n24 Fort Benton's Riverfront\n\nThe historic community of Fort Benton, 42 miles north of Great Falls, boasts a stunning setting on the banks of the Missouri River. The site of a pre-Civil War trading post and key economic point during the \"steamboat era,\" the town is the water gateway to the Missouri Breaks National Monument and a popular launch site for rafts and canoes. Reconstruction of three buildings of the fort is taking place; the Northeast Bastion and Blockhouse are now historically accurate. A heroic-sized statue of explorers Lewis and Clark overlooks the river along a scenic walking path. Another statue immortalizes Shep, a legendarily faithful dog. A walking bridge spans the river and offers benches for rest and reflection. There's lots to do elsewhere in town, which has two museums and a historic restored hotel, the Grand Union, which boasts a fine restaurant. From June 26 to 28, visitors may experience Montana's premier small town festival. In celebration of Chouteau County's 150th birth, the theme this year is \"Footsteps Through Time.\" Call 750-2918.\n\n25 Havre Beneath the Streets\n\nThe Historical Underground Tour is a recreation of Havre's history. When fire destroyed most of Havre, business owners moved underground to carry on their business until the town could be rebuilt. Step back in time as much as 100 years, into the Sporting Eagle Saloon, a turn-of-the-century honky-tonk where cowboys gambled, kicked up their heels and drank good old-fashioned frontier rot-gut. Saunter along the streets beneath Havre and see an opium den (one of three known to have existed in the early days), a Chinese laundry, an ethnic restaurant, and, of course, a bordello.\n\nTours are available during summer months Monday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with the last tour beginning at 3:30 p.m. Reservations are recommended; the ticket office is at 120 3rd Ave., south of Norman's Ranch Wear.

Take a one-hour walking tour for a close-up look at the best-preserved bison kill and campsite in this area of the plains. The Brick Mural is now complete in the shadow of the Bear Paw Mountains. The site is non-sterile, so visitors may handle certain artifacts. Open June 1 to Labor Day from 9 a.m. to 4.p.m. Tours are usually available \"on demand.\" Call 265-6417 or visit www.buffalojump.org for more information.\n\n27 Fort Assiniboine Historic Site\n\nFort Assiniboine Historic Site, located 6 miles southwest of Havre on Highway 87, was constructed in 1879, and became the largest military fort west of the Mississippi River. The post had 104 buildings and was contained within a 40-mile-long by 15-mile-wide military reservation. Several of the original buildings still stand. It became a state agricultural experiment station in 1911 and is now the home of Montana State University's Northern Agricultural Research Center. The primary mission of the fort's garrison was to prevent attacks from the some 5,000 Lakota Sioux Indians led by Sitting Bull, and other chiefs who had fled to the safety of Canada after the Battle of the Little Big Horn.\n\nThe fort served as a base for patrols along the Canadian border and the Milk River Valley. Fort Assiniboine became the state's military headquarters, with the responsibility of maintaining control over the Blackfoot Confederacy and other northern Montana Indian reservations. The most famous soldier to serve at the fort was John J. Pershing, who was assigned to the post in 1896. He commanded H Troop, the black \"Buffalo Soldiers\" of the 10th Cavalry. The Fort Assiniboine Preservation Society offers summer tours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mon.-Fri., and by appointment for the weekends.

Now beginning at Kingston Junction, near Lewistown, and crossing three trestle bridges on its route to Denton and back, the 3.5 hour trip offers includes a full course prime rib dinner, dessert, no-host cash bar and musical entertainment.

Mountain ranges surround three sides, forming a backdrop to a scene that reminds visitors of the days when the entire prairie-wetland ecosystem was alive with thousands of different birds. Benton Lake was created thousands of years ago by the continental glacier, and the area was excluded from homesteading in 1885 in order to provide an irrigation district. Animals abound in the refuge and include water birds such as ducks, Canada geese, snow geese and tundra swans. Also common are sightings of dozens of species of mammals, including mountain cottontail, American badger, striped skunk and long-tailed weasel. Ten numbered signs along the Wildlife Auto Tour correspond to a map provided at the information kiosk at the beginning of the drive, helping visitors reflect on species, habitat, history and management of Benton Lake NWR. Follow Highway 87 north out of Great Falls about 1 mile and turn left onto Bootlegger Trail. Then go about 9 miles to the refuge entrance. The visitor center is open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday to Friday Call 406-727-7400.\n\n35 The Annual Montana Atlatl Mammoth Hunt\n\nExperts and novices from around the country, and even the world, come to try their hand at throwing the atlatl, an 8,000-year-old hunting weapon, and occasionally the primitive bow, tomahawk and knife. Regional members of the World Atlatl Association in conjunction with First Peoples Buffalo State Park set targets along one section of the trail. Participants are required to walk the trail, so bring hiking boots or comfortable shoes. Hunts are set for Sept. 5-6. Call 866-2217 for further information.\n\nMISSOURI COUNTRY\n\n36 Fort Peck Lake Reservoir and Recreation Area\n\nBehind the 3.8 mile long Fort Peck Dam — the world's largest hydroelectric earthen dam — is the state's largest body of water, Fort Peck Lake Reservoir. It is surrounded by 1,520 miles of shoreline — that's more than California has with the Pacific Ocean. The fishing is great with more than 50 kinds of fish, including walleye, bass, ling and salmon, northern pike, perch and sauger. Open Memorial Day to Labor Day, the shore also offers camping, boating and swimming. A paved road for larger vehicles provides access to the reservoir at Fort Peck Marina; all other access roads are gravel or dirt. The C.M.

In 2006, they received state funding for the creation of the museum. Opened in 2008, the 3,000-square-foot Great Plains Dinosaur Museum showcases a \"stunning variety\" of real fossils of fish, squids, lobsters and rare crabs, plants and some of Montana's best-preserved dinosaurs, including Triceratops, Stegasaurus, Sauropod, raptor Dromesaurus and Handrosaurus.

Visitors interested in their turn-of-the-century exploits can still check out several sites along the so-called Outlaw Trail. Start in Scobey, near the beginning of the trail, where Dutch Henry and his gang frequently hung out at the Dug Out Saloon. Much of the history is captured at the Daniels County Museum and Pioneer Town, where 35 historic buildings were restored to depict a town in the early part of the century. If you're in Scobey the last weekend in June, stop by for Pioneer Days, featuring the (family-friendly) Dirty Shame Show. Call 406-487-5965 to confirm dates. Historic walking tours with interpretive signs are available in the area.\n\n41 C.M. Russell Wildlife Refuge\n\nCovering more than a million acres in northeast Montana and extending 125 airline miles up the Missouri River from Fort Peck Dam, the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge includes a vast range of wildlife and topography. Native prairie, forested coulees, river bottoms, badlands often portrayed in the paintings by Charlie Russell, and the huge Fort Peck Reservoir all are encompassed in the refuge.

Call Complex headquarters at 538-7521.\n\nGLACIER COUNTRY\n\n42 Blackfeet Indian Reservation\n\nWhile most of the members of Montana's largest Indian tribe, the Blackfeet, live much like mainstream Western society, they also have maintained traditions such as the use of painted tepees, colorful headdresses and deerskin costumes on special occasions. The Museum of the Plains Indian, near the intersection of U.S. Highways 2 and 89 in Browning, has a comprehensive collection of cultural artifacts and exhibits as well as a gift shop featuring a wide variety of Native American art and jewelry. Interpreter-guided tours, offering a deeper look at the history of the Blackfeet people, begin at the Museum of the Plains Indian and cover sites such as Sun Dance, Buffalo Jumps, Tepee Rings, Holy Family Mission and Fort McLeod Road. The museum is open Tuesday-Saturday, 9 a.m.-4:45 p.m., through Labor Day. Call 338-2230. Although Browning is its center, resort towns St. Mary and East Glacier are located on the eastern edge of Glacier National Park within the boundaries of the reservation.\n\nDuring the 64th annual North American Indian Days, July 9-12, tepees will be pitched on the powwow ground for \"four days of contest dancing, games, sports, events and socializing.\" Call 338-7406 for more information. The Heart Butte Society Celebration will be held Aug. 6-9 at Heart Butte, a town 26 miles south of Browning.\n\n43 Glacier National Park\n\nThe breathtaking vistas of Glacier National Park draw visitors from all over the world. This 1-million-acre national park preserves some of America's most gorgeous country — including 106 miles of the Continental Divide — and the abundant wildlife that inhabits its wilderness.\n\nGlacier National Park has been revered by the Plains Indians for many generations. Archeologists have found evidence of human activity in the Glacier Park area that dates back 10,000 years. These early people may have been the ancestors of the Blackfeet, Salish and Kootenai Indians. Meriwether Lewis came close to the southern tip of Glacier in 1806, checking how far north the Missouri River watershed extended. White explorers kept searching for the perfect mountain pass through which to run a railroad line over the Rockies. Although many of the region's Native Americans knew the location of Marias Pass, the Blackfeet guarded it closely. In 1889, an explorer for the Great Northern Railway, John F. Stevens, finally figured out where Marias Pass lay. Marias was the lowest mountain pass between Canada and Mexico. Its low altitude and easy grade made it perfect for trains to cross the Continental Divide. The mountains east of the Continental Divide were acquired from the Blackfeet in 1895 and designated a national wilderness forest preserve in 1900, opening it to mining. President William Howard Taft signed the bill to establish Glacier as a national park in 1910.\n\nPortions of the Going-to-the-Sun Road remain open all year, but unpredictable spring snow storms can slow plowing progress. For current road status, visit home.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/hours.htm. Other roads open in May, weather permitting. The summer rate for a 7-day vehicle (non-commercial car, truck or van) permit is $25 with the 7-day single-entry price for visitors traveling by foot, bicycle, motorcycle or in a non-commercial organized group is set at $12. There is no entrance fee on Aug. 25 and Sept. 26.\n\nThere are 700 miles of hiking trails, and many visitors wouldn't miss a chance to hike along the Garden Wall. Campers have a choice of about 1,200 first-come, first-serve campsites accessible by vehicle, and permits are available for 13 country front campgrounds. The historic Many Glacier Hotel has recently undergone a $10 million renovation, but historic hotels book up fast; call Glacier Park Inc. at 892-2525 or Apgar Village Lodge at 888-5484.Tour buses and boats are available seasonally, and guided hiking trips and American Indian interpretive tours are also available. Many visitors also make arrangements to cross the border into Waterton Lakes National Park on the Canadian side of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.\n\n44 Izaak Walton Inn\n\nLocated just off Highway 2 at Essex, on the southern tip of Glacier National Park, is the picturesque Izaak Walton Inn. It was built in 1939 for train crews on the Great Northern Railway. Today it's a popular inn, restaurant and mini railroad museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The dining room walls are covered with old photographs and prints of trains. \"Relaxation is key,\" and \"room telephones are absent\" in the inn. For a different experience, rent one of the four old cabooses that have been converted into overnight lodging or stay in one of six new family cabins. Additional lodging is now available in the GN 441 Luxury Locomotive which features 44-year-old reclaimed oak floors and a full kitchen, and the JJ Caboose, named for James Jerome Hill, the Empire Builder of the Great Northern Railway, for an unsurpassed cozy western retreat. The trains still run past the inn, with passenger service available. And Essex is a great place from which to find a trailhead into the surrounding mountains. You may also book Glacier interpretive Red Bus tours or whitewater raft trips from the inn. For information or reservations, call 406-888-5700 or visit www.izaakwaltoninn.com.\n\n45 Flathead Valley\n\nIn the northwest corner of Montana lies the picturesque Flathead Valley. A hub for tourism, the valley sits next to Glacier National Park and is overflowing with activity. From hiking, fishing, boating and golfing in the summer to cross-country or downhill skiing in the winter, the only thing visitors will wish for more of is time. Flathead Lake is the largest natural freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River, and the resort town, Bigfork, situated at its north shore, is a picturesque town with a 27-hole golf course, Eagle Bend Golf Club (837-7310). Family fun abounds in the area, with the Big Sky Water Park in Columbia Falls (892-5025) and numerous fresh huckleberry and Flathead cherry stands scattered throughout the valley. Hungry Horse Dam is the 11th largest concrete dam in the United States, and its spillway is the highest morning-glory structure in the world. During the summer, the visitor center is open from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Call 387-5241. Boating, fishing, hiking and camping are available at the reservoir. Kalispell, the largest city in the valley, is home of the Conrad Mansion, built in 1895 by the city's founder, as well as a picturesque downtown shopping area with tons of local flavor. Call the Flathead Convention and Visitors Bureau at 800-543-3105.\n\n46 Saint Ignatius Mission\n\nBuilt in 1854 by Native Americans under the supervision of Catholic missionaries who came to convert the locals, the Mission's setting is beautiful, with the Mission Mountains in the background. The striking building features 61 original murals along its walls and on its ceiling. These are by Joseph Carignano, a Jesuit priest who served at the mission. The mission is open for private worship 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the summer with Sunday Mass at 9:15 a.m. Reservations are not accepted, but walk-ins are welcome. Gift shop on site.

Self-guided, drive-through tours are available to observe the more than 400 bison, deer, elk, antelope and birds that make their home on the preserve. Red Sleep Mountain Drive is open during the summer while the winter drive is no longer open to two-way traffic. No motorcycles or bicycles are allowed for the safety of the animals and visitors. Visit the range in spring for the abundant wild flowers and in October to watch the annual bison round up, a hugely popular event. New restrictions exclude longer vehicles as well as any trailer or towed vehicle. Visitors' Center is open daily 10 a.m.-2 p.m., but the front gate is open 6:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.\n\n48 Whitefish Mountain Resort\n\nOpening day is June 20! Located on the edge of Whitefish and just west of Glacier Park, Whitefish Mountain Resort is a world-class downhill ski destination. It offers lodging, restaurants, lots of activities and some of the best views in the area. That goes for summer, too. Take the 15-minute gondola ride to the top of the mountain and witness stunning vistas of Glacier Park and the surrounding area. Have lunch, and then hop the gondola for the trip down. Better yet, take the scenic walking trail. The Zipline Tour is for adventurous visitors who will strap on a paragliding-style harness and click onto a custom built cable trolley to fly 300 feet off the ground at speeds up to 50 mph! People of all ability levels may enjoy the Aerial Adventure Park where they can learn to navigate treetop courses. In July and August wildflower walks are offered. Other guided tours are also available. Visit skiwhitefish.com.\n\n49 Flathead Lake\n\nFlathead Lake is the most popular — and most used — water playground in the state. It's the largest natural freshwater lake in the Western states. The lake is 28 miles long and, at its widest, 15 miles across. Maximum depth is 386 feet. Anglers delight in the fishing.

There's lots of lodging and restaurants available along different stretches of the shore.\n\n50 Yaak Falls\n\nThis waterfall is the highlight for many visitors as they tour through the Yaak area in extreme northwest Montana. During spring and early summer tremendous viewing opportunities abound in the Yaak River area as snowmelt follows its way down and over the falls. For any photographer, this is one sight that shouldn't be missed. This site can be found on a Kootenai National Forest Visitors Map at Township 33N, Range 33W, Section 9. The Yaak Falls, named after the Yaak Indians who once populated this remote area of Montana, has always been a favorite stop on the scenic tour of northwest Montana. This beautifully cascading waterfall was created by the eastward shift of the Pacific plate. As a result of this shifting, some of the oldest rock in the world is exposed. The rock is dated between 800 million and 11/2 billion years old. This area is rich in local history, dating back to the 1880s. Part of an old bridge can be seen just below the falls. This bridge was the first structure to span the Yaak River. This allowed unrestricted passage from Troy to another important mining town called Sylvanite. Many placer mining camps, including one called \"Snipe Town,\" operated near the falls in the 1890s. In 1910, a devastating fire destroyed mining operations around the falls area. The Yaak Falls Campground is a little pack-in, pack-out campground with a maximum stay of 14 days and no fees. No toilets or drinking water are available. Call 295-4693.\n\n51 Hot Springs\n\nHot Springs, founded in 1910, is named for the local hot mineral springs that still bubble today. Thousands of people seeking rest and relief from pressure travel to the town of Hot Springs to bathe in the fine mineral water and mud baths. Many revisit on a regular basis, enjoying the benefits and relief that the natural hot mineral waters bring in the treatment of arthritis, skin diseases, rheumatism, stomach ulcers, high blood pressure and many other ailments. Opportunities for privacy, quietness, and relaxation abound in this area. Many lakes, streams and rivers provide excellent fishing for the avid fisherman. Nearby sight-seeing attractions include a tour of the National Bison Range at Moiese, a visit to the historical St. Ignatius Mission Church and Flathead Lake with its many opportunities for boating, jet skiing, water skiing and fishing.\n\n52 Seeley Lake\n\nNamed for the lake it abuts, Seeley Lake is a small town quickly growing in popularity with tourists. In winter, it's known for great snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, dog sledding and ice fishing. Summer recreation is even more plentiful. The lake itself offers camping, boating, swimming and fishing. Nearby trails head off into both the Bob Marshall and Mission Mountain wilderness areas. Folks on mountain bikes and all-terrain vehicles love all the old logging roads. The Clearwater River, which runs south through the valley, and the Swan River which flows north, offer fishing and canoeing. Golfers enjoy the nine-hole mountain course and more at Double Arrow Resort on the south edge of town. Call the Seeley Lake Area Chamber of Commerce at 677-2880.\n\nSeveral guest ranches offer horseback riding. There's camping and boating also available at nearby Swan Lake and Placid Lake. Just a short drive from Seeley Lake is the trailhead to Morrell Falls. A fairly flat, 2.5-mile hike leads to a stunning drop of falls — and a great place for a picnic. The hike is popular with families because children often enjoy splashing in Morrell Creek below the falls. Bring drinking water.\n\n53 The Sweet Palace\n\nIndulge your sweet tooth at the Sweet Palace at 109 E. Broadway in Philipsburg, and view what nostalgic, sumptuous sweets are cooking.

During the summer, they're open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. but are closed on Saturdays.\n\n54 A Carousel for Missoula\n\nLocated in Missoula's Caras Park, the colorful carousel is a gift to the city from one man's dream — and the volunteer work of many others. In 1991, cabinet builder Chuck Kaparich told city residents that if they'd provide a home for it, he'd build the carousel. When it opened four years later, more than 100,000 volunteer hours were logged on the project. Locals volunteered time and materials. The result: 38 hand-carved ponies, two chariots, 14 gargoyles and the largest band organ in continuous use in the country. A carving organization in Calgary, Alberta, even carved a friendship horse for the project. It's all contained within a building that looks like a jewel box. Dragons Hollow, the play area for children was added next to the carousel in 1995. Hours are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. June-August. Call 549-8382.\n\n55 Historical Museum at Fort Missoula\n\nCommunity members joined together in 1974 to save what was left of the historic 1877 Fort Missoula which had housed the black 25th Infantry in 1888 and served as a military training center during World War I, regional headquarters of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 and as an alien detention center in 1941. The post was decommissioned in 1947. Today the museum is the collection point for history and memorabilia of the Missoula area. Located on 32 acres, it houses 13 structures and more than 25,000 artifacts. Current exhibits include \"Growing the Garden City: Missoula's First 50 Years\" and \"The Road to Today: 250 Years of Missoula's History.\" Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday to Saturday and Noon -5 p.m. on Sunday. Call 728-3476 or visit www.fortmissoulamuseum.org.\n\n56 Hike-the-M in Missoula\n\nVisitors to Missoula can gain a dizzying view of the campus of University of Montana with a short but steep hike to Mount Sentinel's M in Missoula. The M-hike is an ideal family activity, but the more ambitious hiker may consider tackling Sentinel itself. Reaching the summit is a bit more strenuous than the M, with an elevation gain of almost 2,000 feet in about one mile. From the summit, hikers have several options to extend their hike or descend the same way they came up. Mt. Jumbo, Mt. Sentinel's sister peak, branded with an L for Loyola High School, offers a climb of barely a mile, but there are fewer switchbacks to help with the climb.\n\n57 Alberton Gorge\n\nSome 30 miles west of Missoula on the Clark Fork River is the Alberton Gorge, the area's premier whitewater run for rafting and kayaking. It features Class III water, as well as quiet pools for swimming and fishing. Floaters are treated to many varieties of birds and wildlife, dramatic cliffs and roller-coaster rapids. Local companies offer full-day and half-day float trips. Only experienced floaters should hit the rapids without a guide. Call 722-7238 for more information.\n\n58 Travelers' Rest State Park\n\nLocated south of Lolo in the Bitterroot Valley, Travelers' Rest marks the old Indian campsite used by Lewis and Clark in both 1805 and 1806 as they made their way through the area. In recent years archaeologists found evidence of the expedition's main cook fire and latrine, which confirmed the explorers had been there. Activities for visitors include bird watching, children's activities, educational programs and fly fishing. Open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. throughout the summer, the visitors' center opens at 9 a.m. The entrance is located ½ mile west of Lolo. Call 273-4253 or visit www.travelersrest.org.\n\n59 Garnet Ghost Town\n\n\"To walk the streets of this ghost town is to step back in time, free from intrusion of modern society!\"A former gold-mining camp east of Missoula, Garnet once boasted some 1,000 residents, a school, many businesses and 13 bars. But by 1912 the gold had played out and a raging fire sent most of the remaining residents packing. Today, Garnet is now considered the state's best-preserved ghost town. Garnet is open to tourists. Open year-round, but access is limited to snowmobile or cross-country skis in winter. For access instructions and restrictions, visit garnetghosttown.net or call 329-3914.\n\nGOLD WEST COUNTRY\n\n60 Virginia City\n\nVirginia City — and the nearby Nevada City — had their glory days during the 1860s gold rush. Seemingly frozen in time, much of their splendor is well preserved, and Virginia City now is a hot destination for history buffs and others seeking a window on the state's past. Virginia City is a National Historic Landmark, a very much alive ghost town that boasts a tremendous collection of old-west memorabilia. Many of the buildings are restored and now give visitors a real-life feel of the past. The Nevada City Living History Museum is open every summer. The summer of 2014 will be filled with fun events celebrating the sesquicentennial of finding gold in Alder Gulch and the cultural heritage of Virginia City. Events are planned every weekend through Labor Day, and there are opportunities for fun and learning throughout the season.

It showcases the development of the cattle industry over the last 150 years with 80 historical structures including a ranch house, bunkhouse and outbuildings which operate much today as they did in the late 1800s and commemorate the role of cattlemen in American history. Visitors may reflect on Montana's early ranch days by beginning guided tours at the main ranch house. The visitors' center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and until 5:30 from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Call 846-2070.\n\n62 Bannack State Park\n\nThe first major gold strike in Montana was in Bannack. The mining camp quickly swelled to a bustling town of 3,000. It was the first territorial capital of Montana and became home to the infamous Sheriff Henry Plummer and the Vigilantes. Located about 25 miles south of Dillon on Grasshopper Creek, Bannack became a state park in 1954. Visitors can walk the boardwalk and enjoy the many buildings that have been preserved as part of this National Historic Landmark. History comes alive the third weekend of July each year during Bannack Days. Get in on the first annual Living History Days in September where re-enactors will depict the first 20 years of Bannack history. There are self-guided tours year round and guided tours by special request. Visitors may have fun panning for gold on their own and will enjoy \"Saturdays in the Park\" with a special project presented each Saturday in the summer. Camping is available year round, and check out the tepee during the summer season. The townsite is open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Call 834-3413.\n\n63 Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park\n\nLocated on Montana Highway 2, 19 miles west of Three Forks or 17 miles east of Whitehall, the Lewis and Clark Caverns became Montana's first state park in 1937. Located on 3,000 acres along the Jefferson River, the caverns are filled with geological wonders — stalactites, stalagmites and stunning columns. Visitors can take a two-hour, two-mile guided tour through the large caverns and narrow passages. The limestone caverns remain a cool 50 degrees during even the hottest of days. The park also includes a 40-space campground, amphitheater, visitor center, 3 rental cabins, picnic area, hiking trails, RV hookups, showers, firewood, and toilets. Bring good hiking shoes and bottled water. The trek to the entrance can be tough on little ones, and strollers or backpacks are not allowed on the tour. Summer cave tours run from May 1 to Sept. 30, but campgrounds and cabins are open all year. Tours are scheduled from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and are open until 7 p.m. midsummer. Call 406-287-3541.\n\n64 Old Montana Prison\n\nBuilt by convict labor in the late 1800s, this old-style prison was in use until 1979 and was home to at least one member of the \"Wild Bunch.\" It is now on the National Register of Historic Places. Guided and self-guided tours take visitors through the massive cell block that once housed the state's worst prisoners. Sandstone walls are 24 feet high and buried 4 feet deep to prevent escape by tunneling. A museum now adjoins the prison. It is open year round seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with last admission time at 5:10 p.m. Call 406-846-3111.\n\nThe old prison also houses an auto museum with more than 150 cars, from classic Chevys to a 1903 Ford, on display. It was recently listed as one of the top 10 car museums in the country by USA Today.\n\n65 Old Works Golf Course\n\nAnaconda's history is built on copper smelting, but that history left a dirty legacy — a Superfund clean-up site. In the 1980s, the idea arose to transform the Old Works smelting site into something more useful. Today, the Old Works Golf Course is the state's only Jack Nicklaus signature golf course, and is quickly building a reputation as one of the premier daily-fee golf experiences in the Northwest region. It features multiple tees, allowing players of all levels to enjoy the challenging 18 holes. The course design includes some of the byproducts of the mining days. Huge piles of black slag are incorporated into the design. It's also used in the bunkers. Measuring up to 7,700 yards, the course runs along Warm Springs Creek.

In 1955, copper mining in the area greatly expanded with the opening of the Berkeley Pit. By 1980, with more than 1.5 billion tons of material removed from the town's main mine, all that was left was the pit. The large, truck-operated, open-pit copper mine was world famous while in operation. Two small communities and much of Butte's former east side were swallowed up by the mine following land purchases for expansion. Now a superfund site, the pit is 7,000 feet long, 5,600 feet wide and 1,600 feet deep. It is slowly filling with water. Visitors can look at the colors of the pit from the viewing stand. Call 497-6250.\n\n68 Our Lady of the Rockies\n\nTowering 90 feet tall on the mountains overlooking Butte is Our Lady of the Rockies, a statue dedicated to all women, regardless of religion. Built entirely by volunteers, the statue was begun in 1979 and completed in 1985. That year, in a breath-taking operation, an Air National Guard team raised the 51-ton statue by Sky Crane helicopter onto its mountainside base. Today visitors can go inside the towering metal structure. During summer and early fall, tour buses take visitors to the site. A 2½ hours. Open June through October, Mon. - Sat.

The lake features four public boat ramps. Camping is available, as are lodging, restaurants, casinos and a marina.\n\n71 Boulder Hot Springs\n\nFounded a century ago, Boulder Hot Springs is a historic hotel situated on the grounds of natural geothermal water.

A guided boat tour from the marina provides visitors with an in-depth look at the area's geography, wildlife and history. The canyon is home to scores of creatures, including mountain sheep, deer, otters, turkey vultures and even the occasional black bear. Although the 2007 Meriwether fire scorched a large part of the area, vegetation is abundant. The canyon like waterway is actually home to some plants that can't be found anywhere else. Tour guides aboard the boats say the area is a \"geologist's playground.\" Passengers have the option to stop off at the Meriwether Picnic Area, stay awhile and catch a later boat back. There are restroom facilities, a large, covered picnic structure for group gatherings and smaller individual sites with grills and tables. Hikers can tackle the jaunt to the Mann Gulch, where a forest fire killed 13 smokejumpers in 1949, or the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness. The Gates was also a significant site for Native American culture. Tour guides said the area had a deep spiritual implication which still can be seen in the pictographs painted onto the cliffs' nooks and crannies. Call 458-5241 or email tours@gatesofthemountains.com for tour schedules and prices and to make reservations.\n\n73 Montana State Capitol\n\nSince its restoration, the Montana State Capitol is a destination in its own right.

A gift shop and museum are located just down the street in the Montana Historical Society, which offers 1-hour guided tours of the Capitol for student and tourist groups. With two weeks' notice, the Legislative Branch offers an age-appropriate 30-60 minutes presentation on the legislative process, and the Secretary of State's office can present a short program on voting and elections.

Call 406-444-4789.\n\n74 Archie Bray Foundation\n\nSixty years ago, on the grounds of his Western Clay Manufacturing Co. brickyard, Archie Bray founded a pottery workshop to encourage the work and creativity of potters. That simple act became a tremendous resource to ceramic artists, who now flock to the center from around the world. A prominent patron of the arts, Bray died in 1953, only two years after establishing the nonprofit Archie Bray Foundation. Since then, more than 400 artists have come to work and hone their talents at the Bray. It also sells pottery and sculpture. Tours are available. Call 406-443-3502 or visit archiebray.org for event schedules.\n\n75 Myrna Loy Center\n\nIn 1976, the Helena Film Society organized to provide alternative films and cinema to residents of the state capital. Based on the second floor of an office building, it became Second Story Cinema and enjoyed a reputation for bringing in independent films. In 1985, with the help of a National Endowment for the Arts grant, the effort expanded with the renovation of the historic Lewis and Clark County Jail into an arts center. The Myrna Loy Center officially opened six years later. Its mission is to present challenging and enriching arts programs to the community. It has sponsored hundreds of live performances, including theater, dance, jazz, folk and performance art. And, yes, it still presents alternative films. For ticket information call 406-443-0287.\n\n76 Marysville\n\nOnce a vibrant gold camp with a population of more than 4,000, the town of Marysville northwest of Helena now is nearly a ghost town. Nearly, but not quite. Some people still live here, and a little mining still goes on. Visitors may take a walking tour of the Drumlummon Hill which includes 14 sites, several of which are listed on the National Historic Register. The Catholic church and general store still serve the community and its visitors. The town now is a popular destination for sightseers and those just wanting a pleasant place for a picnic or a quiet day away from the bustle of town.\n\n77 Sun River Canyon\n\nFlowing from Gibson Reservoir, adjacent to the Bob Marshall Wilderness, is the Sun River.

The vision for protecting this great swath of mountain country came from Bob Marshall, an early day forester and co-founder of the Wilderness Society. The complex, designated as wilderness in 1964, is now considered one of the most completely preserved mountain ecosystems in the world. It includes rugged mountains ranges, alpine peaks, grassy meadows, fish-heavy streams, large valleys and huge forests. Because of its wilderness designation, the area is not open to motorized traffic. But hikers, backpackers and horse riders all enjoy their trips to the interior. The complex is home to grizzly bears, gray wolves, elk, deer, Canada lynx, bobcats, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bears, wolverines and other animals. Access from communities in Gold West Country includes roads near Lincoln, Choteau and Augusta. Plan your visit by visiting www.wilderness.net.\n\nYELLOWSTONE COUNTRY\n\n80 Yellowstone National Park\n\nYes, the majority of Yellowstone National Park actually is in Wyoming, but three of the park's five entry gates are in Montana's Yellowstone Country: Cooke City, Gardiner and West Yellowstone. The country's first national park was established in 1872. Its 2.2 million acres cover a spectacular array of mountains, lakes, rivers and, of course, geysers, mud caldrons and bubbling hot pots. The natural wonders — from wildlife to geography — are as beautiful in winter as in summer. Especially in the Lamar Valley in the northeast corner, visitors are treated to a wide variety of wildlife, including grizzly bears, wolves, bison, elk and deer. Eagles, falcons and trumpeter swans are among the 303 bird species that make their home in the park.\n\nThe Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is a popular hot spot for tourists and the site of one of the most picturesque glacial and volcanic aftermaths in the world.

The town boasts the state's first six-story IMAX theater, with films interpreting the history, wildlife and geothermal activity of Yellowstone Park. Open 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. every day, the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center features live grizzlies and wolves and natural presentations.

Three separate halls are dedicated to traveling exhibits. Call 994-2251.\n\n83 Gallatin Gateway\n\nThis community just west of Bozeman was named for being a main gateway to Yellowstone National Park. Even in the 1800s, the area was known for its many dude ranches and tourist opportunities. Many out-of-state visitors boarded at the beautiful Gallatin Gateway Inn in the early part of the century. It was restored to its original splendor in recent years and has regained its fame as one of the finest historic Inns in the region. The palatial structure features arched windows and carved beams. The original railroad clock still keeps accurate time for visitors. The Inn now is home to a fine restaurant that draws customers from around the state.

The wilderness area includes hundreds of miles of trails for plenty of hiking, backpacking and cross-country skiing.\n\n87 Yellowstone Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nTake the north entrance to picturesque Red Lodge to find the sanctuary. Formerly called Beartooth Nature Center, it's the only public facility in the state to house native animals that cannot be returned to the wild because of injury or habituation to humans.

Under the spiritual leadership of Sitting Bull, the Indians prepared for battle against the much stronger army. During the preparations, he was said to have conducted a Sun Dance and had a vision of a great victory of the white soldiers. The defeat of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and his 647 soldiers in the 7th Cavalry is now well known. Custer and his men attacked an Indian village in the valley of the Little Bighorn River. When the bloodshed ended, 263 cavalrymen — including Custer — lay dead. Today, the monument lies within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation and commemorates the battle and the warriors on both sides who fought for their respective nations.

To the Sioux Indians, the name meant \"bad earth\" or \"bad land.\" Indeed, much of the pine and juniper-studded park is filled with badland formations. The park also is rich in dinosaur remains, including Tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops. A visitor center explains the park's fossils and geologic history. Roads and hiking trails offer visitors a number of routes through which to explore the capstone formations. Visitors also enjoy photography, archery and Frisbee golf.

It houses a coal tunnel and memorabilia from early mining days, local Indian artifacts, fossils, restored cowboy and pioneer exhibits, a blacksmith shop and an old ranch home built in the 1880s.

The vote on each count was unanimous.\n\nDiaz, 78, of Ocean Springs was remanded into custody until he has a bond hearing before a magistrate judge. Sentencing will be at 9:30 a.m. May 22 at William M. Colmer Federal Courthouse in Hattiesburg before U.S. District Judge Keith Starrett.\n\nDiaz faces up to 305 years in prison and fines up to $7.5 million.\n\nThe jury began deliberations around 4:40 p.m. Friday and reached its verdict just before 11 p.m. Diaz's trial got underway Monday in U.S. District Court in Hattiesburg.\n\nDiaz's attorney John Colette declined to comment, saying the verdict was \"too sad\" to talk about.\n\nColette immediately asked for a retrial, mentioning a contaminated jury and threats. Although one juror was not in attendance Friday, no explanation was given of her absence. It was not clear whether Colette's statement of a contaminated jury had anything to do with the absent juror.\n\nColette also sought to have Diaz immediately released on bond, but Starrett, who presided over the trial, refused.\n\n\"The magistrate judge will go through that,\" Starrett said.\n\nDiaz, whose practice is in Biloxi, admitted on the witness stand Thursday he signed several prescriptions for compounded pain and scar creams without ever seeing the patients.\n\nHe told the jury he believed pharmaceutical sales rep Jay Schaar when Schaar told him several VA patients were denied the pain creams by their doctors and would have to start taking oral opioids instead.\n\nDiaz said he was concerned about the patients getting addicted to opioids if they were used for long-term treatment, so he signed the prescriptions and told Schaar he needed to see the patients two weeks to a month later for followup.\n\nThe patients never appeared, yet Diaz kept signing prescriptions for Schaar.\n\nAfter Diaz learned he was being audited by TRICARE, he contacted Schaar, who with Randy Thomley, took Diaz to see the people for whom he had written the prescriptions, to get patient information and set up files for them to submit in his response to the audit.\n\nIn closing, however, Colette said Diaz was an innocent pawn of the \"House of Fraud,\" naming drug rep Schaar, who convinced him to sign prescriptions without seeing patients, and several others, including Hope and Randy Thomley and Jason May.\n\nColette called those who allegedly profited most from the scheme part of a \"Millionaires Club.\" He said Hope Thomley received $86.4 million; Randy Thomley and Jason May each made $4 million; and Jay Schaar made $1.8 million.\n\n\"Everybody got money except for Dr. Diaz,\" Colette said. \"What was in it for him?\"\n\nBut Kate Payerle, an attorney for the government, said Diaz was a willing participant who got caught and was trying to cover up his crime by seeing the patients more than a year after writing the prescriptions.\n\n\"He knew his actions were against the law,\" she said.\n\nThe scheme allegedly defrauded TRICARE and other health care benefite providers of more than $400 million by prescribing medically unnecessary compounds.\n\nFederal agents conducted multiple searches at pharmacies and other businesses on Jan. 21, 2016, seizing millions in property and bank accounts.\n\nMay and Schaar admitted their roles in the scheme, with May admitting to handling around $192 million of the fraudulently obtained money through his pharmacy by issuing \"high-heeled compounded medications\" that were expensive — some costing insurance companies tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nMay also admitted to laundering around $400,000 by transferring funds between various banks.\n\nSchaar admitted to receiving kickbacks for helping Advantage Pharmacy fraudulently obtain around $2.2 million in reimbursements from TRICARE, the Department of Defense's military health care system.\n\n\n\nWhat's next?\n\nDr. Albert Diaz will face a magistrate judge next week, who will determine whether Diaz should be released on bond and whether there should be a retrial. A date and place for the hearing has not yet been set.\n\nDiaz will be sentenced at 9:30 a.m. May 22 in U.S. District Court in Hattiesburg. He faces up to 305 years in prison and fines up to $7.5 million.\n\nNurse practitioner Susan Perry will stand trial in April for her alleged role in the scheme.\n\nJason May and Jay Schaar will be sentenced at a later date.

That I would be shamed.\"\n\nLast May, a 2016 hotel surveillance video exclusively shared by CNN showed Combs kicking, hitting and dragging Ventura Fine – better known as Cassie, the hitmaker behind the song \"Me & U.\"\n\nNow, as Combs, 55, faces charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution, Ventura Fine, 38, is confronting him in court as the prosecution's star witness.\n\nCombs has pleaded not guilty.\n\nCassie in 2023 'didn't want to be alive anymore'\n\nVentura Fine in court testified that in early 2023, around the time before she went to rehab for opioid addiction and began trauma therapy, she experienced suicidal ideation. \"I was spinning out\" at the time, Ventura Fine testified, \"I didn't want to be alive anymore at that point.\"\n\nShe recalled a time when she went home to her husband Alex Fine and children, \"I remember telling him, 'You can do this without me.'\" Ventura Fine said during testimony that it all just felt \"too painful\" and that \"I tried walking out the door into traffic and my husband wouldn't let me.\"\n\nDiddy on trial newsletter: Step inside the courtroom as music mogul faces sex-crimes and trafficking charges.\n\nVentura Fine alleges Combs raped her in 2018 after she met her now-husband Alex Fine\n\nAnother major revelation came from 2018, after Cassie and Combs were no longer together and she had started dating her now-husband, Alex Fine. She said she and Combs met up for dinner, during which he was friendly and kind.\n\nAfterward, he drove her back to her home and walked her inside. \"And then he raped me in my living room\" Cassie alleged. She said she cried and told him \"no\" during the alleged rape.\n\nProsecutors asked how she felt in that moment: “It was like someone taking something from you.”\n\nCassie says Combs threatened to hurt her and Kid Cudi\n\nJurors were shown an email that Ventura Fine sent on Dec. 23, 2011, to her mother and Combs' assistant Capricorn Clark. Ventura Fine said Combs had threatened to \"release two explicit tapes of me,\" sharing one tape two days later on Christmas Day and the other at a later date.\n\nVentura Fine said he also vowed to hurt both her and rapper Kid Cudi, but not with his hands, and that he would be out of the country when it happened. The court saw photos of the large bruises she had on her lower back and thigh, taken at the time.\n\nVentura Fine had returned home to Connecticut to visit her mom for Christmas. She told her mom the bruises were from the first time Combs had assaulted her, even though the assaults had been going on for years. \"I was terrified (to tell her mom),\" Ventura Fine testified to jurors. \"It's not normal, constantly being bruised up by the person you love.\"\n\nVentura Fine's 2023 lawsuit against Combs accused the hip-hop mogul of threatening to blow up Cudi's car. The lawsuit was settled for $20 million, paid by Combs and his companies.\n\nMescudi came to visit Ventura Fine in Connecticut, but she broke off their relationship because she said it was too dangerous to continue, given Combs' alleged threat to hurt them.\n\nCassie alleges Diddy lunged at her with a wine bottle opener after finding out about Kid Cudi\n\nCassie testified about her brief relationship with rapper Kid Cudi in 2011, which began after they started working together on music.\n\nVentura Fine said she didn't initially tell Combs about Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, but Combs went through her phone during a \"freak off\" and found out about the relationship.\n\nHe allegedly became enraged after he saw emails, lunging at Cassie with a wine bottle opener between his fingers, she testified. However, she said she managed to escape and went to another hotel where she contacted Cudi using a burner phone.\n\nAs she left Combs' house, Cassie testified that he \"kicked me in the back on my way out, and I fell to the floor.\" When she got back to her hotel room, someone had urinated on the floor, knocked over the furniture and defecated in the toilet without flushing it. \"It was disgusting,\" she said.\n\nVentura Fine felt 'trapped' after Combs threatened to release 'freak off' videos\n\nVentura Fine alleged that, during a trip to Cannes during their relationship, Combs kicked her off a boat and accused her of taking drugs from him. Combs subsequently sat next to her at a movie premiere at the famed film festival in the French city and allegedly squeezed her legs in a painful manner.\n\nOn the flight back to New York, Ventura Fine said Combs played \"freak off\" videos, which she thought she had deleted, in front of other people.\n\n\"I just felt trapped,\" Ventura Fine said of being shown the footage.\n\n'You treat me like Ike Turner'\n\nProsecutors displayed a text thread in which Ventura Fine attempted to reel in the alleged \"freak offs\" with Combs. Relaying to Combs that many of the typical escorts they hired were unavailable, she told the music mogul that he was the only person she wanted to have intercourse with during their relationship.\n\nCombs pushed forward by booking a new escort, despite concerns from Ventura Fine. \"It's just one more person knowing our secret,\" she wrote. Some of the texts discussed Valium, which she testified she would take if she had anxiety.\n\nIn the same text exchange, she told Combs he was an extraordinary man and that she couldn't wait until they had a baby of their own, while wishing him a happy Father's Day. The message was \"completely separate\" from the prior \"freak off\" texts, Ventura Fine said.\n\nShe also texted Combs that \"nothing good comes out of (freak offs) anymore.\" She told him \"you treat me like Ike Turner,\" by which she said meant he was abusive and controlling. \"As much as I was built up, I was put down quite a bit,\" Ventura Fine testified.\n\nCassie says Diddy attacked her in her sleep\n\nVentura Fine also testified about an August 2017 incident, telling the court that while preparing to go to the OVO Music Festival, two friends, identified as Mia and Deonte, witnessed Combs enter her room and attack her in her sleep.\n\nDeonte and Mia jumped on Combs' back, and he threw her into the bed frame, Ventura Fine said, which caused a gash on her eyebrow. The court then saw a photo of her face with the gash and some blood. Combs had a plastic surgeon whom Ventura Fine went to after the incident, she said, revealing she had a permanent scar on her eyebrow.\n\nIn texts shown to the jury, Ventura Fine sent Combs a photo of the gash and wrote: \"So you can remember.\" Combs replied that Ventura Fine didn't know when to stop during arguments, and she wrote back that she didn't know what she'd done to deserve it.\n\nCassie testifies 'freak offs' caused medical issues\n\nVentura Fine described the medical issues she would suffer from after a \"freak off,\" including sores on her mouth, stomach problems and frequent, \"very painful\" urinary tract infections. She said Combs was aware that she would get UTIs, and it got to the point where the antibiotics she used to treat them no longer worked.\n\nCassie also said that after a \"freak off,\" she and Combs would receive IV fluids, massages and food to recover. She also used opiates after the sessions, and she said she was previously addicted to the drugs.\n\nCassie recounts being 'terrified' of sex clubs\n\nAsked about going to sex clubs, venues allegedly frequented by Combs where multiple people have sex, Ventura Fine said: \"I was always terrified and would drink quite a bit.\"\n\nAt times, she and Combs would go with escorts, including one named Jules. While she said she didn't want to have sex with him, she called the escort \"a safe place\" for her among the \"freak offs.\"\n\nVentura Fine said she would drink alcohol and take various drugs for sex clubs, including ecstasy, MDMA and GHB. The venues were confusing for her, she said, revealing she was clouded by the drugs at that point.\n\nTestifying that she \"was vocal\" about not wanting to go, Ventura Fine said Combs would try to turn the energy around, becoming playful instead of scary, pushing her to go by saying it would be \"a fun thing to do,\" and that they wouldn't go for long periods.\n\nReport from security guard details Combs' alleged assault of Cassie\n\nThe court on May 13 saw a report from Israel Florez, a former security guard who was working at the hotel at the time of the 2016 assault in Los Angeles. Florez detailed being called up to the sixth floor and finding Combs in just a towel, alongside Ventura Fine.\n\nSurveying the damage, Florez said he recognized Combs and advised him to respect Ventura Fine and return to his room. Combs began yelling at her before allegedly offering him a stack of cash as a bribe, saying: \"you take care of this and I take care of you.\"\n\nFlorez said he then helped escort Ventura Fine downstairs, but requested she stand by in case they needed to ask more questions. However, by the time he returned from his manager's office, she had left.\n\nCassie appears calm as she watches hotel assault video\n\nVentura Fine, who testified for over four hours on May 13, strolled confidently into the courtroom clad in a light gray dress and jacket. After sitting down, she took a sip from a water bottle and touched up her lipstick with a tissue before taking off her jacket and flipping her hair forward over her shoulders.\n\nAs she rewatched the video of Combs dragging her down a hotel hallway, footage that has become central to the trial, she spoke quietly and sometimes trailed off at the end of her sentences. Still, she remained calm and composed during her testimony.\n\nCassie testifies fighting back against Combs would 'make it worse'\n\nVentura Fine testified that she did not fight back when Combs hit her at the InterContinental Hotel in 2016. She said that she fought back earlier in the relationship but learned that doing so \"would make it worse for myself.\" Fighting back would make Combs \"stronger and want to push me harder,\" Ventura Fine added.\n\nVentura Fine also told the jury that the first instance of physical violence in her relationship with Combs occurred around 2007 or 2008.\n\nShe recalled that they were eating at a restaurant with a group of people, and she saw Combs briefly flirting with someone else. Afterwards, in their vehicle, “he just shook me up and scared me quite a bit,” she alleged. “I was just shocked,” she added, noting that security was there.\n\nIn a later incident, Ventura Fine said that she punched Combs in the face after he called her a slut, which was the first time she recalls hitting him. Combs allegedly responded by attacking her and stomping on her face.\n\nVentura Fine attended movie premiere with bruises from assault\n\nVentura Fine claimed Combs tried to break into her apartment after the violent 2016 incident, saying she heard \"chaos outside the door,\" with kicking, banging and Combs' voice yelling. He was unable to get inside. She later went to Combs' security guard D-Roc’s house, who, along with his wife, she said, always made her \"feel safe.\"\n\nThe same night, Ventura Fine claimed she went to Diddy’s house to get fitted for the premiere of her movie \"The Perfect Match.\" The jury was shown a photo taken in Combs' bedroom of her wearing her premiere gown and large sunglasses \"to cover up my eye,\" she said, explaining \"I got hit in the face.\"\n\nThe jury was then shown a red carpet photo where a bruise was visible on Ventura Fine's shoulder and another of her at the afterparty where, now in a shorter dress, a bruise on her right shin was visible.\n\nCassie testifies about violent 2016 footage\n\nCassie returned to the witness stand and testified about Combs kicking, hitting and dragging her across a hallway floor in a violent 2016 incident at the now-closed luxury InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter Ventura Fine left the hotel, Combs sent a series of texts to her including \"call me,\" \"yo pls call me,\" \"call me for my kids\" and \"help.\"\n\nThe court was also shown a selfie that Cassie took in an Uber on her way back to her apartment from the hotel. Federal prosecutors asked her to describe the photo, and she said it was \"a selfie of my fat lip.\" In the selfie, Cassie had large sunglasses on and she said, \"I had a black eye underneath. I was trying to cover it.\"\n\nCassie said she wasn't sure if police ever showed up to the hotel, but she didn’t care – she just wanted to be home. In more texts with Combs, she wrote \"I have a premiere on Monday for the biggest thing of my life\" in reference to a movie premiere she had. Cassie starred alongside friend Terrence J in \"The Perfect Match\" around the time the footage was taken.\n\nThese Diddy family members have been in court amid his sex-crimes trial\n\nSeveral members of the embattled rap mogul's family, including his adult children, have turned out to in New York this week as his criminal trial gets underway.\n\nFrom stepson Quincy Brown to Combs' biological sons and daughters and former partners, here's a look at his loved ones who have been spotted at the courthouse.\n\n'Trial by ambush'\n\nBarbs flew in a tense exchange between defense attorneys and prosecutors before testimony began May 14. Prosecutors said the defense had not finished submitting all their marked evidence, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey arguing, \"Our goal is for this not to be a trial by ambush.\"\n\n\"I want all of the exhibits, and I want them now,\" she said, clarifying that she meant that not just for Ventura Fine, but for all of the witnesses.\n\nThe judge called for a \"ceasefire,\" but he also scolded Comey. \"This is being raised while the jury is literally sitting in the box,\" Subramanian said, adding the matter should have been handled three weeks ago.\n\nWho is Cassie's husband? Alex Fine nearly denied court entry\n\nBefore the jury entered the courtroom May 13, Combs' defense team attempted to prevent Cassie's husband, Alex Fine, from being present for witness testimony. One of the embattled mogul's lawyers, Teny Geragos, said they may call him as a witness.\n\nUltimately, he was let inside the courtroom for support.\n\nWhat is racketeering?\n\nRacketeering is the participation in an illegal scheme under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute, or RICO, as a way for the U.S. government to prosecute organizations that contribute to criminal activity.\n\nUsing RICO law, which is typically aimed at targeting multi-person criminal organizations, prosecutors allege that Combs coerced victims, some of whom they say were sex workers, through intimidation and narcotics to participate in \"freak offs\" — sometimes dayslong sex performances that federal prosecutors claim they have video of.\n\nWhere can I watch the Diddy trial?\n\nThe trial will not be televised, as cameras are typically not allowed in federal criminal trial proceedings.\n\nUSA TODAY will be reporting live from the courtroom.\n\nThis article discusses suicide and suicidal ideation.

Flanked by her daughter Ashley and her daughter-in-law Melissa Cohen Biden, they made a trifecta of support as the highly watched case got underway.\n\nAshley Biden is Hunter’s half-sister and Cohen Biden is Hunter's wife. The first lady raised Hunter Biden after the death of the president's first wife in a 1972 car accident. As courtrooms scenes go, the show of presidential family figures in full view of the jury made for an unusual sight – and it's one that continued on Tuesday when the three women returned for opening statements.\n\nWearing a purple monochromatic pantsuit, Valentino stilettos and a perfectly coiffed mane, Jill Biden was a powerful presence on Monday in the courtroom. As the jury selection process got underway, she could be seen paying rapt attention and taking notes as well as frequently whispering to the women by her side. During breaks, she would wait for Hunter Biden to leave the defense table and give him a hug before exiting the room.\n\nIt was apparent that the first lady’s stature was that of any ordinary relative of a defendant. She got up, with everyone else in the courtroom, to “All rise” when U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika entered.\n\nBy the afternoon on Monday, a diverse jury had been selected. The first lady sat across from everyday Delaware residents who would soon decide her son’s fate.\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of former President Donald Trump’s hush money trial and conviction in a New York City courtroom last week. It's a rare moment in history to see so many presidential figures and wannabes packed into courtrooms where their fates and families' fortunes are being decided.\n\nHunter Biden faces three felonies over whether he lied on a federal gun form in 2018 that asked if he was addicted to drugs.\n\nAmong Hunter Biden's family who were conspicuously absent Monday were his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and Hallie Biden, his former sister-in-law whom he dated in the aftermath of his brother's death. They are both expected to be called on as witnesses by the prosecution.\n\nFor many, Joe Biden's focus on family is a big part of his image. In 2014, Biden, then vice president, famously sent a message to his staff, that said, in part: “If I find out that you are working with me while missing important family responsibilities, it will disappoint me greatly. This has been an unwritten rule since my days in the Senate.”\n\nHaving lost his first wife and daughter at age 29 has shaped the president and the way he views his commitment to family. In 2015, tragedy struck again when he lost his older son, Beau Biden at age 46 to a brain tumor.\n\nThe president spent Sunday night with family in their Delaware home and was off on a campaign trip to Connecticut Monday afternoon.\n\nStill, for some, the legal spectacles have sown more doubts.\n\nAmong potential jurors at the Biden trial, there were some who said they believed that government and law enforcement “investigates and prosecutes individuals because of politics.”\n\nSome pointed to the Trump trial as an example. Still others said they felt Biden was being unfairly targeted because of his father.\n\nAmong supporters at the courtroom was Ricky Mouse, president of the Delaware chapter of the NAACP and a longtime Biden friend.\n\n“I have known Hunter from when he was about 3 years old,” he said. “He’s getting crucified because of his name. And that's wrong.”\n\nBoth Hunter and Jill Biden hugged Mouse when they saw him.\n\n“Hunter said I took a lot of tension off of him,” he said afterward.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

Matt Bevin.\n\n\"He was doing the right thing,\" Donta's lawyer, Thomas Clay, said in an opening statement.\n\nBut Joseph Bilby, a lawyer representing the cabinet, said Donta was fired in late 2017 for failing to be a team player, including an instance in which he got into a verbal altercation with another employee about the location of her office.\n\nEvidence will show that Donta was more interested in protecting his appointed job in state government than in working with officials at the cabinet, Bilby said.\n\n\"He was looking out for himself,\" Bilby said. \"He was a holder of grudges.\"\n\nDonta alleges he was fired in 2017 after he reported alleged sexual harassment of several female employees by Winston Bennett, a former University of Kentucky basketball star who worked briefly as the cabinet's director of apprenticeship.\n\nBennett, who also played basketball for Male High School in Louisville, landed his $73,500-a-year job under an appointment approved by Bevin in August 2017 but was fired without explanation 10 weeks later. Bennett was recommended by then-Labor Secretary Derrick Ramsey, a former UK football quarterback who knew Bennett and had worked with him at Kentucky State University when Ramsey was athletic director, Clay said.\n\nThough Ramsey fired Bennett from the Kentucky State job, he later was willing to take him on as an employee at the Labor Cabinet \"with absolutely no background check\" that would have turned up alleged misconduct, Clay said.\n\nDonta also alleges retaliation for reporting to his bosses what he saw as significant problems with a cabinet approval of a nursing apprenticeship program at Louisville's Norton Healthcare that had not yet been approved by the U.S. Department of Labor. Cabinet officials maintain the program was properly authorized.\n\nAs for Bennett, problems with his workplace behavior started right after he began his state job in August 2017, Donta's lawsuit said.\n\n\"Almost immediately upon starting his tenure with (the cabinet), Bennett began commenting in the workplace about the appearance of the women working under his supervision, including comments about their hair, referencing how attractive they looked, and how good they smelled,\" it said.\n\nThe Courier Journal reported a month after Bennett was fired that copies of his emails obtained under open records law included various personal comments to female employees.\n\nIn one email, Bennett told a cabinet employee she was “Too hot to trot. Especially on those skirt and dress days, lips stick matching. Lord have mercy. LOL!!! Not too old by a long shot.”\n\nHe regularly referred to another woman as “Princess.”\n\nHe told another, “I just want to say you are a wonderful lady and I enjoy speaking with you. I also want to say you look very nice today. I hope my saying this does not mess up your shape, kind like eating a cup cake. You are very impressionable. Have a wonderful day.”\n\nDonta alleged cabinet higher-ups disregarded warning signs he brought to their attention before Bennett began work at the cabinet, including past news reports in which Bennett admitted to being a \"sex addict.\"\n\nBut Donta said when he brought that to the attention of his boss, he was told, \"Not our problem, not our call.\"\n\nA second former cabinet employee, Christina Columber, has settled a similar lawsuit pending against the cabinet, alleging she was fired for reporting Bennett's inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe Labor Cabinet did not immediately respond to a request Monday for details of the settlement including the amount of any money paid.\n\nColumber, who was fired in January 2018, alleged she experienced harassing behavior and received inappropriate emails and text messages from Bennett.\n\nColumber, who worked as a program coordinator in the apprenticeship division, alleged five specific instances in which she said she was humiliated by Bennett's behavior, including an Oct. 4 meeting during which he put his hand on her shoulder and \"surprisingly kissed\" her.\n\nDonta's and Columber's lawsuits claimed that in late 2017, Ramsey and Workplace Standards Commissioner Ervin Dimeny called a meeting of female employees in the department and \"apologized for not dealing with Bennett's inappropriate behavior sooner before things had gone too far. Both Ramsey and Dimeny commented that they had been previously aware of issues with Bennett's workplace behavior,\" the lawsuits said.\n\nDimeny appeared as the first witness at the trial Monday but repeatedly said he could not recall details about any information he received about Bennett's conduct.\n\nHe also testified about the apprenticeship program Donta questioned, claiming it was properly authorized.\n\nDonta is seeking unspecified damages.\n\nRamsey, who now serves as secretary of the state Education and Workforce Development Cabinet, is scheduled as the first witness Tuesday.\n\nThe trial is expected to last about four days.\n\nDeborah Yetter: 502-582-4228; dyetter@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @d_yetter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2018/06/25/craigslist-ad-leads-murder-mystery-trial-underway-kelly-shay-cozart-ryan-monroe-allen/730003002/", "title": "Craigslist ad leads to murder mystery; trial underway in Knox case", "text": "June 25, 2018 Updated June 26, 2018, 6:51 a.m. ET\n\nGary Mullins used Craigslist to search for a roommate but, prosecutors say, he found a killer instead.\n\nRyan Monroe Allen – the man who answered Gary Mullins’ advertisement for a roommate in May 2015 – is standing trial this week in Knox County Criminal Court Judge Scott Green’s courtroom on charges of first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse.\n\nHe is accused of killing 42-year-old Kelly Shay Cozart inside the bedroom he rented from Mullins — just weeks after Allen answered Mullins’ Craigslist advertisement for a roommate — and dumping her body in a creek in Monroe County.\n\nBloody room\n\nProsecutors Leslie Nassios and Molly Martin contend Allen beat Cozart to death inside Mullins’ Avondale Avenue home, put her body inside a large black trash bag, bound up the bag with an electrical cord and bedding from Mullins’ home, loaded it into a truck and then drove to Ballplay Creek in Monroe County, where he dumped it.\n\n“Kelly’s blood was in (Allen’s) room,” Nassios told jurors in opening statements Monday. “It was on the bed. It was on the desk. It was in a corner of the room. It was on the floor under the headboard. Nobody else used that room.”\n\nBut defense attorney Keith Lowe told jurors that’s all Nassios and Martin can prove – that Cozart’s blood was in a bedroom where Allen once paid to sleep.\n\n“There’s going to be no proof Mr. Allen is a killer,” Lowe told jurors.\n\nMotive questioned\n\nLowe noted the prosecutors cannot show why Allen would have killed Cozart or even that the pair had been together at the time of her death.\n\n“The proof is going to show no one was a witness to this crime,” Lowe said. “The state is not going to be able to give you a reason … a motivation.”\n\nMullins testified Monday he incurred medical bills and needed a roommate for extra cash, so, in May 2015, he posted an ad on Craigslist, a popular free online classified ad website. Allen, 53, responded and quickly moved into Mullins’ spare bedroom.\n\nThe pair, Mullins said, rarely saw each other, and Mullins knew little about Allen and who Allen associated with.\n\n“I met at least three ladies” who visited Allen in the weeks after he moved in, Mullins said.\n\nOn June 26, 2015, Mullins said he noticed a screen on the window of the bedroom Allen was renting had been damaged – bent outward from the frame – and saw “metal markings across the pavement of the driveway.” Mullins said a tire on Allen’s truck was flat.\n\n“I (then) determined someone had been in my vehicle,” Mullins said. “Some of (Allen’s) hair was in the seat.”\n\n'He kept saying he was no thief'\n\nMullins tried to confront Allen, but Allen ignored his knocks on the bedroom door. Mullins said he went to work but was still fuming when he came home to find Allen there.\n\n“He said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry,’” Mullins said. “I said, ‘Why did you take my truck?’ I said, ‘Was someone with you?’”\n\nMullins said he began a search of his home and discovered checks and coins missing.\n\n“I said, ‘Was someone in my house today? I’m missing checks. I’m missing coins,’” Mullins testified. “He kept telling me he was no thief.”\n\nMullins phoned police but officers were unable to find any proof Allen was, in fact, a thief. Mullins told Allen he wanted him to move out and, a few days later, Allen did. Mullins later noticed a brown stain on the mattress Allen had used but saw no blood or anything else amiss.\n\nLess than a week later – on July 1, 2015 – Joshua McLemore waded into Ballplay Creek and grabbed at a large stick stuck in some brush in a deep section of the waterway.\n\n“A body popped up,” McLemore told jurors.\n\nProbe launched, suspect targeted\n\nTennessee Bureau of Investigation Agent Nick Brown launched a probe that would lead him in November 2015 to order up a search of the bedroom Allen rented from Mullins. It’s not yet clear how he connected the discovery of Cozart’s body in the Monroe County creek to Allen, but Nassios told jurors Monday that Allen had lived near Ballplay Creek years earlier.\n\nNassios conceded in opening statements Allen, who wasn’t indicted in the case for nearly two years, has denied any involvement in Cozart’s death.

Clarion Ledger\n\nUpdated Jan. 29, 2018, 8:33 a.m. ET\n\nJACKSON, Miss. — The federal judge overseeing about 200 lawsuits against opioid makers would rather curb the opioid epidemic than referee the litigation.\n\n“About 150 Americans are going to die today, just today, while we’re meeting,” U.S. District Judge Dan Polster of Cleveland, Ohio, told the parties earlier this month. “And in my humble opinion, everyone shares some of the responsibility, and no one has done enough to abate it.”\n\nHe sees no value in depositions and trials, he said. “People aren’t interested in figuring out the answer to interesting legal questions like pre-emption and learning intermediary, or unraveling complicated conspiracy theories.”\n\nInstead, “my objective is to do something meaningful to abate this crisis and to do it in 2018,” the judge said. “I’m confident we can do something to dramatically reduce the number of opioids that are being disseminated, manufactured and distributed. Just dramatically reduce the quantity and make sure that the pills that are manufactured and distributed go to the right people and no one else.”\n\nOpioid litigation, which started as a trickle, reached a flood last year when about 250 cities, counties and states sued opioid makers, wholesalers, distributors and marketers.\n\nThe lawsuits accuse the companies of misleading health care professionals and the public by marketing opioids as rarely addictive and a safe substitute for non-addictive pain medications, such as ibuprofen.\n\nThe companies deny the claims and say litigation should be halted until the Food and Drug Administration-ordered studies on the long-term risks and benefits of opioids are completed.\n\nExperts say the sheer number of opioid lawsuits could lead some companies to settle.\n\n\"The litigation costs must be killing them,\" said Richard Ausness, a professor at the University of Kentucky college of law. \"The problem is that a settlement with some plaintiffs will only cause more plaintiffs to sue.\"\n\nOnly a global settlement could prevent this, he said. \"I am not sure that this would be feasible, although the Florida Legislature did it in connection with lawsuits against gun manufacturers.\"\n\nBloomberg has reported that Purdue Pharma, whose drug OxyContin jump-started the opioid epidemic, is proposing a global settlement in an attempt to end litigation. Purdue would not comment.\n\nA new wave of litigation from Detroit and other Michigan cities and counties accuses companies of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a law created to fight the mob and organized crime.\n\nThe litigation alleges Purdue and other opioid makers “pushed highly addictive, dangerous opioids, falsely representing to doctors that patients would only rarely succumb to drug addiction.”\n\n“We are deeply troubled by the opioid crisis, and we are dedicated to being part of the solution,” Purdue responded in a statement. “We vigorously deny these allegations and look forward to the opportunity to present our defense.”\n\nPaul Hanly, whose New York law firm, Simmons Hanly Conroy, is involved in 150 lawsuits, said governments “are learning that litigation may be the only avenue for them to recover some of the massive increased expenses related to the epidemic,” including the costs connected to emergency medical services, mental health, the judicial system, law enforcement, child services and rehabilitation.\n\nWith each new lawsuit, governments that have not sued are “taking a hard look at their rights and their obligations to their taxpayers,” he said.\n\nSome hospitals are suing, too.\n\nHospital officials say they have been forced to treat patients for opioid addiction and overdoses as well as babies born with opioid addiction — treatment that is often lengthy and uncompensated.\n\nIn the latest wrinkle, several West Virginia cities have filed litigation against the Joint Commission, which accredits and certifies health care organizations and programs in the United States, alleging the nonprofit spread “misinformation” to health care professionals about the risks of opioid addiction.\n\nIn 2001, the commission began requiring hospitals to assess all patients for pain on a scale of 1 to 10, which some said caused more doctors to prescribe opioids.\n\nPurdue gave the commission a grant to produce a pain assessment and management manual, which told health care providers, “There is no evidence that addiction is a significant issue when persons are given opioids for pain control.”\n\nCommission officials have denied that change encouraged doctors to prescribe more opioids, blaming drug trafficking as well as diversion and abuse by individuals.\n\nEarlier this month, the commission released new pain management standards, which require hospitals to have leaders responsible for “pain management and safe opioid prescribing.” Those hospitals also must identify high-risk patients and make prescription drug monitoring programs available to those prescribing opioids.\n\nIn addition to litigation, congressional investigations are underway, examining such questions as how drug wholesalers sold more than 780 million painkiller pills in six years to a single pharmacy in Kermit, W.Va., where fewer than 400 people live.\n\nEvery state attorney general has either filed a lawsuit against opioid makers or is involved in investigating whether these drugmakers misled health care providers about the addictiveness to opioids. Their offices have issued subpoenas for records from those companies.\n\nOn Oct. 26 — the same day President Trump declared that the opioid epidemic was a public health emergency — Justice Department officials announced the arrest of John Kapoor, the founder of Insys Therapeutics.\n\nThey accused him of using kickbacks to get doctors to prescribe Subsys, a fentanyl spray for cancer patients suffering from excruciating pain, to patients who didn’t have cancer.\n\nAusness, who has written about the opioids litigation, said the growing problem of overdose deaths and the publicity surrounding them “may be increasing public concern and thereby putting pressure on state and local officials to do something about it.\n\n“Lawsuits, as presently underwritten by personal injury lawyers, are a cheap response and, if successful, may provide some extra funding for drug treatment programs at the state and local level.”\n\nHe believes lawyers are hoping for a repeat of the litigation against cigarette makers, which ended with a $206 billion settlement in 1998.\n\nAusness pointed out that “compliance with safety standards is only evidence that the product is not defective. It is not conclusive; however, some states have enacted laws that create a presumption that prescription drugs that are approved by the FDA are not defective.”\n\nThose types of claims usually apply to warnings and design claims, he said. (The label for OxyContin declared, “ ‘Addiction’ to opioids legitimately used in the management of pain is very rare.”)\n\nHe doubts that FDA approval would provide much protection against fraud claims or negligent marketing claims based on failure to monitor distributors and retail sellers.\n\nHe also doubts any lawsuit against the FDA, which approved the drugs, would succeed because the drug approval process falls “within the ‘discretionary function’ exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act, which insulates decisions by federal officials that involve elements of judgment or choice.”\n\nFollow Jerry Mitchell on Twitter: @JMitchellNews", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/features/2022/08/09/columbus-defense-attorney-diane-menashe-murder-trial-mount-carmel-doctor-william-husel/10271864002/", "title": "Columbus Attorney Diane Menashe on Defending William Husel ...", "text": "Andrew Welsh-Huggins\n\nAug. 9, 2022, 11:00 a.m. ET\n\nThe trial of former Mount Carmel Health System doctor William Husel had entered its fifth week when, on Monday, March 21, 2022, prosecutors put witness Christine Allison on the stand. Allison, the widow of Troy Allison, had been outspoken in her quest for justice for her late husband, allegedly murdered by Husel on July 15, 2018, via a lethal dose of 1,000 micrograms of fentanyl. She was also one of several family members of Husel’s alleged victims asked to testify by prosecutors as they laid out their case that Husel purposefully killed 14 patients, many of them already desperately ill and close to death.\n\nOnce assistant Franklin County prosecutor Corinne Buker finished questioning Allison, defense attorney Diane Menashe stepped to the podium for the cross-examination. She was ready. Menashe was a veteran of such moments when a client’s life might depend on the questions she asked over the next several minutes. Menashe had watched video clips of Christine Allison speaking at news conferences about her husband and had kept an eye on her in the back of the courtroom as the trial proceeded. She had no hesitation as she began her questions, which constitute the essence of defense work. Being in front of a jury is “the ultimate physical grind and mental stress, while at the same time being the most incredible rush,” Menashe says.\n\nTheir interaction started off in friendly enough fashion, as Menashe—speaking without notes, as is her custom—reminded Allison that they’d chatted in the hallway before court began that morning. But soon enough, Menashe got down to business by questioning Allison’s recollections of her husband’s death and reminding her—and the jury—of Allison’s wrongful death lawsuit against Husel and Mount Carmel.\n\n“You have a vested interest in this case—do you not?” Menashe said.\n\n“He killed my husband,” Allison said, to which Menashe responded: “I realize that’s your belief.”\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nAfter sparring over the lawsuit, Menashe went after a discrepancy in Allison’s earlier testimony, when she described being with her husband for 18 years. In fact, Menashe said, Allison had been married to someone else between 2008 and 2010, hadn’t she?\n\n“I don’t know if I got the dates wrong but that’s what I said, yes,” Allison said.\n\n“But you were married in 2008 and divorced in 2010 to a different man, were you not?” Menashe said.\n\nBuker objected, as she would twice more as Menashe pressed her point. Common Pleas Judge Michael Holbrook sustained each objection. But the damage had been done.\n\n“She had to prove this lady was not a truthful person,” juror Damon Massey said several weeks later. Though some thought Menashe’s approach was “savage,” Massey said, it was also around this time that jurors started discounting family member testimony.\n\nA month later, the jury found Husel not guilty on all 14 counts, ending more than three years of criminal prosecution. Menashe wiped away tears as she congratulated Husel in court.\n\nThe next day, she began boning up on the Dodd-Frank Act for a tax trial she was litigating for the city of Marion, Indiana, in just a matter of days. Because in the end, trying cases is all she’s ever wanted to do.\n\n“In any jurisdiction, in any state, in any court, across the country,” Menashe says.\n\nMenashe hones her competitive streak at Purdue\n\nOn the surface, Menashe’s background wouldn’t suggest a future defending people accused of some of the most horrific crimes imaginable. By her own account, Menashe, 47, grew up the daughter of privilege in Bellevue, a Seattle suburb, attending a boarding school thanks to the money made by her late father, Jack, a police officer turned food broker. But her Republican dad also had a philanthropic streak, and Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays often found the family distributing food at homeless shelters.\n\n“He really tried to cultivate opportunities for us to see those that were less financially fortunate,” says Menashe, who dates her desire to be a lawyer to at least second grade—if not before—when she played an attorney representing “Tommy the Toothbrush” in a school play.\n\nAfter high school Menashe attended Purdue University, where the competitive athlete intended to walk on as a softball player. Instead, she followed a roommate onto the crew team and took to the sport so well that she earned invitations to the U.S. Women’s National Team Pre-Elite Camps, a collegiate feeder system for Olympic and national teams, where she rowed eight hours a day at summer camps. Not surprisingly, the position that Menashe held—the rower closest to the stern known as “the stroke”—is often considered the most competitive team member in crew. But competition in and of itself was never the goal, nor was being average in a variety of undertakings. That’s not Menashe. “I want to be exceptional at the few things that matter most to me,” she says.\n\nShe continued that focus at Tulane Law School. Where most law students would be content just keeping up with classes, Menashe juggled her academic schedule with coaching Tulane’s women’s varsity crew team, including weekends spent at out-of-town regattas. After graduation and moving to Columbus, Menashe also coached the combined Westerville North and South girls’ team, who rowed on Hoover Reservoir. To this day, rowing—on a machine—is a favored Menashe workout as she hits her gym in Grandview at 6 a.m. most mornings.\n\nIt was also at Tulane that, in her third year, Menashe participated in her first death penalty case through a criminal law clinic and had her initial experience of entering a jail, visiting with a client and, above all, learning about empathy. “How other people live, and the circumstances they survived to be where they are, is to me the greatest part about criminal defense,” she says.\n\nMenashe arrived in Columbus more than 25 years ago to work in the state public defender’s office, branching out on her own after three years and handling dozens of cases in state and federal court. “She leaves no stone unturned,” says Algenon Marbley, U.S. District Court judge. “She will know the law, and she will know her facts.” Menashe gained a reputation as a relentless advocate who literally would work day and night on behalf of clients. Emails at 3 a.m. to her fellow attorneys were not unusual. “She’s tireless,” says defense attorney Kort Gatterdam, who’s partnered with her several times over the years. “You will not outwork her.”\n\nYet early in her career, Menashe hit a stumbling block that might have felled a lesser attorney, when she faced tampering with evidence and obstructing justice charges after she was wrongly accused of instructing a client, a Clinton County police officer charged with murder, to destroy evidence. Felony charges were dropped after she passed a polygraph test. Despite the professional and financial shockwaves caused by a case that might have ended other attorneys’ careers, Menashe shook off the catastrophe and kept going. “I do think hopefully that part of the look-back on me is my resilience,” she says.\n\nMenashe has relied on that resilience again and again. In 2006, she and Gatterdam represented Daryl Lawrence, who shot and killed Bryan Hurst, an off-duty Columbus police officer on special duty, as Lawrence attempted to rob Fifth Third Bank at 6265 E. Broad St. Tensions ran high with federal prosecutors under pressure to secure a death sentence for a cop-killer. Mid-trial, Menashe and Gatterdam filed a motion with federal judge Gregory Frost requesting the officers not wear uniforms to court, though that didn’t stop cops from lining Marconi Boulevard with cruisers. After the trial, then-FOP president Jim Gilbert criticized Menashe and Gatterdam’s representation in a letter to The Columbus Dispatch. “The attorneys tried to convince a jury that somehow Lawrence was the victim in this case,” Gilbert wrote. The true hero, he said, was Hurst.\n\nAmid all this, Menashe “would go over to the U.S. attorney’s table, or out in the hallway, make jokes with them, talk to them,” Frost says. “It put everyone at ease. She did a real good job of that under some of the most trying circumstances with regard to the evidence.” (Though the jury initially sentenced Lawrence to death, Frost later dismissed the death sentence after Menashe and Gatterdam successfully petitioned for a new trial. Later, Lawrence’s death sentence was reinstated, and he remains on federal death row.)\n\nRepresenting Lawrence taught Menashe the value of having a thick skin, a trait that came in handy after she took on two of the highest-profile cases of her career—the back-to-back 2018 and 2019 trials of Brian Golsby, accused of raping and killing 21-year-old Ohio State University student Reagan Tokes after abducting her in the Short North; and of Quentin Smith, who shot and killed Westerville police officers Eric Joering and Anthony Morelli as they answered a 911 domestic violence call from Smith’s wife. During both trials, Menashe received so many death threats she had to request police officers respond to her house and office, where she worried about walking to her car after dark.\n\nThough convicted, both Golsby and Smith were spared the death penalty, which goes in the win column for Menashe, a fiercely anti-capital punishment lawyer who makes no bones about the fact that saving lives—she’s worked on more than 35 capital cases—is often the measure of success in death penalty defense work. “Nothing but fair,” she called the 2019 life sentence her client, Martin Neftali Aguilar-Rivera, received for his role as an MS-13 leader charged with five Ohio killings, including victims slashed and beaten to death with machetes and hammers.\n\nTo this end, she takes care to always “own” the facts of a case, no matter how bad they appear. This is especially important in death penalty cases, Menashe says, when your credibility is on the line as you ask jurors to spare the lives of defendants who have committed terrible crimes. In Golsby’s case, for example, he claimed that an accomplice named “TJ” forced him to rape Tokes and was the one who killed the college student. But Menashe was clear with jurors. “He’s lying. There’s nobody else,” she said.\n\nTeamed again with Gatterdam, Menashe laid out Golsby’s horrific childhood, including domestic violence, mental health problems, addiction, his rape around the age of 12 or 13, brain injuries and brutal treatment in the state youth detention system. The jury deadlocked eight to four on execution, and Golsby was sentenced to life without parole.\n\n“I hope you don’t waste their efforts,” Judge Mark Serrott told Golsby afterward. “You’re standing here alive because of your lawyers.”\n\nMenashe’s tactics were not only an effective strategy but an example of what makes her a good adversary, says Jennifer Rausch, who faced off against Menashe as a Franklin County prosecutor in the Golsby case but also considers her a friend.\n\n“If the jury trusts what the attorney is representing, I think it makes it easier for them to listen to and fully consider the positions that they’re arguing,” says Rausch, now an assistant state attorney general.\n\nThree days after the Golsby trial ended, Franklin County Judge Richard Frye called and asked Menashe to represent Quentin Smith. For the first time in her career, Menashe hesitated. It was a dream assignment, but the idea of jumping into such a high-profile case again so soon was daunting. She told Frye she had to think about it.\n\nIn the end, she decided to take the case, owned the facts again—refusing to argue, for example, that Smith had been in a gun fight with officers—and emphasized his mental health problems instead. He was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nThe first reason Menashe took the case, she says, was that, as a woman, she feels she has to work harder to earn opportunities than male colleagues, and it would have been a professional mistake to turn the job down.\n\nAs for the second reason?\n\n“I’m not sure anyone else could have saved Quentin’s life,” she says.\n\n“They loved her because she didn’t waste their time.”\n\nFor most attorneys, saving the lives of Golsby, Smith and Aguilar-Rivera would constitute cases of a lifetime. For Menashe, they were practically a prelude to Husel.\n\nThe charges against the doctor made headlines from the moment former Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O’Brien announced an investigation “with regard to conduct by a medical employee” at Mount Carmel on Jan. 14, 2019. Husel, a well-regarded Mount Carmel physician, had been fired by the hospital amid allegations he ordered potentially fatal painkiller doses for nearly 30 patients. Multiple wrongful death lawsuits against Mount Carmel followed, Husel was arrested in June 2019, and a month later Mount Carmel fired 23 employees in connection with the scandal, including five doctors.\n\nThe case was unusual in many ways, not least of which were the explosive allegations. In March 2020, the coronavirus pandemic shut down the courts, producing a months-long delay. That November, former Ohio 10th District Court of Appeals Judge Gary Tyack, a Democrat, ousted the Republican O’Brien, the longest-serving prosecutor in Franklin County history. Just over a year later, Tyack moved to dismiss 11 of the original 25 counts. After multiple delays, the trial finally got underway in February of this year with Menashe joining lead attorney Jose Baez, a high-profile, Florida-based defense lawyer known for winning acquittals in the sensational murder cases of Casey Anthony and Aaron Hernandez. “There was no momentum in that case until we began,” Menashe says.\n\nDuring the seven-week trial—one of the longest in Franklin County history—prosecutors put on a whopping 53 witnesses, including Mount Carmel employees, medical experts, investigators and family members of all 14 patients, including Christine Allison. Asked about her cross examination of Allison, Menashe says her intent wasn’t to attack her, but to expose what she felt was a bias because of the wrongful death lawsuit. “The jurors’ job is to determine credibility,” Menashe says. “It is my job to give the jury the information to determine credibility and to determine the facts.”\n\nGerald Leeseberg, a lawyer representing Allison in her wrongful death lawsuit, called Menashe’s grilling of his client an attempt “to nitpick” discrepancies and inconsistencies that had nothing to do with the case. But while he wasn’t crazy about Menashe’s cross-examination, saying it wasn’t a fair fight, he saved his real ire for the prosecution, labeling it a disaster from the outset.\n\n“The prosecution allowed the defense to use a lay person who was clearly out of their element as a punching bag,” Leeseberg says.\n\nTyack says his prosecutors tried the case that was handed to them. “We felt we needed to have the family members think we were taking our best shot—we weren’t just going through the motions,” he says. Tyack called Menashe a talented trial lawyer who did what she had to. “You can’t really second-guess them, because they got the results they wanted,” he says.\n\nThe path to those results wasn’t always smooth. Menashe wasn’t a big fan of Baez’s decision to spend time attacking Project Lighthouse, Mount Carmel’s considered but never implemented plan to manage the publicity around the Husel case. To her, the case was purely about intent—did Husel intend to kill patients or not? For his part, Baez was nervous about Menashe’s desire not to put on a single witness, based on her principle that once defense attorneys start presenting evidence, they assume the burden of proving their client innocent.\n\nIn the end they compromised. After the 53 prosecution witnesses, Baez and Menashe put on just one: Dr. Joel Zivot, an Emory University anesthesiologist who testified that Husel’s patients died from their illnesses, not lethal doses of fentanyl.\n\n“A lot of what we did in the courtroom was not only with Diane’s blessing, but many of them were her suggestions,” Baez says. “We just worked extremely well together, but that doesn’t mean that we didn’t have our bumps in the road.”\n\nOne thing was clear by the end, however: Menashe had won over jurors with her approach. “They thought she was tough, but they loved her because she didn’t waste their time,” says Judge Michael Holbrook.\n\nMenasche’s decision to join Ice Miller\n\nBy the time the Husel case rolled around, Menashe had left behind her old life as a sole proprietor attorney. Big firms had come calling after the Golsby and Smith trials, interested in bringing her aboard to boost their trial attorney divisions. In December 2019, she was hired by Ice Miller, one of the city’s top law firms. John Gilligan, a veteran Ice Miller commercial litigator who brought Menashe on, acknowledges the move was perceived as risky, on both parts. But quickly Menashe—now the firm’s director of litigation training and pro bono activities—more than proved her mettle, working on everything from a defense of Columbus’ COVID-era ability to tax former commuters to that Marion, Indiana, tax trial, which she won. In what constitutes spare time for the always busy attorney, she also defended protesters arrested during the city’s 2020 racial injustice rallies.\n\nAt Ice Miller, Menashe has also spearheaded a pro bono initiative in which dozens of attorneys for six major Columbus law firms petition for early release for inmates near the end of their sentences, and organized a project to measure the impact of race on Cuyahoga County death penalty cases from 1994 to 2000. Gilligan marvels at how the latter undertaking united staff from all political perspectives. “I’m not sure we’ve ever had a project where there were more people from Ice Miller working on it enthusiastically,” Gilligan says.\n\nMenashe is now an instructor at Harvard Law School’s Trial Advocacy Workshop, and so highly regarded in her field that she’s a fellow in both the American College of Trial Lawyers and the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, although you’ll struggle to find proof of that in her office: Both plaques are hidden away in a closet.\n\nFor Menashe, with the Golsby and Smith trials behind her and in the midst of Husel, the move to Ice Miler came at a turning point in her career. After two decades on her own, she missed the teamwork from her days rowing crew. Menashe also confronted a character trait—overwork—that has taken a toll over the years. She’s pledged to seek a better work-life balance. “It’s a real priority,” she promises.\n\nNevertheless, in almost the same moment, Menashe makes a different kind of pledge that sounds familiar.\n\n“I always can say to my clients with real conviction, that when it’s your day, the rest of my world will stop, and you’ll get everything.”\n\nThis story is from the August 2022 issue of Columbus Monthly.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/07/08/trial-underway-pueblo-man-accused-killing-dismembering-mother/7900250002/", "title": "Anthony Cuevas admits to dumping mother's body, denies ...", "text": "July 8, 2021 Updated July 12, 2021, 9:57 a.m. ET\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect Friday morning's court proceedings.\n\nThere's no question it was Anthony Cuevas seen on surveillance video dumping a suitcase containing the dismembered body of his mother in the dumpster of a South Side car wash in 2019, both the defense and prosecution agreed in their opening statements Thursday.\n\nHowever, Cuevas' defense lawyers maintain that their client had nothing to do with the killing or dismembering of Maria \"Mary\" Cuevas-Garcia, his 58-year-old mother. Instead, the defense argued that Anthony's wife, Melanie Cuevas, believed Cuevas-Garcia was a \"witch\" and had used her phone to search for ways to kill and dispose of a witch.\n\nThe jury trial for Anthony Cuevas, who is charged in connection with the October 2019 death of his mother, began Tuesday. The torso of Cuevas-Garcia's body was found in a suitcase in a dumpster in 2019; the rest of her dismembered remains were found in a trash bag beside the Arkansas River in 2020.\n\nAfter an investigation, Pueblo police arrested Anthony Cuevas, 37, of Monte Vista. He later was charged by the 10th Judicial District Attorney's office with first-degree murder, as well as vehicular eluding, trespassing with the intent to commit a crime and identity theft, all felonies.\n\nHis jury trial is expected to last two weeks. Jury selection took up Tuesday and Wednesday proceedings and continued well into Thursday afternoon prior to attorneys delivering opening remarks. The state has subpoenaed 146 witnesses, while the defense has subpoenaed eight for possible testimony during the trial.\n\nOpening statements of defense, prosecution\n\nThe prosecution, led by Deputy District Attorney George Poland, said that after Cuevas-Garcia's body was dumped at the car wash, Anthony drove his mother's sedan, a 2018 Nissan Versa that can be seen on the surveillance video, to a scrapyard. The vehicle was fairly new in 2019 and fully functional, Poland said.\n\nThe vehicle was sold to the scrapyard for $70, Poland said. He alleged Anthony had asked that the vehicle be crushed as soon as possible as Melanie waited outside the office in a white Hyundai SUV also owned by Cuevas-Garcia.\n\nPoland said Pueblo police later saw the SUV and attempted to stop the vehicle, but it ultimately fled onto Red Creek Springs Road, where the pursuing officer was forced to stop due to a large amount of dust obscuring the road, which the vehicle had kicked up during the chase.\n\nLater, Poland said, the vehicle was found abandoned near the Pueblo Reservoir and the Cuevases broke into a fisherman's pickup truck — an offense that Anthony's defense lawyer, Philip Dubois, admitted his client committed.\n\nDubois listed several actions that Anthony took that \"he regrets,\" including his drug addiction, disposal of his mother's dismembered torso, sale of the sedan to the scrapyard, the theft from the pickup truck and using a check stolen from the truck to withdraw $250, in addition to fleeing from police.\n\nHowever, Dubois maintained that Anthony did not kill his mother. Instead, he pointed to \"bad blood\" between Melanie and Cuevas-Garcia, including that each woman believed the other was a \"witch.\"\n\nPoland said DNA was found inside of a pair of rubber gloves found in the area where Cuevas-Garcia's body was likely dismembered, due to a large presence of poorly obscured blood.\n\nHer dismembered body parts were found five months after her torso was discovered, Poland said, and he noted the condition of Cuevas-Garcia's head, hands and feet were consistent with having been refrigerated for a period of time.\n\nPoland also said jurors would hear during the trial a recorded interview of Anthony telling police that he stabbed Cuevas-Garcia. Dubois purported that Anthony said it to protect Melanie. Dubois also said Anthony was unable to accurately say how many times or where Cuevas-Garcia had been stabbed.\n\nAutopsy technician explains wounds, jury hears Cuevas' first interview with police\n\nOn Friday, the state called it's first witness for the case, Dr. Daniel Lingamfelter, a forensic pathologist, to testify about the autopsy he conducted on Cuevas-Garcia's remains in two parts. The first part was her torso, which was recovered about five months before her hands, feet and head.\n\nLingamfelter explained that the body had eight stab wounds to the upper portion of the chest and four additional stab wounds to the back of the neck.\n\nHe noted that the body showed signs of lividity — settling of blood due to gravity following death — on Cuevas-Garcia's back. Her back also bore some scrapes that, due to the lack of blood presence, Lingamfelter said, were likely inflicted after death.\n\nThe amputations of her hands, feet and head were also likely performed after death, Lingamfelter said.\n\nHe said he detected a scattering of blunt force trauma impacts across Cuevas-Garcia's body, but the marks were too indistinct to point to a weapon.\n\nLingamfelter said he is not trained to discern what manner of tools were used and was unable to say how the amputations to the body were performed.\n\nBecause the condition of the victim's head, hands and feet were not decomposed to the scale he would have anticipated without attempts at preservation, Lingamfelter opined that the body was refrigerated or frozen for some of the months prior to its discovery.\n\nFollowing the forensic pathologist's testimony, the State called a series of witnesses involved in the discovery of the suitcase in the dumpster and the sale of the Nissan Versa sedan to Dionisio Metal & Iron.\n\nEmployees of the scrapyard said the customer, who they identified in court as Cuevas, was nervous and asked if the vehicle could be \"smashed\" immediately.\n\nThe scrapyard maintains a policy of waiting seven days to crush vehicles as they may be stolen, so the vehicle was recovered by police as evidence.\n\nA Pueblo man also testified that he had been picking up papers blowing around the neighborhood near the car wash where Cuevas-Garcia's body was later found, and went to its dumpster to dispose of the litter. Upon spotting a suitcase, he told the car wash attendant he wanted to look at it more closely and then entered the dumpster. Once he opened the suitcase, he saw bloody blankets and called 911, he testified.\n\nBefore the lunch recess, the State called their advisory counsel, Det. Ron Gravatta of the Pueblo PD, to take the stand. He was one of two officers to interview Cuevas upon his arrest in October 2019. The State used his testimony and presence on the stand to show the video of his interview with Cuevas to the jury.\n\nIn the recorded interview, Cuevas tells officers that he did not know why he was in custody, but admitted to running from the cops earlier that day on foot and in a vehicle. He noted that he had lost his shoes while running from law enforcement, showing scratches and injuries to his hands, legs and feet.\n\nHowever, Cuevas also relayed information that he said was revealed to him by a \"witch doctor,\" saying he had been abused sexually by his mother for years, beginning when he was 5 years old. He said the witch doctor also told him that Cuevas-Garcia had placed a \"memory block\" on him, which was why he didn't remember the abuse.\n\nCuevas told law enforcement his step-father, Cuevas-Garcia's husband, was a member of the Mexican Mafia, and that had also contributed to the \"awfulness\" in his life.\n\nCuevas said he stabbed Cuevas-Garcia, in response to which \"she laughed.\" He said, hesitantly, that he stabbed her twice in the stomach, but later told police he had no recollection of telling them that. He also denied having any anger toward his mother.\n\n\"She sold herself to the devil,\" he said.\n\n\"I still suffer from memory loss from what that woman put me through,\" he added, and questioned whether he was possessed in some way by a demonic presence.\n\nWhat police reported prior to trial\n\nThe case began when portions of Cuevas-Garcia's remains were discovered Oct. 17, 2019. Law enforcement officials were alerted to her death after her body was found in a suitcase in a car wash dumpster. A video recovered from the car wash showed a figure throwing the suitcase away.\n\nCuevas-Garcia's identity was not released immediately because it was unknown pending an autopsy. However, police did release photos of tattoos on her body in an attempt to find people who knew her.\n\nThe rest of her body was discovered on March 10, 2020, when a volunteer group cleaning up the south bank of the Arkansas River reported finding human remains in a trash bag to a park ranger, who called police to an area near the 200 block of Howard Street.\n\nAnthony Cuevas was arrested on Oct. 18, 2019, along with his wife, Melanie Cuevas, 37, who was arrested on a charge of criminal impersonation. She was released and arrested again later in Monte Vista on April 14, 2020, accused of being an accessory to a first- or second-class crime, which would include murder charges.\n\nMelanie Cuevas has a jury trial scheduled for Oct. 18 but appeared in court on July 7 for a hearing in which she exercised her Fifth Amendment right and refused to testify in her husband's trial.\n\nChieftain reporter Heather Willard can be reached via email at hwillard@gannett.com or on Twitter: @HeatherDWrites.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/05/22/celebrities-mentioned-diddy-trial/83768322007/", "title": "Celebs mentioned during Diddy trial: Kid Cudi, Michael B.

But in November 2023, the gilded walls of Combs' music kingdom came crashing down.\n\nThat month, Combs' ex-girlfriend Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura Fine filed a lawsuit against him that opened the floodgates for various abuse allegations and kicked off a two-year legal saga for the former mogul.\n\nThen, in September, he was arrested by federal authorities at a Manhattan hotel. He has pleaded not guilty to his five charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution.\n\nDiddy on Trial newsletter: Step inside the courtroom with USA TODAY as Sean 'Diddy' Combs faces sex crimes and trafficking charges.\n\nEight months later, Ventura Fine is now the star witness in Combs' federal sex-crimes trial. Combs — who once claimed to be a billionaire — now spends his days in a Brooklyn prison, not his bi-coastal mansions. Gone is the glitz and glamour.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nWith Combs' trial underway, here is a look at all the Hollywood A-listers who have been name-dropped so far.\n\nCassie's friend Bana Bongolan name drops Rihanna, Beyoncé\n\nDuring June 4 testimony, Bryana \"Bana\" Bongolan, a designer and friend of Cassie Ventura Fine, said she and the singer mostly spent time together at the singer's apartment, where they would work on clothing designs, talk and use drugs.\n\nShe said there were periods when she and Ventura Fine would try to get sober. \"We wanted to do better,\" Bongolan said. But those periods didn't last. \"It's hard to get sober when there's a lot of drugs around,\" she said on the stand. Drugs that she alleged Combs provided.\n\nOn cross-examination, one of Combs' lawyers asked whether a clothing line Bongolan and Ventura Fine collaborated on failed because they were using drugs at the time. But the witness shot back they they were competing against fashion lines from fellow singers Rihanna and Beyoncé, and they weren't as famous.\n\nDiddy's ex-girlfriend Cassie was prosecutors' star witness\n\nDuring her trial testimony, Ventura Fine brought forward new details about the abuse she allegedly faced in her decadelong relationship with Combs.\n\nThe \"Me & U\" singer testified for four days the week of May 12 and laid bare the raw details of their complicated dynamic, including her alleged participation in drug-fueled sexual performances labeled \"freak offs,\" physical and emotional abuse she said she faced early on in their relationship, and violence she reportedly witnessed while in Combs' orbit.\n\nCassie Ventura takes the stand: Biggest moments from her Diddy trial testimony\n\nHer testimony also included an in-depth look at Combs' infamous assault of her at the now-closed InterContinental luxury hotel in Los Angeles, an alleged 2018 rape and her fear of leaving the Bad Boy Records founder due to potential retribution.\n\nCassie shared a makeup artist with Rihanna\n\nVentura Fine's friend and former makeup artist, Mylah Morales, took the stand in Combs' trial on May 22 to reflect on Cassie's turbulent relationship with Combs. Morales previously worked for pop star Rihanna for 13 years and during that time had other celebrity clients such as Cassie, Jennifer Lopez and even Diddy himself.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Morales was shown photographs from magazines and video shoots where she had done Ventura Fine's makeup, including stills of Cassie and Wiz Khalifa in the \"Black and Yellow\" music video, as well as a photo of Cassie, Rihanna and Ryan Leslie attending an awards show. Morales said Ventura Fine's look was \"important to her.”\n\nKid Cudi testified about Diddy allegedly breaking in, blowing up his Porsche\n\nKid Cudi took the stand in Combs' trial on May 22 to discuss his one-time fling with their shared ex-girlfriend Ventura Fine. Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi, was previously mentioned in Cassie's November 2023 lawsuit against Combs.\n\nVentura Fine previously testified that Combs allegedly blew up Cudi's car during her short-lived relationship with the \"Pursuit of Happiness\" hitmaker after Combs found out about the pairing. The \"Me & U\" singer's testimony mirrored details from her 2023 suit, which first featured the bombshell accusation.\n\nVentura Fine said Combs' violence toward her extended to others, including Cudi, whom she briefly dated in 2011 during a break in her relationship with Combs after they had musically collaborated.\n\nCudi echoed Cassie's allegation about his damaged vehicle during court testimony and leveled additional claims that Combs broke into his home and locked his dog in a bathroom. The rapper also confirmed that Ventura Fine had told him about Combs' alleged physical abuse, \"that he would hit her, sometimes kick her.\"\n\nAfter finding out about the Cudi relationship during a \"freak off\" sex session, Cassie testified that Combs attacked her. Later, she told the court that she and Cudi split because she wanted to protect the rapper.\n\nKid Cudi speaks out: What rapper revealed Cassie told him about Diddy\n\nDanity Kane member Dawn Richard claimed to have witnessed Diddy abusing Cassie\n\nAfter Ventura Fine's testimony ended May 16, former Danity Kane member Dawn Richard took the stand.\n\nRichard, discovered by Combs, was a prominent collaborator of the music mogul for a decade, including stints in the Bad Boy Records girl group and later the short-lived trio Diddy – Dirty Money.\n\nHer September lawsuit claimed Combs subjected her to physical and sexual abuse throughout their professional relationship. Combs' lawyers at the time said Richard was trying to \"rewrite history.\"\n\nRichard testified that she witnessed Combs attack Ventura Fine, discussed a suspected assault of Combs' longtime girlfriend Kimberly \"Kim\" Porter and claimed Combs threatened her and fellow Dirty Money member Kalenna Harper with statements like, \"You want to die today,\" and \"I end people.\"\n\nDawn Richard appears at Diddy trial: Danity Kane singer describes violent assault on Cassie\n\nIs Usher testifying at Diddy trial?\n\nSo far, neither prosecutors nor the defense have announced plans to call on R&B singer-songwriter Usher as a witness in Combs' trial.\n\nHowever, Usher's name was brought up during Dawn Richard's cross-examination on May 19. Richard told the court about a dinner around 2009 where she allegedly saw Combs punch Ventura Fine. She said Usher was one of the music stars in attendance.\n\nUsher and Combs have previously linked up in the studio. The two have collaborated on the songs \"I Don't Know,\" \"Better on the Other Side\" and \"Looking for Love.\"\n\nWhat is music executive Jimmy Iovine's connection to Diddy?\n\nJimmy Iovine, co-founder of Interscope Records, has not appeared at Combs' trial, but the music executive has been referenced in court testimony.\n\nDuring Diddy — Dirty Money alum Dawn Richard's cross-examination on May 19, Richard said Iovine was present at a dinner party around 2009, during which Combs allegedly punched Ventura Fine. Interscope Records co-distributed Diddy — Dirty Money's 2010 album \"Last Train to Paris\" alongside Bad Boy Records.\n\nDuring her May 27 testimony, Capricorn Clark – a personal assistant who worked in various other roles for Combs and his businesses from 2004 to 2012, then again in 2016 – mentioned Iovine.\n\nAs told the court that as she sought a new job, Combs tried to blackball her. She alleged that she met with Iovine for what she thought was a job opportunity, but the co-founder of Interscope Records and Beats Electronics, among others, gave her a warning on Combs' behalf.\n\n\"They were there to tell me to leave Puff alone and that this wasn’t going to end well for me,\" Clark said.\n\nBritney Spears, Dallas Austin attended Cassie's birthday party\n\nIn court, Ventura Fine detailed the A-list attendees at her 21st birthday party, which included pop princess Britney Spears and hit producer Dallas Austin.\n\nVentura Fine told the court that the \"Toxic\" hitmaker wasn't there because of her: \"That was all him. I didn't know them.\" The real reason why Austin's name was on the questionnaire given to potential jurors is unknown, but he previously dated Combs' ex Porter, who died of pneumonia in 2018.\n\nCassie once linked to 'Sinners' star Michael B. Jordan\n\nDuring her May 15 testimony, Ventura Fine touched on a connection to actor Michael B. Jordan as Combs' attorneys scrutinized her relationships with other men.\n\nVentura Fine said Combs suspected that she was in a relationship with the Emmy-nominated actor after the pair broke up in 2015, per Fox News. At the time of their split, the singer-actress was filming a movie in South Africa. (Cassie starred in the musical drama \"Honey 3: Dare to Dance,\" which was set in South Africa and reportedly concluded filming in December 2015.)\n\nWhen asked about Combs' reaction to an alleged relationship with Jordan, Ventura Fine said she \"wasn't there to see it,\" according to NBC News, but added that Combs attempted to get in contact with her.\n\nVentura Fine's former friend, Kerry Morgan, on May 19 confirmed Cassie \"had started talking to Michael B. Jordan before she went to South Africa.\"\n\n\"She was speaking to Michael B. Jordan,\" Morgan said. \"They were not together, and (Combs) was jealous ... She was trying to leave (Combs).\"\n\nThen on May 29, Ventura Fine's friend and former stylist, Deonte Nash, told the court: \"Yes, I did hook her up with Michael B. Jordan.\" Nash clarified that Cassie was \"somewhat\" pursuing dating Jordan. They were \"dating, talking and getting to know each other.\"\n\nDiddy trial: Cassie testifies about Michael B. Jordan relationship\n\nDid Cassie Ventura cheat on Diddy with Chris Brown?\n\nAn alleged incident between Ventura Fine and R&B singer-songwriter Chris Brown was referenced during Combs' trial on May 16 after the rapper's lawyer Anna Estevao asked Cassie about two instances where Combs suspected she was cheating on him.\n\n\"He found out you were dancing with another person in the entertainment industry? Do you remember the incident where he suspected you of dancing with Chris Brown?\" Estevao asked of an alleged 2013 incident. Ventura Fine said she did not remember the instance, but she \"was not dancing\" with the singer.\n\nBrown and Combs have collaborated on numerous occasions, including the Diddy — Dirty Money tracks \"Yesterday\" and \"I Know.\"\n\nJurors asked about Mike Myers, Lauren London, Michelle Williams of Destiny's Child\n\nPotential jurors in the Combs trial were asked about Ventura Fine's longtime close friend and actress Lauren London, who has been vocal about Combs' support of her in the wake of the 2019 shooting death of her late partner, rapper Nipsey Hussle.\n\nVentura Fine and London frequently comment on one another's Instagram posts. London commented \"Love you guys\" with blue heart emojis on Ventura Fine's February pregnancy announcement.\n\nPotential jurors were also asked about Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams and \"Austin Powers\" star Mike Myers.x\n\nOn May 29, Combs' former assistant Mia – using a pseudonym to protect her privacy – mentioned she'd been Myers' personal assistant before working for Combs.\n\nDiddy feuds with 50 Cent, Suge Knight brought up during trial\n\nCapricorn Clark, Combs' former assistant, told jurors on May 27 that she had a connection to one of Combs' foes, Suge Knight, who is the father of her best friend's children. The connection apparently sowed distrust in their professional relationship, she said.\n\nOn Clark's very first day of work, Combs took her to Central Park after 9 p.m. with his bodyguard, \"Uncle Pauly,\" Clark said, alleging he \"told me he didn't know I had anything to do with Suge Knight and if anything happened, he would have to kill me.\"\n\nShe also recalled an instance early on while working for Combs, when she accompanied him to do press at MTV and overheard him tell his security guard that he didn't like nonsense and people, but he did \"like guns.\" Clark told jurors that 50 Cent was at MTV that day and Combs \"had an issue with 50 Cent.\"\n\n50 Cent, Diddy fights spill into court as former assistant reveals long-running feud\n\nVentura Fine previously referenced the music mogul's longstanding feud with Suge Knight, as she took the witness stand and spoke about weapons allegedly stored in Combs' homes. On May 13, Ventura Fine testified that Combs left his Los Angeles house after being tipped off by a bodyguard that Knight was at a diner nearby.\n\nAt the time of Combs' departure, Ventura Fine said she told Combs, \"Please don't do anything stupid\" as she screamed and cried in fear.\n\nDiddy security guard 'D-Roc' was in car when childhood friend Biggie died\n\nA name that has been repeatedly mentioned in court is Combs' security guard \"D-Roc,\" whose real name is Damion Butler. Butler was once aligned with another famous rap figure: Christopher \"The Notorious B.I.G.\" Wallace, who was his childhood friend.\n\nBefore his 1997 drive-by shooting death, Wallace was signed to Combs' Bad Boy Records. D-Roc was also in the car when Biggie was shot dead, according to a 2022 book \"It Was All a Dream: Biggie and the World That Made Him.\"\n\nThe 2021 Netflix documentary \"Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell\" features never-before-seen footage filmed by Butler.\n\nBefore her February death, Biggie's mom Voletta Wallace told Rolling Stone she wanted to \"slap\" Combs in May 2024 after footage of Combs' hotel assault of Ventura Fine surfaced.\n\nBiggie's longtime friend D-Roc on why he 'trusted' Netflix doc's filmmaker with unseen footage\n\nEx-assistant said Diddy attacked Cassie at Prince's house party\n\nDuring her May 29 testimony, the prosecution asked Mia about a party that took place at the late musician Prince's house around 2011 or 2012.\n\nMia said she'd convinced Ventura Fine to go to the \"intimate\" party despite Combs' instructions for them to stay home. At the event, they danced, hung out with friends and Prince performed on a table. But when Mia spotted Combs walking in, she and Ventura Fine \"booked it\" outside the house.\n\nHowever, she said, \"Puff caught up to Cass and had her on the ground.\" He started to attack her, but Prince’s security intervened; the next day, she was allegedly told Combs was suspending her without pay due to \"being insubordinate.\"\n\nWhy was former President Barack Obama mentioned in Diddy trial?\n\nWhile on the stand May 20, former Combs staffer David James testified that he once retrieved ecstasy from the embattled mogul's medicine bag for one of his friends.\n\nJames said the rapper had several different types of ecstasy pills, including \"one in the shape of a former president's face,\" later clarifying that the pill was shaped like former President Barack Obama.\n\nContributing: Marina Pitofsky, Aysha Bagchi, Patrick Ryan, Taijuan Moorman, KiMi Robinson and Anna Kaufman, USA TODAY\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced sexual violence, RAINN’s National Sexual Assault Hotline offers free, confidential, 24/7 support in English and Spanish via chat and at 800-656-4673.

The Dispatch has been covering the trial since its start and updating this blog with happenings of note.\n\nJudge denies motion for mistrial; jury has begun deliberations\n\nFranklin County Common Pleas Judge Michael Holbrook told prosecution and defense attorneys Tuesday morning that he had reviewed a defense motion to a declare a mistrial over alleged \"burden-shifting\" comments made during closing arguments by the prosecution on Monday, but ruled that it didn't warrant a mistrial.\n\nHolbrook said he understood the concerns from Husel attorney Jose Baez related to shifting the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense. But he didn't receive any further evidence including emails that both sides were invited to submit Monday.\n\nFollowing brief jury instructions that included advising the jury they could consider murder or attempted murder charges against Husel in each of the 14 patient deaths provided they believe the prosecution provided intent, Holbrook excused the jury to begin their deliberations at 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe jury was told they could deliberate until 5 p.m. each day as they have been appearing for court during the trial or they could go longer into the evening if they wish, but they will not be sequestered until they reach a verdict. It appears the jurors will maintain a Monday to Thursday schedule for deliberations and go home with the judge's admonishment that they not discuss the case with anyone or view or listen to any media coverage.\n\n- Dean Narciso\n\nDid the prosecution engage in 'burden-shifting'? Defense thinks so\n\nIn a development late Monday afternoon after the closing arguments concluded and the jury was dismissed, Jose Baez, lead defense attorney for former Mount Carmel Health doctor William Husel, called for a mistrial after accusing the Franklin County prosecution of \"burden-shifting\" in its closing arguments and rebuttal.\n\nBurden-shifting is when one party in a trial attempts to shift the burden of proof by making a so-called \"argument from ignorance\" in which something is assumed to be true because it has not yet been proven false, or it is assumed false because it has not yet been proven true.\n\nIn this case, the defense is arguing that the closing argument and rebuttal presented by the prosecution to the jury Monday attempted to shift the burden of proof on the defense. By law, a defendant in a criminal matter is presumed innocent until the prosecution provides sufficient evidence to a jury to prove the defendant guilty.\n\nFranklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Holbrook indicated he expected to receive arguments from both sides Monday night by email. The matter is expected to come up Tuesday morning before the jury would be brought into court again.\n\nIf the request is rejected, the judge will proceed with instructing the jury before they go into deliberations.\n\nHolbrook ruled earlier that the jury may now consider the lesser charge of attempted murder as well as murder in each of the 14 counts, though conviction of either charge would require that the prosecution prove Husel intended to kill the patients involved.\n\nJudge rules jury may consider attempted murder charge; closing arguments underway\n\nCommon Pleas Court Judge Michael Holbrook ruled Monday that the jury may consider a lesser charge of attempted murder instead of murder when it begins deliberating, provided it believes the prosecution has proven intent by the former doctor to kill his patients.\n\nClosing arguments began this morning with the prosecution and were expected to take up most of the day, Holbrook said.\n\n\"What did he intend to do when he administered those doses,\" Franklin County assistant prosecutor David Zeyen told the jury to ask themselves of former Mount Carmel doctor William Husel's decisions to order up to 10 times higher doses than typical of fentanyl, along with other painkillers, for his dying patients.\n\n\"You've got to get in his mind ... You have to figure it out from all the facts and circumstances.\"\n\nZeyen was the first to consolidate five weeks of testimony and rebuttal into 2 1/2 hours of closing arguments Monday morning. Husel's defense team will present their closings this afternoon,\n\nCommon Pleas Court Judge Michael Holbrook ruled Monday that the jury may consider a lesser charge of attempted murder instead of murder when it begins deliberating, provided it believes the prosecution has proven intent by the former doctor to kill his patients.\n\nThe closings come after four delays last week, setbacks that mean that 11 days of being \"on ice,\" as Holbrook called the jury's idle time, will have passed between when the defense rested its case and when the jury begins deliberations.\n\nSome of the delay is related to attempts by Husel attorney Jose Baez to disqualify Holbrook. That filing on Tuesdwas denied by Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor,\n\nBefore anything began, Holbrook told attorneys from both sides that one of the 12 jurors was going to be replaced with an alternate.\n\nOver the weekend, \"Clearly he was paying attention to the media,\" Holbrook said.\n\nMore than 40 people were in the gallery, most of them packed in benches behind Husel's defense team.\n\nZeyen told the jury that Ohio law doesn't allow doctors to kill or hasten the deaths of even dying patients.\n\n\"That is what you do to sick animals,\" he said. \"That's fine in veterinary science. That is not fine in the ICU at Mount Carmel.\"\n\nThe defense arguments are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m., to be followed by a rebuttal argument by prosecutors.\n\nAfter closing arguments are completed, the jury will get instructions from Holbrook and then begin deliberations. That may not occur until Tuesday because closings were expected to take most if not all of the day Monday.\n\nClosing arguments were expected to begin April 4, but were delayed 3 times\n\nAfter the defense rested its case Thursday, March 31 after calling only one witness, Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Holbrook scheduled closing arguments in the case to begin at 9 a.m. Monday, April 4.\n\nOn Friday, April 1, however, Holbrook's office moved the start of closing arguments to Tuesday, April 2, explaining the delay was due to \"legal matters.\" They were delayed again two more times before beginning Monday, April 11.\n\nWhy the delay in closing arguments in the William Husel trial? What we now know\n\nHusel trial: It's easier to remove judge in Florida than Ohio\n\nJudge denies defense motion for acquittal\n\nDefense attorney Jaime Lapidus made a \"Rule 29 motion\" on Tuesday, March 29, asking Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Michael Holbrook to acquit former doctor William Husel on all 14 murder counts against him.\n\nThe motion is standard in criminal trials after the prosecution rests its case. In his argument, Lapidus said the 14 patients Husel is accused of killing by allegedly hastening their deaths with large doses of fentanyl suffered from a variety of other medical conditions that caused their deaths, rather than the fentanyl.\n\n\"Absent these medications, the state has not proven that these patients would not have died once the life support is turned off,\" Lapidus said in his more than 20-minute argument before Judge Holbrook.\n\nLapidus also said the prosecution had not proven that Husel had any motive for taking the lives of the patients. Prosecutors are not required under Ohio law to prove a motive.\n\nAssistant Franklin County Prosecutor David Zeyen responded that the sole evidentiary issue in dispute is Husel's intention when ordering the doses.\n\n\"He came up with this on his own,\" Zeyen said of Husel's high dosing habits. \"Nobody else is doing this.\n\n\"This is about speeding people along as they're dying,\" Zeyen said. \"You can't metaphorically step on their neck and speed it along so the family feels it was peaceful.\"\n\nZeyen also addressed what the defense has stated is Husel's motive, saying even if Husel was acting out of what he believed to be compassion and mercy, his actions were still illegal under Ohio law.\n\n\"Even if Dr. Husel had in his mind a pure motive, you still cannot purposefully cause the death of a dying person,\" Zeyen said. \"Not every one of them had to die that night.\"\n\nHolbrook denied the defense motion on all 14 counts. Following his ruling, the attorneys had arguments behind closed doors related to the testimony of defense witness Dr. Joel Zivot, who is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, March 30, as the defense presents its ca.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nProsecution formally rests their case\n\nAt 9:50 a.m. Tuesday, March 29, Assistant Franklin County Prosecutor David Zeyen stood before Judge Michael Holbrook and announced:\n\n\"For the record, your honor, the State of Ohio rests.\"\n\nAfter calling 53 witnesses, including loved ones of all 14 patients involved in the case, prosecutors rested their case-in-chief. The remainder of Tuesday, March 29, is expected to involve arguments and rulings on multiple motions pending before Holbrook, including motions to exclude testimony from three defense experts.\n\nEarlier Tuesday morning, March 29, Brian Mollette, the son of Danny Mollette, testified as the final witness for the state. The younger Mollette said Husel had approached his family on Dec. 5, 2017, told them his father was \"severely brain damaged or dead\" and that his organs were failing.\n\n\"We decided to put it in God's hands,\" the younger Mollette testified.\n\nThe jury was dismissed for the day following Mollette's testimony. The defense will begin calling witnesses for their case on Wednesday morning, March 30.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nProsecution expected to call final witness Tuesday morning\n\nAfter calling 52 witnesses, prosecutors intend to call their last witness Tuesday morning, March 29, believed to be a family member of one of the 14 patients former Mount Carmel Health doctor William Husel is accused of killing.\n\nFranklin County prosecutors said Monday, March 28, that they then intend to rest their case-in-chief.\n\nThree family members of alleged victims testified Monday. One of those family members, James D. Allen, the son of James G. Allen, testified that the family had asked for Husel to wait about 20 minutes to withdraw care from the elder Allen because he would be celebrating his 81st birthday on May 29, 2018.\n\n\"We wasn't given a choice,\" the younger Allen testified.\n\nHusel told the family that \"his experience\" told him the elder Allen would pass quickly and wouldn't suffer. A dose of 1,000 micrograms of fentanyl was given to the elder Allen.\n\nThe younger Allen engaged in a testy cross-examination with defense attorney Diane Menashe, who has been questioning many of the family members in the case.\n\nFamily members of Bonnie Austin and Sandra Castle also testified on Monday.\n\nAfter the prosecution's final witness on Tuesday morning, Judge Michael Holbrook and the attorneys are expected to debate a number of motions outside the jury's presence. The defense is likely to verbally ask for the case to be dismissed, which is standard procedure in criminal cases after the prosecution rests, in what is called a Rule 29 motion.\n\nOther motions that will be discussed involve the prosecution's request for the dismissal of three of the defense's expert witnesses. The prosecution will be able to call rebuttal witnesses after the defense rests their case.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nFamily member accused of tampering with pill bottle evidence during testimony\n\nOn Monday morning, March 28, the daughter of one of the 14 patients former doctor William Husel is accused of killing was accused of tampering with evidence while she testified on the stand last week.\n\nThe issue was raised before the jury was brought into the courtroom.\n\nBeverly Leonhard, daughter of Melissa Penix, was handed a pill bottle by Assistant Franklin County Prosecutor Janet Grubb during her testimony on Wednesday afternoon, March 23. The bottle was for a morphine prescription Penix was given about three weeks before her death in November 2018.\n\nSomeone watching a video feed of the trial sent emails to Husel's defense team and Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook stating that while on the stand, Leonhard appeared to peel something off the label of the pill bottle and then placed the pill bottle on a low ledge inside the witness stand, outside the view of anyone in the courtroom for several seconds. She then put the bottle back up on a ledge where it could be seen.\n\nHolbrook said he received an email Sunday, March 27, from someone concerned about Leonhard's actions. Attorneys for Husel said they also received an email from the same person. The prosecution was not emailed.\n\nA clip from the livestream video feed of the trial was played in the courtroom. Holbrook said the video did appear to show something was peeled off the label on the pill bottle, but he said he did not know what it was.\n\nHusel's attorneys have requested that Leonhard's testimony be stricken from the record for tampering with evidence.\n\nGrubb argued that the prosecution has photographs of the pill bottle that could be supplemented into evidence to show what was on the bottle before Leonhard handed it. He said those questions about the bottle could be stricken, while allowing the remainder of Leonhard's testimony to be considered by the jury.\n\nHolbrook did not immediately rule on whether the jury would be told to disregard the testimony, but apparently later decided against the defense motion to do so.\n\nLeonhard was in the courtroom on Monday morning, March 28, while the issue was discussed and the video was played.\n\nAfter the jury had left for the day on Monday, March 28, defense attorney Diane Menashe said she had subpoenaed Leonhard to testify as a witness during the defense's case. Holbrook has not yet rendered a decision on how the situation will be handled, but said Menashe was able to subpoena Leonhard.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nProsecutors challenge third defense expert\n\nIn a third motion filed Friday, March 25, prosecutors asked Holbrook to exclude the testimony of Dr. James Claude Upshaw Downs, a forensic pathology consultant who also is the medical director for physicians assistants at Charleston Southern University in South Carolina.\n\nThe motion said Downs has no experience in providing palliative or end-of-life care and any testimony he provided about dosing, medications, end-of-life decisions or timing would violate Ohio's evidence rules.\n\n\"Dr. Downs admits in his report that 'the propriety of medication use, dosing, and scheduling' is more appropriately ascertained by 'active practitioners' in the field,\" the motion said. \"Dr. Downs is not an active practitioner in this field. His lack of expertise in this area makes any opinion he offers on this topic unreliable.\"\n\nProsecutors want two defense experts disqualified\n\nThe prosecution team filed a motion on Wednesday afternoon, March 23, and another on Thursday, March 24, seeking to disqualify and exclude the testimony of two witnesses that former doctor William Husel's defense team had planned to call to testify.\n\nThe first motion asks Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Michael Holbrook to bar testimony from Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor and senior member of the Department of Anesthesiology and Surgery at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, saying Zivot violated state legal procedure and relied on improper information to form his opinion.\n\nIn its motion, the prosecution said Zivot \"improperly bases his conclusions\" regarding Husel's care on conversations with Husel, which Zivot references in an affidavit attached to the motion.\n\n\"The Ohio Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that expert witnesses are not permitted to opine on the credibility of individuals,\" the motion said. \"Dr. Zivot is relying upon Defendant's out of court statements to which no hearsay exception applies. Dr. Zivot's opinion on Defendant's intent must therefore be excluded.\"\n\nThe prosecution said they were not able to bring the motion sooner because Husel's defense team had not provided the state with the names or reports of their expert witnesses prior to trial, as is typically required. The motion also says having Zivot testify would \"blatantly\" violate Ohio's rules of evidence for criminal trials.\n\n\"Whether this was done out of strategy or ignorance does not matter and does not make it any less improper,\" the prosecution's motion states.\n\nThe second motion seeks to exclude the testimony of Guorang Patel, a pharmacy supervisor from Chicago, saying if Patel were to be allowed to testify he would be \"offering opinions outside of the area of (his) expertise\" which is barred by Ohio's evidence rules.\n\nIn the 51-page motion, prosecutors cite 12 examples of Patel's testimony in a civil deposition related to more than 30 lawsuits filed against Husel in which Patel deferred to a physician's expertise in dosing, end-of-life care and decisions, as well as what caused a patient's death. Those same areas of testimony are what Patel is expected to be called to testify to in the criminal case, prosecutors said in the motion.\n\n\"Setting aside the ethical concerns of knowingly proffering an unqualified opinion, it is self-evident that Mr. Patel is not qualified to opine on the issues contained in this section of his report,\" the motion said, noting that Patel's testimony as an expert was also excluded from a trial in Illinois.\n\n\"Mr. Patel’s expert report (in the Husel case) offers no explanation for how he can reliably opine on cause of death or rule out potential causes of death with his training and experience as a pharmacist,\" the motion said. \"His deposition testimony makes it clear that he recognizes he is unable to reliably do so. It is abundantly clear that Mr. Patel lacks the qualifications to reliably opine on any issues of causation in this case.\"\n\nLawyers from both sides met in chambers with Judge Holbrook after testimony for the week concluded Thursday. Afterwards, Holbrook said that hey had discussed the two motions and other ways to expedite the pace of the trial.\n\nHolbrook said a third motion would be filed sometime Friday, March 25, but would not say by which side or about what, only that it would likely make the issue more complicated.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nWednesday, March 24 afternoon update\n\nBeverly Leonhard recalled having a normal breakfast with her mom, Melissa Penix on Nov. 15, 2018.\n\nBut shortly afterwards, her 82-year-old mom complained of stomach pain, and went to the living room to sit down.\n\n\"I laid down on the couch and put my head on her lap,\" Leonhard recalled.\n\nIt would be one of the last normal mother-daughter moments she would recall having.\n\nHer mom began having shortness of breath and had to be taken to Mount Carmel West hospital's emergency room.\n\nFive days later, after daily visits from her family, Leonhard again lay her head on her mother and grasped her hand.\n\nOnly this time, Melissa Penix's body was lifeless.\n\nLeonhard has been in court for Husel's trial every day but one, often taking notes, glancing occasionally at Husel and his wife.\n\nShe had earlier told a Dispatch reporter that not all of his patients should have died the way they did, including her mother.\n\nPenix wasn't a complainer, Leonhard testified. And her mother didn't until she arrived at the hospital and was admitted into the intensive care unit, where back pain, overheating and thirst took hold.\n\n\"She's literally begging for water,\" Leonhard testified. But nurses declined because Penix was connected to oxygen equipment.\n\nOn the last of of her five days at Mount Carmel, Penix was placed on a ventilator.\n\nJanet Grubb, an assistant county prosecutor, asked Leonhard if she had had end-of-life discussions with her month.\n\n\"Just that she would never ever want to live on a ventilator,\" Leonhard replied.\n\nWhen the hospital later called about her mother's decline, she returned quickly, walking into her mom's room.\n\n\"I remember looking up at the monitors to see her blood pressure and nothing was on.\" A syringe was going into her elbow, she testified.\n\n\"Who was applying that syringe,\" Grubb asked.\n\nShe said it was Husel, recalling a tattoo on his arm.\n\nLeonhard had been told there was virtually no chance of survival, and she said she wondered aloud, \"If there's no hope, why was something being put in her arm when I walked in?\"\n\nShe said Husel replied, \"Oh, we never stop trying.\"\n\nAfter being asked to step out for a few minutes, Leonhard said she was allowed to return to her mom's room. Tubes had been removed. The monitors were quiet.\n\n\"I remember putting my head on her chest and rubbing her hand,\" she said. But Penix was dead.\n\nHusel never discussed pain medication with her or her relatives, Leonhard testified.\n\nAs Leonhard spoke to the jury, Penix's husband, other relatives and their attorney in a civil lawsuit, listened.\n\nLater that year, Leonhard testified, Mount Carmel Health called.\n\n\"My understanding was that my mom had been overdosed,\" she testified of that conversation.\n\nOn cross-examination, Husel defense attorney Diane Menashe asked about all the testimony Leonhard has heard and medical records that were reviewed while she was sitting in the courtroom listening before she was called as a prosecution witness.\n\n\"You've heard it all, right? And your (civil) lawsuit is still pending?\" Menashe asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Leonhard replied.\n\nMenashe pressed Leonhard about her mom's declining health, and Penix's inability to walk more than a few feet prior to being hospitalized.\n\nShe asked if Leonhard would be surprised to know that her mother's pneumonia was in both lungs and all lobes, not just one side, as she testified.\n\n\"Yes, I would be very surprised,\" Leonhard replied.\n\nMenashe also asserted that many others at Mount Carmel had contact with the family, including a pastor, not just Husel as Leonhard had testified.\n\n\"My mom was a very spiritual person who read the Bible daily,\" Leonhard said.\n\n- Dean Narciso\n\nWednesday, March 23 afternoon update\n\nAttorney Diane Menashe, a member of former doctor William Husel's defense team, continued Wednesday to attack the credibility of Dr. John Schweiger, a critical care and anesthesia expert witness for the prosecution, about errors found in his reports and inconsistencies in his testimony during his full day of testimony on Tuesday.\n\nEach of the 14 patients Husel is charged with killing was placed on a ventilator and later withdrawn by the former Mount Carmel West doctor, who worked third shift in the hospital's intensive care unit. Menashe noted that other Mount Carmel doctors had reported that several of the 14 patients had little, if any, chance of survival, prior to coming under Husel's care.\n\nSchweiger testified that each of the 14 would have survived, for either minutes, hours or days, if not for Husel removing them from ventilators while prescribing high doses of fentanyl or other opioids.\n\nIn one case, a Husel colleague noted that surgery was not recommended for a patient with a severe brain hemorrhage.\n\nUnder questioning, Schweiger said he has testified in 35 civil trials. This is his first criminal trial.\n\nSchweiger had testified that most of Husel's patients and relatives had inadequate consultation with Husel and other staff about end of life decisions, but Menashe noted that other doctors or spiritual care personnel had met with patient families prior to Husel's involvement.\n\nMenashe asked Schweiger if he agreed that giving pain medication to a dying patient, even if that results in death, is part of the doctrine of double effect, which is one of Husel's defenses. He agreed.\n\nIn summary, Menashe asked Schweiger if any of his patient review reports had included anything that Husel had done to assist patients and save their lives up until their deaths.\n\n\"That was not the focus of my report, to include interventions,\" Schweiger said.\n\nFranklin County Judge Michael Holbrook again updated attorneys after an assistant prosecutor had tested positive for COVID-19. He cautioned jurors to be mindful of their health.\n\n\"I don't think you guys are in danger right now, but we have to be careful,\" he said. \"This isn't time to be proud or hide things,\" he told jurors on Tuesday.\n\nTwo jurors have not been vaccinated and a juror testing positive could delay the trial by 10 days, Holbrook said.\n\nTuesday, March 22 afternoon update\n\nAfter reviewing ten sets of patient records, Dr. John Schweiger, an intensive-care specialist and expert on anesthesia from Tampa, Florida, testified that Husel overprescribed fentanyl to each critically ill patient, intending to hasten their deaths.\n\nIn addition, he said, Husel should have had better contact with a team of peers such as family doctors or oncologists, not have removed breathing tubes before trying to stabilize the patients and had \"no medical justification\" for the large amounts of fentanyl and other opioids he ordered and had administered.\n\nHe also torpedoed one of Husel's main defenses, that harmful effects from medical treatment is permissible if it occurs as a side effect of a beneficial treatment — even if it results in death. The ethical concept is known as the doctrine of double effect.\n\nIn one patient analysis, Schweiger, who is being paid $550 per hour as an expert witness, said that Husel not only provided Joanne Bellisari's 10 times more fentanyl than appropriate, but also could have prolonged her life by not removing her breathing tube.\n\n\"There appears to be a relatively quick determination\" to remove her breathing tube, Schweiger testified, stating that there was a \"lack of formal consultation\" to do so with Mount Carmel hospital staff and Bellisari's family.\n\n\"I don't believe that all medical intervention had been exhausted,\" Schweiger said of Bellisari's case.\n\nAll of the patients suffered dire medical complications, from drug overdoses and heart disease to cancer and infections.\n\nBellisari, 69, had chronic kidney disease, pneumonia, septic shock and a lung tumor when admitted on April 22, 2015.\n\nSchweiger said that Bellisari's pain was being treated well in the 2 1/2 weeks she was hospitalized. and that the decision to remove her from life support was premature. \"I didn't see that death was imminent,\" he testified.\n\nSchweiger said that if he had given any fentanyl at all, it would have been no more than 100 micrograms, or one-tenth of what Husel ordered injected at 11:32 p.m. on May 10. Bellisari died eight minutes later.\n\nJanet Grubb, a Franklin County assistant prosecutor, asked if Husel's actions were protected by the concept of double effect.\n\nNo, Schweiger testified, explaining: \"You can cure cancer by giving a patient cyanide,\" but there has to be a \"concept of moderation or proportionality.\"\n\nBecause most of the patients had no apparent pain, the opioids were unecessary, he said.\n\nSchweiger said that the only plausible explanation for Husel's courses of treatment would be to expedite Bellisari's death.\n\n\"That is, in fact, what occurred,\" he said.\n\nSchweiger's analysis of Bellisari's care by Husel took about an hour.\n\nIn each, he said that Husel should have had better contact with a team of peers such as family doctors or oncologists, removed breathing tubes too hastily and had \"no medical justification\" other than hastening death for the large amounts of fentany and other opioids he ordered and administered.\n\nIn addition, Schweiger said that each patient should have been stabilized and a course of treatment planned for the next day.\n\nDuring a short break, Husel attorney Jose Baez objected to Judge Michael Holbrook about Grubb describing the case as \"murder\" loudly enough for the jury to hear.\n\n\"That's why we're all here, for a murder trial,\" Grubb said.\n\nBaez told Holbrook that Grubb's conduct was inappropriate. He said Grubb's remark was \"unnecessary commentary ... solely for shock appeal,\" and shouldn't be allowed because it would prejudice the jury.\n\nHolbrook responded that Grubb had said \"alleged murder\" to describe what the trial was about. But he told the prosecution, \"I would ask that the state not highlight it on every count.\"\n\nAnd assistant prosecutor David Zeyen asked Holbrook for permission to ask Schweiger questions related to Husel being reckless, proposing \"If it's not purposeful, is it at least reckless.\"\n\nHusel attorney Diane Menashe objected saying that the case is built around allegations of intentional murder.\n\nHolbrook agreed saying that the question would not be relevant.\n\nAt the end of the day, he announced that an assistant prosecutor had tested positive for COVID-19 and cautioned jurors to be mindful of their health.\n\n\"I don't think you guys are in danger right now, but we have to be careful,\" he said. \"This isn't time to be proud or hide things.\"\n\n-Dean Narciso\n\nMonday, March 21 afternoon update\n\nA Florida-based medical intensive care expert discussed the \"sacred oath\" of putting the patient's wishes first, while giving an overview of basic care for critically ill patients and recommended dosing of fentanyl\n\nFor about three hours, Franklin County Assistant Prosecutor Janet Grubb asked Dr. John Schweiger to explain CPR, brain function, respiration and dangers of high or low acid levels in the body.\n\nSchweiger later testified about research showing that combining fentanyl and other opioids was dangerous and another study indicating that muscle rigidity occurred with 1,000 microgram fentanyl doses, causing patients to struggle to breathe.\n\nHusel prescribed doses up to 2,000 micrograms.\n\nAsked if it was appropriate to accommodate families of patients who \"just wanted it over\" for their loved one. Schweiger said the goal of providing comfort care is to treat the patient, not \"doing it for the family.\"\n\nUltimately, he said, medication should be used carefully, based on the patient's history, \"to provide pain relief, anxiety relief and then to let the natural dying process to continue.\"\n\nHe testified that he rarely uses fentanyl, except in cancer patients at Tampa General Hospital where he works. Those patients have typically built an immunity. And when he does, he administers oses no greater than 250 micrograms.\n\n- Dean Narciso\n\nMonday, March 21 morning update\n\nIt's a striking example of a story being told in different ways.\n\nChristine Allison and her 44-year-old husband had been at home watching TV when he began hyperventilating July 15, 2018. She offered him a bag to breathe into and the issue subsided. Still, paramedics called earlier suggested he be checked at the hospital.\n\nAllison's daughter, Mariah Havens, had previously testified that she arrived at the hospital prior to her mom.\n\nAllison had been treated in the emergency room, and had been sent to a critical care room when his health declined.\n\nMrs. Allison testified that Husel approached her at one point and said \"I'm 99.9% sure that he's brain dead and that his organs have failed.\n\n\"I'm going to pull the tube and give him something to make him comfortable.\"\n\nAllison said she was never told about that day's hospital test results, including a CT scan, and she said she was confused about Husel's bluntness.\n\n\"You take tests to verify it right?\" she testified. \"You don't go by what you think.\"\n\nShe testified that within a few minutes, the curtain was opened in the ICU room and her husband was dead.\n\n\"I looked at Mariah and said \"We didn't see his last breath,\" Allison testified. \"I've seen a person die before and it wasn't like that. I was so confused.\"\n\nAbout five months later, a hospital official called her to discuss her husband's death.\n\nAllison testified \"The light went on and it all made sense. He told me what had happened. Troy had been given an overdose of a narcotic.\"\n\nOn cross-examination, Husel attorney Diane Menashe questioned almost everything in Allison's story, noting that Troy had had repeated visits to the hospital for a variety of medical issues including a leg wound that wouldn't heal.\n\nShe referred to notes from hospital staff asked Allison to verify that she did not want him resuscitated. That the family had gathered around him and had invited a hospital chaplain to continue praying for him. That staff had done chest compressions and other life saving measures.\n\n\"So all the notes ... all wrong,\" Menashe asked.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I did not agree with anything you said on that paper,\" Allison replied.\n\nMenashe asked if she had a \"vested interest\" in maintaining her story since she's one of several family to have sued Husel and the hospital.\n\nThat sparked an outburst.\n\n\"He killed my husband.\"\n\n\"That's your belief,\" countered Menashe.\n\n\"It's not my belief. That's what happened. I was there. You were not.\"\n\nMenashe asked about previous interviews on CNN and other news outlets and how she's watched live coverage of the trial from her home.\n\nAllison said she's committed to getting justice.\n\n\"I will tell anybody who will listen because the whole place needs to be shut down ... and that man needs to go to jail\" she said of Husel and Mount Carmel Health System.\n\nAfter her testimony, Allison told a Dispatch reporter, \"I think my emotions totally took over,\" adding \"I just wanted him (Husel) to look at me at least once. He didn't look at me.\"\n\ndnarciso@dispatch.com\n\nWednesday, March 16 update\n\nKathleen McDowell, a former nurse who worked the night shift, was asked by assistant prosecutor David Zeyen on Wednesday, March 16, about the relationship Husel had with the pharmacists at Mount Carmel West hospital. She was twice interrupted in responding by objections from defense attorney Jose Baez.\n\nAfter Judge Michael Holbrook overruled both objections, McDowell replied:\n\n\"The pharmacist would tell him not to use certain drugs or don't use this much, and he would tell them OK and just say, 'I'll do what I want to do, give what I want to give.'\"\n\nMcDowell testified that she was involved with the palliative extubation of Corrinnia Blake, who died at the hospital on Sept. 17, 2018, after being given 500 micrograms of fentanyl. Blake was one of the 25 patients Husel was initially charged with murder in connection with her death, but that charge was among 11 murder counts the prosecution asked to be dismissed in January.\n\nMcDowell said she questioned Husel one time about his medication dosing, but never took it to her chain of command, saying she feared she could be reprimanded if she were to raise concerns with her supervisor that turned out to be wrong.\n\nHusel was described by McDowell as breeding a boys club culture of a boys club and having a \"bromance\" with male nurses in the hospital's intensive care unit. She testified that Husel favored several of the nurses who have already testified in the trial, and would \"put the boys against each other.\"\n\nWhen Baez cross-examined McDowell, he asked her about her decisions to hire a criminal defense attorney three days after being interviewed by Columbus police homicide detectives and to agree to a formal proffer of information to former Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien.\n\nMcDowell is the only nurse that has testified thus far who has acknowledged hiring an attorney.\n\nBaez also questioned McDowell's motivation, asking whether she was bullied or teased by the male nurses she worked with in the ICU. McDowell said she wasn't aware of being teased.\n\n\"You like yourself a lot more than you like Dr. Husel don't you,\" Baez asked, before withdrawing the question after an objection from the prosecution.\n\nMcDowell was further questioned by Zeyen, who asked her why she became emotional after her interview with detectives and hired an attorney.\n\n\"I was terrified,\" she said.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nTuesday, March 15 update\n\nWhen Geraldine Brown took her partner's daughter, 37-year-old Brandy McDonald, to Mount Carmel West hospital on Jan. 11, 2018, Brown testified that McDonald was laughing.\n\nShe was talking. She walked herself into the hospital.\n\n\"She seemed fine to us,\" Brown said.\n\nBut three days later, Brown testified, McDonald died after being given 1,000 micrograms of fentanyl and six milligrams of the painkilling relaxer Versed, at Husel's order.\n\nMcDonald is the youngest of the 14 patients for whom Husel is on trial for murder, accused of prescribing doses of fentanyl and other painkillers that hastened their deaths.\n\nMcDonald had been taken to the hospital at the request of her primary care doctor because some bloodwork had revealed elevated liver enzymes. The doctor wanted McDonald to get checked out to be safe, Brown said, since McDonald had been battling ovarian cancer for several years and was undergoing treatment with an experimental medication.\n\nAfter two days in the hospital, in which McDonald was speaking to her family members by phone and visiting in person, McDonald had insisted that her family members leave the hospital on Jan. 13, 2018, because it was snowing.\n\nIt was the last conversation she'd have with her loved ones.\n\nA few hours later, between midnight and 1 a.m. on Jan. 14, 2018, Brown said McDonald's mother received a phone call that McDonald had gone into respiratory distress and was placed on a ventilator.\n\nOnce McDonald's family and friends had gathered at the hospital, Brown said a meeting was had with a doctor — she didn't remember if it was Husel in particular — about removing life support.\n\n\"Her mom and dad didn't believe she wanted to live on a ventilator,\" Brown said.\n\n\"Did the doctor inform you Brandy would be given 1,000 micrograms of fentanyl,\" Assistant Franklin County Prosecutor Taylor Mick asked.\n\n\"No,\" Brown replied.\n\nThe family stepped out of McDonald's hospital room while medical staff extubated her from the ventilator and then \"went right back in,\" Brown said.\n\n\"It seemed like it only took 10, 15 minutes\" for McDonald to die, Brown said.\n\nAt no time during her hospital stay did McDonald appear to be in pain and her family never requested pain medication for McDonald, Brown testified.\n\nAbout a year after McDonald's death, Brown said the hospital contacted McDonald's family, followed by a call and interviews with Columbus police. McDonald's family has filed a civil lawsuit against Husel and the hospital system, which is still pending.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nMonday, March 14 afternoon update\n\nProsecutors said Monday afternoon they could rest their \"case in chief\" as early as next week. The case in chief refers to the party in a trial with the burden of proof — in this case, the prosecution — presenting its evidence.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of testimony Monday, Assistant Franklin County Prosecutor Janet Grubb said the prosecution has another expert witness set to testify on Monday and Tuesday of next week, but \"would like to finish early next week if at all possible.\"\n\nShould the prosecution rest their main case, Husel's defense team would begin calling their witnesses to testify in the case. Prosecutors would have the chance to call rebuttal witnesses after the defense rests their case.\n\nFamily members of the 14 people Husel is charged with murder for allegedly hastening their deaths, are expected to begin testifying this week.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nMonday, March 14 morning update\n\nNurse Jacob Deemer testified Monday that he sought clarification from Husel about doses of 1,000 micrograms of fentanyl for three patients the pair treated together in the intensive care unit at Mount Carmel West.\n\nDeemer, who described Husel as approachable and willing to pass on his knowledge to nurses and other personnel working in the ICU, said he wanted to understand Husel's mindset for ordering 1,000 microgram doses for Danny Mollette, James Allen and James Timmons.\n\n\"Anytime there's a new order placed, I want a contextual reason,\" Deemer said.\n\nDeemer also testified about Timmons' death on Oct. 24, 2018. He said minutes after administering the 1,000-microgram dose as instructed by Husel, Timmons' brother called for Husel and Deemer to \"do something\" because Timmons was \"in pain.\"\n\nTimmons was turning \"grayish-blue,\" had what appeared to be foam at the mouth and was breathing in a way that indicated distress, Deemer testified.\n\nOn cross-examination, however, Deemer acknowledged those details were not included in the medical report.\n\nAdditional morphine and benzodiazepines were given to Timmons at that time, Deemer said.\n\nDuring his testimony, Deemer also said he alerted the hospital pharmacy on at least two occasions about high doses of fentanyl that were set to be administered.\n\nDeemer was placed on administrative leave during a Mount Carmel investigation into Husel's conduct and resigned his position in January 2019.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nThursday, March 10 afternoon update\n\nAt the end of his testimony Thursday afternoon, Dr. Wes Ely, a physician and medical instructor at Vanderbilt University was asked about the large dosages of fentanyl and other painkiller medication ordered by Husel for 14 patients.\n\n\"There's no other reason to give those doses unless you're trying to end the life of the person,\" Ely said in of Husel patient Joanne Bellisari.\n\n\"The same explanation goes for (Husel patient) Ryan Hayes?\" asked Assistant Franklin County Prosecutor Paula Sawyers.\n\n\"Yes,\" Ely responded.\n\nSawyers asked the same question about each of the other 12 patients Husel is accused of killing: Beverlee Schirtizinger, Danny Mollette, Brandy McDonald, Francis Burke, Jeremia Hodge, James Allen, Troy Allison, Bonnie Austin, James Timmons, Sandra Castle, Rebecca Walls and Melissa Penix.\n\nFor each, Ely responded: \"Yes.\"\n\nEly was questioned for about an hour by Diane Menashe, one of Husel's defense attorneys, picking up where questioning had left off on Feb. 28, when Ely first testified in the case.\n\nMenashe asked about notes in the medical records of some patients that indicated families had met with doctors other than Husel before agreeing to withdraw life support measures for their loved ones.\n\nEly confirmed that appeared to be the case.\n\nTestimony is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. Monday.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nThursday, March 10 morning update\n\nA closed-door meeting between the attorneys, Husel and Judge Michael Holbrook took place for more than 40 minutes Thursday morning, delaying the start of testimony.\n\nAround 9 a.m., Holbrook ordered all parties in the case back to his chambers. A member of Holbrook's staff said the discussion involved \"logistics issues.\"\n\nTestimony began around 10 a.m. Thursday, with Dr. Wes Ely, a doctor from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, continuing his testimony. Ely first testified on Feb. 28.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nWednesday, March 9 afternoon update\n\nThe 14 patients at Mount Carmel West in Dr. William Husel's care were not in good shape, suffering from chronic disease, organ failure and drug addiction among others.\n\nThere have been descriptions of \"bad death,\" which involve patients who hang on to life even as breathing tubes and other attempts to resuscitate are removed.\n\nA former nurse, Stephanie LeChard, described a \"death rattle,\" loud gurgling (audible throughout the intensive care unit), grimacing in pain and a tear running down the cheek of Sandra Castle, 80 when she worked with Husel.\n\nCastle had worked only six shifts in the intensive care prior to Nov. 13, 2018.\n\nThe trial focuses on excessive drugs, specifically fentany, Husel prescribed and whether patient families were made aware of it.\n\nJose Baez, one of Husel's attorneys asked LeChard about Husel's demeanor during his work with Castle.\n\nShe testified that she understood Husel's intent as \"not to hasten Castle's death but to make her (Castle) comfortable.\"\n\nLeChard agreed, stating, \"He was kind, patient, caring when talking to the family.\"\n\nLeChard testified that Husel left dosing decisions for pain for the family, but she gave no specifics.\n\nShe testified that had Husel not provided to a patient's family important information about the drugs that he was prescribing she would have spoken up.\n\n- Dean Narciso\n\nWednesday, March 9 morning update\n\nTwo former intensive care nurses at Mount Carmel Health explained how they each administered 1,000 micrograms of fentanyl to a patient in 2017, the second nurse testifying that he was unaware of the first dose.\n\nBoth dosages were prescribed by Husel who was the attending physician at the time for Ryan Hayes, an overdose patient who was considered comatose during his two day admittance to the hospital.\n\nTyler Springer testified that on April 3, 2017, he had no idea that 20 minutes before, that his colleague Troy Rudman had administered the same to Hayes.\n\nSpringer testified that he recalled the Hayes case as memorable, without reviewing medical records, because \"it was the highest amount of medication that I had given.\"\n\nSpringer also testified that he recorded Hayes' pain as '0' on a 1-10 scale for hours leading up to the fentanyl dosage. During the removal of Hayes breathing tube at about 11:15 p.m., Springer said he had changed the pain score to '10,' anticipating that removing the breathing tube would be uncomfortable.\n\n\"I anticipated that he had pain. I noticed that he was turning blue.\"\n\nPrevious doctors have testified that fentanyl, if used at all, would be administered in smaller dosages over a period of time, for pain relief only and not in one intravaneous dosage as Husel has prescribed, in this case twice.\n\nOn cross-examination, Diane Menashe, Husel's attorney, asked Springer if he would have assigned a patient a pain score only if he believed it was warranted. Springer agreed.\n\nMenashe asked both nurses if they like Husel and if he was responsive to change and easy to work with. Both replied yes.\n\nShe asked both if they recognized whether different doctors have different techniques. Both agreed.\n\nHayes had arrived at Mount Carmel in full cardiac arrest after being found in a bathtub. His son drove from North Carolina that day and, en route, agreed to the removal of his breathing tube, typically end a critical care patient's life.\n\n- Dean Narciso\n\nTuesday, March 8 afternoon update\n\n\"You weren't charged with murder were you?\" lead defense attorney Jose Baez asked Dr. Tom Brady, an internalist contracted to work at Mount Carmel West, Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBrady helped to treat 64-year-old Bonnie Austin during her hospitalization in September 2018. He testified while he treated Austin and signed paperwork after her death, Brady was not involved in order the 600 micrograms of fentanyl that prosecutors allege killed her.\n\nBrady was not able to answer the question, or a second question about whether he was named in a lawsuit filed by Austin's family against Husel and Mount Carmel in January 2019, as prosecutors objected. The objection led to an extended sidebar conversation.\n\nBaez had several testy exchanges with Judge Michael Holbrook while questioning Brady Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"You knew you were coming to testify in a murder trial, right?\" Baez asked, prompting Holbrook to respond \"Counsel, stop.\"\n\n\"Ask a proper question,\" Holbrook continued.\n\n\"I thought it was a proper question,\" Baez responded.\n\nBrady was the fifth witness called Tuesday and the fourth witness to testify about the discharge summaries and death certificates prepared by doctors after the patients' deaths.\n\nTwo nurses involved in the retrieval and administration of the fentanyl doses are expected to testify, providing for the first time their accounts of what happened in the intensive care unit under Husel's watch.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nTuesday, March 8 morning update\n\nThe prosecution team is calling a series of attending physicians to the stand, bnning Monday and continuing into Tuesday, who signed off on the death certificates and other paperwork for the death of the patients Husel is accused of killing.\n\nDr. Caleb Wagner, an internal health physician, testified he \"had no reason to question\" the medication Husel gave to the patients whose paperwork he signed off on and whom he had not treated at all during their hospitalization.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Dr. David Ralston, the medical director for the intensive care unit at Mount Carmel West during Husel's employment, said he had never given a dose of more than five or six milligrams of morphine. That dose would equate to about 50 or 60 micrograms of fentanyl, significantly less than the 500, 1,000 or 2,000 micrograms Husel is accused of ordering for patients who died under his care.\n\n\"You don't want to even be perceived as crossing that line,\" Ralston said.\n\n--Bethany Bruner\n\nMonday, March 7 update\n\nThe testimony of Dr. Dan Roth, chief clinical officer for Trinity Health — Mount Carmel's Michigan-based parent company — was the first thing the jury heard Monday morning. Much of Roth's testimony under cross-examination by lead defense attorney Jose Baez involved objections from the prosecution, an ongoing theme throughout the early stages of the trial.\n\nDuring additional questioning from Assistant Franklin County Prosecutor David Zeyen, Roth said he and Trinity Health did not do anything to \"frame\" Husel. Attorneys for Husel had argued Mount Carmel had attempted to make Husel a \"villain\" in the public's eyes.\n\n\"Did you frame Dr. Husel for murder,\" Zeyen asked. \"No,\" Roth responded.\n\nThe second witness to testify Monday was Dr. David Ralston, who was the medical director for the intensive care unit at Mount Carmel West while Husel worked there. Ralston detailed how he would give two or four milligrams of morphine to patients who are undergoing a palliative extubation. Those dosages would equate to about 20 to 40 micrograms of fentanyl — less than the 500 to 1,000 micrograms, and in some instances 2,000 micrograms of fentanyl that Husel is accused of ordering for patients under his care.\n\nA shooting at the Franklin County parking garage across the street from the courthouse did not impact testimony Monday morning.\n\n-Bethany Bruner\n\nWhy we haven't heard directly from attorneys\n\nThe attorneys on both sides of the murder trial for former Mount Carmel Health doctor William Husel underway in Franklin County Common Pleas Court are restricting their comments to the courtroom.\n\nThe team of prosecutors from the Franklin County Prosecutor's office has been following a long-standing tradition within that office of not discussing a case publicly with the media during the course of a trial.\n\nHusel's Florida-based lead attorney, Jose Baez, who has handled many high-profile cases, also told reporters after the first day of formal jury selection on Feb. 14 that he would not speak to the media during trial, either.\n\nThere has not been a gag order issued in the case by Common Pleas Judge Michael Holbrook, which would prevent the lawyers from talking to the press.\n\nWho are the victims?\n\nThe patients all died at Mount Carmel West between 2015 and 2018.\n\nHusel, 46, was initially charged with 25 counts of murder, but 11 were dismissed in January at the request of the prosecution. He is now charged with 14 counts of murder for allegedly authorizing large doses of fentanyl that caused the deaths of Joanne S.

The flag flew from atop a pole in a park across from the Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar in New York's Greenwich Village that was the scene of one of the most significant events in LGBTQ+ history.\n\n“Removing the rainbow flag from the Stonewall National Monument again makes a target of what is sacred ground for our community – and another attempted act of erasure by an administration that has relentlessly attacked the LGBTQ+ community since the day it took office,” said Cathy Renna, spokeswoman for the National LGBTQ Task Force.\n\nThe National Park Service said in a statement provided to USA TODAY that, with limited exceptions, only the U.S. flag and other authorized flags are permitted on flagpoles managed by the agency. The policy was outlined in a directive the agency issued Jan. 21. Exemptions can include flags that provide historical context, current military branch flags and the flags of federally recognized Tribal nations.\n\n“Any changes to flag displays are made to ensure consistency with that guidance,” the statement said.\n\nThe removal of the flag, which has become an internationally recognized symbol of the gay rights movement and the hard-fought gains it has won through decades of struggles, infuriated activists as well as city and state leaders.\n\n\"I am outraged by the removal of the Rainbow Pride Flag from Stonewall National Monument,\" New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said in a statement posted on X. \"New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history. Our city has a duty not just to honor this legacy, but to live up to it.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the decision \"a shameful attempt to erase our LGBTQ history.\"\n\n\"I will not let this administration roll back the rights we fought so hard for,\" she said in a message posted on X.\n\nThe Stonewall National Monument commemorates a clash between police and members of the LGBTQ+ community after officers raided the Stonewall Inn in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969. For six days, gay men and women, transgender people, bikers, street kids and others fed up with police harassment fought back. The riots are considered the spark that ignited the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.\n\nThe Stonewall uprising is regarded as such a significant chapter in American history that President Barack Obama designated the bar’s exterior, the adjacent park and the surrounding streets as a national monument in 2016 so that what happened there, and the people involved, would not be forgotten. The bar itself remains privately owned.\n\nThe Stonewall Monument is the only site within the national park system dedicated to LGBTQ+ history, which makes its preservation all the more meaningful to activists and historians.\n\n\"It's a sacred space,\" said Brad Hoylman-Sigal, the Manhattan borough president, who recalled that Stonewall was the first place he visited when he moved to New York City three decades ago. \"You really can't overestimate its importance to generations of LGBTQ people across the world.\"\n\nStacy Lentz, one of the bar's current owners, said the administration did not give her notice that the flag would be removed.\n\n\"We cannot allow the government to erase a historical fact,\" she said. \"This isn't even about the politics of it all. This is about history, and that history has to be preserved.\n\n\"Stonewall taught us that our history doesn't survive unless we defend it.\"\n\nThe removal of the flag marks the second time the Trump administration has targeted the monument in the past year.\n\nEarly last year, just weeks after President Donald Trump took office for the second time, the administration angered LGBTQ+ activists when it stripped all references to transgender people from the monument’s website. The administration said the change was in keeping with Trump’s broader campaign to recognize the existence of just two sexes – male and female – and combat what he calls “gender ideology.”\n\nAfter that decision, more than 1,000 protesters showed up at a rally to support the transgender community and challenge the administration's actions.\n\n'We are here because something sacred was taken from us'\n\nAnother rally Tuesday evening to protest the flag’s removal resulted in a brief standoff between demonstrators and the National Park Service.\n\nThe event was scheduled for 5 p.m. But as people gathered at the monument, National Park Service staff began closing park gates around 4:20 p.m., about 40 minutes before the normal closing time, said Jay W. Walker, a New York City activist and cofounder of the Queer Liberation March.\n\nProtesters stood in front of the main gate and refused to leave. Eventually, New York City police announced the park would stay open, Walker said.\n\nBy the time the rally started, a couple of hundred people crowded inside the small park in front of where the monument’s large flag had been removed.\n\n\"We are here because something sacred was taken from us,\" Tabytha Gonzalez, a transgender activist and a policy and advocacy director with the Bronx-based nonprofit Destination Tomorrow, told gatherers. \"Our flag, the thing we have pride in. The thing that was a symbol of safety.\"\n\nShe said the flag’s removal fits into a larger pattern by the administration, particularly against transgender and gender nonconforming people. That begins with limiting visibility, then challenging language and identity, followed by removing symbols.\n\n\"They will try to push us back into the margins to erase us,\" Gonzalez said. \"We’re not going to let that happen.\"\n\nThe rally drew young and old huddled together as freezing winds gusted in Manhattan. Jonathan Ned Katz, 88, an author who wrote the 1976 book \"Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.,\" stood alongside a high school student who led chants with the crowd. At several points, people called for the flag to be reinstalled immediately.\n\n\"I’m very aware of the rise of authoritarian regimes and the danger that they pose,\" he said, carting a red rolling suitcase across the street from the Stonewall Inn. \"I am scared of what’s happening in the U.S. at this time, and that’s why I’m here.\"\n\nIn front of the bright red neon lights of the Stonewall, Sergio Aragon, 30, and Jesus Gutierrez, 30, posed for a picture after the rally. The couple traveled from Brooklyn to show solidarity after seeing the Stonewall bar announce the rally on Instagram.\n\nIn dark times, Aragon, a first-generation Mexican American, said it was important to stand together with his immigrant and queer community. Aragon said the rally meant love, safety and unity as Gutierrez smiled alongside him.\n\nHoylman-Sigal and other state and community leaders also plan a separate event on Thursday, Feb. 12, to again raise the flag over the park in defiance of the Trump administration.\n\n\"This is a flashpoint, just as it was back in 1969, for standing up for what you believe is right,\" Hoylman-Sigal said.\n\nThis story was updated with new information.\n\nMichael Collins writes about the intersection of politics and culture.

The new flagpole was shorter, and the pride flag flew below the American flag.\n\nThe activists were not happy.\n\n\"So it ended up being with the American flag overshadowing our flag, and our community was incensed,\" said Jay Walker, an activist and cofounder of the Queer Liberation March and president of Gays Against Guns.\n\nA few of them, including Walker, removed both flags and joined them with plastic zip ties while raising the pride flag slightly higher than the Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe event drew about 1,000 spectators and participants.\n\nShep Wahnon, who was at the event, said it makes sense for a pride flag to be in a gay monument that the federal government recognizes as a significant place for American history.\n\n\"The way the whole thing went down was pretty dramatic,\" said Wahnon, an actor. \"Gays have a sense of flair and drama.\"\n\n'The federal government is bullying trans people'\n\nChloe Elantari, a transgender woman who lives in the East Village, arrived at the 0.12-acre Christopher Park around noon, hours before the rehoisting of the flag at 4 p.m.\n\n\"I'm here because the federal government is bullying trans people by taking our flag away to distract from the heinous crimes that everybody at every level of government has been committing against children,\" Elantari said, referencing the Jeffrey Epstein files. \"They are scapegoating us. They are blaming us.\"\n\nElantari, a crisis counselor, came prepared for the day's events.\n\n\"I brought my flag and I put my flag up here,\" she said, pointing to a blue, pink and white striped trans flag, which she had tied to a tree. \"Because our colors need to fly here at Stonewall.\"\n\nElantari and other activists say they see the flag removal as the latest assault on the rights of transgender people by the Trump administration, which has has taken steps to restrict access to gender-affirming care for minors and limit recognition of transgender identities in federal and military spaces.\n\nTrump has also cut federal funding, blocking Medicaid and Medicare from being used for gender-affirming care and issued an executive order saying the federal government will recognize only two sexes: male and female. Another executive order prohibited transgender girls and women from competing in female sports.\n\nThe Stonewall Uprising of 1969 was a turning point in the quest for civil rights for LGBTQ+ people. It began with a police raid on a neighborhood bar popular with the gay community that led patrons to fight back after decades of discrimination and harassment.\n\n\"History will not be erased,\" Brad Hoylman-Sigal, the Manhattan borough president, announced on Instagram after the park service removed the pride flag.\n\nOn Jan. 21, the Department of the Interior issued guidance about the display and flying of \"non-agency flags and pennants\" in the national park system. Exemptions noted in the memo include flags that \"provide historical context, such as earlier versions of the U.S. flag at a historic fort.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, a rainbow flag that flew from the nautical flagpole at Christopher Park was gone. One day before the planned reraising of the flag, the park service flew an American flag from the nautical flagpole.\n\nThe White House did not comment on the removal of the flag, saying only that it was \"deferring\" to the Interior Department.\n\nStonewall National Monument is a 7.7-acre site established by presidential proclamation in 2016. The monument encompasses public and private property, including the privately owned Stonewall Inn, portions of the New York City street network and Christopher Park, which was donated to the federal government by the city of New York, according to a fact sheet from the National Park Service.\n\nAt its dedication on June 24, 2016, Obama said, \"Stonewall will be our first national monument to tell the story of the struggle for LGBT rights.\"\n\nThe pride flag was first flown at the site when President Donald Trump was in office in 2018. During Pride Month, a community volunteer reached out to the National Park Service asking whether he could fly a pride flag for the month. It was approved.\n\nBut when the volunteer, Steven Love Menendez, who is known in the community as the site's \"caretaker,\" asked the park service for permission to fly the flag for the rest of the year, he was denied.\n\n\"The park had the status of being a national landmark. But inside the park, nothing had changed visually,\" Menendez told USA TODAY. \"It just looked like the same park that it was before it was a monument.\"\n\nDuring the Biden administration, Menendez made the request again. This time, he was \"surprised\" by the park service, which agreed not only to install a new flagpole but also ordered a new rainbow flag with the park service logo. The pride flag flew continuously beginning in Feb. 2021, soon after Biden’s inauguration – until last week.\n\n\"It has so much significance to the community, young and old. It’s very sad and callous and hateful for that flag to have been removed. It wasn't necessary, you know?\" Menendez said.\n\n\"That flagpole was put up there for the sole purpose of displaying the rainbow flag,\" Walker said. The park service \"stole our flag.\"\n\n\"The reality is that that entire garden area, before it was designated a national landmark, those have been tended to by members of the community,\" he said. \"Since Donald Trump has been in office the second time, he has just encroached again and again. First, he changed the hours, from open until 8 p.m. to open until 5 p.m. Now this.\"\n\n\"We as a city and as a state are going to have to come up with some other solutions,\" Walker said, \"to snatch it back from the federal government.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Walker said, many of his friends had placed orders for several pride flags to make sure it will continue to have presence in the park.\n\n\"Because they fully expect for the government to try to take this down there,\" he said. \"Whatever they do, we will make sure that a rainbow flag remains on that flagpole and high up on that flagpole.\"\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

He can't | Opinion", "text": "Feb. 23, 2025, 5:06 a.m. ET\n\nI stood outside the Christopher Street subway entrance in New York City last week and noted my surroundings: a Starbucks, a Chase Bank and a set of bars. A triangular strip of fenced grass lined with park benches was across the street from where I stood. A defaced sign on that entrance now read, “Stonewall National TRANSGENDER Monument.”\n\nThe graffiti was left over from Valentine’s Day, the day after the National Park Service removed the words “transgender” and “queer” from the Stonewall National Monument website.\n\n“Before the 1960s, almost everything about living openly as a lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) person was illegal,” the monument’s website now reads, using an acronym often associated with the trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) movement. “The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for LGB civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.”\n\nThe website change is the latest in the Trump administration’s full-out attack on the transgender community. It has also included blocking gender-affirming care for people under 19, barring trans women from competing in women’s sports, banning trans people from serving in the military and declaring that the United States would only recognize two genders, male and female.\n\nIn their crusade against \"transgender insanity,\" the Trump administration is now going so far as to rewrite history. Future tourists who visit Stonewall will see a different version of the monument that I saw last week: a whitewashed version of what really happened, a version that is far from the truth. And while the LGBTQ+ community is responding with protest and resilience, there’s an ever-present dread about what’s to come.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nTrump and Republicans want to erase the Stonewall Uprising\n\nThe Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center, which opened in 2024, does not agree with the Trump administration’s decision.\n\nIn the window was a fan that read “trans and proud” next to a statement specifying that the nonprofit that runs the space is separate from the National Park Service.\n\n“Our space is inextricably linked with and honors the brave pioneers, especially trans and gender-nonconforming individuals, who led the Stonewall Rebellion,” the statement reads.\n\nSo, what is it that the Trump administration wants us to forget and Republicans are so afraid of?\n\nThe Stonewall Rebellion, sometimes called the Stonewall Uprising or the Stonewall riots, was a multiday revolt in 1969 that started with a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar and safe place for gender-nonconforming people. Trans women played a vital role in that rebellion and would become icons of the pride movement.\n\nLGBTQ people are still under attack. Stonewall reminded me of how important our stories are.\n\nInside the visitor center was a completely open room sectioned off by activity. There was a film playing in the back with rows of chairs, a wall of information and photos, and an information desk/gift shop. There was a jukebox that is the same model as the one in the original bar. Beside the help desk is a Parsons art installation featuring a set of blank notebooks where visitors can tell their stories.\n\nI opened the one that asked, “When did you know?”\n\nI flipped through to read other stories – some short and to the point, some with words of encouragement, and none over a page long. Some people had replied to others, indicated by the various marker shades. A lot of people spoke about being gay, but a surprising number were talking about when the writer knew they were trans.\n\nDirectly across from the books was “The Stories of Stonewall,” detailing the history of the bar itself, Greenwich Village and the uprising. Toward the end was a section dedicated to the founders of Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR), trans activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.\n\nA famous quote by Johnson, who was present at Stonewall, adorns the wall: “No pride for some of us without liberation for all of us.”\n\nIt's alarming that pride and liberation are still under attack 56 years later.\n\nRepublicans want to erase people like me. We won't let that happen.\n\nI walked out of the visitors center and around the park, looking at the display that is almost certain to change in the next few months. There's a card addressed to \"the darling trans community\" and a flower stuck behind a photo of Johnson. When I scan the QR code in the top left corner, it leads me to the trans-exclusionary version of the NPS website.\n\nThere were also signs that the Trump administration had not yet made its way to Christopher Park – a trans pride flag was still whipping around in the breeze, surrounded by smaller progress pride flags. None of the signs have been changed out that include the LGBTQ acronym.\n\nInside the park are a pair of statues depicting two same-sex couples, cast in bronze and painted white. Someone had placed pink and blue flower bouquets in the arms of the lesbian couple. I looked at the women and the wilted flowers for a minute. Transgender people are the reason that the Stonewall Uprising happened, the reason I am afforded rights as a queer woman today. Republicans would prefer if I forgot that, but then again, it sometimes seems like they'd prefer if all LGBTQ+ people disappeared.\n\nI finished my afternoon at the Stonewall Inn, the bar’s neon red sign inviting me in from the cold of the park. I walked into the sound of Cardi B’s “I Like It,” greeted by the bar’s dark wood paneling and twinkling multicolored fairy lights. A set of televisions displayed a crackling fire. Things were also business as usual: There was still a giant trans flag in the back of the room.\n\nThe bar isn’t the original; it was an assortment of things in the years following the uprising before opening as a gay bar called New Jimmy’s in 1990. It was renamed after the owner’s death from complications of of HIV/AIDS.\n\nI sat at the bar and thought about what I'd seen. My freedom to sit at this bar, or at any gay bar in New York, was won because of the trans people who rose up at Stonewall. We, as other members of the LGBTQ+ community, must find a way to support our trans brothers and sisters. We can't let them be erased from our history. We must remember the truth of what happened at Stonewall, and keep its spirit in mind as we continue to protest against the Trump administration.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter: @sara__pequeno", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2025/06/05/when-is-pride-month-2025-lgbtq-events-delaware-trans-flag/84026711007/", "title": "When is Pride Month? 2025 LGBTQ+ Pride events in Delaware", "text": "Updated June 5, 2025, 10:08 a.m. ET\n\nJune marks the 56th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots and the 26th anniversary of the first Pride Month.\n\nLGBTQ+ Pride Month, also known simply as Pride Month, is observed each June, marking a celebration of queer culture through both celebration and protest.

The month also highlights the fight for civil rights and the pursuit of equality. It's celebrated in June to commemorate the Stonewall Riots of June 1969.\n\nWhat were the Stonewall Riots?\n\nThe riots occurred on June 28, 1969, when New York police raided the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan. Several people fought back and the confrontation grew into six days of protests. One year later, the first Gay Pride Parade occurred. According to History.com, 3,000 to 5,000 people attended. Parades also took place in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nWhen did Pride Month begin?\n\nOn June 11, 1999, President Bill Clinton, after the National Park Service added the Stonewall Inn to the National Register of Historic Places. designated June of 1999 as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. He did the same in 2000. In 2009, President Barack Obama made the month more inclusive by expanding it to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. Obama also created the Stonewall National Monument in 2016.\n\nPride Month parade and other celebrations in Delaware\n\nHere are some of the events happening in Delaware to celebrate Pride Month.

Here's a description of each from the nonprofit Human Rights Campaign:\n\nUmbrella flags\n\nGilbert Baker Pride Flag\n\nThe original Pride Flag was created in 1978 after activist Harvey Milk asked artist Gilbert Baker to design a symbol of gay pride. Each color represents a different aspect of the LGBTQ+ community: hot pink represents sex, red symbolizes life, orange stands for healing, yellow represents sunlight, green represents nature, turquoise symbolizes magic and art, indigo represents serenity, while violet symbolizes the spirit of LGBTQ+ people.\n\nTraditional Pride Flag\n\nAfter the assassination of Harvey Milk, the rainbow flag was in high demand. Due to manufacturing issues, the hot pink stripe was removed. The turquoise stripe was removed from the flag as a design choice from Baker. The six-color pride flag has represented the community for over 40 years and is still one of the most common LGBTQ+ flags.\n\nPhiladelphia Pride Flag\n\nThe Philadelphia Pride Flag was unveiled at the city’s pride event in 2017. The Philadelphia City Council commissioned the creation of this flag as they wanted to incorporate queer communities of color that have often been overlooked in the mainstream LGBTQ+ movement. The addition of the black and brown stripes symbolize communities of color and their contribution to the movement.\n\nProgress Pride Flag\n\nThe Progress Pride Flag evolved from the Philadelphia Pride Flag and was created by Daniel Quaser. Quasar added a white, pink, and light blue stripe to represent the Trans community. While the black and brown stripes still represented communities of color, the black stripe is also a nod the thousands of individuals that the community lost during the HIV/AIDS crisis in 1980s and 1990s. Since its creation, the flag has become very popular.\n\nIntersex-Inclusive Progress Pride Flag\n\nThe Intersex-Inclusive Progress Pride Flag adds the intersex community to the Progress Pride Flag. With this update coming in 2021, this serves as the most up-to-date LGBTQ+ flag. The flag was created by Valentino Vecchietti of Intersex Equality Rights UK.\n\nQueer Pride Flag\n\nWhile this flag is not as well known, this is the Queer Pride Flag. Created in 2015, the flag represents all aspects of queerness as the label ‘queer’ has become more celebrated. The pink and blue shades represented same-gender attraction while the orange and green stripes stand for non-binary and gender non-confirming individuals. The black and white stripes symbolize asexual, aromantic, and the agender community.\n\nSexual orientation flags\n\nLesbian Pride Flag\n\nWhile there have been many iterations of the Lesbian Pride Flag, this has been in use since 2018. Since then, it has been widely accepted. The different shades of red, pink, and orange represent the different types of femininity in the lesbian community.\n\nTrans-Inclusive Gay Men's Pride Flag\n\nThis is the second version of the Gay Men’s Pride Flag. The original only had green, blue and white. This version has different shades of green and blue to include non-cisgender gay men.\n\nBisexual Pride Flag\n\nThe Bisexual Flag was created in 1998 by Michael Page to bring awareness o the bisexual community. The pink represents bisexual’s attraction to the same gender while the blue represents the attraction to the opposite gender. The purple stripe in the middle represents attraction to two genders.\n\nPansexual Pride Flag\n\nThe Pansexual Pride Flag was created around 2010 in order to bring awareness to the community. Pansexual people are those who have the potential for emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction to people of any gender though not necessarily at the same time, in the same way or to the same degree. The pink stripe represents attraction to women while the blue stripe represents attraction to men. The yellow stripe is for everyone else in between and beyond the gender binary.\n\nAsexual Pride Flag\n\nThe Asexual Pride Flag was created in 2010 following a contest by the Asexual Visibility and Education Network. Asexual individuals are people who do not have a sexual attraction to any gender. Each stripe has a different meaning: black represents asexuality, gray means gray-asexuality & demisexuality, white stands for non-asexual partners and allies, and the purple represents community.\n\nDemisexual Pride Flag\n\nIt is unknown when the Demisexual Pride Flag was created, but it represents people who only form sexual attraction for people once they have established a deep emotional connection with them. Each color has a different meaning: black represents asexuality, gray stands for demisexuality, white means sexuality, while purple represents community.\n\nPolyamory Pride Flag\n\nIn 2021, over 30,000 members of the polyamorous community voted for this new Polyamory Pride Flag design by Red Howell, which created a contemporary approach to the traditional vexillological elements of the original flag from 1995, and represents elements around different core values including white for possibility, magenta for desire and love, blue for openness and honesty, gold for energy and perseverance and purple representing the united non-monogamous community.\n\nPolysexual Pride Flag\n\nThe Polysexual Pride Flag was created online in 2012 for people that are attracted to multiple, yet not all, gender. The blue stripe represents attraction to men, pink stands for the attraction to women, while green is for attraction to those outside of the binary.\n\nDig deeper: Learn the meanings, and origins of Pride flags\n\nPride Flag | Progress Pride Flag | Lesbian Pride Flag | Bisexual Pride Flag | Pansexual Pride Flag | Asexual Pride Flag | Intersex Pride Flag | Gender Identity Flags | Trans-Pride Flag", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/02/24/pride-flag-ban-lgbtq-symbol-vanishes-more-cities-schools/11325450002/", "title": "Bans on LGBTQ Pride flag spark debate about inclusion, civil rights", "text": "Updated Feb. 24, 2023, 10:38 a.m. ET\n\nLGBTQ advocates are becoming increasingly alarmed as municipalities and school districts across the country take measures prohibiting displays of the rainbow Pride flag on public property and in classrooms.\n\nSome say the moves reflect a broader wave of GOP-endorsed reform and policy efforts that include book bans, changes to school curricula, attacks on the use of preferred pronouns and restriction of reproductive rights.\n\n“We’re in the middle of an avalanche of anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bills,” said Dara Adkison, board secretary for TransOhio, a trans equality organization in Columbus. \"They’re playing that numbers game of, 'What can we squeak through?'”\n\nSuch restrictions have been approved in Delaware, Ohio, and in Cold Spring, New York, as well as in school districts from Davis County, Utah, to Wales, Wisconsin. In Green Bay, Wisconsin, an effort to push a similar citywide measure there was narrowly defeated this month.\n\nAnd in Florida, Republican state Rep. David Borrero has introduced a bill that would similarly limit flag displays at all governmental and public school buildings statewide.\n\nHow do these measures ban Pride flags?\n\nThe municipal measures that prohibit rainbow flags aren't explicitly expressed as such. Presented as a means to avoid favoring any one group over another, they limit flag displays to government and military flags – but the effect is the same.\n\nIn the measure in Delaware, Ohio, city manager Thomas Homan in May 2022 informed flag and banner applicants that the city was pausing its program for review in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that month ruling that Boston city officials had violated a Christian group’s free speech rights when they denied a request to fly a Christian flag over city hall. Delaware’s program allowed organizations to request their flags be displayed on city street poles.\n\n“While unfortunate for our local nonprofit organizations who use the banner and flag program to support cultural and community events, it is reasonable and prudent to take this step to protect the interests of our city,” he wrote.\n\nA city spokesman told USA TODAY the review was ongoing.\n\nOn March 7, City Council members in Huntington Beach, California, are set to take their final vote on a similar measure.\n\nAt the council's meeting earlier this week, board member Dan Kalmick criticized the proposal as cloaked in language hiding its true intentions.\n\n\"This is a poor and cowardly ordinance couched in 'equality,' \" Kalmick said. \"It’s, of course, a ban on the city flying the Pride flag. Call it what it is. ... If it walks like a ban and quacks like a ban, it’s a ban.\"\n\nTwo previous council votes have favored the ordinance 4-3. The proposed measure notes that businesses and individuals can still display flags of their choice on private property.\n\nLast week, Debbie Chang, president and CEO of the private foundation funded by nonprofit health plan Blue Shield of California, informed Huntington Beach officials that given the situation, the group had canceled plans to conduct a two-day retreat for trustees and senior management in the city in June.\n\n“We decided that we could no longer in good conscience meet in your city until the uncertainty of this situation is resolved,” Chang wrote in a letter Friday.\n\nGiven the LGBTQ community’s high rates of health inequities and domestic violence, she said, the city's move to ban the Pride flag \"puts a vulnerable population at risk of further harm.”\n\nIn response, Huntington Beach council member Casey McKeon said at this week's meeting: \"I don’t know why they are trying to blackmail us economically when we are drafting our government flag policy to only fly government flags that represent every individual equally.\"\n\nWhy is the rainbow flag important?\n\nGilbert Baker, a Kansas-born artist who spent much of his life in San Francisco, created the iconic six-striped rainbow flag in 1978 at the behest of LGBTQ activist and lawmaker Harvey Milk in 1978, according to the New York-based Gilbert Baker Foundation. He died in 2017.\n\nThe symbol has since become an icon of LGBTQ inclusion.\n\n“It’s that age-old visibility, of knowing where you’re welcome,” said Adkison, of TransOhio. “The Pride flag is an easy way of knowing you have some allies there.”\n\nPeg Corley, executive director of LGBTQ Center OC, based in Santa Ana, California, said Huntington Beach council members were sending \"a very loud message\" by considering the measure.\n\nThe rainbow flag “is the most diverse symbol we have,” Corley said. “Literally every walk of life is represented in the LGBTQ community, so saying we’re not going to fly a symbol of diversity and inclusion – that’s the message they’re sending.”\n\nHow is the LGBTQ community responding?\n\nThe Gilbert Baker Foundation, the New York-based organization named for the flag's creator, on Friday launched a Save the Rainbow Flag campaign with instruction for local community advocates on mobilization and letter-writing activism, plus an open letter from the ACLU with legal arguments against flag restrictions.\n\n“Make no mistake – right-wing groups want to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, and they’re starting with banning the rainbow flag,” Charley Beal, the foundation’s president, said in a press release.\n\nSome such bans have already been reversed – for instance, in Newberg, Oregon, where school board members last month rescinded a controversial 2021 measure prohibiting political signage, which had included the rainbow flag, after the measure was challenged by the ACLU.\n\nBut, Beal said, “every month brings a new threat to LGBTQ+ rights and equality. It’s time to stop the haters.”\n\nCorley, whose organization has been asked to participate in public raisings of the rainbow flag when Orange County municipalities kicked off Pride Month celebrations in previous years, said she expects more businesses to withdraw from Huntington Beach should the ban remain in effect.\n\n“We’re people, not a political agenda,” she said.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nWhat is the meaning of other LGBTQ+ flags?\n\nBook bans are on the rise.

Jeremy Graham/Alamy\n\nThe city called the bar “one of the city’s most significant sites of LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer) history” in the news release.\n\nJulius’ was the site of the 1966 “Sip-in,” a protest against homophobic discrimination – although at the time, the bar wasn’t an explicitly LGBT space. Four men named Dick Leitsch, Craig Rodwell, John Timmons, and Randy Wicker staged the event to protest the persecution of gay men for drinking in public, according to the National Park Service. Bars and restaurants could be raided for “disorderly” conduct, which included men flirting and kissing, says the service. So bars often refused to serve clients who they knew were gay.\n\nAt Julius’, the men announced they were gay – and the bartender refused to serve them, saying it was illegal. The men successfully brought a court case challenging that interpretation of the law. And in 1967, “the courts ruled that indecent behavior had to be more than same-sex ‘cruising’” kissing or touching,” says the National Park Service. “Gays could legally drink in a bar.”\n\nJulius’, located in New York City’s West Village, is a crucial piece of the city’s history: The bar has been open since the 1860s, according to the National Park Service. And today, it openly describes itself as a gay bar on its social media.\n\n“The ‘Sip-In’ at Julius’ was a pivotal moment in our city and our nation’s LGBTQ+ history, and this designation today marks not only that moment but also Julius’ half-century as a home for New York City’s LGBTQ+ community,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in the city news release. “Honoring a location where New Yorkers were once denied service solely on account of their sexuality reinforces something that should already be clear: LGBTQ+ New Yorkers are welcome anywhere in our city.”\n\nCouncil member Erik Botcher thanked the activists who pushed for the landmark designation in the release.\n\n“As a gay man who enjoys countless freedoms that were unimaginable in their time, I owe enormous debt to the activists who made Julius’ Bar the site of their protest.” Bottcher said in the release. “Landmarks should tell the history of all New Yorkers, including those from marginalized communities.”\n\nAnd the landmark status will help ensure the historical site is preserved for decades.\n\n“The Commission’s designation of the Julius’ Bar Building today recognizes and protects the site of the 1966 ‘Sip-In,’ an important early protest against the persecution of LGBTQ+ people that drew vital attention to unjust laws and practices and paved the way for future milestones in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights,” said Sarah Carroll, the landmarks preservation commission chair, in the release.\n\n“This building represents that history and has remained an important place to commemorate it,” she went on.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/04/28/trump-anti-trans-lgbtq-executive-orders/83248377007/", "title": "Trump keeps pushing anti-LGBTQ policy. But we're still here | Opinion", "text": "April 28, 2025, 4:31 a.m. ET\n\nI didn’t always know I was gay, but I grew up scared that someone would label me that way. I was scared of being bullied, scared that I wouldn't be accepted and, most of all, scared that something was wrong with me.\n\nGrowing up in a small, conservative North Carolina town, I never knew a single out gay person through my childhood. When I found out about same-sex attraction from students at my elementary school, it was because being gay was the punchline of every joke. A childhood friend wasn’t allowed to watch \"Teletubbies\" because her father thought the characters were “gay.”\n\nSo when I realized I was gay, I was terrified of how I would be treated. I knew it would be horrible.\n\nFor President Donald Trump's first 100 days, he and his Republican enablers have tried to make life unbearable for marginalized communities to score hate-fueled political points and a fake sense of accomplishment. In doing so, they're all ignoring reality. The LGBTQ+ people, people of color and any other group being attacked by his administration's actions will always exist.\n\nI'm still here today because the younger me didn't stay hidden\n\nRepublicans would have preferred that younger me had stayed hidden when my fear continued well into high school. During my sophomore year, I began dating a boy because I felt like it was what I was supposed to do. I believed that if we dated for a year, that would make other people think I was normal, even though I still struggled to name what was different about me.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nOn one of our final dates toward the end of that yearlong relationship, I told him that I thought some of the girls in our class were cute. It was the first time I’d ever admitted my attraction to girls to anyone. I hadn’t even told my best friend at the time.\n\nOnce we broke up, he started calling me a “slut.” I’ve always wondered whether those two things were related.\n\nIt took me until college to come out to myself, and even longer to admit that I wasn’t sure I liked the opposite sex at all. Despite growing up in the conditions that should, hypothetically, “make someone straight,” I ended up queer.\n\nWhy did I write all that?\n\nBecause Republicans would rather I had stayed that scared child. I'm still here today because I didn't. Republicans seem to believe that they can legislate people out of existence, or scare us so we'll at least stay hidden. That's been clearer than ever these past three months.\n\nTrump's first 100 days were filled with hate toward transgender people\n\nTrump has repeatedly attacked the transgender community.\n\nOn the first day of his second term, he signed an executive order that declared the federal government would only recognize biological sex assigned at birth. This meant that transgender people would no longer be issued passports that identify them by their gender, and incarcerated trans women in federal prison would be transferred to men’s prisons.\n\nHe is attacking transgender people of every age. He has banned trans girls and women from competing alongside their peers in women’s sporting events. He has restricted gender-affirming health care for people younger than 19. He has tried to ban trans people from joining the military.\n\nThe history of trans resistance was removed from the Stonewall National Monument's website.\n\nNone of these things change the fact that transgender people aren’t going anywhere. Yes, Trump has made their lives much harder. Yes, they are being erased from public records. But transgender people are still here, whether you like it or not. Nothing Trump does will change that.\n\nStonewall is still there, even if its existence weirdly makes Republicans obsess.\n\nUnder Trump, Republicans crystallize their disdain for immigrants\n\nThe Trump administration has also begun its mass deportation agenda since regaining control of the White House, something that is striking fear in every foreign national, regardless of immigration status. It feels like it won’t be long until Trump begins going after U.S. citizens, something he says he intends to do.\n\nDuring all of this, Republicans have said that they will only go after individuals who are undocumented immigrants who came to this country \"the wrong way,\" the \"worst of the worst.\"\n\nInstead, they have gone after people who are legal residents in this country because they are afraid of anyone who has different opinions or different lived experiences from theirs. They've decided to deport legal immigrants out of a fear of words and a clear resentment of the First Amendment.\n\nTrump’s government has tried to deport Mahmoud Khalil for speaking out against Israel. They have wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia and refuse to return him to the United States. They have deported people for having tattoos. They have denied people due process.\n\nWhat they are doing is terrifying; it also will not stop people from entering the country.\n\nDespite Trump’s animosity toward immigrants, they will always be part of the fabric of the United States and will be here long after this MAGA administration isn't.\n\nRepublican attack on DEI rooted in foundational fear of anything 'different'\n\nTrump has also decimated diversity, equity and inclusion policies within the federal government, including in schools. Private companies quickly followed suit.\n\nIn March, Trump declared during a joint session of Congress that his administration had “ended the tyranny” of DEI policies in both the government and the private sectors, proclaiming that “our country will be woke no longer.\"\n\nImagine thinking that something as simple as \"inclusion\" was tyrannical. Then imagine a tyrant saying it.\n\nMeta, Disney and Target are among the companies that have transformed or completely gotten rid of their DEI programs. The country isn’t on board with this decision.\n\nIn fact, 53% of Americans disapprove of the dismantling of DEI initiatives, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nAt its core, this attack on DEI programs is about putting anyone who isn’t a straight, cis, white man “in their place.” It’s about undoing any social progress we’ve made since the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers in 2020.\n\nTrump's next 100 days will be more of the same. We'll still be here.\n\nConservatives must understand that any person different from them is still, in fact, a person.\n\nThe trans person whose life you’ve made a living hell is still a person. The immigrants they've wrongly deported deserve to continue pursuing what America offers. The students hurting deserve to learn the history of civil rights and queer resistance to systems of oppression, to see themselves represented both in curriculum and in the media.\n\nTrump wants us to believe that he can create a world without diversity. If I’ve learned anything from growing up in Trump country, it’s that we will continue to exist despite the entirety of the American government trying to stop that.

Hateful, even. To President Donald Trump and those in his administration, that’s the point.\n\nOn June 18, it was announced that the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline would no longer be partnering with The Trevor Project and other groups to provide specialized support services for LGBTQ+ youth and young adults in crisis. According to the Trump administration, this is “to focus on serving all help seekers.”\n\nTo LGBTQ+ people and our allies, it’s clearly a move to show that our mental health is not a priority to the Republican Party. And how does removing something help anybody?\n\nThis isn’t the only instance of Trump and Republicans trying to destroy the progress made by LGBTQ+ people in the decades since Pride Month celebrations began.\n\nHere are some of the other ways the LGBTQ+ community has been targeted this June. Remember, the point from Republican leaders is to inflict pain for political points. It's not to help children.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nSupreme Court rules against trans youth\n\nIn the months following Trump’s second inauguration, the transgender community has borne the brunt of Republican ire. Another blow to the community was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 18, when the justices voted 6-3 to uphold Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors. The court ruled that the law, which prevents young people from using puberty blockers or hormone therapy, doesn’t violate the 14th Amendment.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the court “abandons transgender children and their families to political whims.”\n\nChase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union and the first openly transgender person to argue in front of the Supreme Court, called the decision a “painful setback” but stressed the need to continue the fight for trans rights.\n\nThe children who do seek this type of gender-affirming care know who they are. Hormones and puberty blockers aren’t prescribed unless these children can prove that they are suffering from distress that would be eased by treatment.\n\nThis ban, and the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold it, show that the “debate” over trans people’s identity isn’t about keeping kids safe. It’s about controlling people who are different. It's not about protecting kids; it's about hurting them to make Republican leaders feel good about themselves.\n\nNavy may no longer honor Harvey Milk with vessel\n\nIt’s not just the present that is being affected by the Trump administration. It’s also how we remember the past.\n\nOn June 3, U.S. officials confirmed that the USNS Harvey Milk, a naval oil tanker named for the late LGBTQ+ rights activist. Milk, who served as a U.S. Navy operations officer on rescue submarines during the Korean War then went on to become the first openly gay man elected to public office in California, was assassinated in 1978.\n\nWhile it’s unclear when the renaming will occur, it’s clearly part of the Trump administration’s efforts to scrub anything related to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives from the public record.\n\nIt's disgraceful that Trump wants to rid the government of as much LGBTQ+ history as possible. It is shameful that something as simple as a dedication is being questioned. It may not seem like a big deal to some people, but it shows that the primary goal of the Trump administration is to make people feel like their lives and their history don’t matter.\n\nAll of this started well before this Pride Month. One of the first things Trump did upon his second inauguration was declare that the country would only recognize two genders. In February, his administration removed references to transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument's website. Bills have been introduced in several state legislatures that attempt to overturn the Supreme Court ruling Obergefell v. Hodges that legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nThe LGBTQ+ community is strong. We have remained defiant for decades, and we'll continue to speak out as Trump and Republican lamakers try to silence us. It’s just heartbreaking that this is happening during a month that we are supposed to be celebrating.\n\nRepublicans aren't going to stop until we're all back in the closet. We must continue to fight for progress, for the benefit of all. In the end, history will remember who was on the wrong side of history – and it certainly won't be those of us fighting to keep our rights.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter:@sara__pequeno", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/01/stonewall-trump-trans-lgbtq-monument/82636933007/", "title": "Stonewall vets sound alarm over Trump attempt to erase trans history", "text": "June 1, 2025 Updated June 9, 2025, 9:15 a.m. ET\n\nNEW YORK – Out of nowhere, through the open back door of the police van, came a rhinestone-studded high heel.\n\nThe drag queen rocking the pump kicked an officer in the shoulder, knocking him to the ground and sending him skidding across the pavement. The growing crowd outside the Stonewall Inn howled as he got up, dusted himself off and charged into the back of the van with such ferocity that the door slammed behind him.\n\nThen ghastly noises exploded from inside the vehicle – “bone against metal, flesh against metal, and a dreary, dreary liquid sound that shocked everybody, I mean, shocked us,” recalled Martin Boyce, a Stonewall regular who witnessed the events unfold in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969.\n\nThe role of transgender people in the Stonewall riots – a monumental moment in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality – is undisputed and well documented. A police raid on the popular gay bar in New York’s Greenwich Village, amid the tumultuous events of the late 1960s, touched off six days of rioting considered the spark that ignited the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.\n\nThe bar’s patrons – a colorful cocktail of gay men, lesbians, trans people, bikers and street kids – had survived police harassment and similar raids many other times. By the time police barged into the bar that unusually hot summer morning, they’d had enough.\n\nThey fought back, with the fists and fury of a people tired of being targeted and condemned for who they are.\n\nThe Stonewall riots represent such a significant chapter in American history that President Barack Obama designated the bar’s exterior, an adjacent park and the surrounding streets a national monument in 2016 so that what happened there, and the people involved, would never be forgotten.\n\nLess than a decade later, President Donald Trump wants Americans to remember only part of the story. In February, the National Park Service stripped references to transgender people from the monument’s website. The move was part of Trump’s broader campaign to recognize the existence of just two sexes – male and female – and combat what he calls “gender ideology.”\n\nTrans people who battled police alongside gay men and lesbians at Stonewall have now been erased from the government’s official history of that event.\n\n“That’s just wrong,” said Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, who participated in the riots and now lives in Little Rock, Arkansas. Miss Major, as she is known, is a transgender activist who has argued for years that trans Americans’ involvement in Stonewall has never been fully acknowledged.\n\nMark Segal, a gay rights activist from Philadelphia who was inside Stonewall the night of the raid, is appalled by Trump’s attempt at trans-washing LGBTQ+ history.\n\n“I am a witness to history, and my trans brothers and sisters were with me that night,” Segal said. “I won’t allow him to censor history. I want people to realize that when a government tries to erase a group of people, that's dangerous.”\n\n'Go get 'em, girls!'\n\nSegal was at the back of the bar, near the dance floor, where other young people hung out, when police came barreling through. It was 1:20 a.m., a Saturday.\n\nSegal, then 18, had been in New York for just six weeks. Growing up in Philadelphia, he had felt as if he were the only gay man in the world. Gay men were practically invisible in 1969. He had heard that Greenwich Village was a place where people could be themselves, so he headed to New York and found his way to Christopher Street in the heart of the city’s gay scene.\n\nThere, he found a circle of friends like himself. He found Stonewall.\n\nFredd “Tree” Sequoia had discovered Greenwich Village a few years earlier. He had heard about it from a friend. So one day, while he was a teenager, he snuck off from his home in Brooklyn and boarded a train to the city. He was so taken by the neighborhood’s thriving mixture of clubs, coffee shops and easy sex that he moved there and never left.\n\nStonewall opened in early 1967 and quickly became his main hangout. He was there, along with Segal and others, dancing at the back of the bar, when the police charged in.\n\nWhat happened next is legend, one that has been repeated and embellished so often that it can be hard to separate fact from fiction.\n\nAbout 200 people were inside the bar that morning. Some, like Sequoia, were dancing. Others were just standing around, talking to friends, openly flirting, something that could have gotten them arrested in an era where same-sex relations were considered deviant and criminal.\n\nSuddenly, the lights in the bar blinked on, and the music stopped. Sequoia heard a friend known as Gypsy scream at the top of his lungs, “Don’t touch me!”\n\nThen, pandemonium.\n\nA dozen or so police officers moved swiftly through the bar. They justified the raid by saying they were investigating the illegal sale of alcohol. Until 1966, New York had barred the sale of booze to known or suspected homosexuals. Gay bars like Stonewall had tried to get around that rule by operating as private clubs, but with homosexuality a crime, they were still easy targets and often subjected to police raids and brutality.\n\nOfficers smashed bottles of liquor against the bar, shattered the jukebox and cigarette machine and shoved people up against the wall.\n\n“I was scared out of my mind,” Segal said. “I had never seen such violence in my life.”\n\nPolice demanded to see IDs. Most patrons, including Segal and Sequoia, were eventually allowed to leave. Trans people were isolated in a back room so police could examine them to verify their gender. Some refused to cooperate. Lesbians in the front of the bar recoiled at what they considered unnecessary frisking. One reportedly punched a cop.\n\nHonoring the past: 10 great places where LGBTQ history was made\n\nOut on the street, rumors of the raid spread. A crowd gathered in front of the bar and watched as police officers yanked drag queens and trans people through the door, some kicking and screaming, and shoved them into the back of a waiting van.\n\n“They were just rude,” said Miss Major, who was in the crowd. “They put their hand where it didn’t belong. They shoved them and pushed them around and then they didn’t help us when we had to go up the steps to the paddy wagon.”\n\nBoyce and a friend, Robert \"Birdie\" Rivera, were on their way to Stonewall when the raid happened. They were dressed in “scare drag” – a looser gender-bending style that would later be popularized by the singer Boy George – instead of full drag, which could have gotten them thrown in jail. Police were known to arrest anyone who wasn’t wearing at least three items of clothing that corresponded to their gender at birth.\n\nAll at once, Boyce, then 21, felt a surge of people behind him that seemed unusual, even for a weekend. He looked toward Stonewall and could see the police cars’ red bubble lights, twirling and brightening up the night sky. The crowd was pushing toward the bar. Boyce and Rivera headed in that direction. By the time they got to Stonewall, the number of onlookers had grown and formed a semi-circle outside the bar’s doors.\n\nBoyce watched as an officer dragged the skinny queen in the rhinestone-studded pumps out the door. The bystanders giggled as she fought back and the officer struggled to get her into the police van. They laughed harder when she kicked him to the pavement with her sparkly footwear. He got up and bolted into the vehicle.\n\nWhen the beating was over, he stepped back onto the sidewalk, jaws clenched, Boyce recalls, and barked at the crowd: “You faggots! You saw what you came to see. Now get out of here!”\n\nInstead of scattering, the onlookers moved in his direction. Boyce could see the officer's anger rise as he commanded the crowd to disperse and ducked back inside the bar.\n\nExactly what turned the resistance into a riot remains an open debate. By some accounts, the tipping point was the lesbian punching the officer. Boyce suggests it was the officer’s menacing response after he was kicked to the ground. Whatever the cause, the crowd's frustration gave way to fury.\n\n“People started throwing things at the door, whether it be coins from their pockets or a stone they picked up, or an empty can of soda,” Segal said.\n\nSegal saw drag queens, loud and boisterous, hurl anything that wasn’t fastened to the street. “Whoever assumes that a swishy queen can't fight should have seen them, makeup dripping and gowns askew, fighting for their home and fiercely proving that no one would take it away from them,” he would write in a memoir published in 2015.\n\nSequoia observed rioters pull a parking meter out of the ground and use it to batter the doors of the bar, where the police had barricaded themselves. Others watched the rioting from the windows of nearby apartments and encouraged the queens to keep fighting back.\n\n“You heard people in the buildings around there yelling out their windows at the girls beating the police up,” Miss Major said. “Some people yelled out, ‘Go get ’em, girls!’ The fact that we were attacking the police was a big deal.”\n\nThe rebellion spread to the surrounding streets. Police called in the riot squad for reinforcements. As they advanced in line formation, wearing riot helmets and holding shields, they were taunted by a group of young men who locked arms and formed a Rockette-style kick line, chanting to the melody of the vaudeville tune \"Ta Ra Ra Boom-de-Ay\":\n\n“We are the Stonewall girls.\n\n\"We wear our hair in curls ...”\n\nBy 4:30 a.m., the rioting had died down. Thirteen people were arrested, including Stonewall employees and customers. At least two of those arrested were drag queens, according to an account provided by the Library of Congress.\n\nThe next afternoon, Karla Jay, a feminist activist who lived nearby, heard about the uprising on the radio and headed over to check out the scene. Police barricades were stationed at each end of the street. Empty cans and debris were everywhere. Knots of people gathered along Christopher Street, furious about what had happened and insisting that something had to be done.\n\nFor the next five days, spontaneous outbursts and demonstrations continued, involving several thousand people at times. Groups like the Gay Liberation Front formed, demanding an end to police brutality and equality for all. A month later, a small but boisterous group of protesters marched to Stonewall from nearby Washington Square Park, halting traffic and shouting “gay power” and other slogans.\n\n“We felt it was a great victory,” Jay recalled. “We had walked that far, and nobody had attacked us. There we were, out in the daylight. It was very liberating.”\n\nThat demonstration, on July 27, was New York’s first openly gay pride march.\n\nA movement had been born.\n\nToday, June is celebrated as Pride Month in the United States and many other countries because of the trans, lesbian and gay activists who rose up at Stonewall.\n\n'Home to everybody who is gay'\n\nThe history of the LGBTQ+ rights movement is often told in two parts: before and after Stonewall.\n\nThe bar, still operating from the same Christopher Street location, is now a mecca for LGBTQ+ people from around the world and anyone concerned about equality. Next door, a visitors center occupies space that was once part of the bar.\n\nTour guides include Stonewall among their stops at important New York City landmarks. Men and women too young to remember a time when same-sex relations were a crime pose for photos in front of the red-brick facade, with its arched doorway and neon sign in the window.\n\n“This is the home to everybody who is gay,” said Sequoia, now 86, who works at the bar on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays as the host and resident storyteller. “They all know about it – all over the world. Even in countries where it’s illegal to be homosexual, people know about Stonewall, and they come here to see it.”\n\nInside, the dark-paneled walls are decorated with memorabilia reflecting the bar’s history.\n\nA framed newspaper clipping from July 6, 1969, recounts the raid, beneath a derogatory headline from the New York Sunday News: “Homo Nest Raided, Queen Bees Are Stinging Mad.” At the entrance hangs the placard that police placed on the front door following the events of that summer nearly six decades ago. “THIS IS A RAIDED PREMISES,” it announces in all caps.\n\nJust across the street, black-and-white photos hanging on the wrought-iron fence surrounding Christopher Park show prominent figures and moments in the push for LGBTQ+ equality. At the center of the park, white-finished “Gay Liberation” sculptures by the artist George Segal depict two men standing next to each other, the hand of one resting on the other’s shoulder. Two other life-size figures are of women seated on a bench, one’s hand resting on the other’s lap.\n\nThe park, with its brick paving and benches, is part of the Stonewall National Monument, a 7.7-acre site that includes the bar’s exterior and the surrounding streets where much of the rioting happened.\n\nKeeping Stonewall’s legacy alive and educating younger generations is important because “if you don’t know your past, you may not have a future,” said Stacy Lentz, one of the bar’s current owners.\n\nStonewall veterans, members of the community and Americans across the country are infuriated by the elimination of trans people from the National Park Service’s website.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. But the Park Service said in a statement to USA TODAY that references to transgender people were removed to align with Trump’s executive orders recognizing just two genders and targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nLentz said she was stunned by the Trump administration’s decision.\n\n“In the days right after (the riots) and in terms of keeping the movement alive, when a lot of other gay and lesbian and bi people were more and more scared, a lot of trans folks were more vocal – maybe because they felt like they had nothing to lose.”\n\nIn the decades since, they continue to face threats. Trans women, in particular, have remained easy targets for criminals and politicians. More than 2,800 hate crimes were recorded against LGBTQ+ people in 2023, according to a report by the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group. Of those, nearly 550 were committed against transgender people or people whose gender identity fell outside traditional gender norms and roles, the report said.\n\nIn 2024, more than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in state legislatures, and more than 40 became law in 14 states, the report said. The previous year, lawmakers approved more than 85 anti-LGBTQ+ laws. Most of them specifically targeted trans people, limiting their access to gender-affirming medical care, public restrooms and school sports.\n\nLandmark of liberation\n\nStonewall is the only federal monument dedicated to LGBTQ+ history, which makes its preservation all the more meaningful, Segal said.\n\n“If you want to feel proud of the civil rights movement that was led by numerous people throughout the years, you might go to the Pettus Bridge (in Alabama),” he said. “You might come to Independence Hall (in Philadelphia) if you want to feel proud about patriotism in America. If you want to feel proud about the building of the LGBTQ community and where that started, you come to Stonewall.”\n\nThat’s why it’s so important to tell the uncensored story of Stonewall, the movement it started, and the people involved, including those who are trans, Segal said.\n\n“We had to fight back (at Stonewall), and we will continue to fight back now against this administration,” he said.\n\nHe’s confident that, just like on that hot summer morning in 1969, they will prevail.\n\nFollow Michael Collins on X @mcollinsNEWS.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/01"}]}

The rise of ultra-popular fast fashion websites Shein and Temu had cut into sales for the jewelry store chain, which has 1,326 company-operated stores in the U.S. Other detrimental factors: rising interest rates, inflation and tariffs on goods from China.\n\nKnown for its ear piercings and teen fashion accessories, the chain joins other companies facing bankruptcies and store closings such as At Home, Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl's, JCPenney, Macy's and Party City.\n\nHere's what to know, including which stores are closing.\n\nWhy is Claire's filing for backtuptcy?\n\nAhead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing, the company had sought to find a buyer for all or part of the business, and identified 18 stores it would close, according to filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.\n\n\"This decision is difficult, but a necessary one. Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire's and its stakeholders,\" said Claire's CEO Chris Cramer in the news release. \"We remain in active discussions with potential strategic and financial partners and are committed to completing our review of strategic alternatives.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Claire's deferred payments on debt interest as a way to conserve cash, Bloomberg reported.

The retailer offers a wide array of fabrics, crafting tools, decor and do-it-yourself kits for crafters of all ages and abilities.\n\nThe \"under-consumption core\" trend took social media by storm in 2024, offering ways for people to spend less money and get more out of what they already own by mending worn-out clothing, upcycling fabrics into unique, handmade items and transforming old trinkets by breathing new life into them. Despite this trend encouraging folks to embrace the joy and efforts of DIY-ing, this surge in interest hasn’t been enough to keep Joann comfortably afloat.\n\nNow, crafters in Lane County will have only one Joann store available to them locally.\n\nThe Ohio-based company, founded in 1943, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2024. At the time, it secured $132 million in new financing, which it expected would reduce its total $1 billion debt by about $500 million.\n\nOn Jan. 15, the company released a statement revealing that it would once again initiate a voluntary Chapter 11 process to “facilitate a sale process to maximize the value of its business.” This marks the second time in a one-year period that Joann is filing for bankruptcy.\n\nBy mid-February, the retailer submitted court documents listing the 533 stores set for closure across 49 states as part of the company's bankruptcy court proceedings. Oregon is set to lose 15 locations statewide.\n\nWhat is Chapter 11 bankruptcy?\n\nChapter 11 bankruptcy, also known as a “reorganization” bankruptcy, typically allows the debtor to maintain possessions while a reorganization is proposed and enacted. This reorganization is intended to restructure a business, allowing greater flexibility in repaying debts.\n\nDuring Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the debtor is allowed to continue operating its business and can borrow new money with court approval. When a reorganization is proposed, the affected creditors may vote on the plan.\n\nWhat will happen to Joann locations in Eugene and Springfield?\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Joann told USAToday the company is looking to \"right-size its store footprint\" by closing about 500 of its roughly 850 store locations.\n\n\"This was a very difficult decision to make, given the major impact we know it will have on our Team Members, our customers and all of the communities we serve,\" the statement from Joann said. \"A careful analysis of store performance and future strategic fit for the Company determined which stores should remain operating as usual at this time.\"\n\nThe Eugene-Springfield metropolitan area currently has two Joann locations:\n\n1024 Green Acres Road, Eugene\n\n2122 Marcola Road, Springfield\n\nThe Springfield Joann location was part of the list of planned closures, meaning residents of the area will soon have to travel to the Eugene location if they want Joann to meet their crafting needs.\n\nWhat other Joann locations are closing in Oregon?\n\nJoann plans to close 15 store locations in Oregon.\n\nThe following locations are planned for closure:\n\n732 SW Sixth St., Redmond\n\n932 NW Circle Blvd., Corvallis\n\n2122 Marcola Road, Springfield\n\n2248 Santiam Highway SE, Albany\n\n4069 NW Logan Road, Lincoln City\n\n1324 W Sixth St., The Dalles\n\n1611 Virginia Ave., North Bend\n\n180 SE Neptune Drive, Warrenton\n\n1090 Northeast E St., Grants Pass\n\n2880 South Sixth St., Klamath Falls\n\n1401 N Highway 99 W, Mcminnville\n\n1842 Molalla Ave., Oregon City\n\n7270 Ne Butler St, Hillsboro\n\n4005 SE 117th St, Beaverton\n\n10174 SE 82nd Ave., Clackamas\n\nWhile losing 15 stores across the state, Oregon still isn't one of the states most impacted by Joann closures.

Gymboree employs more than 11,000 people, including 10,500 hourly workers.\n\nThe bankruptcy was widely expected after Gymboree refused to pay some of its bills in recent months, placing the retailer on a collision course with creditors. The retailer said in its filing late Sunday that it hopes to slash $1 billion of its $1.4 billion in debt and to win approval for its plan by Sept. 24.\n\n\"We expect to move through this process quickly and emerge as a stronger organization that is better positioned in today’s evolving retail landscape, with the right size store footprint and greater financial flexibility to invest in Gymboree’s long-term growth,\" the retailer'sCEO Daniel Griesemer said in a statement.\n\nLike other retailers, Gymboree buckled amid declining mall traffic, fixed rental costs and online competition. Other mall retailers that have recently succumbed to bankruptcy filings include Payless ShoeSource, Rue21 and The Limited.\n\nGlobal financial services giant Credit Suisse predicted last week that up to 25% of nation's malls could close by 2022.\n\nAs shoppers flock to Amazon and other e-commerce options, online sales represent only 21% of Gymboree's revenue, and its web systems are \"dated and unsupported,\" recently appointed Chief Restructuring Officer James Mesterharm said in a court filing.\n\nMesterharm also said Gymboree had \"struggled against other established brick-and-mortar retailers,\" including Children's Place and GapKids.\n\nAmong other shortcomings, Gymboree failed to innovate quickly, having only recently introduced store email, analytics and tablet computers to help employees do their jobs.\n\nThe turmoil also resulted in recent leadership changes. The company's CEO since 2013, Mark Breitbard, resigned April 3. His permanent replacement, Daniel Griesemer, was appointed May 22. Upon filing for bankruptcy, the company announced the exit of Chief Financial Officer Andy North and the appointment of interim CFO Liyuan Woo, a consultant at restructuring firm AlixPartners.\n\nThe company declined to make executives available to comment and did not release a list of store closures.\n\nThe bankruptcy represents a bitter outcome for Gymboree owner Bain Capital Private Equity, which acquired the retailer for $1.8 billion in 2010 and launched a major global expansion.\n\nStill, Gymboree posted a profit before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $71 million in 2016, down from $94 million in 2015.\n\nFiling for bankruptcy while still profitable could give Gymboree a shot at finding a sustainable path forward. The company said it had secured a deal with certain secured lenders to restructure its debts and reemerge from bankruptcy, an accord that would require a federal bankruptcy judge's approval.\n\nFounded in San Francisco in 1976 as a program devoted to nurturing child learning through playtime with parents, Gymboree started its first store in 1986 and now operates stores worldwide under three brands: Gymboree, upscale chain Janie & Jack and value-focused Crazy 8.\n\nThe company's fiscal distress is particularly problematic for mall owners Simon Property Group and GGP, formerly General Growth Properties, which collectively control 35% of Gymboree's U.S. real estate space.\n\nMoody's: Number of distressed retailers tops total during financial crisis\n\nInvestor concern over Gymboree's future worsened when the company disclosed that it had missed a June 1 payment on senior notes due in 2018.\n\nGymboree also was among 22 companies that a June 7 report by rating giant Moody's Investors Service characterized as distressed retailers. The rating that Moody's assigned to Gymboree's debt is far below investment grade.\n\nSimilarly, a previous Moody's report on distressed retailers issued in March attributed Gymboree's low rating to \"the company's high debt burden and weak credit metrics stemming from the 2010 acquisition of the company by affiliates of Bain Capital and subsequent weak operating performance.\"\n\nNoting that Gymboree faced approaching maturities of an asset-based revolving loan in December 2017 and a secured term loan in February 2018, the report said refinancing the debts \"could be challenging.\"\n\n\"Thus, the risk of default, including the potential for a distressed exchange-type restructuring, is very high,\" the March report said.\n\nContributing: Kevin McCoy\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/04/charlotte-russe-bankruptcy/2771165002/", "title": "Charlotte Russe files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, will close 94 stores", "text": "Updated Feb. 4, 2019, 5:18 p.m. ET\n\nFashion retailer Charlotte Russe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with plans to close about 94 stores and seek a sale.

The company has more than 8,700 employees.\n\nThe bankruptcy marks the latest in a series of similar cases among mall retailers that have been unable to identify a sustainable path amid declining foot traffic and intense digital competition.\n\nCharlotte Russe, which also controls Peek stores, said it had received a bankruptcy financing package worth up to $50 million to help it continue operating.\n\nThe company, which caters its items toward young women's fashion, has more than 500 stores in 49 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nFor now, those stores remain open.

That made it three Super Bowl wins in the past five years – including back-to-back titles – for the Chiefs, one of the best runs of sustained success in NFL history.\n\nWith Patrick Mahomes leading the way, the Chiefs ran through the 2024 regular season in impressive fashion, racking up 15 wins en route to grabbing the top seed in the AFC playoffs.

See the highlights\n\nHow many Super Bowl wins do Kansas City Chiefs have?\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have won four Super Bowls, one of the highest figures in the NFL. Only the New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys have more.\n\nThe Chiefs made it to the first Super Bowl ever, but lost to the Green Bay Packers following the 1966 season. In Super Bowl 4, Kansas City won the big game for the first time, but the wait for a follow-up would end up lasting 50 years.\n\nKansas City has made up for lost time since then, though, going to four of the past five Super Bowls. That includes wins at Super Bowls 54, 57 and 58.\n\nKansas City Chiefs 2024 record\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs posted an impressive 15-2 record in the 2024 NFL regular season, good enough to claim the top seed in the AFC (and the first-round playoff bye that came along with it).\n\nHere is a brief rundown of every Chiefs game in the regular season:\n\nHas there ever been a Super Bowl three-peat?\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are back-to-back Super Bowl winners, but no team in the Super Bowl era has ever managed to make it three in a row.\n\nAs impressive as Kansas City's achievement over the past two seasons is, it's not particularly rare. The Chiefs are the ninth team to win two consecutive Super Bowls, meaning roughly one in six NFL champions repeat the following season. It's the three-peat that has proven elusive.\n\nSome have come close: the Miami Dolphins lost Super Bowl 6 before winning the next two seasons, while the Pittsburgh Steelers managed to repeat twice in a six-year span (1974-1979), but both streaks were broken at the third attempt. Between 2001-04, the New England Patriots won three Super Bowls, but a failure to make the playoffs during the 2002 season broke their chances of making NFL history.\n\nThe closest anyone has come to a three-peat is the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys. The 49ers won titles in 1988 and 1989 but fell to the eventual champion New York Giants 15-13 in the NFC championship game after the 1990 season. Emmitt Smith and Co. won Super Bowls 27, 28 and 30, but a 38-28 loss to the 49ers in the NFC championship game in the 1994 season interrupted the streak.\n\nHow to watch Super Bowl 2025: Time, TV channel, streaming\n\nSuper Bowl 59 between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will be televised nationally on Fox and can be streamed on Tubi or Fubo, which is offering a free trial for new subscribers.\n\nDate: Sunday, Feb. 9\n\nSunday, Feb. 9 Time: 6:30 p.m. ET\n\n6:30 p.m. ET TV : Fox\n\n: Fox Streaming: Fubo, Tubi\n\nFubo, Tubi Location: Caesars Superdome (New Orleans)\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

There are 12", "text": "Jan. 28, 2026, 10:00 a.m. ET\n\nThe Super Bowl is nothing more than a big dish for some NFL teams.\n\nFilled with chips, dip or countless other snacks, there are 12 teams every season that can only dream of what it would be like to win a Super Bowl. Four of those teams can only dream of what it's like to even get to one without needing a ticket.\n\nAnother season is almost in the books and the Super Bowl 60 matchup is set.\n\nThe New England Patriots will take on the Seattle Seahawks in a rematch of Super Bowl 49. Despite being one of the more unpredictable seasons in recent NFL history, the two finalists have been there before.\n\nExpert NFL Playoffs picks: Exclusive betting insights only at USA TODAY.\n\nFive of the 14 playoff teams are on the list of teams that haven't won the biggest game of the season. The playoff results ensure that will be the case for at least another year.\n\nHere's the list of teams that haven't won the Super Bowl and a look at the teams that are still searching for their first appearance.\n\nWhat NFL teams have never won a Super Bowl?\n\nThe Cardinals franchise dates back to 1898, making it the oldest professional football club in the NFL, according to the league. They've bounced around through their history, beginning in Chicago as one of the NFL's founding teams. They eventually moved to St. Louis, Mo., before heading west to the desert, settling in Arizona.\n\nDespite all that history, the Cardinals have made just one Super Bowl appearance, losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl 43.\n\nThe Falcons entered the NFL during the Super Bowl's first season but still haven't captured one. In two appearances, Atlanta fell short in Super Bowl 33 and lost more famously in Super Bowl 51. The New England Patriots would win that game after the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead.\n\nAs good as Buffalo has been in recent history, it still hasn't reached the top. They've been around for 66 seasons and arguably have experienced some of the most heartbreak. As if losing four consecutive Super Bowls in the 1990s wasn't enough, they also ran into the Kansas City Chiefs' dynasty. Their presence has blocked Buffalo from reaching the Super Bowl, knocking them out of the playoffs four times in the last six seasons. Even without the Chiefs in the postseason, they fell short against the Denver Broncos in the divisional round, ensuring they're set for another long offseason of wondering what could've been.\n\nOne of the NFL's younger teams, the Panthers have only 31 seasons of experience. Still, they've played in the big game twice, losing Super Bowls 38 and 50. Carolina's recent run has relegated them to the basement of the league, but it's not far off from their dominant seasons with Cam Newton under center. In Super Bowl 50, the Panthers ran into Peyton Manning's storybook ending, wasting a 15-1 regular season. The Panthers were back in the postseason for the first time since 2017, but lost to the Los Angeles Rams in the wild-card round to keep the drought alive for at least another year.\n\nOften associated with losing in the wild-card round thanks to the Marvin Lewis days, Cincinnati has been to three Super Bowls, losing 16, 23 and 56. They've typically been described as a cheap franchise, seemingly unwilling to invest whatever it takes to win. Another tough, injury-filled year leaves the Bengals with more questions than answers. The biggest? Did the Super Bowl window already close?\n\nA juggernaut before the formation of the NFL and then the Super Bowl, the Browns have eight championships in team history. However, that couldn't be further from the case in recent history. Not only has Cleveland failed to win a Super Bowl, but they haven't even made it to one. Maybe one day, Cleveland.\n\nThe Lions' franchise has been around since 1930. They claimed four championships before the first Super Bowl but haven't won since the big game was introduced. Like the Browns, the Lions haven't even made it to the event.\n\nThe youngest NFL franchise, the Texans turned 24 this season. Despite hosting two Super Bowls at their stadium, the Texans have required an entry ticket each time. Typically associated with the 4:30 p.m. ET kickoff on Saturday afternoon on wild-card weekend, Houston is still trying to break through in the AFC to reach their first Super Bowl. The Texans finally graduated to a different schedule slot this year, but it wasn't enough to propel them past the Patriots in the divisional round, meaning Houston's problem won't be solved in the immediate future.\n\nLike their AFC South mates, the Jaguars are also seeking their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Although they have played 31 seasons, they are a little older than their Houston foes but they have at least made the conference championship game three times. Jacksonville entered the playoffs with high hopes, but it fell victim to a last-minute comeback by Buffalo in the wild-card round to end those dreams for the 2025 season.\n\nThe Chargers profile as one of the NFL's cursed franchises – relegated to a reality of often being good but never being good enough. The Chargers joined the league from the AFL in the merger, but have only had the honor of playing in Super Bowl 29, losing in what was their only appearance in team history. The Chargers were another teamthe Patriots beat on the road to Super Bowl 60.\n\nWhile some other teams know all about the pain of falling short, no one knows it like the Vikings. The franchise has seen plenty of wins, posting a 546-446-11 record. Despite all that success, it hasn't translated to the playoffs. The Vikings have lost six times in the NFC championship game and four times in the Super Bowl. Whether it was Brett Favre's interception in 2010 or Blair Walsh's missed 27-yard field goal in the wild-card round, there is plenty of subject matter and none of it is particularly good.\n\nNot even Stefon Diggs' \"Minneapolis Miracle\" can compensate for all that heartbreak. They'll have to overcome the Minnesota sports curse, but you'd have to think that the Vikings can one day make their Super Bowl dream a reality.\n\nClosing out the list of Super Bowl-less teams is the Titans. Tennessee has been a team of peaks and valleys but has always found itself without a seat in the champions' chair when the music stops. They've only appeared once in the big game, losing Super Bowl 34 to the Rams.\n\nThe Tennessee version of the franchise has only been around since the 1997 season, but its history extends back to 1960 as the Houston Oilers. If it's any consolation, they won two AFL championships in 1960 and 1961.\n\nWhat NFL teams have never made a Super Bowl?\n\nOnly four NFL teams have not played in a Super Bowl – the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/chiefs/2024/12/25/kansas-city-chiefs-super-bowl-wins/77200844007/", "title": "Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl wins: How many do they have?", "text": "Dec. 25, 2024, 6:04 a.m. ET\n\nAs back-to-back Super Bowl champions holding the NFL's best record in 2024, the Kansas City Chiefs are closing in on \"dynasty\" status.

Both quarterbacks would meet up again three years later in Super Bowl 13, when Bradshaw and the Steelers staved off a late fourth-quarter comeback from Staubach and the Cowboys.\n\nIn the two Super Bowls against Staubach, Bradshaw threw for 518 yards and six touchdowns. Meanwhile, Staubach threw for 432 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nBradshaw's first win over Staubach made the Steelers the third NFL franchise to win back-to-back Super Bowls. He is the only quarterback to win back-to-back Super Bowls twice in his career, as the Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl 14.\n\nTroy Aikman and Jim Kelly\n\nSuper Bowl 27: Dallas Cowboys 52, Buffalo Bills 17\n\nDallas Cowboys 52, Buffalo Bills 17 Super Bowl 28: Dallas Cowboys 30, Buffalo Bills 13\n\nWho could forget about the 1990s and the dominance of the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills with Troy Aikman and Jim Kelly?\n\nAikman led the Cowboys back to the Super Bowl for the first time in over a decade in 1993 with a roster that was filled with talent, highlighted by Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith. In Super Bowl 27, Aikman threw for four touchdowns — two to Irvin, and one each to Jay Novacek and Alvin Harper — in the Cowboys' 52-17 rout of the Bills.\n\nThe Hall of Famer and now \"Monday Night Football\" analyst came out on top again the year later, giving Kelly a 0-4 record in four consecutive Super Bowls from 1990-1994 — the only quarterback to do so. Buffalo has not returned to the Big Game since, and is one of 12 teams that have not won a Lombardi Trophy in NFL history.\n\nAikman and Kelly are the only quarterbacks in Super Bowl history to play against each other in back-to-back Super Bowls.\n\nEli Manning and Tom Brady\n\nSuper Bowl 42: Giants 17, Patriots 14\n\nGiants 17, Patriots 14 Super Bowl 46: Giants 21, Patriots 17\n\nTom Brady and Bill Belichick built the New England Patriots into one of the NFL's greatest dynasties during their 20 seasons together in Foxborough with six Super Bowl titles and 13 conference championship appearances.\n\nHowever, their Achilles heel was Eli Manning and the New York Giants.\n\nIn Super Bowl 42, Manning guided the Giants to a late fourth-quarter 17-14 comeback victory to stop Brady from leading the Patriots to being the first team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to go undefeated for the entire season with a Super Bowl victory. En route to his go-ahead touchdown pass, Manning, of course, connected with David Tyree for the famous \"helmet catch\" on third-and-5.\n\nThe future Hall of Fame quarterback replicated that success in Super Bowl 46 when he led the Giants to their fourth Super Bowl title in franchise history with a 21-17 win.

So, just being able to become wiser, grow and mature and take all these lessons in for the next season and the next games.\n\n\"It's had a great driving force. It lit a flame, lit a fire in me, and to have this opportunity again is exactly what you work for.\"\n\nAdded Mahomes on if he will take anything from Super Bowl 57 into Super Bowl 59: \"You take a couple of things (from then) just (because) they are a lot of the same players.

Then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders ripped the team at the time for what she said was an attempt to pull \"a political stunt.\" The White House instead hosted a brief, awkward event the next day that it described as a celebration of America.\n\nTrump has at times had a frosty relationship with the NFL and its players. During his first term, he repeatedly criticized players, sometimes in explicit terms, who kneeled during the national anthem to protest racial inequality. \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners ... say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out. He's fired,\" he said at a 2017 rally.\n\nOnly one of the four teams that won a Super Bowl during Trump's first term in office made a trip to the White House: The New England Patriots in 2017. NBA teams, whose players are also predominantly Black, either were not invited to visit the White House or declined to attend. And, in a departure from precedent, several championship teams in women's sports did not receive invitations during Trump's first term.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2026/02/08/super-bowl-60-live-score-updates-patriots-seahawks-2026/88533096007/", "title": "Seahawks slow Patriots, take home Super Bowl 60 win - USA Today", "text": "Feb. 8, 2026 Updated Feb. 9, 2026, 8:34 a.m. ET\n\nThe story of Super Bowl 60 was written by the defense. And also Kenneth Walker. And kind of Jason Myers.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are NFL champions for the 2025 season after taking down the New England Patriots, 29-13, in a defensive showdown. Neither team’s offense scored a touchdown until two were scored on consecutive possessions to open the fourth quarter – and then only once more.\n\nUltimately, Seattle won because its “Dark Side” defense – the 2025 Seahawks’ answer to the franchise’s “Legion of Boom” defense of the decade prior – was more overwhelming than New England’s. The Seahawks sacked Patriots quarterback Drake Maye six times for 43 cumulative yards lost. They forced three turnovers that led to two touchdowns and a field goal, and the Seattle defense didn’t allow New England into the red zone until the final three minutes of the game.\n\nOn offense, the Seahawks’ biggest star was easily Walker, their running back. The fourth-year tailback finished the game with 29 touches for 161 yards – his third-highest total in a single game in his career. The performance was one fitting of the man that had helped put Seattle’s offense on his back throughout the playoffs – it was his third game in a row with more than 20 touches and 100-plus scrimmage yards.\n\nWhile the Patriots excelled at bending and not breaking on defense – allowing just one touchdown to the Seahawks in four red-zone trips – their offense was unable to keep up. Myers, the Seahawks’ kicker, set a Super Bowl record with his five field goals as head coach Mike Macdonald was happy to take the points whenever his team got the chance.\n\nWith the Super Bowl 60 victory, Macdonald, 38, becomes the third-youngest NFL head coach to win a Lombardi Trophy. He’s also the fourth ever to win a Super Bowl before his 40th birthday.\n\nHere’s a look at how this year’s big game unfolded as USA TODAY Sports provided live updates throughout the contest:\n\nSuper Bowl 60 takeaways\n\nThe Seahawks defense had one of the best Super Bowl performances ever . Seattle's \"Dark Side\" defense lived up to their nickname against New England. The Patriots were hardly able to do anything offensively in Super Bowl 60, as the Seahawks held them scoreless for three quarters and only allowed 13 total points in the blowout win. Seattle generated six sacks – showing off their elite and diverse pressure packages – while the team's secondary played sticky coverage and made it difficult for Drake Maye to read the field. The whole unit deserves credit for their star showing, with Devon Witherspoon, Byron Murphy and Derick Hall being among the biggest stars of Super Bowl 60.\n\n.

The whole unit deserves credit for their star showing, with Devon Witherspoon, Byron Murphy and Derick Hall being among the biggest stars of Super Bowl 60. Kenneth Walker was the engine that drove Seattle's offense . Sam Darnold had a solid, mistake-free showing in Super Bowl 60. However, it was Walker who catalyzed Seattle's offense and provided it a path to victory against New England. Walker ran consistently throughout the night, finding a lot of success on outside zone runs and generating plenty of chunk plays. The Seahawks needed him to be a bell-cow back with Zach Charbonnet (torn ACL) out for the game, and Walker delivered, generating 135 yards on 27 carries. Without the 25-year-old, the Seahawks may not have broken through as quickly against a New England defense that played well in the first half.\n\n.

Without the 25-year-old, the Seahawks may not have broken through as quickly against a New England defense that played well in the first half. Drake Maye had to be better for the Patriots than he was . Maye had to play better than he did across his first three playoff games to give New England a chance to win Super Bowl 60. The second-year pro was unable to deliver. He struggled immensely against Seattle's stalwart defense, looking uncomfortable in the pocket and failing to adjust to the pressure looks Mike Macdonald's defense gave them throughout the night. Maye completed just 27 of 43 passes for 295 yards but had just two touchdowns compared to three turnovers. That included two in the fourth quarter, a critical interception when New England trailed by 12 points and a strip-sack fumble that was returned for a touchdown.\n\n.

That included two in the fourth quarter, a critical interception when New England trailed by 12 points and a strip-sack fumble that was returned for a touchdown. The Patriots have to figure out their offensive line in 2026. New England's offensive line was an issue throughout its first three postseason games, allowing Drake Maye to be sacked five times in each game. The Patriots were still able to win those contests, but their luck ran out in the Super Bowl. The unit allowed Maye to be sacked a postseason-high six times while Will Campbell continued to struggle immensely against both power and speed on Maye's blindside. New England's offensive line was much better in 2025 than it was in 2024, but general manager Eliot Wolf will need to continue to add to the unit in the offseason – and decide whether Campbell can hold up long-term on the outside.\n\nSeahawks beat Patriots 29-13 in Super Bowl 60\n\nThe Seahawks have earned vengeance against the Patriots. They thrashed New England 29-13 in blowout fashion to win the franchise's second Super Bowl.\n\nSam Darnold is now a Super Bowl champion, and so too is DeMarcus Lawrence.\n\nWhat is the Super Bowl attendance?\n\nThe official number for this year's Super Bowl sits at 70,823. That's an increase over the 65,719 who attended in 2025 for Super Bowl 59.\n\nRhamondre Stevenson makes shoe-string catch for Patriots TD\n\nThe Patriots were able to march down the field against the Seahawks, and Drake Maye managed to get the team into the end-zone. It initially looked like the quarterback was going to run the ball in himself but he saw Stevenson flash open to his left.\n\nMaye dumped the pass to Stevenson, who made a great catch just before the ball hit the ground. The running back then scampered into the end-zone untouched to put the Patriots within 16.\n\nNew England decided to go for two after the play. They were unsuccessful, ensuring the score would stay 29-13.\n\nUchenna Nwosu scores TD after Seahawks defense strip-sacks Drake Maye\n\nThe Seahawks have effectively wrapped up Super Bowl 60. They tied a Super Bowl record by sacking Drake Maye a seventh time and the second-year quarterback lost the ball while dealing with the blitz.\n\nNwosu scooped up the loose ball and ran untouched to the end-zone. Jason Myers made the extra point and the Seahawks are winning by 22 with 4:27 left in regulation.\n\nSuper Bowl score update: Jason Myers makes fifth field goal to give Seahawks 15-point lead\n\nThe Patriots were able to prevent the Seahawks from getting into the end-zone. However, Seattle was able to bleed clock before Myers made a 26-yard field goal with 5:25 left in regulation to give the team a 22-7 lead.\n\nThe Patriots have two timeouts remaining but have no room for error as they look to overcome a two-touchdown deficit late in Super Bowl 60.\n\nSeahawks 22, Patriots 7\n\nJulian Love intercepts Drake Maye after with 8:37 left in regulation\n\nMaye's rough day at the office got worse midway through the fourth quarter. The Patriots quarterback stepped up in the pocket with the team trailing by 12 points in the fourth quarter and tossed a deep pass in the direction of Kyle Williams.\n\nMaye's pass floated harmlessly into the hands of Love, who returned it 35 yards to put the Seahawks on the edge of field goal range.\n\nThe Patriots are running out of time to make a comeback, and a Seahawks touchdown would likely put Super Bowl 60 out of reach.\n\nThe Super Bowl MVP vote consists partly of a fan vote and mostly of a vote by 16 media members.\n\nFans are responsible for 20% of the Super Bowl MVP vote on NFL.com. The remaining 80% of the vote is determined by 16 members of a media panel, who submit their ballots around the 2-minute warning at the end of the game. - Jack McKessy\n\nWho is the Patriots backup quarterback?\n\nJoshua Dobbs is the Patriots' backup quarterback and will assume that familiar role behind Maye in Super Bowl 60 against the Seahawks.\n\nDobbs joined the Patriots in free agency and is in his first season with the club. The 31-year-old was a fourth-round pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2017 NFL Draft but has been with nine different NFL organizations across his nine-season career to date.\n\nHow old is Drake Maye?\n\nDrake Maye is 23 years old. He is the second-youngest quarterback to ever start a Super Bowl, behind only Dan Marino.\n\nIf Maye can author an unlikely fourth-quarter comeback, Maye would become the youngest quarterback ever to win the Super Bowl. Ben Roethlisberger, who was also 23 when he won his first Super Bowl, currently owns the record.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba injury update: Seahawks WR returns\n\nAfter being treated for an ankle injury and evaluated for a concussion, wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba has returned to the field for Seattle.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 score update: Patriots get on board with Mack Hollins TD\n\nNew England finally got on the board shortly after Seattle's first touchdown. Maye finally had time enough in the pocket to feather a pass down the field to Hollins. The veteran wide-out managed to play through contact and make the grab before falling into the end-zone for the score.\n\nInterestingly, the Patriots opted to kick the extra point after the score to cut their deficit to 12 points. Andy Borregales' kick was good, but Mike Vrabel passed on an opportunity to cut Seattle's lead to 11, which would be a touchdown, two-point conversion and a field goal. A 12-point game means New England will need two touchdowns to complete an unlikely fourth-quarter comeback.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 score update: Sam Darnold finds AJ Barner for TD\n\nJust over a minute and a half into Super Bowl 60, the Seahawks scored the game's first touchdown. Barner went into motion before the play and managed to break open heading toward the back right part of the end-zone. Darnold was able to easily feather the pass to him, giving the Seahawks a three-score lead.\n\nJason Myers nailed the extra points, and Seattle is winning 19-0 with 13:24 remaining in regulation.\n\nSeahawks 19, Patriots 0\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba injury update\n\nSmith-Njigba was taken to the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion.\n\nThe receiver was checked out in the tent before heading back up the tunnel with the training staff. It initially appeared to be a leg injury for the Seahawks' star, but NBC's Melissa Stark noted that Smith-Njigba did hit his head on the field prior to coming off.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba injury update\n\nThe Seahawks wide receiver was seen being tended to on the sideline, with trainers applying a bandage to one of his ankles. Njigba didn't enter the medical tent, but it will be something to monitor as the game nears its fourth quarter.\n\nHow old is the Seahawks coach?\n\nThe Seahawks head coach, Mike Macdonald, is 38 years old.\n\nA native of Massachusetts, Macdonald was hired by Seattle ahead of the 2024 season after a stint as the Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator from 2022 to 2023. He was the youngest head coach in the NFL when the Seahawks hired him on Jan. 31, 2024.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 score: Jason Myers pushed the lead to double digits\n\nPoints have been at a premium in Super Bowl 60, but don’t tell Myers that. He nailed his fourth field goal of the contest to give the Seahawks the first score of the second half. A once-promising drive stalled, but Seattle will enjoy a 12-point lead for now with just 24 minutes left in the game.\n\nSeahawks 12, Patriots 0\n\nHow to watch the Super Bowl halftime show\n\nTV channel: NBC\n\nNBC Live stream: Peacock\n\nNBC owns the broadcast rights to the 2026 Super Bowl, so viewers can tune to their local affiliate to catch the game from beginning to end.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 score: Jason Myers nails third FG of the evening\n\nThe Seahawks' kicker has all of the points in Super Bowl 60 so far. Myers' 41-yard kick in the final seconds of the first half was his third made field goal of the big game in three attempts.\n\nSeattle holds a 9-0 lead with 11 seconds left in the first half. The Patriots will receive the kick to begin the second half.\n\nSeahawks 9, Patriots 0\n\nWhat time will Bad Bunny perform the Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nThere's no set time for the Super Bowl 60 halftime show, but viewers tuning in can expect the show to air anywhere between 8 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. ET, barring any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThat's about how long it should take Super Bowl 60 opponents, the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks, to get through a half of football.\n\nHow many teams has Sam Darnold played for?\n\nDarnold has played for five different teams during his eight-year NFL career. He started his career with the New York Jets before being traded to the Carolina Panthers ahead of the 2021 NFL season.\n\nDarnold has spent the last four seasons with four different teams. He was with the Panthers in 2022 before playing for the San Francisco 49ers in 2023, the Minnesota Vikings in 2024 and finally finding a long-term home with the Seattle Seahawks in 2025.\n\nWhat was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever?\n\nSuper Bowl 53 was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in NFL history. The New England Patriots won their sixth Lombardi Trophy by beating the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 during a game where just one touchdown was scored.\n\nJahlani Tavai injury update\n\nPatriots linebacker Jahlani Tavai suffered a shoulder injury. He is officially listed as questionable to return.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 score update: Jason Myers' second FG doubles Seahawks' lead\n\nThe Seahawks' offense made it back into the red zone for the first time since their first drive of the game, but their second quarter-opening drive ended the same way: with Myers kicking a short field goal.\n\nMyers' second kick of the game was from 39 yards out and gave Seattle a 6-0 lead with 11:16 left before halftime.\n\nSeahawks 6, Patriots 0\n\nSeahawks sack Drake Maye again to force punt\n\nNew England's offense lost yardage in three consecutive plays. On third-and-15 following two negative plays to TreVeyon Henderson, Seahawks cornerback Devon Witherspoon got to the Patriots' quarterback for the second sack of the game.\n\nNew England punted on 4th and 25 and Seattle's offense gets the ball back on their own 13-yard line with 3:29 to go in the first quarter.\n\nSeahawks 3, Patriots 0\n\nSuper Bowl 60 update: Patriots punt after reaching midfield\n\nOn first-and-10 from the Seahawks' 45-yard line, Derick Hall brought down Maye for a sack. The loss of 10 yards forced 2nd and long and the New England offense couldn't get the yardage back.\n\nA Bryce Baringer punt pins the Seahawks inside their own 10-yard line. Seattle takes over with 7:11 to go in the first quarter.\n\nSeahawks 3, Patriots 0\n\nSuper Bowl 60 score update: Seattle gets on the board first with FG\n\nThe Seahawks managed to go 51 yards in just seven plays but Sam Darnold's throw on third-and-7 from the Patriots' 14-yard line fell incomplete in Rashid Shaheed's direction.\n\nJason Myers' 33-yard field goal gives us the first points of Super Bowl 60. Seattle takes the lead with 11:58 to go in the first quarter.\n\nSeahawks 3, Patriots 0\n\nWho won the Super Bowl coin toss?\n\nThe Patriots won the coin toss and elected to defer to the second half. Seattle will have the ball on offense first to open Super Bowl 60. Tails, in this case, did fail for the Seahawks. – Ayrton Ostly\n\nSuper Bowl 60 uniforms make history\n\nWhile this Super Bowl could have looked so much cooler if the league permitted throwbacks and/or alternate jerseys in its Roman Numeral showcase, Super Bowl 60 did make a bit of haberdashery history.\n\nFor the first time on Super Sunday, believe it or not, both teams were in monochromatic uniform combinations, Seattle in College Navy from head to toe, while New England, the designated home team, chose to wear its customary all-white road look. And, in case you were wondering, the Tom Brady-led Patriots that beat the Seahawks in Super Bowl 49 wore white jerseys and blue pants. – Nate Davis\n\nWho sang the national anthem at the Super Bowl?\n\nCharlie Puth performed the national anthem at the 2026 Super Bowl in Santa Clara.\n\nIt will be the singer's first time performing at the Super Bowl in any capacity.\n\nHow long was the Super Bowl national anthem 2026?\n\nThe 2026 Super Bowl national anthem unofficially lasted 1 minute and 53 seconds, from the song's first word until the end of the final note held.
