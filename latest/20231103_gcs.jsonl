Still, Hurd, who sat at a mere 1% in a September Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll, has openly criticized Trump during his 14 weeks on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring the Republican Party of Iowa’s annual Lincoln Dinner in Des Moines in July, Hurd told the crowd Trump was running for president not to represent voters, but to \"stay out of prison.\" He was roundly booed.\n\nHe doubled down on that criticism during a visit to the Iowa State Fair this past August, arguing that the Republican party needed to grow its voting base to defeat Biden.\n\n“Donald Trump lost the house in 2018.

He would have had trouble qualifying for the third Republican debate on Nov. 8 in Miami.\n\nAs supporters cheered, Pence told the Las Vegas forum that while he is leaving the presidential race, \"I will never leave the fight for conservative values.\"\n\nPence did not, however, endorse any of the remaining presidential candidates.\n\nPence, Trump and Jan. 6\n\nA former congressman and governor of Indiana, Pence may be back in the news in 2024. He may be called as a witness in the federal trial of Trump on charges that he tried to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the highest-profile moment of his political career, Pence refused Trump's demand that he, in his capacity as president of the Senate, throw out electoral votes that elected Biden. Pence said he lacked the legal right to essentially hand the election to Trump.\n\nThat decision preceded the pro-Trump insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021. It also drew continuous criticism of Pence by Trump and his allies, both before and during the vice president's brief presidential campaign.\n\nPence testified before a Jan. 6 grand jury in April.\n\nTrump told supporters in Las Vegas late Saturday that Pence should endorse him because “I made him vice president.” The former president added that he doubted he would get Pence’s supportbecause “people in politics are very disloyal.”\n\nEndorsement: Other candidates praise Pence\n\nSome of the remaining candidates quickly praised Pence, perhaps hoping he will endorse them.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, also speaking to the Republican Jewish Coalition, said the vice president has long fought for Israel, for Republicans, and for Americans in general.\n\n\"We all owe him a debt of gratitude,\" Haley said.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said on the social media site X, formerly Twitter, that Pence has been “a prayer partner, a friend, and a man of integrity and deep conviction.”\n\n“The Republican Party is stronger today” because of Pence’s leadership, Scott said. “I have no doubt Mike and Karen will continue to serve this nation and honor the Lord in all they do.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called Pence \"a principled man of faith who has worked tirelessly to advance the conservative cause.\"\n\n\"Casey and I appreciate Mike and Karen for their willingness to put themselves forward in this campaign and wish the Pence family well in their next steps,\" DeSantis said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie praised Pence’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021: “Mike Pence stood for the constitution of the United States. He deserves our thanks as Americans for putting his oath of office and the Constitution of the United States before personal and political pressure.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee said Pence's biggest problem was the Trump Republican agenda.\n\n\"Pence set the tone for the Republican primary, ensuring Republican candidates lined up behind an extreme agenda of banning abortion nationwide, slashing Social Security and Medicare, and campaigning for election deniers,\" said DNC spokesperson Sarafina Chitika. \"Good riddance.”\n\nNo traction against Trump\n\nPence ended his longshot bid for the GOP presidential nomination after being unable to gain traction in a party that has been transformed by the person he helped elect in 2016: Trump.\n\nThe first former vice president in modern times to run against the president under whom he served, Pence had been unfailingly loyal to Trump until the president pushed him to block Congress’ certification of their electoral loss.\n\nDuring the campaign, Pence said Trump disqualified himself for a second shot at the White House by asking him to ignore the Constitution.\n\nTrump responded by calling Pence disloyal. Other Republicans opposed to Trump, however, declined to get behind Pence's 2024 candidacy, pointing to his previous subservience to Trump during the 2016 campaign and the presidency.\n\nHistory also trended against Pence; of the last ten vice presidents, only two have been elected president: George H. W. Bush and Joe Biden.\n\nUnable to catch Trump\n\nSo far, Pence and other challengers have been unable to make Trump's legal problems an issue against him. The former president is dominating the field while Pence has been polling in the single digits and had lackluster fundraising.\n\nStill, running for president gave Pence the chance to be his own man after four years of bending himself to Trump’s will, and to tell his side of the story.\n\n“I do think Mike Pence wanted to reclaim his own identity,” David Axelrod, who served as senior advisor to former President Barack Obama, said on a recent episode of the podcast “Hacks on Taps.”\n\nPence tried to re-introduce himself\n\nPence had argued he was well known but not known well – and sought to reintroduce himself to voters.\n\nBut what he is most known for – Jan. 6 – kept coming up on the campaign trail. He was both attacked for his defiance of Trump and praised for it, though those who praised him weren’t necessarily going to vote for him.\n\nPence’s bid was also a bit of an about face from 2016. As Trump’s running mate, Pence lauded Trump for creating a movement.\n\nThis year, Pence warned Republicans that Trump’s populism is a “road to ruin” for the party.\n\nHe urged Republicans to return to the tenets of the pre-Trump GOP, limited government, social conservatism and hawkish national security.\n\nBut his throwback to Ronald Reagan Republicanism was not a winning message.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/10/19/2024-voters-gop-candidates-drop-out/71218329007/", "title": "Thin out the 2024 field?

Some are trekking to the state capitol in Concord to sign their name at a historic desk to be on the ballot.\n\nOthers are sharing their messages through several town halls and other stops, including a GOP dinner that happens once every eight years.\n\nVoters have a message, too: some of you need to drop out.\n\n\"It’s still early. There's still a lot on that stage,\" said Laura Williams, a registered Republican from Rochester, N.H., who plans to vote in the primary. \"Let some weed themselves out, and those that rise to the top, you know, we’ll wait it out and see.\"\n\nWhether Granite State natives or political tourists traveling across states lines to get a closer glimpse at the candidates, many are wishing for fewer options after what some called a disastrous second primary debate hosted by the Republican National Committee in California.\n\n\"Frankly, I was put off by all their debate performances in the last one. They were all talking over one another,\" Vaughn Annis, a retired chemical engineer, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"The field was too crowded on that stage to get anything as a meaningful debate.\"\n\nAnnis, a registered Republican who hails from Henniker, N.H., hasn't made up his mind on a presidential candidate, but he is giving Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott closer attention.\n\nA candidate he would like to see exit this race is former Donald Trump, the frontrunner with a commanding lead.\n\n\"Where I have voted in the past for him, I think Trump needs to step aside and let others move forward, younger people in the party that aren't as controversial,\" Annis said. \"I think that would be helpful for not only the party but also the country.\"\n\nTrump rules, but N.H. primary remains fluid\n\nA USA TODAY/Boston Globe/Suffolk University survey of likely voters showed Trump at 49% with Haley, a former South Carolina governor, the closest rival at 19%.\n\nThe non-Trump voters say they are hoping one of the other Republicans can break through, but they are by no means certain that's possible.\n\nLarry Provencher, a semi-retired artist in Exeter, N.H., fears Trump may be the Republican nominee, adding how he believes the former president \"just lost a few upstairs.\"\n\nHe said when interacting with voters, the other candidates need to share their vision in detail and forget about the frontrunner.\n\n\"You know, like, Chris Christie, I think his main goal is to get Trump out. I want to hear what else you're gonna do,\" Provencher said.\n\nThose in the anti-Trump camp said they are hoping if some of the other candidates exit, they will unite behind a single challenger. In the most recent example, former Rep. Will Hurd, of Texas, left the race and endorsed Haley.\n\nHaley, a former UN ambassador, has surged in the New Hampshire poll ahead DeSantis, the governor of Florida who was once held as chief alternative to Trump.\n\nNorman Stuart, a veteran and retired machine shop worker, attended a Haley event at the Rochester American Legion last week. He was impressed with her, but he remains undecided.\n\nAlthough Stuart said he was considering several of the candidates, who he declined to name, he stated emphatically: \"I did not go to Wolfeboro to see Trump.\"\n\nThat provides a glimmer of light for the other Republicans, who hold out hope that despite Trump's strong standing in the polls, there are some signs the race is fluid.\n\nThose surveyed in the Suffolk poll, for instance, are split 48%-44% when asked whether Trump's nomination was inevitable or whether some other candidate could win the nomination.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 said they might change their minds before the January primary.\n\nBut the Trump base is fiercely loyal, with 84% saying their minds were made up to back him and just 15% saying they might switch to someone else.\n\n“I know a lot of people don't like him. I don't like his personality. I think it stinks,\" said Ronald Sassi, of Chichester, N.H., who wants Trump to win. \"But he doesn't have any lobbyists telling him what he has to be or beholden to them.\"\n\nIndependents giving single-digit candidates a shot\n\nJo-Ann Jacob, an independent from Exeter, N.H., doesn't want to rush in making a choice before she gets a chance to hear from more candidates.\n\nSeveral of the Republican contenders are \"too much\" in the sense they brag about themselves or insult others. She prefers the more somber style of North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum or former Vice President Mike Pence, who she describes as more \"down to Earth.\"\n\nBoth men are in the basement of the polling at 1%, according to the Suffolk University survey.\n\nOther independent voters, who can participate in the New Hampshire GOP primary, said they aren't sure what to make of the current field yet.\n\n“At this point, I'm really unsure,” Lynne Chase, a registered nurse who lives in Grantham, N.H., told USA TODAY.\n\nChase, who identifies as an independent, said she has \"deep concerns\" about the country's partisan divide, and how, \"this is the pool that we have to select from.\"\n\n\"That's why I choose to remain a middle ground voter,” she said.\n\nOther voters said they are drawn toward Haley and Burgum because of their experience and record as their state's chief executive.\n\n“When you govern a state, you have a lot of experience in governing within a structure of government,” Patricia Squires, a Republican from Wolfeboro, N.H., told USA TODAY.\n\nDistaste of a Biden-Trump rematch\n\nMany voters shared how they aren't crazy about the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch in 2024, but don't see a way to change that probability.\n\nRachel McKaig, a Democrat, said there is a general frustration that President Joe Biden will be the party’s likely nominee come next November.\n\n“I genuinely wish we had another candidate,” said McKaig, a University of New Hampshire graduate. \"I just can't see him doing anything amazing over the next four years, because he hasn't done anything amazing in the past four years.”\n\nGiven its status as the \"first-in-the-nation primary,\" New Hampshire draws a fair amount of out-of-state visitors.\n\nThose voters said they were impressed with lesser-known candidates they had a chance to see in-person, but admit there is an underlying pessimism that makes it hard for others to take that contender seriously.\n\n“I just know that you look at the people who are ascending because that tends to continue,\" said John Sweeny, a retired appellate judge who came to New Hampsire from Hudson Valley in New York.\n\n\"The ones who were staying flat – it would take a miracle for something to happen that they're going to say, ‘Oh, wow, you're wonderful. I didn't notice you before. Let me pay attention to you now,’\" he added. \"It just doesn't happen.\"\n\nShawn Rieke, a retired technician from Johnstown, Colo. who is vacationing in New England, waited outside the old State House for a glimpse of DeSantis after he filed.\n\nPeople may not like Trump's \"crudeness\" or the personal attacks he makes, but they agree with him on many issues, he said. They also think the criminal charges against him are politically motivated.\n\n\"At this point it looks like it's pretty much locked up,\" Rieke said. \"It is what it is.\"\n\nRepublican Rachel Hannah Swift, 46, who comes from Hagerstown, Maryland said no one is happy with the prospect of a Biden-Trump re-match, and she has a unique response: Running for president herself.\n\nAs her colorful car blared pop music outside of the old State House, Swift said: \"These politicians are kinda boring...They don't have a lot going on.

He was the third wheel Florida Republican running against two better-known rivals from his home state: the leading candidate in the Republican primary, former President Donald Trump, and Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nBecause of this, Suarez barely registered in either national or individual state polls. Suarez was excluded from the Republican debate stage since the Republican National Committee (RNC) qualifying rules required at least 1% in three national polls or a mix of national and early-state polls between July 1 and Aug. 21, and a minimum of 40,000 donors with 200 in 20 or more states.\n\nThe RNC concluded Suarez had not met the criteria and left him out of the Fox News-hosted encounter.\n\n“I agree that if you can’t meet the minimum thresholds, you shouldn’t be trying to take the time involved away from being productive,” Suarez said to reporters at the Iowa State Fair earlier this month.\n\nTrump skips Iowa:Trump gives priority to Palm Beach County, skipping major Iowa conference\n\nA Democratic National Committee spokesperson, Ammar Moussa, wrote in a statement after Suarez suspended his campaign: \"One fewer Republican who wants to ban abortion nationwide. Too bad the rest of the field is just as extreme. Good riddance.\"\n\nSuarez's campaign was focused on his work in Miami and his re-election in a city once known as a Democratic blue-dominant area. Suarez had made a few campaign trips, including three to Iowa and two to New Hampshire since his campaign launch in mid-June.\n\n\"I look forward to keeping in touch with the other Republican presidential candidates and doing what I can to make sure our party puts forward a strong nominee who can inspire and unify the country, renew Americans’ trust in our institutions and in each other, and win,\" Suarez wrote in his post.\n\nStephany Matat is a politics reporter for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY-Florida network.

Trump and DeSantis have been in something of a cold war for months now.\n\n“If I faced him, I’d beat him like I would beat everyone else,” Trump told Yahoo Finance in October of last year of DeSantis. “I think most people would drop out, I think he would drop out.”\n\nLast month, Trump labeled it a “BIG MISTAKE” when DeSantis recorded a robocall for Colorado Republican Senate nominee Joe O’Dea. O’Dea had drawn Trump’s ire by saying in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash that he would “actively” oppose the former president if he ran for the White House in 2024.\n\nDeSantis, for his part, has not paid the sort of obeisance to Trump that the former president is used to receiving from GOP politicians. DeSantis did not seek Trump’s endorsement for his 2022 reelection bid and, over the weekend, the two men held dueling rallies on the eve of the general election in Florida. (At his Florida rally on Sunday, Trump avoided criticizing DeSantis.)\n\nDeSantis looks, for all the world, like he is gearing up to use the momentum garnered from his expected win on Tuesday to launch a White House bid. He released a video last week that could easily have doubled as a presidential announcement and Politico noted that DeSantis raised $200 million for his reelection bid and had more than $90 million in the bank.\n\nSo, assuming DeSantis runs for president, how would Trump run against him?\n\nWell, the “DeSanctimonious” nickname actually hearkens back to how Trump sought to bring down Ted Cruz, his main rival for the 2016 Republican nomination.\n\nIn that race, Trump insisted that Cruz was sanctimonious – insisting that while the Texas senator portrayed himself as a honest broker and a man of God, he was actually something short of that.\n\n“I think he’s going to go down,” Trump said of Cruz in February 2016. “I think a guy can’t be – I’m a Christian – but you know Ted holds up the Bible and then he lies about so many things.”\n\nIt would seem, then, that Trump would rehash the playbook he used against Cruz in his potential fight against DeSantis. The idea is to undermine the notion of DeSantis as a principled conservative by portraying him instead as someone who talks down to average people and thinks he’s better than them.\n\nTrump, in this formulation, is the real man of the people, who would never dare think he is better than anyone. (That Trump has a super-sized ego and routinely casts himself as special seems to go unnoticed in this equation.)\n\nWhether and how DeSantis runs for president remains an entirely open question. But what’s clear is that Trump is already beginning to position himself against DeSantis – even before the 2022 election is over.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/trump-desantis-2024-warning-shot/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump just sent Ron DeSantis a 2024 warning shot | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn the day of the 2022 general election, Donald Trump sent a very clear 2024 message to Ron DeSantis: Stay out of the race or else.\n\n“I would tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering – I know more about him than anybody – other than, perhaps, his wife,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n(Trump, a Florida resident, did say Tuesday that he had voted for DeSantis for another term as governor.)\n\nTrump’s rhetoric is the most open threat he has made against DeSantis in recent weeks. At a rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend, Trump referred to DeSantis as “Ron DeSanctimonious.”\n\nThat nickname came less than a month after Trump called it a “BIG MISTAKE” when DeSantis endorsed Colorado Republican Senate nominee Joe O’Dea. O’Dea had previously told CNN’s Dana Bash that he would “actively” oppose the former president if he ran for the White House in 2024.\n\nAnd it comes after Trump has repeatedly insisted that DeSantis would be unwise to run against him. “If I faced him, I’d beat him like I would beat everyone else,” Trump told Yahoo Finance in October of last year of DeSantis. “I think most people would drop out, I think he would drop out.”\n\nThat may be a bit of wishful thinking by Trump.\n\nDeSantis appears to be on the verge of a victory Tuesday over former Gov. Charlie Crist, a win that could serve as a springboard for a 2024 bid. As Politico has noted, DeSantis raised $200 million – a staggering sum – for his reelection race and had $90 million left in the bank.\n\nHe has also avoided bowing and scraping to Trump as so many other elected Republican officials have done. DeSantis did not even seek Trump’s endorsement in his 2022 campaign.\n\nTrump has routinely said that he effectively created DeSantis by endorsing him in the 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary. He repeated that claim on Tuesday in an interview with NewsNation.\n\n“He was not going to be able to even be a factor in the race, and as soon as I endorsed him, within moments the race was over,” Trump said. “I got him the nomination. He didn’t get it, I got it. Because the minute I made that endorsement, he got it. I thought that he could have been more gracious, but that’s up to him.”\n\nThere’s no question that Trump’s endorsement helped DeSantis, who was, at the time, a relatively unknown member of Congress. But since then, DeSantis has emerged as a force all his own. He was openly skeptical of shutdowns triggered by Covid-19. He has positioned himself as perhaps the most vocal opponent in the country of the teaching of critical race theory and other allegedly “woke” policies.\n\nMost polling done on the 2024 GOP primary race shows Trump comfortably ahead.

Ron DeSantis, who is making his first trip to Iowa Friday as he weighs a possible presidential run. And they’re substantially higher than those for declared challenger Nikki Haley and likely candidate Mike Pence.\n\nThe data represent an early test of Iowans’ feelings toward the growing crop of candidates as they begin the task of vetting and winnowing the field during a busy caucus year.\n\nThe poll of 805 Iowans, including 257 self-identified Republicans, was conducted March 5 through 8 by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nQuestions asked only of Republicans have a margin of error of plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.\n\nPoll respondent Steven Goodenough, a 72-year-old Republican from Guthrie Center, said he voted for Trump in 2020 and would consider voting for him again in 2024, but he’s interested in hearing from the other candidates already making their way to Iowa.\n\nHe said Trump may be his current top choice “by default,” but he’s interested in seeing how he conducts himself on the campaign trail.\n\n“I’m not a dyed-in-the-wool Trump fan,” Goodenough said. “I am probably more middle of the road with him.

But you know, I probably would vote for him again if he is the candidate.”\n\nMore:Iowa or bust: Why the 2024 Iowa caucuses will be key to deciding GOP nominee\n\nGoodenough said he likes that Trump brought “balance” to the judiciary, both in the Supreme Court and in other federal appointments, and he thought Trump’s policies helped stimulate the economy.\n\nBut he expressed disappointment that Trump is already bringing a combative personality to the campaign trail, as evidenced by his attacks on candidates such as Haley and DeSantis.\n\n\"I think that was evident during the presidency that he might have gotten further if he was not so combative,\" Goodenough said.\n\nFewer say they would 'definitely' vote for Donald Trump in 2024 general election\n\nIf Trump were to become the GOP nominee for president, 74% of Iowa Republicans say they would likely vote for him in the 2024 general election.\n\nThat includes 47% who say they would definitely vote for him and 27% who say they would probably vote for him.\n\nJust 9% said they would be unlikely to vote for him, with 5% saying they would probably not vote for him and 4% saying they definitely would not vote for him.\n\nAnother 12% say they “might or might not” vote for him, 3% say they wouldn’t vote at all and 2% were unsure.\n\nMore:Ron DeSantis makes his Iowa caucuses debut with stops March 10 in Des Moines, Davenport\n\nThat’s a substantial shift from June 2021 when the Iowa Poll last tested the question.\n\nThen, 69% of Iowa Republicans said they would definitely vote for Trump in the 2024 general election — 22 percentage points more than say the same today — and another 15% said they would probably do so.\n\nIn 2021, just 4% said they would be unlikely to vote for Trump, with 2% saying they probably would not and 2% saying they definitely would not.\n\nAnother 10% said they “might or might not” for him, 1% wouldn’t vote at all and 1% were unsure.\n\nThe question is relevant in a caucus cycle where Republicans are already beginning to discuss “electability” and who would be best positioned to take on Democratic President Joe Biden, who is expected to seek a second term.\n\nDan Leinen, a 64-year-old poll respondent from Woodburn, said he is a Republican, but his views on Trump changed drastically following the Jan. 6th U.S. Capitol riot.\n\nLeinen said he didn’t like how Trump dealt with his election defeat and wouldn’t consider voting for him again — even if he were the Republican nominee for president.\n\n“I don’t think we need anybody like that in the White House,” he said.\n\nKendall Kirschbaum, a 21-year-old poll respondent and Republican from Lake Mills, said she thinks Trump was a strong president who successfully tackled key issues while in office, including promoting a strong economy, keeping down inflation, achieving low unemployment rates and strengthening security on the border, while also being good to farmers and small businesses.\n\nShe said she recognizes his social media presence may have been offensive to some, but she said it didn’t really bother her.\n\n“Growing up, I really just heard of him as not necessarily a political figure but more as a celebrity,” she said.\n\nBut after hearing Trump speak on policy, she said she realized “I really liked this guy. He is straightforward and he seems like he is going to get stuff done and he thinks like a businessman.”\n\nDonald Trump’s favorability falls; Ron DeSantis starts out strong\n\nA September 2021 Iowa Poll showed Trump was viewed favorably by 91% of Iowa Republicans. That fell to 83% in October 2022, and now it is at 80%.\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s unfavorable numbers have climbed, with the percentage of Iowa Republicans viewing him unfavorably more than doubling — from 7% in 2021 to 18% now.\n\nAmong independent Iowans, 35% view Trump favorably — down from 40% in October 2022 — and 63% view him unfavorably.\n\nTrump is set to return to the state March 13 for a rally in Davenport, just days after DeSantis makes his Iowa debut in the same city. Trump is expected to address education policy in his first Iowa campaign stop of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nThe numbers follow a tumultuous couple of years for the former president, who is facing multiple investigations related to his involvement in efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election, his handling of classified documents and his past business practices.\n\nThose investigations continue as other declared and potential presidential contenders begin making their appeals to Iowans.\n\nMore:Donald Trump to make first Iowa trip of 2024 presidential campaign\n\nDeSantis, who is attending public events with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds in Davenport and Des Moines Friday, is viewed favorably by 74% of Iowa Republicans — just behind Trump’s 80%. He is viewed unfavorably by 6% of Iowa Republicans, with 20% saying they aren’t sure.\n\nIndependent Iowans are nearly evenly split on DeSantis, with 35% viewing him favorably, 33% viewing him unfavorably and 32% saying they’re not sure.\n\nDeSantis has emerged in national polling as the early favorite to challenge Trump.\n\nA Real Clear Politics rolling average of polling shows 45% of respondents say Trump should be the Republican nominee for president, while 29% say it should be DeSantis. No other potential candidate is currently polling in double digits.\n\nPoll respondent Alex Barry, a 31-year-old Cedar Rapids Republican, said he views Trump “very favorably” and would vote for him in a general election, but he worries that Trump, 76, would fail to gain necessary support.\n\nBarry said he thinks DeSantis would have a better chance of beating Biden.\n\nBarry called DeSantis, 44, a “younger, fresh face” and praised his “strong stance on parental rights.”\n\n“I liked what he did with COVID — he stayed open and didn’t restrict everybody,” he said. “… He just seems like the right guy to me.”\n\nGrowing share have unfavorable view of Mike Pence; Nikki Haley relatively unknown\n\nPence, who served as Trump’s vice president and was previously the governor of Indiana, is viewed favorably by 66% of Iowa Republicans.\n\nPence has the highest unfavorable rating of the four politicians tested among Iowa Republicans at 26%. Another 7% are not sure.\n\nThose numbers have changed substantially since June 2020, when the Register last tested Republican Iowans’ attitudes of Pence. Then, 86% viewed him favorably, while just 7% viewed him unfavorably and 7% were not sure.\n\nSince then, many of Trump’s most loyal followers have turned on the former vice president after he refused to help Trump overturn the results of the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThat day, some who rioted at the U.S. Capitol erected makeshift gallows and chanted “hang Mike Pence” as others flooded the halls of Congress in search of the vice president.\n\nJust 58% of Iowa evangelicals — the group consistently showing the most support for Republicans and seemingly one of Pence’s most natural constituencies — say they have favorable feelings toward him.\n\nGoodenough, the poll respondent from Guthrie Center, is a pastor and said he was disappointed with Pence’s handling of the 2020 election and wished the vice president had done more to investigate allegations of fraud.\n\n“I think he's a good man,” Goodenough said. “But I'm not sure he's really qualified for the job of the president.”\n\nPence has traveled to Iowa multiple times since losing the 2020 election with Trump, and he’s been well-received at events around the state. He’s scheduled to return March 18 for a foreign policy forum alongside U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\nMore:Mike Pence rails in Iowa against 'radical gender ideology' as caucuses start to simmer\n\nHaley, the former governor of South Carolina and Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, was also in Iowa this week, holding events in Council Bluffs, Nevada and Des Moines.\n\nShe announced her campaign in February and immediately traveled to Iowa where she has been advocating for a “new generation” of leaders, urging Iowans to look forward, rather than back at Trump.\n\nAccording to the poll, she is viewed favorably by 53% of Iowa Republicans and unfavorably by 8%. However, she is much less known than the others, with 40% saying they don’t know enough about her to form an opinion.\n\nKirschbaum, the Lake Mills Republican and Trump supporter, a 21-year-old poll respondent and Republican from Lake Mills, said she needs to learn more about Haley before coming to a strong opinion about her, but she likes that Haley is in the field of candidates.\n\n“I really like how she provides that kind of strong, independent female portrayal,” Kirschbaum said. “I feel like that’s a really good example, especially for the Republican party.”\n\nMore:Nikki Haley is carving a lane in the Iowa caucuses as Donald Trump looms. Here's how:\n\nStill, Kirschbaum said she currently prefers Trump for the GOP nomination, followed by DeSantis.\n\nAlthough favorability numbers don’t necessarily indicate how candidates will perform in a head-to-head race, Selzer said they are a helpful indication of name identification and visibility and help set the stage for the campaigning that will come.\n\nThey also show the “intensity” of Iowa Republicans’ feelings about the candidates, she said.\n\nFor DeSantis, a plurality of 42% rate their feelings as “very favorable.” Trump also has a plurality of Iowa Republicans saying they feel “very favorably” about him, at 44%.\n\nBut for Pence and Haley, the plurality say they feel slightly less intense, rating their feelings as “mostly favorable.” For Pence, it is 49% and for Haley it is 37%.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 805 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/01/2024-presidential-election-candidates-republican-democratic/11641319002/", "title": "2024 presidential candidates: A comprehensive list of everyone ...", "text": "The 2024 election cycle has kicked off. Though Election Day is over a year away, the race is well underway.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced he will seek another term, and with former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, a rematch of their 2020 race is a real possibility. Though the Democratic establishment is expected to fall firmly behind Biden, the Republican side is more of a toss-up.\n\nTrump-endorsed candidates suffered in the midterm elections, and with his legal troubles mounting, the GOP may consider other options. Polls still show Trump with a strong lead however, and many of those trying to unseat him have floundered including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis who generated early buzz has suffered in the polls, struggling to translate popularity in Florida to popularity at the national level, and recently firing much of his campaign staff in a major shake-up.\n\nHere are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election:\n\nAnd here are the candidates who have announced their intention to run for president in the 2024 election:\n\nLearn more about each candidate:\n\nJoe Biden ∣ Dean Phillips ∣ Marianne Williamson ∣ Ryan Binkley ∣ Doug Burgum ∣ Chris Christie ∣ Ron DeSantis ∣ Larry Elder ∣ Nikki Haley ∣ Will Hurd ∣ Asa Hutchinson ∣ Perry Johnson ∣ Mike Pence ∣ Vivek Ramaswamy ∣ Tim Scott ∣ Francis Suarez ∣ Donald Trump ∣ Cornel West ∣ Robert F.

He lost his first wife Neilia Hunter and their one-year-old daughter Naomi in a 1972 car accident shortly after winning his first Senate race. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash but survived. In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research.\n\nHe remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden. The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren.\n\nBiden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction. The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father.\n\nPrevious political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate. First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008.\n\nAfter serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.\n\nHis views: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is \"whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer.\"\n\nMore on Biden's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nAge: 54\n\nFamily: Phillips wed wife Annalise in 2019, and has two adult daughters from a previous marriage: Daniela and Pia.\n\nPrevious political experience: Phillips was first elected to Congress in 2018 and has served for three terms as a representative for Minnesota's 3rd district.

Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the \"politics of love\" and rejecting a “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.”\n\nHer views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U.S. Department of Peace.\n\nMore on Williamson's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nRepublican party candidates for 2024\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 55\n\nFamily: Binkley met wife Ellie in college and the two share five children.\n\nPrevious political experience: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Equity Group.

He says he wants to stand out in a crowded field by prioritizing unity, and leaning on his faith and business experience.\n\nHis views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform, and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion. Though he signed a highly restrictive bill in his own state, he had indicated he would not do the same nationally and it should be a local issue. Binkley advocates for American energy independence using an \"all of the above\" approach that encompasses both fossil fuels and new technologies.\n\nMore on Binkley's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nLatest Ryan Binkley news : Explore\n\n: Explore Who is Ryan Binkley?

He was elected governor of North Dakota in 2016 and reelected in 2020.\n\nBurgum’s candidacy is expected to focus more on economics than culture wars – a favored topic of frontrunners Trump and DeSantis.\n\nHis views: Burgum has emphasized economic issues, rather than hot-button cultural issues that have been a focal point for some other GOP candidates. He is a vocal supporter of the oil industry, and the U.S. role in exporting it to other nations, and has said he favors smaller government and lower taxes.\n\nMore on Burgum's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 60\n\nFamily: Christie met wife Mary Pat at the University of Delaware and the two wed in 1986.

He ran again unsuccessfully in 2016 and, despite prior criticism, ultimately endorsed Trump and later joined his campaign.\n\nHis views: Christie is anti-abortion, but does support some exceptions in the case of incest, rape, and danger to the mother. He is not for a federal ban, instead believing the issue should be left to the states. He has advocated for a more secure border to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country and is in support of U.S. aid for Ukraine.\n\nMore on Christie's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 44\n\nFamily: The governor wed former television host Casey DeSantis in 2009 and the couple share two daughters Madison and Mamie and one son Mason.\n\nPrevious political experience: DeSantis serves as the 46th governor of Florida.

Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHe is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is in favor of \"defending parental rights and eliminating CRT,\" and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment.\n\nMore on DeSantis' 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Elder has no children and has been married once.

Though he lost, Elder received the highest number of votes of any candidate besides Newsom.\n\nElder announced his candidacy on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" tweeting afterward \"America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That’s why I’m running for President.\"\n\nHis views: Elder backs school choice, including vouchers and charter schools. His platform also includes a vow to be tough on crime, to secure the border, and to \"contain China\" by asserting military dominance in the South China Sea and minimizing reliance on the country's manufacturing.\n\nMore on Elder's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 51\n\nFamily: Haley is one of four children born to Indian-American parents in Bamberg, South Carolina - a town she has described as divided by race.\n\nShe and her husband of 26 years, Michael, live still in South Carolina where they are raising two children Rena and Nalin.\n\nPrevious political experience: Haley started her political career in the South Carolina state legislature where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010.

Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. \"May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News.\n\nHer views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and \"getting tough\" on China and Russia.

Born and bred in New York, he first made his name developing skyscrapers and casinos.\n\nTrump first married in 1977, wedding Czech-born model Ivana. The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.\n\nTrump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.\n\nPrevious political experience: When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nPrior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nMore on Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThird-party 2024 presidential candidates\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAge: 69\n\nFamily: Kennedy bears a powerful last name in Democratic politics.

He wed current wife Cheryl Hines in 2014. Hines is a television star best known for her role on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"\n\nPrevious political experience: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison. In 2017, former President Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website.\n\nMore on Kennedy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical Party: Green Party\n\nThough West originally announced his candidacy under the People's Party, he later officially filed as a Green Party candidate.\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: West has been married five times and has two children.

His bid with the People's Party represents the first independent ticket to enter the race thus far.\n\nHis views: West is a proponent of Medicare for All, and removing oil and gas subsidies as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists \"end the wars\" as a key priority which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.\n\nMore on West's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThese presidential candidates have ended their 2024 campaigns\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 63\n\nFamily: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.\n\nPrevious political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat. He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.\n\nPence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself.\n\nHis views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate.

Ron DeSantis in what has become a heated battle for second place in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump still dominates the race. He’s ahead by 27 percentage points – a lead that has expanded slightly despite his mounting legal problems.\n\nA new Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows 43% of likely Republican caucusgoers choose Trump as their first choice for president, up from 42% in an August Iowa Poll.\n\nDeSantis and Haley are now tied for second place with 16%.\n\nThat’s a drop of 3 percentage points for DeSantis, who was the first choice of 19% of caucusgoers in August. And it’s a 10-point jump for Haley, who was at 6%.\n\n“You just have (Haley) rising. You have DeSantis kind of holding on for second place,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the Iowa Poll. “But both of them are on ground that you could only describe as shaky compared to the solid ground that Donald Trump stands on.\n\n“If anything, he’s showing improvement.”\n\nRecently, Haley and DeSantis have spent more time battling with each other than with Trump, particularly over their approach to the Israel-Hamas war. Each has targeted the other in television ads and on the campaign trail.\n\nAnd both candidates have recently announced they would increase their Iowa presence as the race to caucus day on Jan. 15 enters its final months.\n\nAaron Rush, a 39-year-old poll respondent from Waterloo, lists DeSantis as his top choice for president but is weighing supporting Haley. He said he’s been watching presidential polls and debates to help him decide between the two.\n\nMore than anything, he says, he wants to find a candidate who looks like they can beat Trump. He likes U.S. Sen. Tim Scott but doesn’t include him in his top two because of the senator’s poorer showing in other polls.\n\n\"The ability to beat Trump right now is more important than any sort of policy differences you're going to get between the rest of the field,” Rush said.\n\nThe remaining candidate pool is largely stagnant.\n\nScott is at 7%, down from 9%; former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 4%, down from 5%; entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy held steady at 4%; North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum rose from 2% to 3%; and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson rose from 0% to 1%.\n\nTexas pastor Ryan Binkley is at 0%, failing to gain support after also polling at 0% in the August Iowa Poll.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence dropped out of the race Saturday, saying “this is not my time.” The new Iowa Poll results backed that up, with only 2% of likely Republican caucusgoers naming him their first choice. That was down from 6% in the August Iowa Poll.\n\nPence’s first-choice votes were redistributed to poll respondents’ second-choice candidates in the poll.\n\nOverall, likely Republican caucusgoers say their first choice for president is more about issues (63%) than leadership style (29%) as they wade through the still-crowded field.\n\nThe poll of 404 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Oct. 22-26 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nNikki Haley rises with independents and suburbanites\n\nHaley has doubled her support with independents, which has helped propel her into the second-place tie, Selzer said.\n\nIn August, Trump and DeSantis were nearly evenly split among independent caucusgoers, with 21% supporting Trump as their first choice and 19% supporting DeSantis.\n\nBut Trump now leads DeSantis with independents 33% to 12%.\n\nAnd Haley has also overtaken the Florida governor with independents: 22% list her as their first choice for president – up from 10% in August.\n\n“This is a group that is fickle and on the small side,” Selzer said. But it could be an important group to watch as the race progresses, she said.\n\nIndependents make up 21% of the poll’s respondents.\n\nKelly Hester, a poll participant who identifies as an independent, said Haley is her top choice for president.\n\n“The Republicans have ticked me off as of lately with their stance on gay rights, transgender and especially abortion rights,” she said. “But I definitely lean Republican fiscally.”\n\nShe thinks Trump has “ticked off too many people” and won’t be able to defeat Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nHester said she saw Haley during the debates and appreciated her positions on foreign policy, abortion and border security, and she thinks Haley has a better shot at winning than Trump.\n\n“I would like to hear her (in person), because I'm not set in stone,” Hester, a Solon resident, said. “But so far, she's definitely been my favorite.”\n\nOne possible advantage for Haley, Selzer said, is that she gets support across a much broader demographic range than DeSantis.\n\nIn addition to her strong showing with independents, Haley leads both Trump and DeSantis with suburban poll respondents: 32% say Haley is their first pick for president. DeSantis is at 29%, and Trump is at 24%.\n\nHaley also leads DeSantis among those with a college degree, 22%-16%; among men 65 or older, 23%-17%; white women with a college degree, 24%-15%; and women 44 or younger, 22%-13%.\n\nDeSantis leads Haley among men under the age of 45, 22%-13%.\n\n“It's not just one particular group where she's really dug in,” Selzer said. “She's digging in across demographics.”\n\nSo how much crossover is there between supporters for Trump, DeSantis and Haley?\n\nOf those who name DeSantis as their first choice for president, 27% name Haley as their second choice. But 41% say their second choice is Trump.\n\nFor Haley, 34% of her first-choice supporters pick DeSantis as their second choice for president, 19% select Scott and 14% choose Burgum. Just 12% say Trump is their second-choice candidate.\n\n“To my mind, she's done the best job of differentiating that she is the non-Trump candidate, to the extent that they don't see him as even a second choice,” Selzer said.\n\nOf those who name Trump as their first choice for president, 41% say DeSantis is their second choice. Haley is at 16% and Ramaswamy is at 15%.\n\nTrump supporters are more enthusiastic, locked in than Haley or DeSantis supporters\n\nIn addition to leading overall, Trump performs better than his opponents across nearly every demographic the poll tested, including among first-time caucusgoers.\n\nTrump has maintained his lead there, with 49% of first-time caucusgoers saying he is their first choice. DeSantis is at 15%, and Haley is at 14%.\n\nThose who name Trump as their first choice are also more enthusiastic about their pick, the poll shows.\n\nOverall, 30% of likely caucusgoers say they are extremely enthusiastic about their first choice for president.\n\nAmong Trump voters, it’s 47% – about twice what it is among DeSantis voters (25%).\n\nAmong Haley voters, it is even lower, at 19%.\n\nThat may be a sign that although Haley is the only candidate seeing substantial upward momentum in this poll, Selzer said, the ground underneath her could be “a little shaky.”\n\nTrump’s support is also more firmly locked in.\n\nOverall, 54% percent of likely Republican caucusgoers have a first choice for president and say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. Fewer, 41%, say their minds are made up.\n\nBut that number is much higher among Trump supporters, with 63% percent saying their minds are made up. A smaller share, 37%, say they could still be persuaded to pick another candidate.\n\n“This solid ground is what makes people want to say he's invincible,” Selzer said of Trump.\n\nPoll respondent Dennis Canarsky, 73, said that as long as Trump is in the race, he plans to support him.\n\n“If Trump’s not running, I would have to look to see what (the other candidates) stand for,” Canarsky, a Republican, said. “Otherwise, it’s Trump all the way. He’s my hero. Him and Jesus are my heroes.”\n\nSupport for DeSantis and Haley is less solid.\n\nThirty percent of DeSantis’ supporters say their minds are made up, while 70% could still be persuaded.\n\nAnd for Haley, even fewer, 26%, say their minds are firmly made up. The rest, 74%, say they could still be persuaded.\n\nIs it inevitable that Donald Trump will win the Iowa Caucuses?\n\nTrump leads by a commanding margin, but Iowa caucusgoers have not shut the door on alternatives, the Iowa Poll suggests.\n\nIowa caucusgoers are known for considering many candidates before slowly zeroing in on one person by caucus day.\n\nThe poll shows that just 4% of respondents have narrowed the list of candidates they are considering to just one. Instead, 22% are considering two candidates and 72% are considering three or more candidates.\n\nOverall, 67% of likely Republican caucusgoers say they are considering caucusing for Trump, even if he is not their first choice.\n\nThat 67% includes the 43% who say he is their first choice, 12% who say he is their second choice and 12% who say they are actively considering him.\n\nTrump’s total is matched by the 67% who say they are considering caucusing for DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis’ universe of support includes the 16% who say he is their first choice, 27% who say he is their second choice and 25% who say they are actively considering him.\n\nAlthough Haley is tied with DeSantis overall, the poll shows she has a smaller universe of people considering her, at 54% (although that’s up from the 40% who were considering her in August).\n\nHer footprint includes the 16% who say she is their first choice, 17% who say she is their second choice and 22% who say they are actively considering her.\n\nScott follows with 49% who say they are actively considering him (down from 53%). That includes the 7% who name him as their first choice, 10% who name him as their second choice and 32% who are considering him.\n\n\"He's on the cusp of being in the top tier,” Selzer said. “Most of that is people saying that they're actively considering him. … But that's not where you want (your support) to be happening, unless you've got a very specific strategy that is designed to identify people who are on the edge and sort of make them – force them – to take a different look. Because the look they're getting now isn't sufficient to turn into first- or second-choice votes.”\n\nTrailing the polling leaders are Ramaswamy (32%, down from 34%), Burgum (19%, down from 23%) and Christie (16%, down from 21%).\n\nHutchinson and Binkley are in the single digits, with footprints of 9% and 6% respectively.\n\n“These are campaigns that don't appear to be getting traction,” Selzer said.\n\nRon DeSantis viewed favorably by highest percentage of Iowa GOP caucusgoers\n\nAlthough Scott had the highest net favorability rating in August, DeSantis now holds that title.\n\nToday, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 69%, up from 66% in August. And he is viewed unfavorably by 26%, down from 29%. Another 5% aren’t sure.\n\n“He’s likeable enough – with higher favorables than Trump,” Selzer said. “It’s just that many more want Trump as their first choice.”\n\nTrump is viewed favorably by 66% – a new high, after getting 65% in August. And he is viewed unfavorably by 32%, compared with 33% in August. Just 1% are not sure.\n\nScott also maintains high favorable ratings, with 61% saying they view him favorably, compared with 59% in August. Another 22% view him unfavorably, up from 17%. Another 17% are not sure.\n\nIn addition to climbing to tie for second place with DeSantis, Haley’s favorability ratings have also improved, though she remains lower than DeSantis, Trump and Scott.\n\nNow, she is viewed favorably by 59% of likely Republican caucusgoers, up from 53% in August. She is viewed unfavorably by 29%, up slightly from 26% in August. The percentage of those who are not sure about Haley has shrunk from 21% to 13% as she becomes better known.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy viewed more unfavorably in Iowa\n\nThree candidates are underwater with their favorability rating, viewed unfavorably by more likely caucusgoers than favorably: Binkley, Christie and Hutchinson.\n\nRamaswamy has become better known since August, when 41% of likely Republican caucusgoers didn’t know enough about him to say whether they had a favorable or unfavorable view of him.\n\nThat is down to 20% now following two national debates where Ramaswamy claimed the spotlight – but his negatives almost doubled during that same time.\n\nThe percentage of those who view him unfavorably has risen from 20% to 37%, while the percentage of those who view him favorably has increased from 38% to 43%.\n\nChristie remains the candidate with the highest unfavorable rating. The former New Jersey governor has not campaigned in Iowa this cycle, but he has been featured in both debates aggressively attacking Trump.\n\nChristie is viewed favorably by 20% of poll respondents, down from 28% in August. And he is viewed unfavorably by 69%, up from 60%.\n\nContributing: Samantha Hernandez, Des Moines Register\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect their proportions among voters in the list.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 404 voters likely to attend the 2024 Iowa Republican caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register, NBC News and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/30"}]}

This puts a big responsibility on us to really deliver a successful bid,\" said al Misehal. He is a member of the FIFA Council and likely candidate for the AFC presidency in 2027, the year Saudi Arabia hosts the men's Asian Cup after an extensive stadium-building program.\n\nThe Infantino-chaired FIFA Council agreed two weeks ago only members of the AFC and Oceania’s soccer body — New Zealand and scattered Pacific islands – can bid for the 2034 tournament, and also accepted just a single 2030 co-host bid teaming Europe, Africa and South America across six nations.\n\nFIFA give federations in Asia and Oceania an Oct. 31 deadline to show interest and just one month more to submit a detailed bidding agreement with government support.\n\nSaudi Arabia confirmed its intention almost immediately after FIFA opened the contest on Oct. 4. Within minutes, the AFC’s president, Bahraini royal family member Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, said the Saudis had its united backing.\n\nSpeculation about an Australia-Indonesia plan, possibly including Malaysia and Singapore, suggested there was not total Asian unity.\n\nIndonesia’s announcement Wednesday isolated Australia if it wants to make a 2034 bid to follow its successful co-hosting of the 2023 Women’s World Cup with New Zealand.\n\n“There is enough division already all over the world. We have occasions to send messages of unity,” Infantino said Wednesday in a video message from Zurich to AFC members.\n\nInfantino reminded them of his message at a soccer officials’ meeting this month in Tashkent, Uzbekistan — “to be united in Asia as well, to be united for the 2034 World Cup.”\n\nFIFA wants to confirm the 2030 and 2034 World Cup hosts late next year at separate meetings of its 211-member federations.\n\nThe Europe-led bid of Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Argentina, Paraguay and the inaugural 1930 host Uruguay is the consensus choice for 2030. The South Americans are set to get just one game each of the 104-game slate, yet that removes their soccer body from the 2034 picture as FIFA looks to rotate hosting between continents.\n\nNorth and Central American soccer body CONCACAF gets its turn in 2026 when the United States, Canada and Mexico host the first 48-team, 104-game edition.\n\nThohir, an Indonesian government minister who has close ties to Infantino, said Wednesday his country still aims to host when Asia next gets its turn after 2034. That could be in 2046.\n\nIndonesia hosts the men’s Under-17 World Cup for FIFA next month after being stripped in March of the Under-20 version because the Muslim-majority nation refused to stage the games of Israel, which had qualified.\n\nThe Australian soccer federation also has shown interest in hosting the 32-team Club World Cup for FIFA in 2029. Getting a FIFA promise for that tournament is a potential price for letting the Oct. 31 deadline pass.\n\nSaudi Arabia will host the last annual seven-team Club World Cup for FIFA in December. The club tournament is relaunched as a four-yearly, 32-team tournament in June 2025 in the United States.\n\nWinning World Cup hosting rights can accelerate a Saudi state soccer project fueled by oil riches, which has already led to the buying of Premier League club Newcastle, the take over and funding of four storied domestic clubs, plus sponsorship of international competitions by the “Visit Saudi” tourism board.\n\nThe project is surging despite long-standing concerns about human rights in the kingdom and a reputational crisis for the crown prince after the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/football/qatar-fifa-world-cup-explainer-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "How Qatar ended up hosting the World Cup | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith the World Cup now underway in Qatar, many are wondering how this moment arrived – that a tiny Gulf nation with little footballing history ended up hosting the biggest event the sport has to offer.\n\nQatar had never previously appeared at a World Cup tournament – let alone staged one – and became the first host nation to lose the opening game of the tournament with a 2-0 defeat against Ecuador on Sunday.\n\nThe country’s World Cup debut was 12 years in the making, a period in which Qatar’s host status has stirred controversy within the footballing community and beyond.\n\n‘New lands’\n\nWhen Qatar was named as host of the 2022 World Cup back in 2010, it was selected ahead of bids from the United States, South Korea, Japan and Australia.\n\nDuring the bidding process, it faced several obstacles as FIFA, football’s governing body, flagged concerns in technical reports. Those included a lack of existing infrastructure and the region’s intense heat in the summer, when World Cup tournaments are traditionally held.\n\nIndeed, the reports even went as far as to label Qatar’s bid as “high risk,” but the country nevertheless triumphed with 14 votes to USA’s eight in the final round of balloting.\n\nAt the time, Qatar promised to make the world “proud of the Middle East” as the first country from the region to host the tournament, while then-FIFA President Sepp Blatter welcomed the prospect of football’s showpiece event going to “new lands.”\n\n“I’m a happy president when we speak of the development of football,” he said.\n\nTwelve years later, Blatter is more critical.\n\nEarlier this month, he told Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger: “Qatar is a mistake … the choice was bad.\n\n“It is too small of a country. Football and the World Cup are too big for it.”\n\nBlatter said FIFA amended the criteria it used to select host countries in 2012 in light of concerns over the working conditions at tournament-related construction sites in Qatar.\n\n“Since then, social considerations and human rights are taken into account,” he said.\n\nWith a population of three million, smaller than that of Connecticut, Qatar has invested billions in its football infrastructure in preparation for the 2022 tournament.\n\nBut questions about just how Qatar won the right to stage the World Cup continue.\n\nAs recently as March 2020, the US Department of Justice alleged that bribes were accepted by top officials as part of the voting process to elect Russia and Qatar as the tournament host for the 2018 and 2022 events – claims Russian officials denied and Qatari officials called “false” in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe DOJ has been investigating allegations of corruption in international soccer, including FIFA, for years. To date, there have been more than two dozen convictions and some cases are ongoing.\n\nA statement from FIFA in April 2020 said it “supports all investigations into alleged acts of criminal wrongdoing regarding either domestic or international football competitions and will continue to provide full cooperation to law enforcement officials investigating such matters.\n\n“FIFA is closely following these investigations and all related developments in the legal processes ongoing in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\n“It is important to point out that FIFA has itself been accorded victim status in the US criminal proceedings and senior FIFA officials are in regular contact with the US Department of Justice.”\n\nFIFA was handed victim status by US prosecutors as they viewed football’s world governing body as having been almost hijacked by a number of corrupt individuals.\n\nHuman rights criticism\n\nQatar’s human rights record has also been in the spotlight ahead of the World Cup, particularly around the welfare of migrant workers.\n\nGiven the minimal infrastructure Qatar had in place at the time it was awarded the hosting rights to the World Cup, seven new stadiums have been erected ahead of the tournament, as well as new hotels and expansions to the country’s airport, rail networks and highways.\n\nThat has placed a reliance on Qatar’s migrant workers, who account for 90% of the total workforce, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSince 2010, many migrant workers have respectively faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation, and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback FIFA president launches explosive tirade against Western critics of Qatar 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nHowever, Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) said the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” with “significant improvements” made around workers’ rights.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino also told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies that he has seen “great evolution” in Qatar’s labor reforms, and the International Labor Organization has noted reformes like a non-discriminatory minimum wage that Qatar is the first in the region to adopt.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar’s state-backed discrimination against LGBTQ people has also been criticized in the years leading up to the World Cup.\n\nSex between men is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison in the country, and a report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\n“There has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely,” the statement read.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nPerhaps the most obvious sign that this World Cup is different to most has been the decision to stage it in November and December, rather than June and July as is the norm.\n\nSweltering heat during the summer months in Qatar has necessitated the switch, although temperatures are still forecasted to rise above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) later this week.\n\nOther changes to the organization of the tournament have been rather more last-minute.\n\nOn Friday, FIFA announced that no alcohol would be sold at the stadiums, and then on Monday, captains from seven countries were warned they would receive yellow cards if they wore armbands promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination.\n\nFIFA announced earlier on Monday that it had brought forward its “No Discrimination” campaign – which also has a designated armband – adding that “all 32 captains will have the opportunity to wear this armband” during the World Cup.\n\nFIFA’s equipment regulations state that “for FIFA final competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captain’s armband provided by FIFA.”\n\nTime will tell what the legacy of this World Cup will be, but if the past few days, months, and years are anything to go by, it is likely to be complicated and controversial.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/football/european-countries-onelove-qatar-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Eight European countries to participate in diversity campaign during ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTen European football teams – the Netherlands, England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales – will participate in a season-long “OneLove” campaign promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination.\n\nEvery country except Sweden and Norway has qualified for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and each captain of these eight nations will wear a distinctive OneLove armband – which features a heart containing colors from all backgrounds – during the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands FA, which is spearheading the campaign, chose the colors to represent all heritages, backgrounds, genders and sexual identities; the armband will be worn in Qatar where same-sex relationships are a criminal offense.\n\nSweden and Norway will participate in the initiative during the upcoming Nations League matches, while England will also wear black armbands during both its UEFA Nations League matches to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n“This is an important message which suits the game of football: on the field everybody is equal and this should be the case in every place in society.

No matter where you come from, what you look like and who you love.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThis November, billions of people around the world will tune in to the World Cup – one of the greatest sporting spectacles in human history. It’s an event that has brought wars to a standstill, canonized sporting saints and sinners, and united the planet in savoring every exclamation point goal, last-ditch tackle and intricately choreographed celebratory knee-slide.\n\nThere’s just one problem: This year, it’s happening in Qatar.\n\nIn Qatar, journalists are thrown in jail for investigating migrant worker conditions. LGBTQ+ people are treated as criminals. Women need to ask men permission to marry, travel and study abroad in many cases.\n\nAnd Qatari labor practices have been compared to modern slavery – a reported 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010. Experts say it is likely a lot of these deaths are related to construction of buildings for the tournament.\n\n6,500 deaths – at least. The total death toll is almost certainly higher, as this figure does not include many countries sending workers to Qatar, including the Philippines and African nations.\n\n(Qatar argues that the mortality rate for its migrant worker community is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population.)\n\nIn recent years, Qatari authorities have introduced “several promising labor reform initiatives,” according to Human Rights Watch. But “significant gaps remain,” it said, including “widespread wage abuses” and failure to “investigate the causes of deaths of thousands of migrant workers.”\n\nA controversial bid\n\nLet’s not pretend that the Qataris won their Cup bid through merit alone. After all, Qatar – a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and with heat so extreme that it’s a potential health risk to play soccer there during the summer months – is the last place it would make sense to host a giant international sporting tournament.\n\nHow, then, did Qatar get chosen? Well, as an endless stream of investigative journalism alleges, it won the bid through a process that was rigged from top to bottom. (Qatar strongly denies the allegations).\n\nShortly after France’s supporting vote, for instance, Qatar Sports Investments purchased the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club; around the same time, another Qatari firm bought a piece of Veolia, a French energy and waste company.\n\nNot to mention: A firm connected to the Qatari sovereign fund hired the son of Michel Platini, the former head of the European football association. Népotisme? Zut alors!\n\nBut don’t take our word for it. Matt Miller, a former Department of Justice official who traveled with former Attorney General Eric Holder to Zurich to witness the bidding process, told us: “It was the most corrupt thing I’ve ever seen in my career, and I spent a couple years working in New Jersey politics.”\n\nJokes aside, all this raises the question: Why would Qatar even want to host the World Cup?\n\nThe National Stadium, also known as the \"Bird's Nest,\" was a centerpiece of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Goh Chai Hin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe answer is that the country is hoping for a Beijing 2008 Olympics moment – a chance to airbrush its human rights abuses and shine on a global stage. By hosting the World Cup, Qatar wants to project a cosmopolitan image like that of its neighbors in the UAE, signaling it is open for business, welcoming to tourists and a player in global politics.\n\nA tightly controlled image\n\nTo ensure that image happens, Qatar even announced that international television crews will be banned from filming in locations without pre-approval from Qatari authorities. As James Lynch, from London-based human rights group FairSquare, told the Guardian, these “extraordinarily sweeping range of restrictions” would make it very difficult for media to cover any stories not strictly related to games.\n\n(Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said in a statement on Twitter that filming permits were in line with global practices).\n\nWe’ve got to send a clear signal that autocrats cannot amass soft power through the refracted glow of sports immortality. Roger Bennett and Tommy Vietor\n\nWhen you think of Qatar, its leaders don’t want you to picture migrant workers dying in the blistering heat, or to dismiss Doha as less significant when compared to neighboring Dubai. They want you to remember the transcendent thrill of a slaloming Lionel Messi run on goal, or the epic exhilaration of a physics-defying fingertip save by Brazilian goalkeeper Alisson Becker.\n\nAnd that’s what Qatar is going to get after this World Cup – unless we all work to tell a different story, one that brings the world’s attention to Qatari atrocities and serves as a warning to other authoritarian regimes that are watching. We’ve got to send a clear signal that autocrats cannot amass soft power through the refracted glow of sports immortality.\n\nThat means making sure that, by the end of this tournament, every single person who’s expected to tune in – all 5 billion of them – knows what is happening off screen in Qatar.\n\nNational teams have a responsibility, too\n\nAlready, there have been some positive steps in this direction. Denmark’s monochrome “protest jerseys” are a powerful statement – and one which has riled up the Qatari government. During the opening round of World Cup qualifiers, Germany and Norway’s teams wore shirts displaying the message: “HUMAN RIGHTS.”\n\nThe Netherlands’ ever-cantankerous coach Louis Van Gaal, meanwhile, called FIFA’s rationale for hosting the tournament in Qatar “bullshit.” Legend.\n\nThese steps must be just a starting point.\n\nNational teams – and, critically, their governments – can and must push Qatar for accountability. The most critical step is getting behind Human Rights Watch’s no-nonsense #PayUpFIFA campaign. It’s an effort to require Qatar and FIFA to pay out at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament. Every club with a conscience ought to forcefully support it.\n\nTo this point, US Soccer has quietly signed onto the #PayUpFIFA campaign but has publicly said little on the issue. As the world’s richest country, with a major military base in Qatar, America has a particular mandate to champion these values – especially with the current administration’s stated commitment to holding Gulf autocrats accountable.\n\nEngland’s Football Association has been similarly weak in its response. After European football federations promised to call out Qatar with more than “just wearing a t-shirt,” they ended up settling on wearing rainbow armbands, which, quite literally, amount to less than a t-shirt.\n\nAll national teams need to step up – and players have a crucial role to play in this effort as well. We can only imagine the level of pressure already on these athletes to perform. They have likely dreamed about this moment since they were children – and fought so bloody hard and given up so much to make it a reality.\n\nThey did not start kicking a football thinking they were going to have to speak out about human rights. But there is also a long tradition of athlete activism, from Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising their fists in Mexico City to Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford combating child hunger in the United Kingdom.\n\nThis doesn’t mean every player must speak out. But those who do should be supported and amplified – like the Socceroos, Australia’s national soccer team, who called for remediation for workers who have been harmed and the decriminalization of all same-sex relationships in Qatar.\n\nThe future of sport\n\nAfter all, this is about more than the World Cup. It’s about whether people who believe in democracy and human rights are going to let authoritarian regimes get away with hijacking the sports we love.\n\nSaudi Arabia is already attempting to sportswash its image through LIV Golf and the WWE. Russia and Bahrain have tried to do it through Formula One. But if we make a stand against Qatar on the world stage, maybe we can make the next generation of autocrats more worried about a Qatar 2022-style humiliation than thirsty for a Beijing 2008 moment.\n\nFans can help by using their social media platforms to call attention to Qatar’s human rights abuses, and by pressuring football associations to publicly support the #PayUpFIFA campaign.\n\nOur activism could also change the calculus for FIFA – which might be less inclined to award the World Cup to countries like Qatar if they know that doing so will result in years of boycotts, protests and damaging press.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.

It’s been compared to a global eclipse which strikes the entire planet for a month at a time.\n\nIt’s a unique arena where nations can compete fiercely and then shake hands. It’s supposed to represent the best of us – our incredible diversity and our common humanity.\n\nIt’s no wonder authoritarian powers want to take over these events for themselves.

Qatar won the Asia Cup in 2019, capping off one of the most memorable runs in the tournament’s history, conceding only one goal throughout the tournament.\n\nSeventy percent of the squad that won the trophy came through the academy, and that number has only increased heading into the World Cup.\n\nCoached by Spaniard Felix Sanchez, Qatar will be looking to surprise people and faces a relatively kind group, alongside Ecuador, Senegal and The Netherlands.\n\nQatar will look to spring a surprise at Qatar 2022. Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘Winter’ Cup\n\nThe World Cup has always been held in either May, June or July but Qatar 2022 will break away from such tradition – more out of necessity.\n\nTemperatures in Qatar can reach over 40 degrees Celsius over those months so, with this in mind, the tournament was moved to a cooler time.\n\nHowever, winter in Qatar is a relative term with temperatures still likely to be around 30 degrees, but organizers hope to combat the heat with multiple methods, such as high-tech cooling systems in stadiums.\n\nThe change in tournament dates has played havoc with some of the biggest domestic leagues in the world.\n\nAll of Europe’s top leagues have had to work a winter break into their schedules, meaning congested fixture lists before and after the tournament.\n\nThis will be the first World Cup played in November and December. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nIslamic country\n\nOne of FIFA’s justifications for awarding Qatar the hosting rights was the ability to take the tournament to a new part of the world.\n\nNone of the 21 previous World Cups have been held in an Islamic country and this month’s tournament will be a chance for the region to celebrate its growing love for the game.\n\nHowever, it undoubtedly raises a few problems that organizers have had to tackle. For many fans, drinking alcohol has, and will continue to be, a big part of the experience of such tournaments.\n\nIn Qatar, though, it’s illegal to be seen drunk in public, which has forced organizers to come up with inventive ways to circumnavigate the issue.\n\nAs a result, alcohol will only be served in designated fan parks around Doha and there will be separate areas for fans to sober up before and after matches.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback World's only openly gay active pro footballer is concerned for LGBTQ community ahead of Qatar 2022 04:39 - Source: CNN\n\nSmallest hosts\n\nAnother question mark around the tournament is how the country will be able to deal with the influx of an expected one million visitors, given it’s the smallest country to host the World Cup, with a population of just under three million.\n\nAs a result, all eight stadiums are in and around Doha, the capital city, and are all within an hour’s drive of each other.\n\nOrganizers say the travel infrastructure – including buses, metro and car hires – will be able to cope with the increased pressure.\n\nOne benefit of the small distances between venues is that fans will be able to see up to two games in one day. Should traffic be kind.\n\nDue to its size, Qatar has also had to be smart with its accommodation. Two cruise ships, MSC Poesia and MSC World Europa, are being moored in Doha to provide some support to hotels.\n\nFans will have the chance to stay on cruise ships in Doha, Qatar. Catherine Ivill/Getty Images\n\nBoth vessels will offer the usual cruise ship experience, but fans won’t be sailing any further than the 10-minute shuttle-bus ride into the heart of Doha.\n\nFor those fans prone to a touch of sea sickness, organizers have also built three ‘Fan Villages’ which will offer a place to stay on the outskirts of the city.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The Qatar World Cup's migrant worker dilemma 04:31 - Source: CNN\n\nThese include a variety of accommodation – including caravans, portacabins and even camping experiences – and all are located within reasonable distances of the venues.\n\nAlso, for those able to afford a little more, there will be luxury yachts docked in Doha’s harbor, which can offer a place to sleep for, let’s face it, an extortionate price.\n\n‘Carbon neutral’ tournament\n\nFIFA has pledged to make Qatar 2022 the first carbon neutral World Cup, as world soccer’s governing body continues its pledge to make the sport more environmentally friendly.\n\nIt, alongside Qatar, pledged to offset carbon emissions by investing in green projects and buying carbon credits – a common practice used by businesses to “cancel out” the impact of a carbon footprint.\n\nQatar, the world’s largest emitter per capita of carbon dioxide, has said it will keep emissions low and remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as the tournament produces by investing in projects that will capture the greenhouse gases.\n\nFor instance, it will be sowing the seeds for the largest turf farm in the world by planting 679,000 shrubs and 16,000 trees.\n\nThe plants will be laid at stadiums and elsewhere around the country and are supposed to absorb thousands of tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year.\n\nHowever, critics have accused organizers of “greenwashing” the event – a term used to call out those who try to cover their damage to the environment and climate with green initiatives that are either false, misleading or overstated.\n\nCarbon Market Watch (CMW), a nonprofit advocacy group specializing in carbon pricing, says Qatar’s calculations are grossly underestimated.\n\nFemale officials\n\nQatar 2022 will also see female referees officiate a men’s World Cup match for the first time.\n\nYamashita Yoshimi, Salima Mukansanga and Stephanie Frappart have all been named among the 36 officials selected for the tournament.\n\nThey will be joined by Neuza Back, Karen Diaz Medina and American Kathryn Nesbitt, who will be traveling to the Gulf nation as assistants.\n\nFrappart is arguably the most famous name on the list after she wrote her name into the history books in 2020 by becoming the first woman to take charge of a men’s Champions League match.\n\nReferee Yoshimi Yamashita will make her debut at the men's World Cup. Masashi Hara/Getty Images\n\nBut looking to learn from her in Qatar is Rwanda’s Mukansanga, who told CNN that she was excited to embrace the challenge of refereeing at a major tournament.\n\n“I would look at what the referees are doing, just to copy the best things they’re doing, so that one day I would be in the World Cup like this,” she said, adding that her family couldn’t wait to see her take to the pitch.\n\nIt’s not yet decided when the women will be refereeing their first match at the tournament, but there will be some new rules to enforce.\n\nFor the first time, teams will be able to use up to five substitutes and managers can now pick from a squad of 26 players, rather than the usual 23.\n\nQatar 2022 is set to start on November 20.

ANDREWS, Scotland - Rory McIlroy had said all the right things in his post-round news conference and with those duties complete, he slumped into a four-passenger golf cart and buried his head into wife Erica's left shoulder and all the emotions came flooding out.\n\nThe 150th Open Championship, the one McIlroy labeled his Holy Grail earlier in the week, was his to win or lose. After sharing the 54-hole lead with Viktor Hovland, McIlroy had built a two-stroke lead with nine holes to go. The World No. 2 had his strut back this week and was playing chess against the fabled seaside links in a way that would have made past champions here like Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods proud.\n\nMcIlroy could almost taste the alcohol he surely would have consumed from the Claret Jug once he regained possession of the winner's trophy for the first time since 2014 and ended his nearly eight-year winless drought.\n\nOnly problem is Cameron Smith of Australia had other plans and vaulted into the lead by reeling off five back-nine birdies in a row en route to shooting 8-under 64 at the Old Course. McIlroy, who closed in 2-under 70, two shots back, and finished in third, was left to wonder what more he had to do claim his elusive fifth major title.\n\nBRITISH OPEN:Cameron Smith seals victory with spectacular final-round 64\n\nCAMERON SMITH:British Open winner is 'going to find out how many beers' fit in Claret Jug\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get daily updates in your inbox\n\n\"I'll be OK,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, it's not life or death. I'll have other chances to win the Open Championship and other chances to win majors. It's one that I feel like I let slip away, but there will be other opportunities.\"\n\nExcept he didn't look OK as he drove off. He rued failing to convert on birdie chances at Nos. 3, 6 and 9, which could have nipped Smith's charge in the bud. McIlroy hit every green in regulation in the final round and had a wonderful sense of speed with his putter, but he picked a bad time for it to go cold. He didn't make a single putt of consequence.\n\n\"I felt like I didn't do much wrong today, but I didn't do much right either,\" he said. \"It's just one of those days where I played a really controlled round of golf. I did what I felt like I needed to just apart from capitalizing on the easier holes - around the turn, 9, 12, 14. If I had made the birdies there from good positions, it probably would have been a different story.\"\n\nThis one will hurt because McIlroy knows he had every chance to stop Smith, but with every birdie by Smith, his confidence grew and the pressure on McIlroy tightened.\n\n\"I can't be too despondent because of how this year's went and this year's going,\" he said. \"I'm playing some of the best golf I've played in a long time. So it's just a matter of keep knocking on the door, and eventually one will open.\"\n\nBut despondent is what he looked like as he hid his face in his wife's embrace. He finished second at the Masters, eighth at the PGA Championship, T-5 at the U.S. Open, and third at the Open - a banner-type year for Rickie Fowler in 2014 but for McIlroy it is close but no cigar. The end result is a failure and like Vesuvius he has to wait until April to begin the quest of pushing the ball up the mountain again.\n\nIt hurt because he admitted that he had dreamed of winning the 150th and allowed himself moments to look ahead and think about what it might be like to hold the trophy and be celebrated on the 18th green as the Champion Golfer of the Year.\n\n\"I'm only human. I'm not a robot. Of course, you think about it, and you envision it, and you want to envision it,\" he said. \"My hotel room is directly opposite the big yellow board on 18 there right of the first. And every time I go out, I'm trying to envision McIlroy at the top name on that leaderboard and how did that feel?

The official website of the royal family explained that “members of the public will be invited to take part in The Big Help Out”, a campaign to showcase how volunteering both benefits communities and the people who take part.\n\nWhen is the coronation?\n\nThe coronation of King Charles III is taking place at 11am on Saturday 6 May 2023, eight months after Queen Elizabeth II’s death.\n\nIt is traditional to “wait until a sufficient time period of mourning has taken place” before crowning new sovereigns, said the London Evening Standard. The late Queen’s coronation took place on 2 June 1953, some 16 months after her the death of her father, King George VI, on 6 February 1952.\n\nWhere will it take place?\n\nThe coronation procession will take the King and Queen Consort from Buckingham Palace down The Mall, past Trafalgar Square and along Whitehall before arriving at Westminster Abbey, where the service will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nThe 1.3-mile route will be a fraction of the length of Elizabeth II’s, “raising fears that many royal well-wishers may miss out on the chance to see the new monarch”, said The Telegraph.\n\nSince the days of William the Conqueror – some 900 years ago – all coronations except two have been held in Westminster Abbey. “Edward V was presumed murdered in the Tower of London before he could be crowned and Edward VIII abdicated 11 months after succeeding his father so was never crowned,” explained the abbey’s website.\n\nAfter the service, King Charles will return to Buckingham Palace along the same route, with some members of his family joining the procession, and will then appear on the Palace balcony.\n\nWhat will happen during the coronation?\n\nThe monarch will be crowned alongside his wife, Queen Consort Camilla, who will then take the title of Queen. The King will be anointed with holy oil and receive the Sovereign’s Orb, coronation ring and sceptre, and will then be crowned with the majestic St Edward’s crown and blessed.\n\nThe ceremony has been “years in the planning” under the codename of “Operation Golden Orb”, according to the i news site.\n\nIt will be a “deeply religious affair” but is also expected to be “more inclusive of multi-faith Britain than past coronations” while remaining an Anglican service.\n\nCharles will sit on the same throne on which King Henry VIII, King Charles I, Queen Victoria and the late Queen Elizabeth II were all crowned. Yet “despite its history, the chair is covered in graffiti”, said Sky News.\n\nMuch of it has been “carved by Westminster schoolboys and visitors to Westminster Abbey during the 18th and 19th centuries”, added the broadcaster, with one carving reading: “P. Abbott slept in this chair 5-6 July 1800”.\n\nDuring the historic ceremony, millions of viewers worldwide will be invited to “cry out and swear allegiance” to the monarch, said ITV News. The addition of the controversial new Homage of the People marks “the first time in history” that the public will play “an active role” in a coronation.\n\nWho will attend?\n\nIt will be a significantly smaller affair than the Queen’s 1953 coronation, when more than 8,000 guests from 129 nations travelled to Westminster Abbey to see the crowning. Around 2,200 guests will see Charles officially crowned.\n\nConfirmed guests include royals from Monaco, Japan, Denmark and Sweden, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Scotland’s First Minister Humza Yousaf, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “President Joe Biden will not be in attendance, but First Lady Jill Biden will lead a US delegation to the coronation,” said Town & Country.\n\nAmong the British Empire Medal recipients invited is 13-year-old Max Woosey, who raised more than £750,000 for North Devon Hospice by camping in his garden for three years.\n\nIn “a sign of radically changed times”, Sinn Féin “who once supported Irish Republican Army attacks on British royals”, is sending a senior representative to the coronation, said Politico. Michelle O’Neill, the party’s deputy leader and first minister-designate for the “mothballed” Northern Ireland government, said she wanted to demonstrate her respect for unionists and their British identity.\n\nCamilla’s “naughty” ex-husband will also be there, said The Sunday Times. Andrew Parker Bowles “will be front and centre of the congregation at Westminster Abbey watching his first wife crowned alongside King Charles, while his grandchildren take centre stage with official roles in the ceremony”, according to the paper.\n\nWho will perform?\n\nThe Palace had hoped to line up a stellar cast for the king’s coronation concert at Windsor Castle on Sunday, but at least six of the UK’s biggest stars were said to have turned down the opportunity to perform.\n\nAccording to reports in The Sun, “Elton John, the Spice Girls and Harry Styles had all been invited”, but told Buckingham Palace that their “crazy-busy schedules” meant they were unable to make the “regal shindig”. That’s after Ed Sheeran, Adele and Robbie Williams also reportedly turned down the gig.\n\nBut King Charles won’t be bereft of stars at the celebration, with Take That’s Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald due to headline the concert, as well as Australian stars Kylie and Dannii Minogue, and soul legend Lionel Richie. The concert will also feature “12 newly commissioned pieces of music” including one from Andrew Lloyd Webber, said the BBC.\n\nOther stars expected to perform include pop star Katy Perry, opera singer Andrea Bocelli, singer-songwriter Freya Ridings, bass-baritone Bryn Terfel and classical-soul pioneer Alexis Ffrench.\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nAccording to a source in The Sun, the ceremony could cost around £100m. “In today’s money the 1953 coronation cost around £50m but estimates for King Charles’s are twice that because of things like security, which weren’t such a big issue back then,” said the insider.\n\nHowever, this has not been confirmed. “The British government, which picks up the tab, says that information will be published at a later date,” said The Washington Post.\n\nHow can I watch the coronation?\n\nThe Queen’s coronation was broadcast to an estimated 20m people and marked the first time cameras were placed inside Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe BBC is suspending the licence fee over the upcoming coronation weekend, allowing “venues to show coronation coverage on 6 May and the concert on 7 May without needing to pay for a licence”, said The Mirror.\n\nThe broadcaster said the dispensation was granted in “exceptional circumstances”, with the event needing to be of “national importance” and shown in a community setting.\n\nBroadcasting icon David Dimbleby, whose father Richard covered the Queen’s coronation, turned down an opportunity to play a role in the BBC’s coverage, according to The Times. Instead, coverage will be spearheaded by Kirsty Young in a studio located outside Buckingham Palace, with support from Huw Edwards and Clare Balding.", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Harold Maass", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/uk/order-of-service-queen-funeral-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "The Orders of Service for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral and ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe funeral service for Queen Elizabeth II will be conducted by the Dean of Westminster at Westminster Abbey, starting at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET), with the Archbishop of Canterbury giving the Sermon and Commendation.\n\nThe Queen’s great-grandchildren Prince George and Princess Charlotte will form part of the royal family procession behind the Queen’s coffin as it is carried into Westminster Abbey\n\nDuring the service, the choir will sing a specially commissioned piece, “Like as the hart,” a setting of Psalm 42 by the Master of the King’s Music, Judith Weir.\n\nOther music selected for the state funeral include the hymn “The Lord’s my shepherd,” which was also sung at the then-Princess Elizabeth’s wedding to Prince Philip in 1947, and the anthem “O Taste and see how gracious the Lord is,” which was composed for the Queen’s coronation in 1953 by Ralph Vaughan Williams.\n\nThe nation will observe a two-minute silence towards the end of the hour-long service after which the Sovereign’s Piper of the Royal Regiment of Scotland will play the traditional lament, “Sleep, dearie, sleep.”\n\nFull order of service\n\nMusic before the service\n\nMatthew Jorysz, Assistant Organist, Westminster Abbey, plays:\n\nFantasia of four parts, Orlando Gibbons (1583–1625)\n\nRomanza (Symphony no 5 in D), Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958) arranged by Robert Quinney (b 1976)\n\nReliqui domum meum Peter Maxwell Davies (1934–2016)\n\nMeditation on ‘Brother James’s Air’ Harold Darke (1888–1976)\n\nPrelude on ‘Ecce jam noctis’ Op 157 no 3 Healey Willan (1880–1968)\n\nPsalm Prelude Set 1 no 2, Herbert Howells (1892–1983)\n\nIn the Country Op 194 no 2, Charles Villiers Stanford (1852–1924)\n\nFantasy on ‘O Paradise,’ Malcolm Williamson (1931–2003)\n\nElegy Op 58 Edward Elgar (1857–1934) arranged by Matthew Jorysz (b 1992)\n\nThe Sub-Organist plays:\n\nAndante espressivo (Sonata in G Op 28), Edward Elgar Sospiri Op 70, Edward Elgar, arranged by Peter Holder (b 1990)\n\nThe Choir of Westminster Abbey sings the Sentences, during which the Procession of the Coffin moves through the Abbey\n\nI AM the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.\n\nJohn 11: 25–26\n\nI KNOW that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.

Here, where Queen Elizabeth was married and crowned, we gather from across the nation, from the Commonwealth, and from the nations of the world, to mourn our loss, to remember her long life of selfless service, and in sure confidence to commit her to the mercy of God our maker and redeemer.\n\nWith gratitude we remember her unswerving commitment to a high calling over so many years as Queen and Head of the Commonwealth. With admiration we recall her life-long sense of duty and dedication to her people. With thanksgiving we praise God for her constant example of Christian faith and devotion. With affection we recall her love for her family and her commitment to the causes she held dear.\n\nNow, in silence, let us in our hearts and minds recall our many reasons for thanksgiving, pray for all members of her family, and commend Queen Elizabeth to the care and keeping of almighty God.\n\nA brief silence is kept.\n\nO MERCIFUL God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live, though he die; and whosoever liveth, and believeth in him, shall not die eternally; who hast taught us, by his holy Apostle Saint Paul, not to be sorry, as men without hope, for them that sleep in him: We meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness; that, when we shall depart this life, we may rest in him, as our hope is this our sister doth; and that, at the general Resurrection in the last day, we may be found acceptable in thy sight; and receive that blessing, which thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear thee, saying, Come, ye blessed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.

For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\n1 Corinthians 15: 20–26, 53–end\n\nThe choir sings The Psalm\n\nLIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks : so longeth my soul after thee, O God.\n\nMy soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God :\n\nwhen shall I come to appear before the presence of God?\n\nMy tears have been my meat day and night : while they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God?\n\nNow when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself : for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;\n\nIn the voice of praise and thanksgiving : among such as keep holy-day.\n\nWhy art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul : and why art thou so disquieted within me?\n\nPut thy trust in God : for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his countenance.\n\nWords: Psalm 42: 1–7\n\nMusic :Judith Weir CBE, Master of the Queen’s Music (b 1954)\n\ncomposed for this Service\n\nThe Right Honourable Elizabeth Truss MP, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, reads the Second Lesson\n\nLET not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

Here, in St George’s Chapel, where she so often worshipped, we are bound to call to mind someone whose uncomplicated yet profound Christian Faith bore so much fruit. Fruit, in a life of unstinting service to the Nation, the Commonwealth and the wider world, but also (and especially to be remembered in this place) in kindness,concern and reassuring care for her family and friends and neighbours. In the midst of our rapidly changing and frequently troubled world, her calm and dignified presence has given us confidence to face the future, as she did, with courage and with hope. As, with grateful hearts, we reflect on these and all the many other ways in which her long life has been a blessing to us, we pray that God will give us grace to honour her memory by following her example, and that, with our sister Elizabeth, at the last, we shall know the joys of life eternal.\n\nAll remain standing for the Hymn:\n\nAll my hope on God is founded;\n\nHe doth still my trust renew.\n\nMe through change and chance he guideth,\n\nOnly good and only true.\n\nGod unknown,\n\nHe alone\n\nCalls my heart to be his own.\n\nGod’s great goodness aye endureth,\n\nDeep his wisdom, passing thought:\n\nSplendour, light and life attend him,\n\nBeauty springeth out of naught.\n\nEvermore\n\nFrom his store\n\nNew-born worlds rise and adore.\n\nDaily doth th’Almighty giver\n\nBounteous gifts on us bestow;\n\nHis desire our soul delighteth,\n\nPleasure leads us where we go.\n\nLove doth stand\n\nAt his hand;\n\nJoy doth wait on his command.\n\nStill from man to God eternal\n\nSacrifice of praise be done,\n\nHigh above all praises praising\n\nFor the gift of Christ his Son.\n\nChrist doth call\n\nOne and all:\n\nYe who follow shall not fall.\n\nWords: Robert Bridges, OM (1844-1930) based on the German of Joachim Neander (1650-80)\n\nMusic: ‘MICHAEL’ Herbert Howells, CH, CBE (1892-1983)\n\nThe Dean of Windsor gives The Reading.\n\nI SAW a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

According to Levine we are \"clearly on a downward and stable slope.\" He said it takes time for numbers to peter out because of the 7 to 14 day incubation perid.\n\nRutland County cluster: A Rutland County employer in the Fair Haven area has 12 cases within its population. Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro. Levine said the number of cases there is less than 10 but would not give an exact number as to not inadvertently identify the family.\n\nLevine said a cluster is when cases are confined to one main source such as a family, household or business and not distributed across the population. The term outbreak is used when transmission is beyond one particular source, he said.\n\n__________\n\nThere were 20 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state cumulative total to 1,184.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W.

Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Thousand of homes — as many as 220,000, reports said — were without power across the southern, coastal parts of the country Monday.\n\nPolice said one teenager was killed after a tree fell on a home in Kent and a Hertfordshire man in his 50s was killed when a tree fell on a car. U.K. officials reported at least five deaths total.\n\nFour people were killed Monday in Germany, adding to two deaths at sea off the German coast Sunday. Danish media says one man was killed by a flying brick just north of Copenhagen, and Amsterdam police said a woman there was killed by a falling tree.\n\nThe high winds and heavy rains forced the cancellation of at least 130 flights at Heathrow airport and authorities urged the public to take precautions and \"be prepared.\"\n\nAhead of the storm's landfall late Sunday night a 14-year-old boy was feared drowned after being swept out to sea near the town of Newhaven, in West Sussex.\n\nLocal media have dubbed the storm — one of the most severe to hit the British Isles in decades — \"St. Jude\" after the patron saint of lost causes. The saint is traditionally celebrated on Oct. 28.\n\nHowever, for many at London's Victoria train station, a major hub for the capital's rush-hour commuters, the severe weather did little more than cause some relatively mild inconvenience.\n\n\"I'll be standing here for a while,\" engineer David Simpson, 47, from Kent, said.\n\nTrains departing Victoria were running several hours late during the Monday morning rush-hour, but Simpson said that compared to the Great Storm of 1987 — when at least 22 people were killed as gale-force winds slammed the English Channel — the weather \"is nothing.\"\n\nAnother commuter, Karishma Thaladi, 24, summed up the delays as \"quite bad.\" Thaladi was grateful that her employer, a local bank, was flexible with start times.\n\nAway from Victoria, there were fewer taxis on the streets of London than there would normally be as the working week got underway and Transport for London delayed its overground services inside the capital until 9 a.m. local time.\n\nForecasters said that the storm would peak by mid-morning as it moved in a north-east direction out over the North Sea.\n\nBy 9 a.m. in Brighton, a beach town about an hour south of London, the sun was already out.\n\nKim Protheroe, a features editor for Brighton's The Argus newspaper, said, \"Ironically, I had the easiest journey to work ...

Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency and urged residents to prepare for the storm's arrival.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dorian battered the Virgin Islands, parts of Puerto Rico and its island-municipalities of Vieques and Culebra with powerful winds and heavy rainfall, which could lead to life-threatening flash flooding through Thursday morning.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for both U.S. and British Virgin Islands, as well as Vieques and Culebra. Puerto Rico was under a hurricane watch, and 100 flights to and from the main airport were canceled, but the U.S. territory was spared a direct hit.\n\nStay up to date on Dorian day and night:The Evening Briefing newsletter brings the news straight to your inbox\n\nOn Thursday, Dorian should be east of the Turks and Caicos and the southeastern Bahamas, likely growing to a Category 2 hurricane by the evening. By Friday or Saturday, forecasters expect it near or to the east of the central and northwestern Bahamas.\n\nThe hurricane was about 90 miles north of San Juan, Puerto Rico, as of 11 p.m. Wednesday, moving at 13 mph.\n\n\"Heavy rains are expected to occur over portions of the Bahamas, Florida, and elsewhere in the southeastern United States later this week and into early next week,'' the hurricane center said, urging residents in those areas to monitor the storm.\n\nNuking a hurricane? You can't nuke a hurricane to stop it, as Trump reportedly suggested. Here's why\n\nPresident Donald Trump has declared an emergency and ordered federal assistance for Puerto Rico the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nTrump tweeted Wednesday morning that he was tracking the storm closely, and he also took a shot at Puerto Rican officials.\n\n\"FEMA and all others are ready, and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!\" he said.\n\nDorian has already battered Barbados and St. Lucia this week, downing trees and power lines.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, the storm's threat sparked fears as the island continues to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria, which wiped out power two years ago.\n\nRuben Rodriguez, a reporter and editor at Puerto Rico’s leading newspaper, El Nuevo Dia, said residents promptly loaded up on supplied to brace for Dorian.\n\n“After Maria, everybody became an expert in hurricane preparation,'' said Rodriguez, who bought extra food and six cases of bottled water. \"As soon as word got out that a big storm was coming, people flooded the stores to buy water.’’\n\n'Absolute nightmare':4 former Florida nursing home staffers charged in 12 Hurricane Irma deaths\n\nRodriguez and Paco Figueroa, a semi-retired accountant who lives in the eastern town of Ceiba, said those who endured the impact of Maria were left with a sort of whiplash when a major weather system approaches.\n\nFigueroa didn't take any chances and drove early Wednesday to his daughter's house in the San Juan metropolitan area, away from the hurricane's path.\n\n“Maria left a deep scar here, and any storm provokes anxiety among people,'' he said. \"That’s understandable, because we haven’t totally recovered yet. There are still a lot of people with those blue tarps for roofs.’’\n\nTop officials say they are prepared this time with better equipment, though some concern persists. José Ortiz, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, told the Associated Press that the power system still has some weak areas and could \"suffer\" given the storm's wind speeds. But he said the agency has thousands of lights, poles and transformers.\n\nCristobal Jimenez, a community activist who lives in the northeastern city of Fajardo, said he went two months without power after Maria and that many in the island are wondering whether the lights will stay on after the grid repairs.\n\n“Dorian will show whether the distribution lines were glued with bubble gum,’’ Jimenez said.\n\nHe also noted that Puerto Ricans have a much better idea now of what it takes to prepare for a hurricane, and they’re better supplied with generators, water filters, solar lamps, food and water.\n\n\"I went to help out at the church today and you could see the movement on the street didn’t have the same feeling of desperation as before,'' Jimenez said. \"There was some anxiety, but it was along the lines of, ‘I need to get bread. I need to get a couple other small things.’ But it wasn’t the kind of chaos that’s often present.''\n\nElsewhere in the Atlantic, Tropical Depression Erin is forecast to move northeast, away from the U.S. East Coast. A weakened version of the storm could affect the Canadian Maritimes later in the week, the hurricane center said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

The PM is due to unveil the government’s long-term strategy for living with the virus in a press conference likely to take place this evening, with changes due to come into effect later in the week.

Queen plans to work from home\n\nThe Queen expects to continue carrying out “light duties” at Windsor over the coming week, said Buckingham Palace yesterday after announcing that the monarch had tested positive for Covid-19. The statement from the palace added that the Queen was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms”. Prince Charles tested positive on 10 February and had met with his mother on 8 February. “I’m sure I speak for everyone in wishing Her Majesty The Queen a swift recovery from Covid and a rapid return to vibrant good health,” tweeted the PM on Sunday.\n\nA look back at Queen Elizabeth’s ‘no-fuss’ approach to illness\n\n4. Biden and Putin to ‘hold talks’\n\nJoe Biden says he has agreed “in principle” to hold a summit with Vladimir Putin to discuss the crisis over Ukraine. The White House said the talks, proposed by France, would only take place if Russia does not invade its neighbour. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke twice to Vladimir Putin on Sunday for a total of nearly three hours, consulting Biden for 15 minutes in between the two calls. The development comes as reports suggest that Russian frontline commanders have been given orders to begin final preparations for an attack on Ukraine, said Sky News.\n\nIs Whitehall convinced Russia will invade Ukraine?\n\n5. MPs: PM should quit if fined\n\nTwo ministers have said the PM should quit if he is fined over Downing Street parties. “If he gets an FPN (fixed penalty notice) he’ll have to go. How can you have a prime minister who has been found guilty of breaking the law?”, one unnamed minister told The Times. Another minister said that “if the Met’s conclusion is effectively that he broke the regulations” then “it’s going to be very difficult for him to stay”. Legal experts say Johnson, who denies wrongdoing, could be fined more than £12,000 if he is found to have breached Covid laws.\n\nThe best Boris Johnson parody videos\n\n6.

The Swiss bank said it strongly rejected the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s alleged business practices or lack of due diligence carried out.\n\n7.

Record-breaking snowfall, Madrid\n\n(Image credit: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)\n\nIn the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\n2. Storm Christoph, UK\n\n(Image credit: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)\n\nThe period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\n3. Cyclone Ana, Fiji\n\n(Image credit: Leon Lord/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\n4. Winter storms, Texas\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\n5. Dust storm, China\n\n(Image credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nFlights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\n6. Flooding, New South Wales\n\n(Image credit: Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\n7. Cyclone Seroja\n\n(Image credit: Alfred Ike Wurin/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\n8. Record temperatures, Moscow\n\n(Image credit: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\n9. Heat dome, Pacific Northwest\n\n(Image credit: Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\nSoaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.\n\nBlistering Pacific Northwest temperatures should act as a wake-up call\n\n10. Bootleg fire, Oregon\n\n(Image credit: Payton Bruni/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA “heavier-than-normal start to the US wildfire season” saw “one of the largest blazes in Oregon’s history” consume more than 364,000 acres of land, the BBC reported in July. More than 2,000 firefighters tackled the wildfire, which took more than a month to contain. The fire “generated its own weather system”, noted Oregon Live, and thousands of homes were threatened by the blaze, which saw residents temporarily housed in evacuation centres in the state.\n\n11. Flooding, west Germany\n\n(Image credit: Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFloods destroyed homes and bridges along the River Ahr in July, while in the German village of Schuld, water “engulfed streets and swallowed homes” CNN reported. Victims will be supported by a government-approved €400 million recovery package, as ministers have promised to move quickly on rebuilding affected areas, Euronews reported. A study by World Weather Attribution found that this event was between 1.2 and nine times more likely to happen in 2021 compared to pre-industrial periods.\n\n12. Flooding, China\n\n(Image credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 300 people died when China’s Henan province experienced severe rainfall and flooding in July. Twelve people lost their lives in a Zhengzhou metro train, with survivors describing how water leaked through the carriage’s doors until it became difficult to breathe. While the country typically experiences flooding in the summer months, this year’s occurrence was “exacerbated by rapid urbanisation, conversion of farmland and the worsening climate crisis, as well as overwhelmed flood mitigation systems,” The Guardian reported.\n\n13. Wildfires, Greece\n\n(Image credit: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHuge wildfires “ravaged” large regions of southern Europe in August, claiming lives in Greece, Turkey and Italy, The Guardian reported. The blaze came as a heatwave swept the region, and Greece’s second largest island - Evia - was evacuated. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised for the blazes, and said that more than 580 fires have broken out in the past seven days. More than 20 countries offered to send firefighting resources, and the “camaraderie” that’s developed between Greek and British firefighters “is testament to the scale of the job before them”, Sky News reports.\n\n14. Hurricane Ida, US\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nMore than one million homes and businesses were left without power in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Ida made landfall on 29 August, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Ida hit with maximum sustained winds of 150mph. It was later downgraded to a tropical depression, and moved from a category four storm to category one. “Katrina followed a similar trajectory”, Sky News said. In the following days, Storm Ida moved up the northern-eastern coast of America. Subway stations and roads were flooded in New York, where the lives of at least nine people - including that of a two-year-old boy - were claimed by the storm. For communities in New Orleans, Ida has brought “painful reminders of the death and devastation” caused by the 2006 hurricane which killed more than 1,800 people, The New York Times reported.\n\n15. Monsoon floods, India and Nepal\n\n(Image credit: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSeveral Nepalese regions and two Indian states were hit by “heavy late monsoon rains” in October, Reuters reported. “Deadly flash floods” took the lives of more than 180 people as “homes were submerged or crushed by rocks”, said the BBC. The Nepalese government committed to giving each of the victims’ families $1,700 (£1,220) in response.\n\nThe unseasonal rainfall was attributed to the climate crisis, but some experts indicated that hydro-power projects in the Himalayas, and “excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes”, had contributed to the damage caused to the region’s “fragile ecology”, said the broadcaster.\n\n16. Tornadoes, Kentucky\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden said that Kentucky had experienced “one of the largest tornado outbreaks in US history”. More than 30 tornadoes “tore through” Kentucky and seven other states, claiming the lives of at least 90 people, and leaving thousands of residents homeless, said Sky News.\n\nThe state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said that this was “the most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky’s history”.\n\nTwo brothers, aged 15 months and three months old, were placed in a bathtub before being carried away by the severe winds. Their grandmother, Clara Lutz, later learned that both boys had been found alive in her garden under the upturned bath.\n\nBiden’s infrastructure bill has allocated billions of dollars to climate resilience projects, in the hope of strengthening infrastructure and defence against future extreme weather events.\n\n17. Typhoons, Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Red Cross described “complete carnage” in coastal areas of the country after Super Typhoon Rai “sent some 400,000 people running for safety” on 16 December, said the BBC. Thousands of military and service personnel were working to assist with search and rescue efforts in the worst-hit areas.\n\nWinds of around 120mph ripped through the nation’s south-eastern islands, injuring at least 500 people. A further 375 people are known to have died. “There are some areas that look like it has been bombed worse than World War Two,” Red Cross chair Richard Gordon told the BBC.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Brendan Morrow", "The Week Us", "Catherine Garcia", "Rafi Schwartz", "Devika Rao", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/02/22/wednesday-forecast-winter-weather-0222/11316127002/", "title": "Wednesday weather forecast: Winter storm warnings, blizzard, ice in ...", "text": "Thursday updates: Read the latest weather news here.\n\nA brutal winter storm that has stretched 2,600 miles coast to coast battered states from the West to the East Coast on Wednesday, moving into parts of Pennsylvania, New York and New England.\n\nThe storm knocked out power to more than 100,000 households in California early Wednesday, shuttered highways and prompted more than 1,000 flight cancellations.\n\nResidents in Western states and the Plains have faced severe winter weather for several days already this week and may see blizzard conditions and significant snowfall.\n\nAnd as the storm barrels across the country, dangerous conditions are landing farther east as an ice storm slicing across several Midwestern states and snow and sleet reached the Northeast.

Others shouted for the now-shuttered store to be re-opened.\n\n\"If we can't work, we have to come and get something to eat,\" said 60-year-old fisherman Anastasio Barrera, as he stood with his wife outside the store. \"The city government isn't doing anything for us, and neither is the state government.\"\n\nMexico was hit by the one-two punch of twin storms over the weekend, and Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said 57 storm-related deaths had occurred.\n\nThe country could get another double blow by week's end. A tropical disturbance formed over the Yucatan Peninsula on the country's eastern tip and Tropical Depression Manuel — the same storm that battered Acapulco — regained force in the Pacific. It was expected to hit Baja California on the country's far west as a renewed tropical storm.\n\nWith the twin roads from Acapulco to Mexico City closed down, at least 40,000 tourists saw a long holiday beach weekend degenerate into a desperate struggle to get weeping children, elderly parents and even a few damp, bedraggled dogs back home.\n\nTwo of Mexico's largest airlines were running about two flights an hour from Acapulco's still-flooded international airport Tuesday, with priority for those with tickets, the elderly and families with young children.\n\nEveryone else who couldn't wait for the government's promise to reopen the roads within two days flocked to Air Base 7, about 20 minutes north of Acapulco, where a military air bridge made up of barely more than a dozen aircraft ferried tourists to Mexico City. The normally quiet beachfront installation was transformed into a scene from a conflict zone.\n\nFamilies in shorts and sandals waited for as long as eight hours outside the gates of the base, held at bay by rifle-toting soldiers until they were allowed to drag suitcases, pet carriers and red-eyed children across the tarmac, where they jostled furiously for a chance at one of the 150 seats on the next departing Air Force Boeing 727.\n\nMilitary officials said only two of the passenger planes were in service, although a few hundred people got seats on one of the five helicopters or seven cargo planes also pressed into emergency duty.\n\nMany told of spending the weekend trapped by torrential rains inside their hotels, emerging to discover there was no way back home.\n\n\"It's probably one of the worst holidays I've ever been on,\" said David Jefferson Gled, a 28-year-old from Bristol, England, who teaches English at a private school in Mexico City. \"It wasn't really a holiday, more of an incarceration.\"\n\nBy the end of Tuesday, 24 hours after most vacationers were supposed to be back, about 2,750 people had been flown out of Acapulco, the Guerrero state government said. But many still waited miserably on the runway or, worse, with thousands of other sweating, blank-eyed people in a roughly quarter-mile-long line outside the base.\n\n\"It's horrible. We haven't eaten anything since nine in the morning,\" said Lizbeth Sasia, a 25-year-old teacher from Cuernavaca. \"They keep telling us we'll be on the next flight, but the next flight never comes.\"\n\nAdding insult to injury, a few immaculately dressed families skipped the line and were escorted to private jets by soldiers, to the incredulous stares of the sweltering masses.\n\n\"We're cooking here, burnt. We're tired, desperate,\" said Irma Antonio Martinez, a 43-year-old housewife from suburban Mexico City who came to celebrate the three-day Independence Day weekend with 12 relatives. \"We just want to get home to our poor house. Our families are waiting for us.\"\n\nAsked how she felt, Juana Colin Escamilla cradled her toddler daughter and was able to get out one word, \"bad\" before she burst into tears.\n\nSome cash machines along Acapulco's coastal boulevard were low on bills, but most of the city's tourist zone appeared back to normal, with roads clear, restaurants and hotels open and brightly lit and tourists strolling along the bay in an attempt to recover some of the leisure time lost to three days of incessant rains.\n\nGavin McLoughlin, 27, another teacher at Mexico City's Greengates School, said he went to Acapulco on a late-night bus Thursday with about 30 other teachers at the school, many of whom are in their 20s.\n\n\"We had no idea of the weather,\" the Englishman said. \"We knew there was a hurricane on the other side but not this side.\"\n\nFederal officials said it could take at least another two days to open the main highway between Mexico and Acapulco, which was hit by more than 13 landslides, and to bring food and relief supplies into the city of more than 800,000 people.\n\nCity officials said about 23,000 homes, mostly on Acapulco's outskirts, were without electricity and water.

Here are some of the worst to have hit the UK in recent history.\n\n1. 1953\n\nCanvey Island, Essex (Image credit: Daily Herald Archive/National Science & Media Museum/SSPL via Getty Images)\n\nThe 1953 storm was the “worst peacetime disaster on record”, said the BBC. It claimed the lives of 307 people in England, 19 in Scotland, and a further 2,225 in the Netherlands, Belgium and at sea.\n\nThe storm hit on the evening of 31 January 1953, which had otherwise seen people carry out “their daily businesses as usual”, said The History Press. Fishing boats went out, buses ran their routes, and “it was a typical Saturday for the people living on the coast”. This “was soon to change”, as the tide “surged over the sea walls taking many by surprise and leaving no time to warn others”.\n\nFierce winds of 126mph were recorded at Costa Hill in Scotland and a tidal surge saw the North Sea soar up to more than five metres above its average level. The storm “brought havoc” to more than 1,000 miles of coastline, said the BBC, and particularly the east coast of England.\n\nMore than 30,000 people were displaced by the flooding, and the events caused “a major rethinking of coastal defences, weather prediction and warning systems after it became obvious that the majority of deaths could have been avoided had these already been in place”.\n\n2. 1987\n\nLangton Green, Kent (Image credit: Mirrorpix/Getty Images)\n\nThe 1987 storm has been referred to as a “once in 200 year event”, and is sometimes referred to as the “Michael Fish hurricane”, named after the BBC weather forecaster who assured viewers there wouldn’t be a hurricane that evening. Though the Met Office noted that he was scientifically correct, the winds were far greater than forecast and Fish’s name “became synonymous with wrong predictions”, said Sky News.\n\nSevere weather was predicted several days before the storm hit in mid-October, but forecasts “started to give a less clear picture” as they got closer to the day itself. “By the time most people went to bed” on 15 October, “exceptionally strong winds hadn’t been mentioned in national radio and TV weather broadcasts”, the Met continued. But by the early hours of 16 October, the depression that had begun developing over the Bay of Biscay had made its way over the western Channel.\n\nWinds of up to 100mph saw many parts of the UK “ravaged” on 16 October, said the Met Office. Trees as high as 15m were blown down and 18 people were killed, while thousands of people were left without power. Most destruction was felt in the south-east of England, and the patterns of damage suggested “whirlwinds accompanied the storm”.\n\n“Numerous small boats were wrecked or blown away,” the weather agency continued.\n\n3. 1990\n\nDitchling, East Sussex (Image credit: Ed Simons / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nIt’s estimated that £2bn worth of damage was caused by the Burns Day storm of 1990, making it “the costliest of the past 30 years”, said The Telegraph. “Hurricane-force winds” brought “chaos” to the UK, “with many railway stations, roads and ports forced to close”, the BBC reported.\n\nThe storm hit the south-west of England on the morning of 25 January 1990, and by 8am “police in the West Country, the Bristol area and Hampshire were inundated with calls”, said the broadcaster. Half a million homes were left without electricity, and 47 people died.\n\nStorm Daria “was marginally less powerful than its better known predecessor of 1987”, but it resulted in the greatest loss of life since the 1953 North Sea floods, partly because the storm arrived during the day. The area impacted by the strong winds was also larger than that impacted in 1987.\n\n4. 2013 – 2014\n\nHemsby, Norfolk (Image credit: Stephen Pond/Stringer via Getty Images)\n\nThe UK experienced the “stormiest December since 1969” in 2013, said Countryfile. The UK was “battered by strong winds and lashed by heavy rain” as “a ferocious series of storms” swept in from the Atlantic between the end of October 2013 and February 2014, said the BBC.\n\nThe months of disruption and damage began with St Jude’s storm, which “caused chaos across parts of Europe” and claimed the lives of four people in Britain after hitting on 27 October. December was the sixth wettest December on record, said the BBC, while January brought further “havoc” with “high winds, rain and strong waves” battering the coastline.\n\nBut it was in December and January that the worst of the extreme weather was felt. Storms in recent years had been “comparable or more severe”, but it was “the rapid succession” of events that “made the spell exceptional”, said the Met Office.\n\n5. 2020\n\nEast Cowick, Yorkshire (Image credit: Oli Scarff / AFP / Getty Images)\n\nStorm Ciara brought “hurricane-force winds and flooding” to the UK, with “winds of more than 90mph knocking out power to homes” in some regions, said The Guardian.\n\n“Communities in the north of England that have suffered the brunt of flooding in recent years were hit again” on 9 February 2020, with residents in the Calder Valley reporting “cars being swept away and water engulfing defences” that had been built up since previous flooding in 2015.\n\nCiara was soon followed by Storms Dennis and Jorge, and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) estimated that the industry would “pay out £363m to victims of the bad weather”, said the Evening Standard, with flooded households expected to receive an average of £32,000.\n\nThe ABI’s assistant director Mark Shepherd said: “Insurers’ first priority when bad weather strikes is always to help customers recover from the traumatic experience as quickly as possible,” reported Sky News. “When the flood waters recede, the hard work begins.”\n\n6. 2022\n\nDamage caused by Storm Eunice outside Windsor Castle (Image credit: Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images)\n\nThe ongoing Storm Eunice could prove to be “the worst storm in a generation” with winds reaching 122mph on the Isle of Wight, reported The Telegraph.\n\nThe wind speed is “on par with category three level wind speeds on the Hurricane Wind Scale”, posing a major risk of “structural damage to small buildings and serious coastal flooding to those on low lying land”.\n\nThe storm has led to “power cuts, flight cancellations, hundreds of school closures, and a number of major bridges being closed” across the UK, reported the BBC, with major incidents declared in Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Avon and Somerset and Hampshire.\n\nThe Met Office has also warned that a dangerous weather phenomenon known as a “sting jet” – a “small area of highly intense wind inside a storm” – could form later on Friday, causing further damage and disruption.\n\nSting jets are generally quite narrow at just 30 miles across, but can create winds of “at least 100mph”, meaning “they are extremely dangerous and create significant damage and risk to life”, Sky News reported.\n\nThere are widespread reports of trees being brought down by intense gusts of winds, as well as structural damage to several buildings across England. The storm has also torn a “huge” hole into the roof of London’s 02 Arena, which one eyewitness told ITV was “completely shredded”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "The Week Uk", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Rebekah Evans", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Fred Kelly", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/business/sam-bankman-fried-arrested/index.html", "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's founder, is arrested in the Bahamas ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed crypto exchange FTX, was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday after US prosecutors filed criminal charges against him, according to a statement from the government of the Bahamas.\n\nThe Southern District of New York, which is investigating Bankman-Fried and the collapse of FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda, confirmed his arrest on Twitter.\n\n“Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY,” wrote US attorney Damian Williams. “We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.”\n\nBankman-Fried, was arrested without incident at his apartment complex shortly after 6 pm ET Monday in Nassau, and is set to appear in court Tuesday, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a statement.\n\nA representative for Bankman-Fried’s legal team didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nShortly after the SDNY confirmed his arrest, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had authorized separate charges relating to Bankman-Fried’s “violations of securities laws,” which will be filed publicly on Tuesday.\n\nIt’s unclear what charges await Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old crypto celebrity who became a pariah overnight last month as his company suffered a liquidity crisis and filed for bankruptcy, leaving at least a million depositors unable to access their funds.\n\nThe New York Times, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that the charges against Bankman-Fried included wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.\n\nThe United States’ extradition treaty with the Bahamas allows US prosecutors to return defendants to American soil if the charges would be considered punishable by imprisonment of at least a year in both jurisdictions.\n\nIn the four weeks since FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried has sought to cast himself as a somewhat hapless chief executive who got out over his skis, denying accusations that he defrauded FTX’s customers.\n\n“I didn’t knowingly commit fraud,” he told the BBC over the weekend. “I didn’t want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.”\n\nBankman-Fried was scheduled Tuesday to appear virtually before the US House Financial Services Committee, which is demanding answers about how the company came crashing down, ricocheting throughout the digital asset ecosystem. Several crypto companies have halted operations, freezing customer accounts and in some cases filing for bankruptcy themselves because of their exposure to FTX.\n\nAfter his arrest, Rep. Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the committee, said Bankman-Fried would no longer give testimony as scheduled Tuesday. The hearing was set to move ahead, however, beginning with testimony from FTX’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, who took over for Bankman-Fried on November 11 and is tasked with shepherding it through the bankruptcy process.\n\n“While I am disappointed that we will not be able to hear from Mr. Bankman-Fried tomorrow, we remain committed to getting to the bottom of what happened,” Waters said in a statement Monday night.\n\nRay has so far painted a picture of a crypto empire with virtually no corporate controls and a shocking lack of financial and other record-keeping.\n\n“The scope of the investigation underway is enormous,” Ray said in prepared remarks released Monday ahead of his testimony.\n\nWhile the probe isn’t completed, Ray said, FTX’s collapse appears to stem from the concentration of power “in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals” who failed to implement virtually any corporate controls.\n\nRay also states as fact that “customer assets from FTX.com were commingled with assets from the Alameda trading platform.” That’s a key issue for investigators, as FTX and Alameda were, on paper, separate entities.\n\nSBF’s denials\n\nBankman-Fried has denied knowingly commingling funds and sought to distance himself from the day-to-day management of Alameda, which made a number of high-risk trading strategies such as arbitrage and “yield farming,” aka investing in digital tokens that pay interest-rate-like rewards, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHe has admitted to mismanaging FTX and not paying enough attention to risk.\n\n“Look, I screwed up,” he said at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit late last month. “I was CEO of FTX…I had a responsibility.”\n\nBankman-Fried also acknowledged the lack of corporate controls and risk management within the businesses he oversaw.\n\n“There was no person who was chiefly in charge of positional risk of customers on FTX,” Bankman-Fried told DealBook. “And that feels pretty embarrassing in retrospect.”\n\nOne of the key questions about FTX’s collapse stems from a Reuters report last month that says Bankman-Fried built a “backdoor” into FTX’s accounting system, allowing him to alter the company’s financial records without tripping accounting red flags. The report said Bankman-Fried used this “backdoor” to transfer $10 billion in FTX customer funds to Alameda, the hedge fund, and at least $1 billion is now missing.\n\nBankman-Fried has denied knowledge of any such backdoor. “I don’t even know how to code,” he told cryptocurrency vlogger Tiffany Fong in an interview last month.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}]}

Researchers say it would also be a harbinger of declining health in men in general, since semen quality can be an important marker of overall health.\n\nThe review, and its conclusions, have sparked a debate among experts in male fertility. Some say the findings are real and urgent, but others say they are not convinced by the data because the methods of counting sperm have changed so much over time that it’s not possible to compare historical and modern numbers.\n\nNearly all experts agree that the issue needs more study.\n\n“I think one of the fundamental functions of any species is reproduction. So I think if there is a signal that reproduction is in decline, I think that’s a very important finding,” said Dr. Michael Eisenberg, a urologist with Stanford Medicine who was not involved in the review.\n\n“There is a strong link between a man’s reproductive health and his overall health. So it could also speak to that too, that maybe we’re not as healthy as we once were,” he said.\n\nOthers say that while the review was well-done, they are skeptical about its conclusions.\n\n“The way that semen analysis is done has changed over the decades. It has improved. It has become more standardized, but not perfectly,” said Dr. Alexander Pastuczak, a surgeon and assistant professor the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City. He was not involved in the review.\n\n“Even if you were to take the same semen sample and run it and do a semen analysis on it in the 1960s and ’70s versus today, you’d get two different answers,” he said.\n\nPastuczak says that in more contemporary studies of semen analysis, ones that rely on samples analyzed by a different method, “you don’t see these trends.” In fact, some studies in Northern European regions show sperm counts going up over time, not down, he said.\n\nThe new analysis updates a review published in 2017 and for the first time includes new data from Central and South America, Asia and Africa. It was published in the journal Human Reproduction Update.\n\nAn international team of researchers combed through nearly 3,000 studies that recorded men’s sperm counts and were published between 2014 and 2020, years that had not been included in their previous analysis.\n\nThe researchers excluded studies that featured only men who were being evaluated for infertility, those that selected only men who had normal sperm counts and those whose study participants were selected based on genital abnormalities or diseases. They included only studies published in English, those with 10 or more men and those with participants whose sperm was collected in the typical way and counted using a device called a hemocytometer.\n\nIn the end, just 38 studies met their criteria. They added these to studies included in their previous review and extracted their data, which was fed into models.\n\nOverall, the researchers determined that sperm counts fell by sightly more than 1% per year between 1973 and 2018. The study concluded that globally, the average sperm count had fallen 52% by 2018.\n\nWhen the study researchers restricted their analysis to certain years, they found that the decline in sperm counts seemed to be accelerating, from an average of 1.16% per year after 1973 to 2.64% per year after 2020.\n\n“It’s really remarkable that actually the decline is increasing,” said study author Dr. Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist and public health researcher at the Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine.\n\nOn a population level, the average sperm count dropped from 104 million to 49 million per milliliter from 1973 through 2019. Normal sperm counts are considered to be over 40 million per milliliter.\n\nCauses of the decline are unknown\n\nThe study authors say they didn’t have enough data from different regions to be able to tell whether some countries had lower average sperm counts than others or whether sperm counts were declining faster in certain areas. Data from 53 countries was included in the review.\n\nThe authors also didn’t look at what might be causing the decline. “It should be studied,” Levine said.\n\nIn other research, Levine says, he and others have teased out some factors that are associated with lower sperm counts.\n\nDamage to reproductive health may begin in the womb.\n\n“We know that stress of the mother, maternal smoking and especially exposure to manmade chemicals that are in plastic, such as phthalates, disrupt the development of the male reproductive system,” Levine said.\n\nLifestyle may also play an important role. Obesity, a lack of physical activity and diets high in ultraprocessed food may all be culprits, he said.\n\n“The same factors that harm health in general usually are also harmful to semen quality,” he said.\n\nOne expert said that, ultimately, trying to do this kind of study is fraught with problems that complicate the findings.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“The paper is very scientifically or statistically robust and does a good job of summarizing the data that is available in our field. But it’s important to recognize that that data is still very limited in how it was collected and how it was reported,” said Dr. Scott Lundy, a urologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved in the research.\n\nStandards and methods for counting sperm have changed greatly over time, Lundy says, making it difficult to compare modern counts to historical data.\n\nStill, he said, that historical data is all that’s available to the field.\n\n“While it’s not a cause for panic, because the counts are by and large still normal, on average, there is a risk that they could become abnormal in the future, and we have to recognize that and study that further,” Lundy said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/health/30-year-old-embryos-twins/index.html", "title": "Parents welcome twins from embryos frozen 30 years ago | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn April 1992, Vanessa Williams’ “Save the Best for Last” topped the Billboard 100, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton was running for the White House, “Who’s the Boss?” aired its final episode, and the babies born to Rachel and Philip Ridgeway a couple of weeks ago were frozen as embryos.\n\nBorn on October 31, Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from what may be the longest-frozen embryos to ever result in a live birth, according to the National Embryo Donation Center.\n\nThe previous known record holder was Molly Gibson, born in 2020 from an embryo that had been frozen for nearly 27 years. Molly took the record from her sister Emma, who was born from an embryo that had been frozen for 24 years.\n\nIt’s possible an older frozen embryo may have been used; although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks success rates and data around reproductive technologies, it does not track how long embryos have been frozen. But there’s no evidence of an older embryo resulting in a live birth.\n\n“There is something mind-boggling about it,” Philip Ridgeway said as he and his wife cradled their newborns in their laps at their home outside Portland, Oregon. “I was 5 years old when God gave life to Lydia and Timothy, and he’s been preserving that life ever since.”\n\n“In a sense, they’re our oldest children, even though they’re our smallest children,” Ridgeway added. The Ridgeways have four other children, ages 8, 6, 3 and almost 2, none conceived via IVF or donors.\n\nThe embryos were created for an anonymous married couple using in-vitro fertilization. The husband was in his early 50s, and they used a 34-year-old egg donor.\n\nThe embryos were frozen on April 22, 1992.\n\nFor nearly three decades, they sat in storage on tiny straws kept in liquid nitrogen at nearly 200 degrees below zero, in a device that looks much like a propane tank.\n\nThe embryos were kept at a fertility lab on the West Coast until 2007, when the couple who created them donated the embryos to the National Embryo Donation Center in Knoxville, Tennessee, in hopes another couple might be able to use them. The five embryos were overnighted in specially outfitted tanks to Knoxville, said Dr. John Gordon, the Ridgeways’ doctor.\n\n“We’ve never had in our minds a set number of children we’d like to have,” Philip said. “We’ve always thought we’ll have as many as God wants to give us, and … when we heard about embryo adoption, we thought that’s something we would like to do.”\n\nUnderstanding embryo donation\n\nThe medical name for the process the Ridgeways went through is embryo donation.\n\nWhen people undergo IVF, they may produce more embryos than they use. Extra embryos can be cryopreserved for future use, donated to research or training to advance the science of reproductive medicine, or donated to people who would like to have children.\n\nAs with any other human tissue donation, embryos must meet certain US Food and Drug Administration eligibility guidelines to be donated, including being screened for certain infectious diseases.\n\n“Embryo adoption is not a legal ‘adoption’ at all, at least in the sense of a traditional adoption which occurs after birth,” the National Embryo Donation Center says. “However, the term allows all parties to conceptualize the process and eventual reality of raising a non-genetically related child.”\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine says, “Application of the term ‘adoption’ to embryos is inaccurate, is misleading, and could place burdens upon recipients and should be avoided.”\n\nMany colloquially call the donor process “embryo adoption,” but adoption and donation are not one and the same, said Dr. Sigal Klipstein, a Chicago-based fertility specialist and chair of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine’s ethics committee.\n\n“Adoption refers to living children,” Klipstein said. “It’s a legal process by which a parent-child relationship is created when it did not previously exist.”\n\nEmbryo donation, she said, is a medical procedure. “It’s a way by which we take embryos from one couple or individual and then transfer them into another individual in order to build families.”\n\nThe phrase “adoption” has become wrapped up in a larger cultural debate, used predominantly by those in faith-based communities with conservative leanings. The National Embryo Donation Center is a private, Christian-led organization. It requires recipients to pass a “family assessment” and says “couples must be a genetic male and a genetic female married for a minimum of 3 years.” The center says it has helped with the births of over 1,260 infants from donated embryos.\n\nKlipstein says that using donated embryos can often be cost-effective for people looking for fertility help, as it cuts out the price of looking for and storing donor sperm and eggs. “They don’t get the genetic connection to the children,” she said, “but they do have a much less expensive reproductive option than even with in-vitro fertilization in most cases.”\n\n‘We just wanted the ones that had been waiting the longest’\n\nFor the Ridgeways, building their family was always part of a larger calling.\n\n“We weren’t looking to get the embryos that have been frozen the longest in the world,” Philip Ridgeway said. “We just wanted the ones that had been waiting the longest.”\n\nWhen looking for donors, the Ridgeways specifically asked the donation center about a category called “special consideration,” meaning it had been hard to find recipients for these embryos, for whatever reason.\n\n“Going into this, we knew that we could trust God to do whatever he had sovereignly planned and that their age really had no factor. It was just a matter of whether or not that was in God’s plans,” Rachel Ridgeway said.\n\nTo pick their embryos, they went through a donor database. It did not list the how long embryos have been frozen, but it listed the donors’ characteristics like ethnicity, age, height, weight, genetic and health history, education, occupation, favorite movies and music. With some files, there are photos of the parents and of their children if they have them.\n\nThe Ridgeways assumed those listed with earlier donor numbers had been at the center the longest and tried to narrow their choice to those profiles.\n\nRisks of multiples\n\nSoutheastern Fertility, which partners with National Embryo Donation Center, thawed the embryos February 28. Of the five that were thawed, two were not viable. There’s about an 80% survival rate when thawing frozen embryos, experts say.\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the CDC both recommend transferring one embryo at a time, as transferring more raises the likelihood for multiples, which also potentially increases risk for both mother and child. Twin babies are more likely to be born early, develop cerebral palsy, have autism and result in stillbirth.\n\nRachel remembers Gordon handing her a picture of the three embryos and recommending they transfer only two, telling her, “multiples can cause problems in pregnancy.” But she said there was no question in her mind that they would transfer all three.\n\nShe remembers getting teary-eyed and saying, “You just showed me a picture of my three children. I have to have them all.”\n\nPhilip and Rachel Ridgeway had twins born from embryos that were frozen for about 30 years. Courtesy Philip and Rachel Ridgeway\n\nThe remaining three embryos were transferred into Rachel on March 2, 29 years and 10 months after they were frozen. Two of the transfers were successful. Studies have found that 25% to 40% of frozen embryo transfers result in a live birth.\n\nLike ‘Rip Van Winkle’\n\nEmbryos can be frozen pretty much indefinitely, experts said.\n\n“If you’re frozen at nearly 200 degrees below zero, I mean, the biological processes essentially slow down to almost nothing. And so perhaps the difference between being frozen for a week, a month, a year, a decade, two decades, it doesn’t really matter,” Gordon said.\n\nDr. Jim Toner, a fertility specialist in Atlanta, likens it to an old story: “It doesn’t seem like a sperm or an egg or embryo stored in liquid nitrogen ever experiences time. It’s like that Rip Van Winkle thing. It just wakes up 30 years later, and it never knew it was asleep.”\n\nThe age of the embryo shouldn’t affect the health of the child. What matters more is the age of the woman who donated the egg that went into the embryo.\n\n“If that patient was 25, yes, most likely, her embryos will survive,” said Dr. Zaher Merhi, a fertility expert at the Rejuvenating Fertility Center in New York City. “It’s all about the egg and the embryo and when the egg was taken out.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe Ridgeways say they’ve wanted their kids involved all along the process, so they have been explaining it to them as they went through the steps.\n\n“They were excited and happy with us every step along the way. They love their siblings, and they play together and were looking forward to finding out whether God had given them two boys, two girls or a brother and a sister,” Phillip Ridgeway said.\n\nLydia was born at 5 pounds, 11 ounces, and Timothy was 6 pounds, 7 ounces.\n\n“They were good-size babies,” Rachel Ridgeway said. “It really is God’s grace because he has just sustained us each step of the way.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen Nadia Kounang", "Jen Christensen", "Nadia Kounang"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/02/14/mens-health-fertility/11250643002/", "title": "Men's health: Penis length has grown 24% in recent decades. That ...", "text": "Studies of men from around the world show that the length of the erect penis has grown 24% over the last 30 years.\n\nThat sounds like it would be good news but it concerns some male fertility experts.\n\n\"The million-dollar question is why this would occur,\" said Dr. Michael Eisenberg, a urologist and male fertility specialist at Stanford Medicine, who led the research, published Tuesday in The World's Journal of Men's Health.\n\nOther research has shown that both sperm count and testosterone levels are falling.\n\nPenile length may not be directly related to fertility, Eisenberg said, but anything that changes the reproductive system is fundamental to human existence and \"something we should pay attention to and try to understand why.\"\n\nWhat the study showed\n\nStudies have measured penile length dating back at least 80 years, Eisenberg said.\n\nHe and his team compiled data from 75 studies conducted between 1942 and 2021, on nearly 56,000 men. They found the average erect penis length increased by 24% over the last 29 years.\n\nThe trend was apparent in different regions of the world, he said. \"This was not isolated to a specific population.\"\n\nThe average length of the erect penis across all regions and decades was about 5.5 inches, the study found.\n\nDr. James Hotaling, a urologist and men's infertility specialist at the University of Utah Health, praised the study but said he's not yet convinced that penises are growing longer.\n\nThe simplest explanation, he said, is that the method of measurement has changed over the last 30 years – though there's no evidence that has happened.\n\nMore:Sperm counts are decreasing, study finds. What might it mean for fertility?\n\nWhy study this?\n\nEisenberg got interested in the topic because of declining male sperm counts and testosterone levels. He thought research would show that penises are shrinking as these levels fall and men get more obese.\n\nInstead, he found that they're growing and at a pretty fast clip. \"It certainly was very surprising,\" he said.\n\nHotaling said it's unclear what the clinical impact of this finding might be, but he agreed that it contradicted his expectations. \"This would not support the sperm apocalypse.\"\n\nWhat might explain it?\n\nEisenberg thinks the change in length might be explained by earlier puberty. Boys, like girls, have been reaching puberty earlier in recent years. Perhaps, he said, that's giving their bodies a longer time to grow overall.\n\nHotaling wants more evidence.

SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\n“This adds to the evidence from animal studies, studies of humans undergoing fertility treatment, and the COVID-19 vaccine trials, none of which found an association between COVID-19 vaccination and lower fertility,” the researchers wrote. “Similarly, several studies have documented no appreciable association between COVID-19 vaccination and miscarriage risk.”\n\nThe study included data on 2,126 women, ages 21 to 45, in the United States and Canada. The women enrolled in the study from December 2020 through September 2021, and the researchers followed up with them through November 2021.\n\nDuring the study, the women completed questionnaires online every eight weeks about their reproductive and medical histories, among other factors, and they were given the option to invite their male partners to complete questionnaires. Among the participants, 73% of the women and 74% of their male partners had received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the questionnaire responses and found no association between having been vaccinated against Covid-19 and the probability of conceiving a child within one menstrual cycle. Yet the data showed that although a previous Covid-19 infection was not strongly associated with the probability of conceiving among the women, the men who had Covid-19 were associated with a “transient reduction” in the probability of conceiving.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health announced the study findings in a news release Thursday and noted that couples in which the male partner had tested positive within 60 days were 18% less likely to conceive in that menstrual cycle, but there was no difference in conception rates for couples in which the male partner had tested positive more than 60 days before a cycle, compared with couples in which the male partner had not tested positive.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMore research is needed to determine what might be driving these findings, but fever is known to reduce sperm count and is a symptom of Covid-19, according to the NIH.\n\n“The findings provide reassurance that vaccination for couples seeking pregnancy does not appear to impair fertility,” Dr. Diana Bianchi, director of the NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which funded the study, said in the announcement. “They also provide information for physicians who counsel patients hoping to conceive.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2016/01/02/erasing-phobias-industrial-nations-infertility/78130050/", "title": "Erasing phobias; industrial nations' infertility", "text": "BY MICHAEL ROIZEN, M.D., AND MEHMET OZ, M.D.\n\nQ: I have a fear of snakes that I cannot get a handle on. Not that I come across them very often, but they still creep me out. I’ve tried therapy and some anti-anxiety meds, but nothing seems to help. Any ideas?\n\n— Samantha G., Boulder, Colorado\n\nA: Phobias are common and can range from mild aversions to life-altering anxieties. Overall, they affect about 19 million people in the U.S., and women are twice as likely as men to contend with phobias. Specifically, around 12 percent of women and 3 percent of men have a fear of spiders and snakes.\n\nFor years people have relied on a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, desensitization therapy (gradual exposure to the object of fear), beta-blockers, antidepressants and sedatives to ease symptoms. And while many people find relief from their fears, no single approach works for everyone.\n\nHowever, a new study has found that evoking a fear (of spiders) and two minutes later administering a 40-mg dose of the beta-blocker propranolol (40 mg twice a day is the standard initial dose for high blood pressure) is a very effective treatment. That treatment protocol cleared the phobia for a year (that’s how long they followed the study participants).\n\nHow is this possible? Turns out that propranolol — which is used to control high blood pressure, help avoid a repeat heart attack and reduce migraine attacks — is also an amnesia-inducing drug. It does this if given before a memory becomes consolidated, and it blocks fears triggered by specific cues (like a spider or a snake). One of the researchers described the process of eradicating the phobia as “more like surgery than therapy.” Another big plus: This may be effective in treating PTSD — an often-intractable and life-altering anxiety disorder that affects everyone from soldiers to hurricane victims. So ask your therapist or GP about trying this technique. And let us know what happens if you do try it.\n\nQ: My son is only 28, and he and his wife are having a terrible time conceiving because of his poor sperm quality. He doesn’t smoke, is not overweight and this problem doesn’t run in the family. How can this have happened?\n\n— Becky, Boston\n\nA: There can be all kinds of reasons, from genetics (which might not apply in your son’s case) to unknown toxin exposure at work.\n\nAbnormal sperm have a large or misshapen head or a crooked or double tail that prevents the sperm from being able to penetrate the egg. But abnormal shapes aren’t the only reason for male infertility. It also can be associated with low semen volume, low sperm count and how lively the sperm are in their movement (called motility). Fortunately, in-vitro fertilization can be effective if, over time, conception doesn’t occur.\n\nBut a disturbing new study out of Denmark and the U.S. offers another insight: The environment in industrialized countries is devastating to male fertility. Hormone disruptors such as BPAs in cash register receipts and flexible plastics, phthalates in household products, other common chemicals, plus our modern lifestyle (more sitting, being overweight, eating processed foods) are the causes. The researchers say that for men, adult reproductive problems “may start (before birth) in utero ... and (are) most often related to environmental exposures of the fetal testes ... However, environmental factors can also affect the adult endocrine system.”\n\nWhatever the trigger, the scientists also note that “we found such poor semen quality among young men aged 20 to 25. The average man had up to 90 percent abnormal sperm.” So we would encourage your son to try to reduce his exposure to pesticides, plastics, receipts, BPA lining in canned foods and processed foods. He should increase his activity level, get seven to eight hours of quality sleep a night, take 600 mg of DHA omega-3 and a multivitamin daily, and be patient.

But the couples' chances of conceiving decreased slightly if the male partner had contracted the virus 60 days or less before the other partner's menstrual cycle, an indication of diminished male fertility.\n\nOne possible reason for that, researchers theorized, is the likelihood coronavirus infection would cause a fever, which has been known to reduce sperm count.\n\nAmong the males in the study who tested positive more than 60 days before the cycle, conception rates were the same as males who had not been infected. But couples in which the male was infected within that 60-day window were 18% less likely to conceive in that cycle.\n\n“The findings provide reassurance that vaccination for couples seeking pregnancy does not appear to impair fertility,” said Diana Bianchi, M.D., director of NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which funded the study. “They also provide information for physicians who counsel patients hoping to conceive.”\n\nMisinformation about the impact of COVID vaccines on pregnancy and fertility has been so prevalent that some doctors have proactively dispelled the myth with their patients of reproductive age.\n\nIn September 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urgently exhorted those who were pregnant or planning to conceive to get vaccinated , after the pandemic's highest number of COVID deaths among pregnant people was recorded the month before.\n\n\"In addition to the risks of severe illness and death for pregnant and recently pregnant people,'' the CDC wrote, \"there is an increased risk for adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, including preterm birth and admission of their neonate(s) to an intensive care unit.''\n\nAlso in the news:\n\n►U.S. Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Raul Grijalva of Arizona said Thursday they have tested positive for COVID-19 for the second time.

Fines could rise up to 3,600 euros ($4,000) for repeat violators. Some exemptions for medical reasons and previous infections would be allowed.\n\n“This is how we can manage to escape the cycle of opening and closing, of lockdowns,” Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said. “That is why this law is so urgently needed right now.”\n\nAbout 72% of Austria's population of 8.9 million is fully vaccinated.\n\nIndiana considers approving ivermectin for COVID-19 despite FDA warnings\n\nAn Indiana lawmaker wants to block the state's health care providers from discouraging use of the anti-parasite medicine ivermectin to treat COVID-19, a controversial treatment that has been rejected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe legislation authored by Republican Rep. Curt Nisly would allow an Indiana doctor or advanced practice registered nurse to write a standing order for ivermectin – and ban pharmacists from discouraging using of the drug to treat coronavirus.\n\nThe FDA says ivermectin should never be used to treat or prevent COVID-19, and that incorrect use has required some patients to seek medical treatment. \"Currently available data do not show ivermectin is effective against COVID-19,\" the FDA says on its website.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Struble, president of the Indiana State Medical Association, said in an emailed statement that she found the proposed legislation concerning.\n\n“A health care provider prescribing an unproven therapy can be dangerous for the health of Hoosiers,” Struble said. \"What’s even more dangerous is legislating the creation of a very broad, standing-order mechanism so pharmacists can freely dispense an unproven therapy.”\n\n– Shari Rudavsky, Indianapolis Star\n\nIs there COVID in the air?

The letter argues the science supports immediate vaccine access and “procedural red tape” is preventing that. Pfizer announced early tests showed the 3-microgram doses given to 2- to 5-year-olds didn’t produce as much immune protection as did shots given to other age groups. The company hopes an additional dose of vaccine will provide the desired effectiveness, but that means waiting several more weeks for results.\n\nBased on previous actions by the FDA, the COVID vaccine may be available for children 2 to 4 around May, said Dr. Robert Frenck, director of the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Children 6 to 24 months may have to wait until late summer or fall, he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, presidential medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said he hopes the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine for kids under 5 will be authorized \"within the next month or so.''\n\n– Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nTwo years later, concerns over pandemic grow\n\nAmericans' pandemic fears rose with the infection rate in January, prompting most Americans to avoid large crowds even as masking and vaccine rates remain mostly stagnant, a new survey indicates. A Gallup poll of 1,569 U.S. adults, conducted online Jan. 3-14, found a steep rise in the percentage of Americans who said the pandemic is \"getting worse,\" as compared to fall 2021 data. Americans' optimism had increased when vaccines started rolling out, but now over half of respondents said they think the pandemic is getting worse.\n\n\"Worry has jumped ... and is now the highest it has been since last winter, before COVID-19 vaccines were readily available to the general public,\" a summary of poll results says.\n\n– Claire Thornton, USA TODAY\n\nOmicron spike may be near peak in California\n\nCalifornia, where an omicron-driven spike in COVID-19 cases occurred later than in cities such as Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C., may reach peak case numbers and see case rates begin to fall this week, according to a forecast from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The model predicted a peak in cases from the state for Jan. 19, with an estimation of almost 130,000 cases a day.\n\nEarlier this week, USA TODAY talked to Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University in Atlanta and part of the Sewer Coronavirus Alert Network, a team of scientists that evaluates sewage treatment plants to gain information about COVID-19 rates in California communities. Wolfe said then that testing in about a dozen California cities, the largest of which are Sacramento and San Jose, shows a few cities with possible downward trends but nothing concrete.\n\nOther cities are on the rise, and it will take more time or data to determine where peaks have occurred, Wolfe said.\n\nTesting firm fraudulently reported negative test results, complaint says\n\nThe Minnesota Attorney General's Office filed a consumer-protection lawsuit Wednesday against a nationwide chain of coronavirus testing sites for \"deceptive and fraudulent practices.\" The suit alleges the Illinois-based Center for COVID Control and its primary lab, Doctors Clinical Lab, collected samples from Minnesotans for coronavirus testing but either failed to deliver results or delivered false or inaccurate results, according to the complaint reviewed by USA TODAY.\n\nThe company and its lab \"provide inaccurate and deceptive test result information to Minnesota consumers and have fraudulently reported negative test results to consumers that never completed COVID-19 tests,\" according to the complaint. Some test results listed \"the wrong test type and false dates and times for when samples were collected from consumers,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe company, which is under investigation by the Illinois Attorney General's Office and the Oregon Department of Justice, is operated by Illinois residents Akbar Syed and Aleya Siyaj, the complaint says.

And the global market is projected to increase fivefold by 2030.\n\nA big selling point for products like the meatless meat substitute Impossible Burger, aside from sustainability, is health. But the patty's perceived health benefits have received some criticism, including from social media users who claim the burgers contain a potent payload of hormones.\n\n\"You've probably heard of the 'Made 100% from plants'... Well, (the Impossible Burger) contains 44mg of estrogen,\" reads a tweet shared in an Aug. 26 Facebook post.\n\nThe tweet asserts this alleged dose is far greater than the \"4 mg\" of estrogen contained in hormone replacement therapy given to individuals undergoing gender reassignment.\n\nIf you eat this burger, the tweet concludes, it \"will make you female.\"\n\nThe post and similar ones have racked up hundreds of interactions across Facebook and Instagram within the last few months, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.\n\nLike many meat alternatives, the Impossible Burger uses soybean, or soy, as a protein source. Soy and other foods like wheat, lentils and apples contain a naturally occurring hormone called isoflavone, a type of plant estrogen (or phytoestrogen).\n\nIsoflavone does function similarly to estrogen in mammals, but it isn't as biologically strong. And Impossible Burgers don't contain nearly enough to make anyone female.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user for comment. The Twitter user did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nIsoflavone similar to human estrogen but weaker\n\nEstrogen, a hormone naturally produced by both males and females – animals and humans alike – can be found in trace amounts in all animal products consumed, whether it be milk, red meat or even eggs.\n\nIts plant-derived counterpart, isoflavone, is also found in various fruits and vegetables and products derived from them, like the Impossible Burger. The meat alternative, however, doesn't contain nearly as much isoflavone as the tweet claims – under 2 mg in a single four-ounce serving, according to the company's website.\n\nThis quantity is well below that of some standard hormone treatments recommended for individuals transitioning to female, which can range up to 8 mg of estradiol (one of three forms of estrogen produced by the body) per day.\n\nOnce ingested, isoflavones bind to proteins called receptors that recognize mammalian estrogen, but the interaction is rather weak. Isoflavones also don't bind to all types of estrogen receptors found throughout the body as well as mammalian estrogen does, Kevin Klatt, a postdoctoral fellow at the Baylor College of Medicine, told fact-checking site Health Feedback.\n\nSo while isoflavones can create biological activity to some extent, they can also prevent their more potent cousin estrogen from binding to its receptors, thus simultaneously exerting anti-estrogenic effects.\n\nEating soy in moderation doesn't feminize men\n\nTo date, no studies have shown eating soy or isoflavones in moderation can feminize males or affect childhood development. Soy products have been a mainstay in Asian diets for centuries with no detriment to the male population, Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University, told The Washington Post in 2019.\n\n\"Asians have been eating soy products for millennia and don't seem to be any the worse for it. They have among the longest lifespans and best health, at least in classic diets,\" she told the Post. \"There is a special concern about ... men and boys who eat soy products, but again, if you look at populations that eat a lot of soy products, there is no evidence of particular problems.\"\n\nOne report often used to bolster consumer fears is a 2008 case report of a 60-year-old Texas man who developed a benign swelling of male breast tissue and elevated estrogen levels. Doctors reported the man drank three quarts of soymilk a day, which \"would have given him a daily dose of 360 mg of isoflavones, about 10 times what the average man in Asia consumes‚\" according to Nutrition Action, a resource website produced by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nIt's important to note, excessive intake of any food can have detrimental health consequences. For instance, eating too much salt can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and even calcium loss from bones.\n\nClaim made by cattle veterinarian\n\nThe claim casting suspicion on the Impossible Burger first appeared in a December 2019 article written by James Stangle, a cattle veterinarian based in South Dakota, for Tri-State Livestock News.\n\nIn the original article, Stangle asserted the 44 mg of estrogen contained in Burger King's Impossible Whopper – which uses the Impossible Foods patty – was \"18 million times\" greater than the \"2.5 (nanograms)\" in the regular beef whopper.\n\nThis colossal difference, he claimed, was \"enough estrogen to grow boobs on a male.\"\n\nStangle later issued a retraction acknowledging his 18 million figure was inaccurate and that in moderation, eating an occasional Impossible Whopper would be unlikely to lead to any harm. He also acknowledged to the Atlantic in February 2020 that there was \"no evidence\" eating the meatless substitute could cause a man to grow breasts.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim the Impossible Burger contains more estrogen than transgender hormone therapy. Soy-based products, like the Impossible Burger, contain a type of estrogen called isoflavone that is similar to mammalian estrogen but is much weaker and not nearly as potent. The Impossible Burger's isoflavone content is under 2 mg, which is less than some standard dosages recommended for transgender hormone therapy. To date, there has been no evidence linking soy or isoflavone consumption with feminizing males or affecting childhood development.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

She had her son Grayson 18 months ago after one lost pregnancy and six rounds of fertility treatments costing nearly $100,000.\n\nBefore marrying her husband at age 37, Webber said, “I choose my career, frankly, over everything … But once I was in love and I found this amazing man, I was all about starting a family.”\n\nBirths among women ages 40-44 have been rising since the early 1980s and kept rising in 2017, even as the overall U.S. birth rate fell to a record low, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its latest report. Births in women older than 45 held steady.\n\nWomen ages 40 to 44 had 114,730 of the 3.8 million babies born in 2017; women 45 and older had 9,325.\n\nMore:Having a baby past 35: What women should know\n\nMore:Eating fast food hurts women's chances of getting pregnant, increases infertility, study says\n\nMore:Women who've had babies look different. Here's how pregnancy can permanently change a body\n\nMedical professionals who see older women seeking pregnancy say the factors driving the continued trend include:\n\n• Careers: Many women in their 20s and 30s are completing educations and starting careers. They feel unready, financially and otherwise, to have babies, said Eve Feinberg, assistant professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Studies suggest women maximize their lifetime earnings by delaying motherhood.\n\n• Partners: Some women wait a long time “to find the right person to have a baby with,” Feinberg said. By 40, they may go ahead with or without that perfect partner, said psychologist Andrea Mechanick Braverman, a clinical associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry and human behavior at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. And some women in their 40s who already have children want more — with new partners, said Christos Coutifaris, chief of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n• Optimism and determination: Many women have confidence — and sometimes overconfidence — in their own continued fertility or the ability of doctors to help. “They see all of these celebrities having babies in their 40s and 50s, and they think they can overcome all odds,” Feinberg said. Exhibit one: Janet Jackson, who gave birth to a boy in early 2017 at age 50.\n\nIt is true that fertility doctors can offer older prospective moms more help today than in the past. But biology still imposes limits.\n\nA woman’s natural ability to become pregnant begins a steep decline around age 37, reaching odds of less than 10% a month by age 40, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\nWhen women undergo in vitro fertilization with their own eggs, the chance of having a baby in each attempt falls from 41.5% before age 35 to 12.4% at ages 41–42, the college says. After age 44, the success rate is just 1%, which is why the vast majority of women who have babies after that age, celebrities included, are using eggs from younger donors, Feinberg said.\n\nUsing donor eggs increases success rates to those of younger women. But it means giving up a genetic link to the child and paying more for the procedure. One work-around — freezing one’s own eggs at a younger age — is catching on among some women.\n\nWebber said she and her husband, Eric, 35, ultimately conceived their son with a donor egg and “we couldn’t be happier.” In fact, she said, they plan to try for a second child with frozen embryos created from the same donor’s eggs and her husband’s sperm. She said she expects to get pregnant easily.\n\nBut many women showing up in fertility clinics in their 40s have unrealistically high hopes, fertility doctors said.\n\n“They just have no idea they should have gotten on the ball sooner,” Feinberg said. She said the number of women having babies in their 40s is almost certainly swamped by the number who would like to.\n\nMany women also may not know pregnancy becomes riskier as they age, putting strain on their hearts, lungs and kidneys, said Coutifaris, who is president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Because of those risks, fertility patients are carefully screened, and most clinics will not treat women past 50, he said.\n\n“The good thing is that maternal care has dramatically improved,” reducing complications for those who do get pregnant, said Zev Williams, chief of reproductive endocrinology and infertility and associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nNot every prospective mother in her 40s needs fertility help. While more than 100,000 women older than 40 now give birth each year, just 5,000 to 6,000 of those births appear to result from IVF procedures, Coutifaris said. Unknown additional numbers are using fertility drugs and other techniques, he said. But many births to older women clearly occur without a fertility doctor's assistance, he said.\n\n“It’s amazing how many people just get pregnant the old-fashioned way,” Braverman said.\n\nBut those are not always the people who want to get pregnant. According to the Guttmacher Institute, one-third of pregnancies in women older than 35 are unintended — a reminder that birth control remains important for those who do not want to be a part of the aging mothers’ trend.\n\nRecent research from the Pew Research Center shows that, as of 2016, 86% of U.S. women had given birth, one way or another, by their early 40s. Whether women are having all the children they want is a matter of debate.\n\nAnd what happens after the birth, for older women and their families? That seems to be mostly a good-news story, Braverman said.\n\n“The few studies that have been out there have suggested that older parents do well,” and so do their children, she said.\n\n“The cards are stacked against women for delaying childbearing from a biological perspective, but from a social perspective, they are not,\" she said. \"They get rewarded, financially and otherwise, for waiting.”\n\nIn a better world, she said, women would have “the social supports to make the decisions about career and family building in the same way that men do.\" Then, she said, the choice of when to have children would be “a true choice.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/23/fact-check-aluminum-exposure-through-food-wont-cause-health-issues/3239457001/", "title": "Fact check: Aluminum exposure through food won't cause health ...", "text": "The claim: Heat causes aluminum to leach into food and causes dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson's and cancer\n\nAn undated article from a website called \"Natural Beauty Secrets\" that has been circulating on social media warns that cooking with aluminum allows it to leach into food and cause cancer and different neurological conditions — including dementia, Alzheimer's and autism spectrum disorders.\n\nAluminum is found in many household products, including utensils, foil, baking powder and over-the counter medicines. It is the most common metal and makes up 8% of the Earth’s mass. Because of this, aluminum is literally everywhere, including drinking water and food. Some foods, like citrus fruits, have more aluminum than others.\n\nNaturally occurring aluminum is rarely encountered in its metallic, elemental form. Typically, aluminum is found in the environment as aluminum salts or other compounds such as aluminum citrate. This material circulates through the environment and food web. Adults naturally have between 30-50 milligrams of aluminum in their body at any given time.\n\n\"Analytical chemistry is sufficiently sensitive now that I'm not aware of anything that, naturally, in our environment, food, water and everything else, where it cannot be detected,\" said Dr. Robert Yokel, a professor of toxicology at the University of Kentucky who studies aluminum.\n\nAluminum is not a nutrient. In food additives, aluminum compounds are used as preservatives, for color or for leavening breads without active yeast. A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration confirmed by email that the agency considers it safe for use in food, food preparation and medicines.\n\nUSA TODAY was unable to contact the author or website operators for comment.

The website is hosted through an anonymous domain registration service that did not respond to our request for contact information for the website operators.\n\nNo effects in healthy adults, research shows\n\nWhile it is true that some aluminum gets into food when cooked in aluminum foil or with aluminum cookware, and that this is enhanced in acidic foods, it is not true this causes any health effects in healthy adults.\n\nYour body absorbs less than 1% of the background aluminum in food or drinking water. Ninety-five percent of this is cleared by the kidneys. Most of the environmental aluminum you are exposed to passes out of your system within 24 hours. The average adult eats roughly 7-9 milligrams of aluminum per day. This amount can vary based on local environmental conditions or diet or cookware. Neither the FDA nor the European Food Safety Authority have found that this exposure is high enough to cause problems in healthy adults.\n\nMore:Fact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?\n\n\"If one goes to a high enough concentration, basically of anything, one can produce toxic effects.\" Yokel said. \"The dose makes the poison.\"\n\nIt is true that aluminum exposure has been linked to dementia, impaired neural function and lung irritation, but this is never caused by routine, dietary exposure.\n\nAluminum-linked neural issues\n\nAluminum-linked dementia and encephalopathy been found in elderly people with impaired kidney function. Sometimes, this has happened when dialysis fluid was contaminated by aluminum. When the kidneys don’t work, dietary aluminum can build up in the body and cause dementia. Dialysis is supposed to remove things a failing kidney cannot, so if dialysis fluid is contaminated by aluminum then this happens faster.\n\n\"Everyone would agree that aluminum is a potential neurotoxin but this is an extreme situation,\" Yokel said.\n\nMore:CDC: Gap between white and black children closes in autism cases\n\nThe other cases where aluminum can cause neural problems are more rare, such as when workers are exposed to chronic, low-to-high doses of aluminum dust or fumes in places like aluminum plants or mines. Other documented cases of aluminum neural toxicity come from embedded aluminum shrapnel.\n\nAluminum has at times been linked to Alzheimer’s and Austism spectrum disorder, but in neither case has there been definitive evidence that aluminum causes either. While some studies have shown elevated aluminum levels in Alzheimer’s patients, others have not. It’s not clear what role aluminum plays in Alzheimer’s or whether it is playing a direct role at all.\n\n\"There are no studies that have actually confirmed that there is a correlation,\" said Betsy Reed, a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nMore:Simple eye exam could detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers say\n\nReed said that while early research made such links, later studies were unable to establish the connection. The Alzheimer's Association considers the connection between Alzheimer’s and aluminum to be a myth. A representative of the Autism Self Advocacy Network said something similar. Aluminum is a common component of vaccines. The origins of the connection between autism and aluminum came from the pseudoscientific antivaxxer movement.\n\n\"At this point, any argument that vaccines cause autism, no matter the specific causal mechanism they propose is going against the science,\" Zoe Gross, a spokeswoman for Autism Self Advocacy Network, said in an email. \"It reflects our society's fear of autism and of autistic people — the idea that we must have been harmed in some way to be the way we are.\"\n\nSimilarly, while aluminum has been linked to Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis, the role it plays is unclear. There is no scientific evidence for whether aluminum causes these disorders.\n\nAluminum doesn't cause cancer\n\nThe cancer claims made by the article are also false. Aluminum has never been demonstrated to have a role in cancer. Aluminum smelter workers do have a higher risk of cancer, but this is due to exposure to other chemicals, not aluminum. Aluminum is frequently the target of breast cancer scares because of its use in antiperspirant. Studies have shown that aluminum doesn’t get absorbed through skin and no studies have found a link between aluminum and cancer.\n\n\"It's generally concluded that there is not good evidence aluminum causes cancer,\" Yokel said.\n\nWhile it is true that aluminum is highly concentrated in cigarette smoke and that aluminum absorbs more easily through lung tissue, aluminum is low down the list of harmful substances in cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke contains an array of highly cancer-causing chemicals and toxic heavy metals more toxic than aluminum. Smoke particles, on their own, are considered carcinogenic by the American Cancer Society.\n\nOur rating: Partly false\n\nThe claim that aluminum leaches into food due to heat and causes Alzheimer’s, autism, dementia and cancer is rated PARTLY FALSE based on our research. While it is true that food and water often contain aluminum and that aluminum levels in food increase in hot or acidic conditions, it is false that such exposure is linked to any health effects in healthy adults. While it is true that aluminum can be an occupational health risk or among people with impaired kidney function, it is not true that routine exposure will cause the health effects listed in the article, such as cancer.\n\nOur sources\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Busy, noisy affairs held in cavernous conference halls where hundreds of vendors try to sell expectant parents everything they could possibly desire for their new bundle of joy – and plenty of other things they never knew they needed.\n\nBut this is a shrinking business, and the customer base is dwindling.\n\nSouth Korea recently broke its own record for the world’s lowest fertility rate. Figures released in November showed the average number of children a South Korean woman will have in her lifetime is down to just 0.79.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population and low even compared to other developed countries where the rate is falling, such as the United States (1.6) and Japan – which at 1.3 reported its own lowest rate on record.\n\nAnd it spells trouble for a country with an aging population that faces a looming shortage of workers to support its pension system.\n\nNurses at a nearly empty infant unit of a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, in February 2017. Yonhap/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nThe problem is commonly blamed on economic factors that have put off the young from having families – high real estate prices, the cost of education and greater economic anxiety – yet it has proved beyond the ability of successive governments to fix, however much money is thrown at it.\n\nCritics say that is a sign the problems go deeper than economics and that a change in approach is needed. Whether the government is listening is another matter.\n\nThrowing money at the problem\n\nDuring a visit to a nursery in September, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol admitted that more than $200 billion has been spent trying to boost the population over the past 16 years.\n\nYet since assuming office in May, his administration has come up with few ideas for solving the problem other than continuing in a similar vein – setting up a committee to discuss the issue and promising yet more financial support for newborns. A monthly allowance for parents with babies up to 1-year-old will increase from the current 300,000 won to 700,000 won ($230 to $540) in 2023 and to 1 million Korean won ($770) by 2024, according to the Yoon administration.\n\nAccording to President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea has spent more than $200 billion in the past 16 years trying to solve its population problem. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nThe public’s skepticism that Yoon has any better grip on the problem than his predecessors has only been reinforced by the president’s at times clumsy messaging.\n\nDuring his visit to the nursery, Yoon expressed surprise that babies and toddlers were not being looked after at home and appeared to suggest that it was common for 6-month-old babies to be able to walk, leading to criticism that he was out of touch (the average age for babies to walk is more like 12 months).\n\nMany experts believe the current throw-money-at-it approach is too one-dimensional and that what is needed instead is continuing support throughout the child’s life.\n\nPrams at a baby fair in Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 15. Yonhap/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nBrowsing the stalls at a recent baby fair was Kim Min-jeong, whose second child is due this month. She brushed aside the government’s pledge of more funds, saying: “They’ve changed the names and merged allowances but for parents like us, there are no more benefits.”\n\nThe problem she faces, she said, is that she hasn’t been able to work since her first child was born as she and her husband cannot afford private child care.\n\nGovernment-funded nurseries are free but a handful of scandals in recent years involving caregivers striking infants has put many parents off. While the cases were minimal, they were well publicized and the CCTV footage emotive.\n\n‘A puritanical approach’\n\nAlso standing in the way of would-be parents are a host of problems that are more social than economic in nature and likely to endure however much money is splashed around.\n\nAmong them are what might be called the unwritten rules for parenthood.\n\nWhile having a baby is very much expected of married couples in South Korea, society still frowns on single parents. IVF treatment is not offered to single women, official hospital figures show.\n\n“We still have a very puritanical approach to single mothers,” said law professor Cho Hee-kyoung, who writes a newspaper column on social issues.\n\n“It’s as if they have done something wrong by becoming pregnant out of wedlock… why does it necessarily have to be within a marriage that you can raise a child?”\n\nMeanwhile, couples in non-traditional partnerships also face discrimination; South Korea does not recognize same-sex marriage and regulations make it difficult for unwed couples to adopt.\n\nAuthor Lee Jin-song at Spain Bookshop in Seoul where her books are sold. Charles Miller/CNN\n\nLee Jin-song, who has written books about the trend of young people choosing not to get married or have a baby, said policies to boost the birth rate need to embrace more than just the traditional idea of marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\n“I’ve thought about how heterocentric and normality-centric discussion is in the traditional sense of marriage… (it) excludes people with disabilities, diseases or poor reproductive health,” Lee said.\n\nChoosing to stay single\n\nLee pointed to a common joke that in South Korea, “if you are not dating by the time you are 25, you’ll turn into a crane, meaning if you’re single you become non-human.”\n\nShe said society considers her, and others like her, selfish for not conforming to the traditional expectations of marriage and children, “neglecting their duties for society only for the sake of their happiness.”\n\nLee highlighted the pressures of having children on women in a patriarchal society that is slow to evolve. “Marriage, childbirth and child care require too much sacrifice for women in a patriarchal society especially over the past decade. So, they are beginning to explore the possibility of being able to live well without getting married.”\n\nProfessor Cho agreed, saying there is a lingering social expectation that the father sacrifices for the company and the mother supports the family, even if she also works.\n\n“I know so many couples where the women are actually earning more money than the men, but when they come home, it’s the women who have to do the housework and look after the children and provide emotional support to the husband.”\n\nThe job doesn’t end when the office shuts\n\nMeanwhile, husbands who would like to be more involved in child-rearing find the business culture in South Korea does not always allow for that.\n\nWhile on paper, parental leave has been increased, few feel comfortable to take it in full.\n\nBack at the baby fair, Kim’s husband Park Kyung-su said he is hoping to help with his second child, but “there is no special understanding or treatment from work for having a young child. I can use my time off, but I feel uncomfortable using it because I want good feedback at work.”\n\nThere is a widespread fear that the workers who are promoted are rarely the ones who put family first.\n\nLee Se-eun, a mother of two boys, hasn't worked in seven years. Charles Miller/CNN\n\nLee Se-eun, who has two boys ages 3 and 5, said she would welcome more help from her husband, but he is rarely home in time.\n\n“It would be nice if companies would recognize employees with babies, for example, to exclude them from dinners or nights,” she said.\n\nIn South Korea, the job does not end when the office closes for the day. Rather, there is a culture of “team-building” after hours, which it is frowned upon to miss.\n\nLee used to work in a brokerage firm before launching her own start-up, but she has not worked in seven years and feels there was no option to continue her career as she did not want to put her boys in child care.\n\n“Raising a child is a very valuable, meaningful and very good thing from a personal point of view, but sometimes it feels like it doesn’t get valued in society,” Lee said.", "authors": ["Paula Hancocks"], "publish_date": "2022/12/03"}]}

Julie Lay says the sludge from a poultry processing plant created an overpowering stench when it was applied to a neighbor’s farm fields. Lay says flies also invaded her property in Marshall County. Al.com reports she says the material had a “crust” and chicken feathers. Lay was among several residents who spoke out recently at an Alabama Department of Environmental Management public hearing.

Dozens of people gathered at Bishop’s Beach on Sept. 5 to watch as the two seals – Ugashik “Uggy” and Charley Fritz – were released into the waters of Kachemak Bay in Homer by SeaLife Center staff and volunteers, the Homer News reports. Uggy was found neglected by her mother May 29 on a beach near McNeil Canyon, and Fritz was found neglected by his mother on a beach near Homer on May 12, according to an information sheet provided by the SeaLife Center. At that time, both were estimated to be only a week to two weeks old, says Jane Belovarac, curator for the Wildlife Response Program.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Residents with overdue library books might want to wait a bit before bringing back their borrowed copies of the current bestsellers. Starting in November, Phoenix’s public library system will join a growing number of libraries around the United States that have dropped overdue book fees, becoming the nation’s largest metropolis to dump the fines. Phoenix City Librarian Rita Hamilton said the unanimous City Council decision would allow the system comprised of 17 libraries to ensure “that access to our resources is as equitable as possible.” The Phoenix system has been charging 20 cents per item per day, which can add up quickly into dollars owed, an extra expense some families cannot afford. Phoenix’s move is part of a worldwide trend by libraries to eliminate fines the American Library Association considers “a form of social inequality.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s attorney general is seeking to move lawsuits challenging a measure giving the prison director authority to determine an inmate’s competency to be executed to federal court. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Thursday filed notice to move the lawsuits by death row inmates Bruce Ward and Jack Greene from Jefferson County Circuit Court. The state Supreme Court in November struck down an earlier version of the mental competency law. Legislators this year approved a reworked version of the law, and the inmates are seeking to have it overturned. Rutledge’s filing says federal courts have jurisdiction because the inmates argue the new law violates the U.S. Constitution. Arkansas has no executions scheduled and lacks the drugs needed for its lethal injection process.\n\nCalifornia\n\nFresno: California authorities have captured an emu after the flightless fugitive led officers down a highway. The Fresno Bee reported Friday that the bird was apprehended following a brief pursuit by California Highway Patrol officers. Authorities say officers responded to a report that an ostrich was wandering along the right-hand shoulder of U.S. Highway 99 northwest of Fresno. Authorities say Madera County Animal Services took the bird into custody uninjured. Officers say they do not know whether the emu escaped a nearby farm or a moving vehicle. Animal experts say the flightless native Australian birds can sprint at up to 30 mph and trot quickly for longer distances. Emus are the second-largest birds in the world behind ostriches.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 40 boats gathered at Inlet Bay Marina on Friday and linked together to form a circle, planning on remaining in formation until Sunday. The event, known as the “Ships Wheel,” is a yearly tradition for the boaters of Horsetooth Reservoir to celebrate the end of summer together. The event was created by Inlet Bay Marina owners Glen and Nancy Werth. “It’s an end-of-year celebration. It’s definitely the highlight of the year,” says Anthony Robbins, a Ships Wheel participant. Robbins says those participating strive to create a safe, positive and family-friendly atmosphere in the reservoir, which he says hasn’t always had the best reputation. During the event, those in the wheel hang out on their boats all weekend, eating and sleeping.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A group of prison inmates has asked a federal judge for bottled drinking water, alleging the tap water at the Osborn Correctional Institution is tainted with bacteria found in sewage. The inmates are seeking a temporary injunction as part of a larger lawsuit that accuses the state of exposing them to hazardous materials such as PCBs and asbestos. They allege numerous inmates have become ill with bacteria known as helicobacter pylori, which is typically water-borne and caused by sewage entering the water supply. Affidavits filed by 38 inmates and former inmates at Osborn described discolored water that smells of feces and contains floating particles. They also say prison staff routinely bring in bottled water to drink and provide to therapy dogs. The state denies the allegations.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Three fatal shootings in less than 12 hours in the state’s largest city mean it has already surpassed its number of dead or injured shooting victims for all of 2018. Wilmington Police report two men ages 24 and 26 were shot Friday morning in a residential area and later died. Police say earlier Friday a 36-year-old woman also was shot and died. Their names haven’t been released, and the deaths are under investigation. The woman was the 78th shooting victim of the year, matching the number recorded in all of last year. The total was exceeded with the shootings later Friday. This year 16 people have been killed in Wilmington shootings, compared to 19 in all of 2018.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who helped spark a youth-driven push for climate change, has come to Washington. On Friday, Thunberg and about 1,500 protesters, many of them schoolchildren, marched and chanted near the White House. Thunberg, who is 16, gained international attention by inspiring protests and school strikes demanding immediate actions to avert environmental catastrophe. Her activism has drawn a passionate following of children essentially challenging their elders to take action. Last month, Thunberg crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a solar-powered boat, landing in New York City on Aug. 28. She is in Washington for several days of rallies and lobbying efforts in advance of a global climate strike declared for Sept. 20.\n\nFlorida\n\nWellington: It took 22 years, but a missing man’s remains were finally found thanks to someone who zoomed in on his former neighborhood with Google satellite images and noticed a car submerged in a lake. Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Teri Barbera says the skeletal remains were of William Moldt, who went missing in 1997. Barbera says a previous resident of Wellington was checking his former neighborhood on Google Earth when he saw what looked like a car in the lake. The former resident contacted a current homeowner, who used a drone to confirm it was a white car. Deputies then found the remains. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System says Moldt went to a nightclub in November 1997 but didn’t appear intoxicated when he left alone.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson says he’s demanding answers from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs after a woman says her father was bitten more than 100 times by ants at a veterans’ home in Decatur. Isakson says he was horrified and “downright maddened” after Laquna Ross told WSB-TV she found her father, Joel Marrable, with swollen, red bumps all over his body when she visited him at the nursing home near Atlanta last week before his death. Marrable, an Air Force veteran, had cancer. The Atlanta Veterans Affairs Health Care System said in a statement that it was told the ants were affecting patients. It said all of the bedrooms at the Eagle’s Nest Community Living Center have been cleaned, and a pest control company is monitoring conditions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige says he and other state employees received death threats amid the heated debate over building a giant telescope on the state’s highest peak. Ige disclosed the threats as he and his Cabinet members held a news conference Friday asking people on all sides of the issue to be careful with their language. Attorney General Clare Connors played a voicemail recording in which an unidentified man told a state employee, “I hope you die.” She showed reporters a social media post offering a $5,000 reward for the identity of a law enforcement officer involved in last week’s demolition and removal of a small wooden house built by demonstrators near the camp where they are blocking the telescope’s construction. “I hope that we can all agree that putting a bounty on the head of law enforcement officer is disturbing and deeply concerning,” Connors said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A panel of lawmakers formed to monitor how federal laws affect the state’s sovereignty and report back to the Legislature has created three subcommittees to examine federal lands, education, and health and welfare. Republican Rep. Jason Monks, co-chair of the Committee on Federalism, says the federal lands subcommittee is not a repeat of an interim committee from several years ago that ran up big attorney fees while trying to find a way for the state to take control of federal lands. He says the purpose of the Committee on Federalism created by the Legislature earlier this year is to find ways for the state to work more effectively with the federal government, and the breadth of that challenge is better met by forming subcommittees.\n\nIllinois\n\nOregon: The first steps in repairing a century-old landmark known as the Black Hawk statue are finally underway. Workers began erecting scaffolding last Monday around the 48-foot-tall statue in Lowden State Park in northern Illinois’ Ogle County. Sauk Valley Media reports Quality Restorations Inc. of Wood Dale was scheduled to begin the repair work last spring, but cold, wet weather thwarted that work. The 108-year-old monument has spent most of the past five years beneath a plastic covering to protect it from harsh weather. State budget troubles delayed a promised $350,000 matching state grant for the repairs, but that funding was finally secured over a year ago. The Black Restoration team obtained the remaining $225,000 needed for the project. The cost of repairs will approach $1 million.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is getting a $2.1 million federal grant to explore ways of reducing its high rate of pregnancy-related deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide the State Department of Health with more than $420,000 a year for five years to improve Indiana’s ability to collect data about pregnancy-related deaths and devise ways to combat them. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports the state has the nation’s third-highest rate of deaths of women while pregnant or within one year of their pregnancy’s end. The national maternal-mortality rate is 20.7 deaths per 100,000 births, but Indiana’s rate is 41.4 deaths per 100,000 births, according to the United Health Foundation. Only two other states scored worse: Georgia and Louisiana.\n\nIowa\n\nRed Oak: The Coyote Johnson Muscle Car Auction at the Montgomery County Fairgrounds on Saturday marked the event of the summer in southwestern Iowa, the big reveal of a storied collection of cars the public had long awaited. The massive event saw an entire community come out to witness a newly minted legend and see up close the treasure trove of classic American machines that Bill “Coyote” Johnson had kept hidden away for decades. The existence of Johnson’s hoard, more than a hundred in total, was revealed in April. Its existence was a revelation, a previously unknown monument to mid-century auto engineering. VanDerBrink Auctions sold off nearly 100 vehicles in about three hours.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: The Kansas State Fair will reevaluate its gun policy this fall because concert security concerns could conflict with state law that allows gun owners to carry their weapons openly. The Wichita Eagle reports that the fair had to screen concertgoers at the Sept. 7 Billy Currington performance because he required it in his contract, and the show was delayed while everyone and their bags were checked. Fair Manager Robin Jennison says the fair will likely have to employ that kind of security more often if it wants to continue booking top acts because such requirements are becoming common.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s chief justice says the drug court program has failed to keep up with surging demand for its treatment services while the state struggles with addiction woes. Chief Justice John D. Minton Jr. told lawmakers Friday that he’ll seek funding to expand drug courts. He told a legislative panel that drug courts and similar specialty courts are serving fewer than 2,500 people at a time when Kentucky faces its worst drug epidemic in history. Minton says that’s not even “scratching the surface of the need.” Drug courts provide court-supervised treatment so people can stay out of jail. Participants take part in counseling and education programs and must undergo drug tests.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two Swiss women have recreated Homer Simpson’s gourmandizing tour of the Big Easy, snarf for snarf, finger-wiggle for finger-wiggle. Biz New Orleans reports it took Janine Wiget, of Zurich, and Katrin von Niederhausern, who now lives in Stockholm, a week to duplicate the segment, which covers 54 restaurants in 1 minute, 27 seconds. The side-by-side video created by the 30-year-old illustrators and graphic designers has attracted more than 1 million views since it was uploaded Aug. 23. The women duplicate every action and camera angle in the sequence from “Lisa Gets the Blues,” which first aired April 22, 2018. Tourism officials are delighted. New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corp. president and CEO Mark Romig says it’s priceless publicity.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: A man who caused a standoff that ended with him being shot three times and his home destroyed by a police explosive has sued law enforcement officials. Dixmont resident Michael Grendell argued police didn’t wait for a negotiator trained to handle mental health crises and failed to obtain a proper warrant to use a bomb. The Bangor Daily News reports 62-year-old Grendell sued Wednesday in federal court in Bangor. Eighteen state police members and one member of the attorney general’s office are defendants. A spokesman for the attorney general’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit. Grendell filed a notice in December saying he would seek $120 million in damages. Last year, he was sentenced to probation and a suspended jail term on charges including criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state panel on school construction has approved more than $13 million for portable air conditioning systems in Baltimore County schools. The money approved by the Interagency Committee on School Construction on Thursday will bring portable air conditioning systems to four of the county’s seven schools that still don’t have air conditioning: Dulaney High School, Lansdowne High School, Bedford Elementary School and Catonsville Center for Alternative Studies. Comptroller Peter Franchot, who has pushed for years as a member of the Board of Public Works to bring air conditioning to schools that don’t have it, says there’s finally some good news, on a day when some schools were closed in the Baltimore area due to excessive heat.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: The state has received more than half a million dollars in federal grant money to help workers at the now-shuttered Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station find new jobs. U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey and U.S. Rep. William Keating, all Democrats, said the grant will help the state provide services like career planning, comprehensive assessments, resume writing and job placement to workers who were laid off earlier this year. The Plymouth plant, which produced electricity for 46 years, employed about 580 people in May. That number is expected to be about 270 by March 2020, according to plant operators. Last month the plant was sold to a private company for decommissioning. It was the state’s last nuclear power plant.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Tidal streaming service has selected five Motor City-based artists as the first winners of a million-dollar grant program to boost music careers. The platform announced Friday that Tidal Unplugged’s inaugural group consists of Emma Guzman, Laurie Love, Olivia Millerschin, Raye Williams and Sam Austins. They were chosen among thousands of applicants. The winners will get, among other things, a monthly stipend, professional training, access to recording and creative resources, and promotional support. They also will produce three songs each that will premiere on the streaming service and perform at a showcase later this year. Tidal officials say they aim to expand the program to other areas of the country.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Authorities say a fire that destroyed a historic synagogue doesn’t appear to have been a hate crime. Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken said Sunday that 36-year-old Matthew James Amiot, of Duluth, was arrested Friday in the fire last week at the Adas Israel Congregation, in the city’s downtown. Tusken says he has no reason to believe the fire was a hate crime, although the investigation is ongoing. Police are recommending that prosecutors charge Amiot with first-degree arson. Duluth fire Chief Shawn Krizaj says the blaze started outside the synagogue and spread into the building. No accelerants were found. According to its website, the Adas Israel Congregation is an Orthodox/High Conservative Jewish congregation with 75 members. Eight of 14 Torah scrolls, the holy books of Judaism, that were in the synagogue were saved.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: The wood-frame home where a washerwoman lived as she scrimped to create a scholarship fund has been moved to a museum district honoring African American accomplishments. The Hattiesburg home of the late Oseola McCarty was placed in a tax sale in 2017. The Hattiesburg American reports the local convention commission bought it. Late last month, the home was moved a few blocks from its original site. It will be restored and turned into a museum. McCarty attended school until the sixth grade and washed clothes for a living, saving money to help students needing financial assistance. She was 91 when she died in 1999. She left about $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi, and the Oseola McCarty Endowed Scholarship was created.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: A worker has found what’s believed to be a Civil War cannonball lodged in a Kansas City area tree that he was hired to take down. KMBC-TV reports the small cannonball fell out as the worker was chopping the diseased tree on the grounds of the Overfelt-Johnston house. The house was used as a hospital during the First Battle of Independence, which was fought across the street in 1862. Fourteen people were killed and 18 wounded as nearly 800 mounted Confederates overpowered the 350 men of the town’s federal garrison. Property owner Randall Pratt says a cannonball also was found when the property was restored in 1980. That cannonball, which had been shot into a wall, is in a county museum. Pratt plans to keep the latest find at the home.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The state’s greater sage grouse population has fallen more than 40% over the past three years, mirroring recent declines across the U.S. West for the bird species for which federal officials rejected protections in 2015. State wildlife officials estimate there were about 44,000 ground-dwelling sage grouse in Montana this spring. Sage grouse once numbered in the millions but have seen their range that stretches across portions of 11 states diminished by oil and gas drilling, wildfires, grazing and other pressures. Weather can affect populations from year to year, and wildlife officials say those short-term cycles are most directly responsible for the recent declines. Montana’s drop from almost 78,000 grouse in 2016 was traced to an extreme drought in eastern parts of the state in 2017, says Catherine Wightman with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government collected more tax revenue than expected in August. The Department of Revenue announced Friday that the state received a net total of $462 million last month, which is nearly 5% higher than its official forecast of $441 million. The department says net sales-and-use and miscellaneous taxes came in higher than expected, as did net corporate and individual income taxes. Net tax collections are also higher than expected in the current fiscal year that began July 1. The forecast was set in April by the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board. The board’s projections help lawmakers and the governor determine how much money they have available for the state budget.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An innkeeper selling tickets for campers this week in a tiny desert town is being threatened with legal action by the originator of the “Storm Area 51” internet hoax over the “Alienstock” name. A Las Vegas attorney representing 20-year-old Matty Roberts sent a cease-and-desist letter Thursday telling Little A’Le’Inn owner Connie West to pull the plug on events West says she’s still planning for Thursday through Sunday. West didn’t immediately respond Friday to telephone and email messages. She told the Las Vegas Review-Journal she’s still “full steam ahead” with vendors, merchandise and musical acts. Roberts broke with West last week and says he’ll appear at a party venue in downtown Las Vegas on Thursday – the night before the Life is Beautiful music and art festival begins a few blocks away.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State education officials are moving ahead with Gov. Chris Sununu’s plan to help students earn high school diplomas and college degrees at the same time, at no cost to their families. Sununu, a Republican, first announced his goal for the New Hampshire Career Academy program in January. Modeled after a privately funded partnership between Great Bay Community College and Spaulding High School in Rochester, the new statewide program also provides participants with guaranteed job interviews. Sununu signed an agreement Friday with the state’s education commissioner and chancellor of the community college system to set up the program. Commissioner Frank Edelblut said the program creates a new pathway for students, who will get career-ready educations and a head start in the job market.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The governor has signed a bill allowing the Golden Nugget casino to accept bets on most National Basketball Association games. Texas billionaire Tilman Fertitta owns the casino – and also owns the NBA’s Houston Rockets. When New Jersey lawmakers legalized sports betting last year, a provision in the law banned team owners from placing or accepting bets on any games involving their sport. It was directly aimed at the Golden Nugget and enacted over protests that Nevada regulators allow Fertitta’s casinos to take bets on pro basketball games as long as they don’t involve the Rockets. The bill Murphy signed Friday brings New Jersey in line with regulations in Nevada and Mississippi, which also allow Fertitta’s casinos to handle NBA bets that don’t involve the Rockets.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Health officials say the state had more suicides in 2018 than any other year in at least two decades. According to data provided by the state’s Department of Health, 535 people died by suicide last year. That a rate of 24.8 per 100,000 residents and represents a 6.7% increase over the state’s 2017 suicide rate. Mental health experts told the Albuquerque Journal the 2018 numbers represent the highest suicide rate on record in New Mexico since the state began consistently keeping track in 1999. According to an analysis released by the Violence Policy Center, New Mexico had the fourth-highest suicide rate in the nation in 2017 at 23.51 per 100,000 people. Authorities say there’s an association with firearm ownership and firearms use and deaths connected to suicide.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo says a multimillion-dollar initiative will restore aquatic habitats around the state. Cuomo announced the program Saturday as officials released thousands of juvenile shellfish at New York City’s Hudson River Park. The governor says the “Revive Mother Nature” initiative is the most aggressive in the country and will reintroduce millions of oysters to New York waterways. Cuomo also announced $2.8 million to restore marine habitat in New York Harbor and to expand the Soundview Park oyster reef in the Bronx River. Saturday’s event was part of an effort to create 4 acres of enhanced habitat off the Hudson River Park for 5 million to 10 million oysters. Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul says the program is designed to combat climate change and advance the state as a world-class fishing destination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPittsboro: Police officers and barricades were in place as people for and against the removal of a Confederate monument stood on opposite sides of the street Saturday. Media outlets reported demonstrations were helds near the Chatham County Courthouse, where the monument has stood for more than a century. Chatham’s commissioners voted 4-1 in August to ask a United Daughters of the Confederacy chapter to have a plan by Oct. 1 to remove the statute. The county let the UDC install the statute in 1907. Without a plan, the county will declare it a public trespass by Nov. 1, making it eligible for removal. Monument supporter Barry Isenhour said the statue respects American veterans, but opponent Robert Finch said it was installed to intimidate the black community.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A highly publicized North Dakota Air National Guard flight to bring an infant’s heart to a waiting transplant patient in California more than 30 years ago is set to be showcased. The flight of the F-4 Phantom, a supersonic fighter, took place in December 1986 after a Lear jet flown from California to Fargo to pick up the heart broke down in cold weather. The flight took place on emergency orders from North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, who died last year. The pilot, current North Dakota Air National Guard Brig. Gen. Bob Becklund, flew the golf ball-sized organ to Stanford Medical Center. KFGO radio reports that the heart recipient, now 33, lives in the San Francisco area. The “Heart Flight” display will be unveiled this month at the Fargo Air Museum.\n\nOhio\n\nSandusky: The state’s U.S. senators want Congress to rename a NASA research facility after astronaut Neil Armstrong. Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown introduced legislation Thursday to honor the Ohio native by renaming the NASA Plum Brook Station in Sandusky. Portman says he raised the idea with Armstrong in 2012, a year before the astronaut’s death. The senator says Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, wasn’t comfortable with the attention it would bring. Portman says he has since spoken with NASA and Armstrong’s family, and they support renaming the facility. Brown says it would be a fitting tribute given Armstrong’s contributions as a test pilot and astronaut.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: A public memorial is planned at Oklahoma State University to honor the late T. Boone Pickens, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to his alma mater during his lifetime. Pickens died Wednesday in Dallas at age 91. OSU says the university will honor Pickens on Sept. 25 at Gallagher-Iba Arena in Stillwater. Pickens said last month in his annual letter to Oklahoma State fans that he checked with the school and learned he had donated $652 million over the years, with much of it going to athletic facilities. The school’s football stadium was named for Pickens in 2003 after he made a $70 million donation, which included $20 million set aside for a stadium expansion. A funeral service is also planned for Thursday in Dallas, where Pickens lived.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The 2020 election season is officially underway in the state. Thursday marked the first day for major party or nonpartisan candidates to file declarations of candidacy with the secretary of state’s office. One of the top state races is for that role, secretary of state, the second-highest statewide office after the governor and currently held by a Republican. Filing their papers as Democratic candidates were Jamie McLeod-Skinner, who in 2018 unsuccessfully tried to unseat Rep. Greg Walden, who is from a U.S. congressional district that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016; and state Sen. Mark Hass. Secretary of State Bev Clarno urged Oregonians to run for an office. Her office said there have been few candidates in recent elections, which means voters have not had many options.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A new rule has gone into effect in the city requiring chain restaurants to post warning labels next to menu items that are high in salt. Warnings will be shown for any menu item that has more than 2,300 milligrams, which is the recommended sodium total for an entire day. Restaurants with 15 or more locations were required to post the warnings under the new regulation by Saturday. The legislation was signed by Mayor Jim Kenney last fall after City Council passed the requirement in 2018. Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley says the labels can help customers make healthier food choices. Officials say Philadelphia has one of the highest rates of hypertension and premature deaths due to heart disease. Eating too much sodium plays a big factor.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s congressional delegation says a federal infrastructure grant will help replace and upgrade 11 bridges on a busy stretch of Interstate 95. The delegation visited the Northbound Providence Viaduct on Friday to celebrate the $60.3 million from the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America Grant Program. U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee member, helped design the program to meet Rhode Island’s need for funding for large infrastructure investments. The Rhode Island Democrat says a 55-year-old viaduct will be transformed into modern throughway. It carries about 220,000 vehicles daily. Construction is scheduled for late next year. Financing will come from several federal and state sources.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: This little piggy should have stayed home. The State reports that for the fourth time, Leroy – a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig – wandered over to Brennan Elementary School in Columbia, leading officials to slap McGregor Wallace with citations for owning a pig within city limits and having a fugitive pet. Wallace is scheduled for a court appearance in October. Wallace says Leroy is his emotional support animal meant to help him deal with PTSD from domestic trauma. Wallace says he got Leroy several months ago to replace a standard pig that grew too big. He says Leroy is clever and knows how to open the home’s gate when Wallace isn’t home. The pig also can open the refrigerator. The 7-month-old swine is now at Columbia’s animal shelter.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: An organization promoting the separation of church and state is putting up billboards in three cities to protest the state’s new law that requires all public schools to post the motto “In God We Trust” in a prominent location. The billboards from the Freedom From Religion Foundation show “In God We Trust” carved into Mount Rushmore and the four presidents saying, “There goes the neighborhood.” The drawing is from Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Steve Benson. The billboards will be up for a month in Sioux Falls, Rapid City and Pierre. The foundation’s president, Annie Gaylor, says its members are concerned about the law, which she says is misguided. Gaylor says the motto, adopted during the Cold War, is outdated and divisive.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The University of Tennessee’s marching band is jumping on the anti-bullying bandwagon. The band briefly wore a T-shirt based on a design by a boy who was teased at school over the design and then offered a scholarship at the university. On Thursday, Tennessee officials offered the fourth grader a four-year scholarship beginning in the fall of 2028 if he chooses to attend Tennessee and meets admission requirements. The boy’s story went viral last week after his teacher posted on Facebook that the student’s peers mocked a T-shirt he designed for his school’s “college colors” day. After the post gained attention, the University of Tennessee’s VolShop website created its own Tennessee shirt featuring the boy’s design. School officials say over 50,000 shirts have been presold. Proceeds benefit STOMP Out Bullying.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A federal judge has approved an agreement that will require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make a recommendation by May 2021 on whether the lesser prairie chicken should be federally protected as a threatened or endangered species. The agreement was reached Thursday between the federal agency and three conservations groups: the Defenders of Wildlife, the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians. The groups sued the federal government in June to force it to make a designation for the lesser prairie chicken and its habitats. Once a designation is proposed, there will then be a public comment period followed by a final determination made later by Fish and Wildlife. The agency also could decide that no federal protections should be provided for the bird, which listed as threatened in 2014, but a federal court overturned the designation.\n\nUtah\n\nLayton: State Republican leaders refused Saturday to erase a bylaw to deny ballot spots for candidates who collect voter signatures instead of winning approval from the party’s caucus-convention system. The State Central Committee voted 68-40 to erase the bylaw, short of the two-thirds majority required for a bylaw change. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the bylaw threatened to keep Republican candidates off the 2018 ballot because of a state law allowing both paths. Then-Party Chairman Rob Anderson responded by declaring the bylaw illegal and refusing to oust any candidate, and Republican Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox had said then he’d certify candidates who used either qualifying method. Current party Chairman said Saturday that he won’t ignore the bylaw but that the party will do what’s necessary to get on the 2020 ballot.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Proverbs have been developed for centuries around the world, from “Strike while the iron is hot” to “Been there, done that.” They’re spread by writings, word of mouth and, nowadays, social media. The vast amount of them is evident in a new, unique library at the University of Vermont. It’s the collection of UVM Professor Wolfgang Mieder, thought to be the world’s premiere paroemiologist. The extensive library of nearly 9,000 volumes ranges from proverb collections including German, Chinese, Turkish and Hungarian to thousands of books and dissertations and includes Mieder’s own writings. Among his favorite proverbs is “Different strokes for different folks” because he says that “it tells you to realize that people have different priorities, different thoughts, different ideas.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia’s attorney general says couples planning to get married in the state will not have to disclose their race on their marriage application. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports clerks were notified of the change in an email late Friday, about a week after three couples filed a federal lawsuit challenging the state requirement. Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring wrote that circuit court clerks must ask people seeking a marriage license their race, but couples can decline to answer the question. Herring says clerks should issue a marriage license regardless of whether an applicant answers the question. The lawsuit says one county provided a list of more than 200 potential races to a couple who questioned the requirement. It included “American,” “Aryan,” “Moor” and “Mulatto.”\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state may seem ultraliberal, but voters in one of its deeply conservative areas have re-elected a Republican six times who thinks communists and atheists will destroy the U.S. Now Matt Shea faces a legislative investigation and calls for his resignation following media reports he was in a chat group discussing surveillance on progressives. Shea is also a major proponent of splitting Washington into two states, with Eastern Washington becoming the state of Liberty. The Army veteran hosts a weekly “Patriot Radio” show on the American Christian Network and on Facebook Live in 2017 complimented members of Team Rugged, a group that one member said provides special forces-type gun training for young men so they can “be effective in Christian warfare.” Shea didn’t respond to interview requests.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Education officials say they’ve found a problem with the state’s school system – many students aren’t showing up to class. The West Virginia Department of Education released a report Thursday saying that more than 38% of schools did not meet attendance standards in the 2018-2019 school year. In a statement, schools superintendent Steven Paine didn’t give a reason for the high level of absences but said he looks forward to working with counties and local school boards to address the problem. The report also says a fifth of students statewide are considered chronically absent, meaning they missed 18 or more days of the school year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A media company that owns television stations in the state is partnering with a longtime farm charity on a live 18-hour telethon to raise money for struggling farmers. Quincy Media and Farm Aid have scheduled the event for Friday. It will include anchors and reporters from WKOW in Madison, WAOW in Wausau, WXOW in La Crosse, WQOW in Eau Claire and KBJR in Superior. A news release says volunteers will be answering phones throughout the day collecting donations to provide support, emergency relief and other resources for family farmers in the region. Farm Aid’s annual music festival is scheduled for Saturday at Alpine Valley Theatre in East Troy. The lineup includes Willie Nelson & Family, Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds, Neil Young, John Mellencamp and Bonnie Raitt, among others.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Fifty years after 14 black football players were kicked off the University of Wyoming football team for considering a protest, eight of them returned to campus to commemorate the anniversary as the school takes another step toward reconciliation. University officials unveiled a plaque Friday at War Memorial Stadium commemorating the so-called Black 14. The event capped five days of ceremonies and discussions about the infamous dismissal of all the university’s black players in 1969. The players wanted to protest racism, but head coach Lloyd Eaton would have none of the idea – and was backed up by the university’s board of trustees and Gov. Stan Hathaway. He lit into them about coming from fatherless families and said they would only be accepted by traditionally black colleges if they weren’t at Wyoming, they said. The healing and reconciliation is not complete for some of the men who came back to campus this week. Some say they struggled for years after they were labeled as members of the Black 14.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2019/10/02/delaware-officer-involved-shootings-since-2005/3787203002/", "title": "Police shootings in Delaware: Officer-involved incidents since 2005", "text": "Since 2005, the Delaware Department of Justice has completed 63 police use-of-force investigations, all of which have been for police shootings.\n\nThe investigation into this year's single police shooting is still open, and will likely take several more months to complete.\n\nFIRST PERSON: Former officer reflects on killing a killer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/24/diversity-west-point-sloths-vs-snakes-sinking-island-news-around-states/39511837/", "title": "Diversity at West Point, sloths vs. snakes, sinking island: News from ...", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Historical officials say researchers have located the wreck of the last ship known to bring enslaved people from Africa to the United States. A statement issued Wednesday by the Alabama Historical Commission says remains of the Gulf schooner Clotilda have been identified and verified after months of assessment. The commission’s executive director, Lisa Demetropoulos Jones, calls the discovery “an extraordinary archaeological find.” In 1860 the wooden ship illegally transported 110 people from what is now the west African nation of Benin to Mobile. The Clotilda was then taken into delta waters north of the port and burned. The captives were later freed and settled a community that’s still called Africatown.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage Assembly has adopted a climate action plan setting goals for the city. Alaska Public Media reported Wednesday that officials voted Tuesday to adopt the 100-page document outlining aims such as reducing carbon emissions by 80% within 30 years. The measure passed 8-2, with both Eagle River assembly members opposed. The action plan is primarily a set of nonbinding proposals to guide municipal entities toward more environmentally friendly policies. All 22 members of the public who testified at the meeting favored the measure. Many spoke about the evidence of climate change observed in their lives such as warmer winters, worsening tree pollen, invasive insect species and heightened wildfire conditions.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State lawmakers are poised to consider tripling the amount of cash they’re paid for each day they work in new legislation that emerged as their yearly session nears a close. Lawmakers in both parties appeared supportive of the change Thursday. They said rural lawmakers especially are undercompensated for their costs of traveling to and staying in Phoenix during the session. They also note that federal tax law changes eliminated the ability to write off those expenses. Lawmakers earn $24,000 a year, plus a daily expense stipend that currently is $60 for rural lawmakers and $35 for Maricopa County residents. The Senate bill introduced Thursday raises the daily rate for rural lawmakers to the federal rate of $185 a day and half that for Phoenix-area residents. The rate would adjust yearly.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor has announced 15 new Cabinet secretaries under a state agency reorganization that cut the number of departments answering directly to him. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday said the new secretaries will begin work in July under the reorganization plan that lawmakers approved earlier this year. The plan cut the number of Cabinet-level agencies from 42. The new secretaries include Jami Cook, who will head the new Department of Public Safety that includes State Police, the Crime Lab and the Department of Emergency Management. Cook currently heads the Commission on Law Enforcement Standards and Training. State Department of Heritage Director Stacy Hurst will head the new Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. State Economic Development Director Mike Preston will head the new Department of Commerce.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Trump administration will not immediately give $1 billion it revoked from the state’s high-speed rail project to another project, according to a legal agreement reached Wednesday between the two sides. The Federal Railroad Administration announced last week that it was revoking the money, prompting California to sue on Tuesday. Beyond the lawsuit, the state planned to seek a temporary restraining order halting the federal government from giving the money to a different rail project. The new agreement means the state won’t file the restraining order, but it does not change the status of the lawsuit. California is trying to build a high-speed rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco, a venture expected to cost upward of $77 billion. The $929 million is for a segment of track already under construction in the Central Valley that must be completed by 2022.\n\nColorado\n\nHighlands Ranch: Construction workers have unearthed fossils in a Denver suburb that experts say could be from a rare horned dinosaur. The Denver Museum of Nature and Science said Monday that it is exploring the construction site near a retirement community in Highlands Ranch where a dinosaur’s lower leg bone and several ribs were found. Fossil expert Natalie Toth told KDVR-TV the fossils could be from a torosaurus – a dinosaur similar to the triceratops but differentiated by three bones. Toth says the fossils seem to be intact, so crews are hoping to uncover the entire dinosaur. The fossils are embedded in a rock layer 66 million to 68 million years old. Toth says fossils in the Denver formation are from dinosaurs that were among the last “walking around before the big extinction.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: The local police department has reached a deal with a fugitive that would have him surrender if enough people respond to a wanted poster on social media, an agreement that at least one expert calls unethical. Jose Simms, 29, who is believed to be somewhere in New York, has seven arrest warrants and is being sought as a fugitive after failing to appear in court on charges that range from breach of peace to risk of injury to a child. Torrington police Lt. Brett Johnson posted on the department’s Facebook page Wednesday that Sims had contacted him through the social media site and agreed to turn himself in if the post containing his poster gets 15,000 likes. Johnson said he negotiated Simms down from 20,000 likes. “It will be difficult but is doable,” he wrote.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Those who love people-watching and checking out the sights and sounds of nature at the state’s beaches but can’t make it out for Memorial Day weekend – or aren’t fans of dealing with sand, sunscreen and sea creatures – have an option to get their fix online. Southern Delaware Tourism maintains a list of online live cameras available in the area, so people can tune into the shorebirds aflutter along the Delaware Bay or the Boardwalk cruisers from the comfort of their own couch. “It’s such a great tool to be able to help visually relay what a great scene it is here along the coastline,” says Scott Thomas, executive director at Southern Delaware Tourism.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Officials of the Metropolitan Area Transit Authority say part of the transit train system is set to shut down for 15 weeks, affecting an estimated 17,000 riders per day. News outlets report the six-station shutdown is set to start Saturday and will be the longest in Metro history. Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld urged affected riders on Wednesday to explore other commuting options, such as working from home or carpooling. Officials say more buses will be available. This shutdown is part of a three-year platform reconstruction project and will affect Braddock Road, King Street-Old Town, Eisenhower Avenue, Huntington, Van Dorn and Franconia-Springfield stations. This project portion is expected to cost about $200 million. The transit agency hopes to rebuild 20 station platforms by the end of 2021.\n\nFlorida\n\nOlga: With no fanfare, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has quietly closed a well-loved Caloosahatchee River beach. This week, staff will start sodding over the sand that slopes to the river at the W.P. Franklin Lock and Dam. Though the swimming area was often barricaded for high fecal bacteria levels, it was Lee County’s only official upriver swimming hole, the site of many a kid’s birthday and al fresco wedding. The Florida Department of Health in Lee County will no longer sample the water there for dangerous bacteria, spokeswoman Tammy Yzaguirre said. In rural Olga some 30 miles upriver from the Gulf, the beach is just one of its 154 miles of navigable waterway the Corps supervises between the Franklin and the St. Lucie locks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Two film projects have pulled production from the state after the governor signed the so-called heartbeat bill, which bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected. The heartbeat can be detected as early as six weeks, before many women realize they’re pregnant. The Lionsgate comedy “Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar,” starring Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, and director Reed Morano’s Amazon series “The Power” initially were to be shot in Georgia but now will relocate production. Morano did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday but told Time she had been scheduled to fly to Savannah to scout locations for the new TV series. She canceled after Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill. The measure is set to go into effect Jan. 1.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The first breeding attempt by a pair of Hawaiian crows in the wild in nearly 20 years appears to have failed. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports officials at the Puu Makaala Natural Area Reserve did not find offspring at a nest the birds built. Researchers at the state park on the Big Island saw the crows, Manaolana and Manaiakalani, display behavior associated with egg incubation earlier this month, but then found no sign of chicks in the nest beyond the point when eggs would be expected to hatch. While the female, Manaiakalani, continues to act as though incubating, researchers say it is normal for alala – the Hawaiian name for the crows – to perch on infertile or otherwise nonviable eggs until realizing they will not hatch.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials are taking public comments on a plan to build a 16.5-mile power line at an eastern Idaho nuclear site as part of a cybersecurity effort to bolster protections for the nation’s electric grid. The U.S. Department of Energy announced Tuesday that it’s taking comments through June 21 on the plan to build the power line at the 890-square-mile federal site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory. Officials say the proposed 138-kilovolt powerline will make it easier to conduct experiments at the Idaho National Laboratory’s Power Grid Test Bed. The Idaho National Laboratory contains one of the United States’ primary cybersecurity facilities that uses the existing power grid at the site for experiments to make electric grids around the U.S. more secure from potential hackers.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois State Fair karaoke contest is returning this summer, and the winner will get to perform on the fair’s biggest stage. Organizers say nine regional county fairs will host qualifying rounds of State Fair Karaoke this summer. The top two winners from the regional contests will compete at the finale at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield on Aug. 11. The overall winner will be chosen that day. Fair Manager Kevin Gordon says it’s a great opportunity for local talent to perform on the grandstand stage. It’s also another type of free entertainment for people attending the fair. Competitors must be a solo act and at least 18. The contest is free to enter, but space is limited. Competitors are encouraged to pre-register on the fair website.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Quinto sleeps about 15 hours a day and covers his face with a blanket. If enough moss is in his habitat, some could grow in his fur and turn him sort of green. The 15-year-old is part of a group of two-toed sloths who are the first of the mammals ever to reside at the Indianapolis Zoo. The group will live part of the time in the new MISTery Park, one of two new permanent experiences the zoo is unveiling this Memorial Day weekend. The other, in contrast to the cuddly mammals, is “Size, Speed & Venom: Extreme Snakes,” which includes black mambas, pythons and rattlesnakes. The exhibits are different enough that the zoo is instituting a competition between the two – visitors which choose which team they’re on at the end of their visit.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The U.S. General Services Administration has released concept drawings of the approved design for the new U.S. Courthouse planned along the city’s riverfront. The GSA said in a release that the design concept for the $137 million building remains subject to minor modifications, according to budgetary, operational and security requirements. The federal courthouse is planned to be built at the former YMCA site along the riverfront. The project has been controversial, with Des Moines leaders fighting GSA’s plans to build at the site for years. Local officials have said that it won’t be in the best interest of a city that has been working to revitalize the riverfront for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.\n\nKansas\n\nScott City: The state is relying on its conservation effort to protect the lesser prairie chicken as an ecotourism attraction that is attracting birdwatchers from across the world. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism officials are working with ranchers and tour groups to meet the high demand for areas to view the vulnerable species of grouse. The department’s outdoor content manager, Michael Pearce, says western Kansas is one of the last remaining places with a sustainable native population of lesser prairie chickens. The tourism aspect has taken off recently, and the state is trying to hand off the project to private citizens. Tour organizer Jim Millensifer says Kansas ranches have had more than 200 people from 11 countries visit for guided tours.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s Division of Waste Management is giving grants to five counties to use recycled rubber tires to repave roadways. The $502,000 in grant funding will be used for rubber-modified asphalt projects that use crumb rubber manufactured from waste tires. The grants were announced by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, which oversees the waste management division. Cabinet Secretary Charles Snavely says the grant program is valuable because it promotes the use of recycled rubber from discarded tires. The counties of Clark, Fayette, Hardin, Hopkins and Pulaski received the grants. The state’s Waste Tire Trust Fund collects a $2 fee from the sale of each new tire in the state. The funding helps manage millions of scrap tires discarded each year and develops markets for recycled tire products.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Residents of an island that’s sinking into the Gulf of Mexico are working with legal representatives and case managers hoping to help them relocate. Louisiana’s Office of Community Development Executive Director Pat Forbes tells The Houma Courier that representatives have been working with Isle de Jean Charles residents for several weeks. The island has lost about 98% of its land over the past 60 years. It has 40 residents, many of whom belong to the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw or the United Houma Indians tribes. Resettlement options include moving into a planned 150-home community or getting funding for a home elsewhere. Forbes says residents don’t have a deadline to decide, though federal funding for the project must be used by September 2022. He says construction may start on the community this year.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The National Park Service says numerous improvements are taking place at Acadia National Park over the coming months. The service says work has begun at the Hulls Cove Visitor Center, and work is slated to begin on the Frazer Point Pier early in July. Hiking trails are also scheduled for improvements. Some work is already finished, including the rehabilitation of historic firepits at Seawall Campgrounds. Acadia National Park is one of Maine’s top tourist destinations in the summer months. It’s famous for Cadillac Mountain, the high point of the North Atlantic’s seaboard. The park service says the maintenance projects are paid for via methods including park entrance fees, federal funding and fundraising.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Two male grey seals rescued by the National Aquarium earlier this year were released Thursday at the city’s beach. Choppy waves and a windy, cloudy morning greeted the two semi-aquatic mammals as they were released from their crates. Keeping in line with the nonprofit’s 2019 theme of naming seals after influential scientists, the National Aquarium Animal Rescue Team dubbed the rescuees Edwin Hubble and George Washington Carver. Hubble was found stranded in St. Augustine, Florida – several hundred miles out of the normal range for grey seals, who usually don’t go south of North Carolina. Sea World took him in, and from there, rescuers up and down the Atlantic Coast coordinated a relay for Hubble. He eventually landed in Baltimore at the National Aquarium. Carver was found in early April just south of where he and Hubble were released Thursday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: A slab of rock that bears dinosaur footprints is being donated to Amherst College by authorities who seized it as part of a poaching case. Massachusetts Environmental Police turned the fossil trackway over to the school’s museum of natural history Thursday. It’s believed to bear the tracks of Eubrontes giganteous, a large dinosaur that lived about 190 million years ago. The specimen was taken as evidence in a 2004 case involving poaching in the rich fossil beds of western Massachusetts. The case led to passage of a law protecting fossils and artifacts on public land. After finishing their investigation, police offered it to Amherst’s natural history museum in February. The museum, which says it has the world’s largest collection of fossil dinosaur tracks, was glad to take it.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: A nonprofit tree-planting and education organization is seeking the largest trees in the state. Ann Arbor-based ReLeaf Michigan says its 14th Michigan Big Tree Hunt Contest runs through Sept. 3. Certificates and prizes will be awarded for the largest tree submitted from each of the state’s counties, for the largest tree found by someone 15 and younger and 16 and older, and for the largest eastern white pine in the state. The Michigan Big Tree Hunt was started in 1993 to celebrate the state’s beauty and gather information about its biggest trees. Contest entries provide potential state champion trees to Michigan’s Big Tree Registry as well as the National Register of Big Trees. ReLeaf Michigan partners with communities to replenish the state’s tree canopies by planting trees in public spaces.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Minnesota State has agreed to pay up to $1.9million to settle a wage dispute with faculty at its two-year colleges. The Minnesota State College Faculty union has been fighting since 2010 over wage calculations for faculty who do certain jobs, such as teaching independent studies or coordinating internships. The union prevailed at arbitration in 2016 but argued the public higher education system refused to comply with that ruling. The faculty sued Minnesota State in Ramsey County District Court in December 2017, alleging unfair labor practices. Responding to that lawsuit, Minnesota State said it paid faculty in accordance with the arbitration ruling but maintained it was not required to change practices going forward. The settlement announced Wednesday brings an end to that lawsuit.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Wildlife are struggling to survive as floodwaters cover some of the state’s wildlife management areas. Residents and officials say prey and predators alike are congregating wherever there are dry grounds, adding even more stress to their situation. Roger Tankesly, a Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks wildlife management area biologist for the Delta region, says seven of the state’s more popular wildlife management areas have been completely underwater since January, with some covered in 15 feet of water. David Thornton, 77, of Eagle Lake, says he’s hunted in the area for as long as he can remember. He says the deer have “eaten all the leaves they can reach,” and even raccoons are now wading through water in search for food.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Callers to a state hotline for abuse of elderly or disabled residents frequently can’t get through to anyone. Records obtained by the Columbia Missourian and KBIA radio found only about half of the 92,000 calls to the hotline last year were answered. From January through April, only about 39% of calls were answered. Data obtained through a records request shows the past decade has seen a 35% increase in reports of abuse or exploitation. The Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services added one hotline worker during that time. Jessica Sax, director of the Division of Senior & Disability Services, says the department is first addressing inefficiencies in the hotline before asking for more workers. She says the division also is studying how other states run their hotlines.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Renewable energy activists are urging state regulators to reject a proposal to add a charge for homeowners who generate surplus electricity from their own solar panels. Critics told the Montana Public Service Commission on Thursday that the NorthWestern Energy proposal would kill a burgeoning rooftop solar industry. Over the past two decades, about 2,300 NorthWestern customers in Montana installed their own solar panels. When they generate more electricity than a customer uses, the surplus is fed into the electric grid and earns the customer a credit on their bill in a process known as net-metering. NorthWestern spokeswoman Jo Dee Black says the new charge would ensure net-metering customers pay their fair share of service costs. Officials say the charge would be about $50 a month based on average customer demand.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Omaha Airport Authority is preparing to move forward with a $500 million reconstruction of Eppley Airfield. The Omaha World-Herald reports the project to rebuild the terminal within five years would overhaul its concourse, airline gates, security checkpoints, ticket counters and baggage claim. The Airport Authority is working with contractors to create a preliminary design for the terminal by this fall. The plans come as Eppley Airfield sees steady passenger growth and airline investments. Airlines scheduled a record of more than 6 million seats to fly through Eppley last year. They’ve also doubled the number of nonstop flights from the airport since 2013. Officials are planning to issue long-term revenue bonds to fund the reconstruction.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A company backed by tech billionaire Elon Musk has been granted a nearly $49 million contract to build a transit system using self-driving vehicles underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center. The board of directors of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority approved the contract Wednesday with The Boring Co., the Musk-backed enterprise based in Hawthorne, California. The company plans to construct a twin tunnel system running less than a mile long. The system will use self-driving electric vehicles capable of transporting up to 16 people. The system also will include three underground stations and a pedestrian tunnel. The company plans to start construction in September and debut the system by December 2020. The authority will reimburse the company as it completes certain stages of the project.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlymouth: A new exhibit showcases the grand hotels that once were commonplace in the White Mountains. The exhibit at the Museum of the White Mountains at Plymouth State University opened last week, and a series of talks and events runs through Sept. 12. Featuring paintings, photographs and various artifacts as far back as the 1880s, as well as stories of the people who visited and worked at these gracious establishments, the exhibit explores the origins and history of the hotels. Among the highlights will be landscape paintings from residents at several of the hotels including Edward Hill and Frank Shapleigh. A special focus will be on the four surviving hotels: the Omni Mount Washington Resort, Mountain View Grand Resort & Spa, Eagle Mountain House & Golf Club and The Wentworth Hotel.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSea Girt: Smoking and vaping will be banned on nearly every public beach in the state this summer under tougher new restrictions. Nonsmokers are rejoicing over the ban, which also applies to public parks. But some smokers are feeling discriminated against by the law, which took effect in January. Fines would start at $250 for a first offense and go up to $1,000 for a third offense. At least 20 Jersey shore towns had already enacted their own smoking bans before the statewide law took effect. Nationwide, more than 300 coastal communities have banned smoking on their beaches. But bans as broad as New Jersey’s are rare. The Clean Ocean Action environmental group counted more than 22,000 cigarette butts its volunteers picked up from New Jersey beaches during spring and fall cleanups last year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The first woman to oversee the state’s multibillion-dollar mineral resources is proposing to do away with gender-specific pronouns such as “he,” “his” or “him” in agency rulebooks. Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard says the State Land Office will hold a public hearing Friday in Santa Fe on the proposed changes. Gender-specific pronouns would be replaced by more neutral or specific references. Garcia Richard says current agency rules use male pronouns throughout to refer to her position. She says it’s no surprise that some written wording has grown outdated at the 120-year-old agency. The commissioner has final say on the language changes. The State Land Office oversees energy leases across about 14,000 square miles of state trust land to help fund schools, universities and hospitals.\n\nNew York\n\nWest Point: The class of cadets preparing to jubilantly toss their caps in the air at the U.S. Military Academy’s graduation ceremony Saturday includes 34 black women, a record number that’s a sign of concerted efforts to diversify West Point’s Long Gray Line. West Point remains mostly white and mostly male. “I can show other little girls that yes, you can come to West Point. Yes, you can do something that maybe the rest of your peers aren’t actually doing. And yes, you can be different from the rest of the group,” says senior cadet Stephanie Riley, who was among the black female cadets who recently posed for pre-graduation photos in their gray uniforms, holding out ceremonial sabers. The pictures – part of a tradition for graduating cadets – were posted widely online and became a symbol of West Point’s increasing diversity.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper says his directive that state agencies provide paid leave for workers following a birth means parents will no longer have to choose between their career or their child. Cooper signed an executive order Thursday that offers paid parental leave to state employees in his Cabinet-level departments starting Sept. 1. That’s eight weeks of full paid leave to those who give birth and four weeks to their spouses or partners. Such paid leave is already offered by many private-sector companies. At an Executive Mansion event, Cooper said such leave has been found to increase worker productivity and improve recruitment and retention. Cooper says carrying out the order will cost $3.5 million annually, with his agencies absorbing the expenses from current funds.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: A federal judge has granted a reprieve to the owners of a bar fighting to preserve a mural at their business. U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland granted a temporary restraining order Wednesday two days after the owners of Lonesome Dove filed a lawsuit against the city of Mandan over the mural city officials ordered removed. Bar owners Brian Berube and August “Augie” Kersten were cited for have an unpermitted, Western-themed mural on the outside of the bar. The Bismarck Tribune says Berube and Kersten were unaware of the permit, later applied and were denied because city ordinance states that “no mural may be placed on the front of the building.” The judge says “such a content-based restriction on speech as Mandan has enacted is unlikely to survive constitutional muster.” He scheduled a settlement conference for June 4.\n\nOhio\n\nAlliance: The University of Mount Union has ended its affiliation with the United Methodist Church over the denomination’s renewed bans on LGBT clergy and same-sex marriage. The Canton Repository reports the school’s president says the board of trustees considered the issue for months before voting recently to end the affiliation of more than 150 years. University President W. Richard Merriman Jr. says the school wants a diverse campus. He says it became difficult to see how the denomination’s recent actions could be reconciled with the university’s values. The General Conference of the United Methodist Church in February voted to continue prohibiting ordination of gays and lesbians and barring its clergy from presiding at same-sex weddings. The university says ending the affiliation won’t affect its curriculum.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A bill that would force more school districts to return to five-day school weeks has been given final legislative approval and is heading to the governor’s desk. A top priority of Senate Republicans this year, the bill passed the House on Wednesday on a 63-32 vote. The state Department of Education says 92 of Oklahoma’s more than 500 school districts currently are operating on four-day school weeks. In those cases, instructional hours are extended each day to reach the required number of hours. Under the bill, schools could continue operating four-day weeks if the district meets minimum guidelines for student performance and cost savings. Supporters of the four-day school week say it helps districts save money and recruit teachers.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A new report says that in future years, the state’s population will mostly grow through people moving into the Beaver State rather than through new births. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis predicts the state will see deaths outnumber births sometime in the next decade. Josh Lehner, a state economist, predicts the flip will happen around 2026 or 2027. It would be the first time in Oregon’s history that deaths outnumber births. The trend is already affecting the state’s more rural counties but now is spreading statewide. As the trend continues, analysts say factors that negatively affect migration to Oregon from other states – such as housing affordability – will have a bigger impact on the economy and the size of public budgets.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says preliminary statistics are pointing to a decrease in overdose deaths in the state last year, as his administration suggests the opioid crisis might be starting to wane in some parts of Pennsylvania. Wolf spoke Wednesday as he participated in a training session on how to administer a nasal spray that reverses an opioid overdose. Wolf says physicians are issuing fewer opioid prescriptions and doctor-shopping is over, thanks to a 2016 law that requires prescribers to check a state database before issuing an opioid prescription to a new patient. His administration says more robust health care outreach and law enforcement programs are paying dividends. It’s also made the anti-overdose medication naloxone regularly available at most pharmacies in Pennsylvania, at little or no cost for those with insurance.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A poet has sued the city and a police officer, saying he was racially profiled, assaulted, harassed and falsely arrested three years ago. The Providence Journal reports Christopher Johnson, of Providence, a spoken-word artist and former state poet laureate candidate, is seeking unspecified damages and the firing of the officer. Johnson says he declined to provide his name to the officer, who pulled alongside him in a police SUV while walking home from a concert in May 2016. Johnson says he was grabbed and slammed into the vehicle so hard it left a dent. Charges against Johnson were later dismissed. A police spokeswoman says Johnson never filed a formal complaint with the department.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The South Carolina State Fair this year marks its 150th anniversary of showcasing the state’s agricultural roots. The commemorative event is themed “Prize-Winning Memories” and will be held Oct. 9-20 at Columbia’s fairgrounds. WIS-TV reports the fair will present many special offerings along with traditional favorites including a free, daily big top circus; a Midway with 70+ rides; nearly 70 food stands; arts and crafts displays; pig races; livestock and agricultural exhibits; and stage shows. On July 12 as an early kick-start to the celebration, the fair will host a free outdoor screening of “The Greatest Showman.” The fair was organized in 1869 and is a self-supported, charitable organization, dedicated to preserving and promoting the state’s agricultural roots while supporting statewide education.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The South Dakota Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America will elect a new bishop next month. The election will take place during the synod assembly May 31 and June 1 at Our Savior’s Lutheran Church in Sioux Falls. Fifteen names have been pre-identified as potential candidates but will not be official nominees until their names are placed on the ballot by someone at the assembly, according to Sawyer Vanden Heuvel, director of communications for the South Dakota Synod. Any ELCA rostered minister of Word and Sacrament is eligible for the nomination, and the first ballot becomes the ballot of nominations. Nominees will be contacted and allowed to withdraw their names if they so choose by 2 p.m. Friday.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A massive new exhibition and entertainment hall is set to open at Elvis Presley’s Graceland with three museum-style exhibits, including one on the late boxing great Muhammad Ali. Graceland officials say the 80,000-square-foot Graceland Exhibition Center opens Saturday to guests visiting the Presley-themed tourist attraction in Memphis. The singer, actor and pop icon lived in the city until his death Aug. 16, 1977. Presley and Ali were known to be friends. Presley once gave Ali a custom-made robe in Las Vegas in the early 1970s. A replica of that robe is part of the Ali exhibit, along with photos of the heavyweight boxing and civil rights champion and other artifacts. Exhibits about motorcycles and the planet Earth also are scheduled to open Saturday.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: City leaders have declared a Confederate statue surplus property and offered to sell it for a minimum $450,000 – what it cost to move the bronze artwork from public view. The Dallas City Council on Wednesday designated the statue, of Robert E. Lee and a young soldier riding horses, available for sale to the highest bidder. The 1935 sculpture by Alexander Phimister Proctor was removed from a park in September 2017 and put in storage. The statue was appraised at $950,000, which Dallas authorities say could pay for removal of the city’s Confederate War Memorial. The Dallas Landmark Commission in March approved a plan to disband the 123-year-old memorial complex, which critics say is racist and not historic. A 65-foot obelisk has stood over Pioneer Park Cemetery since 1961.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State and federal officials have signed an agreement to defer to the state when planning forest projects. The Salt Lake Tribune reported Wednesday that Republican Gov. Gary Herbert and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue signed the agreement Wednesday. Officials say the deal obligates the U.S. Forest Service to rely on the state’s guidance for designing, implementing and prioritizing projects intended to reduce wildfire risks and promote the health of the state’s 12,500 square miles of forest. Utah officials say they believe the agreement will build on existing programs and investments in restoring degraded forest landscapes. A Utah forest supervisor says the forest service has already prepared and authorized treatment plans on 1,563 square miles of state forest land using mechanical thinning and controlled fires.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State Attorney General T.J. Donovan says he’s filed suit against eight members of the family that owns the drug company that manufactures OxyContin, one of the drugs believed to be partly responsible for the opioid crisis. Donovan alleged Tuesday that for over two decades the Sackler family, the owners of Purdue Pharma, minimized the health risks of opioids, claiming the prescription drugs were rarely the cause of abuse, addiction or death. Donovan says the Sacklers directed Purdue to promote products that were more dangerous, addictive and lucrative. Last September, the state filed suit against Purdue. In a statement released after the September lawsuit, the company said it shared Vermont’s concerns about the opioid crisis but denied Purdue acted improperly.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A large trash collector in the state will use recycling bins that are partly made from recycled trash. The Central Virginia Waste Management Authority said this week that it ordered 2,000 bins from Israeli company UBQ. The firm uses a patented process that converts municipal waste into a plastic-like composite material. UBQ said the authority is its first U.S. customer. CVWMA serves about 280,000 households in the Richmond area. Executive Director Kim Hynes said it’s testing out the bins, which she said are comprised of 25% of the UBQ material. UBQ says it creates the material by milling anything from banana peels to dirty plastics into a powder. The powder is then placed into a reaction chamber. UBQ says the process produces no greenhouse gas emissions or residual waste.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State and local authorities will now be restricted from asking about people’s immigration status, adding to a West Coast wall of states with so-called sanctuary policies. Gov. Jay Inslee signed a measure Tuesday implementing the new rules. They put Washington among only a handful of states, including California and Oregon, to have enacted statewide sanctuary policies and rank among the strongest statewide mandates in the nation. Police officers in Washington won’t be able to inquire about immigration status except in limited circumstances, and the state attorney general will draw up rules for courthouses, hospitals and other state government facilities aimed at limiting their use as places where federal immigration agents look for people in the country illegally. “We will not be complicit in the Trump administration’s depraved efforts to break up hard-working immigrant and refugee families,” Inslee said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLogan: The community is taking a stand against needle exchange programs. News outlets report Logan County commissioners voted this week to draft an ordinance that would outlaw starting a needle exchange program there. Commissioner Danny Godby says officials want to find a way to eliminate dirty needles, but they think a needle exchange would make the problem worse by adding more needles to the mix. Some communities in West Virginia and other states have approved needle exchanges to reduce the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis and HIV and distribute educational materials about where drug addicts can seek help. A needle exchange in Charleston closed last year over concerns about increased needle litter and other issues.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources board is tweaking the state’s bear hunt structure for the first time since 1980. The new framework calls for six bear management zones rather than the current four. Numeric zone kill limits in DNR rules would end. The agency would instead set limits based on agricultural damage, hunter success and nuisance complaints. The changes could into effect as early as the fall of 2021. The plan called for allowing hunters to use hounds in a newly formed central Wisconsin hunting zone. The board voted 6-1 to remove those provisions, however. Opponents told the board that allowing hounds in the zone would lead to trespassing. Megan Nicholson of the Humane Society of the United States said hunting with hounds is a blight on the state.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A traditional Native American horse race in the city has been postponed following cold and wet conditions in northeast Wyoming. The Gillette News Record reports the Horse Nations Indian Relay was planned for Saturday and Sunday, but rough track conditions have forced organizers to reschedule the event for Aug. 31 and Sept. 1. The sport involves racers riding without saddles to make three laps around a track. Riders finish each lap on a different horse, so they jump on to a new horse twice during each race. Four to six relay teams compete in every race. The event leads up to the Championship of Champions race in Walla Walla, Washington, in late September.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/24"}]}

Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nAnother week, another set of firsts for the new King. This time round, Charles III hosted the first state visit of his reign and welcomed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to the UK.\n\nIt was a short two-day visit but that didn’t stop the monarch from pulling out the stops for a diplomatic tour de force designed to reinforce the relationship between the two nations.\n\nThe trip had been in the works before Queen Elizabeth II’s death and while state visits generally stick to a time-honored program of events, King Charles still managed to put his own stamp on the occasion.\n\nHe kicked things off with a grand processional welcome teeming with British pomp and pageantry. Charles wasn’t alone as he warmly welcomed Ramaphosa at the Royal Pavilion at Horse Guards Parade in central London. Also in attendance were the Queen Consort and the Prince and Princess of Wales – the couple having been dispatched to Ramaphosa’s hotel to greet the head of state earlier in the day.\n\nMore than 1,000 soldiers and 200 horses participated in the ceremonial military spectacle. The South African President looked delighted as he inspected a guard of honor and received a royal salute in the crisp winter sunshine from Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards.\n\nLt Col James Shaw, who oversees major ceremonial events in his role as Brigade Major of the Household Division, said preparations for Tuesday’s welcome had taken “a huge amount of work,” before revealing that those involved were “very proud to support such an important national occasion.”\n\n“The state visit is a historic first: our first state visit for His Majesty the King and the President of South Africa, the first state visit in London since 2019, the first processional state visit on Horse Guards since 2018, and the first for almost everyone on parade,” the military organizer said, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency.\n\nFollowing the official welcome, the party took a carriage ride back to Buckingham Palace where Ramaphosa was greeted with a second honor guard. A tour of Royal Collection items themed around South Africa followed a private lunch put on by the King, before an elaborate white-tie state banquet in the evening.\n\nRamaphosa received a ceremonial welcome at Horse Guards Parade in London. Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/Getty Images\n\nCustomarily held on the first night of a state visit, Buckingham Palace banquets are held in the ballroom, with around 160 invitations extended to individuals with “cultural, diplomatic or economic links to the country being hosted.”\n\nBefore everyone tucks into the lavish feast (a starter of grilled brill with wild mushrooms and truffles with a sorrel sauce, followed by Windsor pheasant filled with artichokes, quince compote and a port sauce for the main, in case you were wondering), the monarch traditionally says a few words and raises a glass to the guest of honor.\n\nCharles wowed Ramaphosa by opening his speech with the word “welcome” in several different languages used in South Africa. After cracking a few jokes, the King praised the economic, scientific and cultural ties between the countries. All standard remarks for a banquet speech, but Charles also didn’t shy away from more challenging subjects, broaching the UK’s troubled legacy of colonialism.\n\n“While there are elements of that history which provoke profound sorrow, it is essential that we seek to understand them,” he said. “We must acknowledge the wrongs which have shaped our past if we are to unlock the power of our common future.”\n\nCharles’s comments were seen by many as part of a continued effort to unify the Commonwealth realms, some of which have in recent years expressed intentions to sever ties with London.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales look set to play a more active role during Charles' reign. Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe monarch also chose the occasion to call for future cooperation on finding “practical solutions to the twin existential threats of climate change and biodiversity loss.”\n\nWith this first visit from a foreign leader coming just two months into his reign, the King was also keen to reflect on his late mother’s relationship with South Africa, recalling her visits to the country, the times she hosted Ramaphosa’s predecessors in London and the friendship she shared with revered statesman Nelson Mandela.\n\nOther royals were also keen to make Elizabeth II’s presence felt, with Camilla donning the late Queen’s dazzling sapphire and diamond tiara with matching necklace and bracelet, and Kate wearing a bracelet that belonged to the family matriarch.\n\nThe South African state visit was Charles’s first big diplomatic test. He revealed that while he’ll lean on templates established by his mother, he also wants to shake things up and tackle issues that matter to him and his subjects head on.\n\nTellingly, he’s also planning on doing it with Camilla, William and Kate firmly at his side, and with other members of the House of Windsor backing up their plays. It became commonplace to see Charles support and sometimes stand in for his mother in the twilight of her reign. But this week, the prominence of the Prince and Princess of Wales during the state visit indicated that the couple have been elevated into crucial central roles. All four will work together, front and center, sharing duties as they seek to secure the future of the dynasty.\n\nPHOTOS OF THE WEEK\n\nHere’s a few of our favorite shots from the first state visit King Charles hosted as monarch.\n\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSouth Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa departs Horse Guards Parade with King Charles III and Camilla, Queen Consort in the Irish State Coach, en route to Buckingham Palace at the start of the President’s two-day state visit.\n\nDan Kitwood/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter sharing a private lunch, the King and President headed to Buckingham Palace’s Picture Gallery where they viewed items from the Royal Collection connected to South Africa. Here, Ramaphosa holds a photograph of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, who served as South Africa’s president in the 90s, with the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nLeon Neal/Getty Images\n\nRamaphosa was also invited to visit Westminster Abbey, where he was shown a memorial stone for Mandela. He was accompanied by the Dean of Westminster Abbey, The Very Reverend Dr. David Hoyle.\n\nAaron Chown/Getty Images\n\nChuckles around the dinner table as King Charles speaks during the state banquet on Tuesday night.\n\nDaniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe following day, the Earl of Wessex accompanied Ramaphosa to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Later, the pair visited the Francis Crick Institute, a research center that collaborates with the University of KwaZulu-Natal. During the stop they learned about technology being used across the African continent to diagnose infections and met with South African scientists and students.\n\nStefan Rousseau/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe state visit also allowed UK PM Rishi Sunak the opportunity to welcome Ramaphosa to 10 Downing Street for a bilateral meeting.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nCharles’ day of engagements in the capital.\n\nThe King was a man about town on Wednesday, as he visited three of the institutions that are home to many of the country’s leading lawyers, doctors and jewelers. First, the King visited Gray’s Inn, one of London’s four Inns of Court where barristers have cut their teeth for more than six centuries. Charles met with many of the trainees hoping soon to be called to the Bar, before touring that Inn’s pristine grounds in central London. From there, the King made the short journey to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital – the oldest hospital in the UK – where a restoration project is set to begin in 2023, the building’s 900th anniversary year.

The unlikely duo so touched the country that, after the monarch’s death, mourners had to be asked by the Palace if they would kindly stop leaving his trademark marmalade sandwiches among the floral tributes. Mourners went on to leave more than 1,000 Paddington Bear toys outside royal residences. Not wanting them to go to waste, the toys were collected, cleaned, and this week donated to the Barnardos children’s charity by the Queen Consort. A fleet of taxis delivered the bears in style, along with Camilla herself, to Barnardo’s nursery in Bow, east London on Thursday. After a very special teddy bears’ picnic, some of the cuddly toys were gifted to children there; others will be distributed to kids around the country supported by the charity.\n\nCamilla personally delivered some of the thousands of Paddington Bears left in the Queen's memory.

It’s not every day that Britons get invited to lunch at Buckingham Palace. Even fewer get invited on account of being members of the Order of Merit. That prestigious award is reserved for only the most talented individuals in the Commonwealth – there can only be 24 living members at one time. For those invited to Buckingham Palace to celebrate this achievement, the expectation is that they will come wearing better than their Sunday best. But David Hockney has always been one to flout expectations. The 85-year-old came to the Palace wearing not brogues or Oxford shoes – but yellow Crocs. The jaunty fashion choice added some extra cheer to the occasion.\n\nDavid Hockney's shoes were as colorful as his paintings.

Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nMark your calendars, royal-watchers. King Charles III will be crowned in Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023, eight months after he succeeded his mother.\n\nAs expected, the date has been the source of heavy speculation in the past few weeks. Many hoped for June 2 – 70 years to the day since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II – as a symbol of continuity between the reigns.\n\nBut, alas, picking a date isn’t as simple as looking at a calendar. It has to be checked against everything else going on to avoid clashes with other major events (the FA Cup soccer final, for example), as well as ensuring the availability of key players like the abbey itself and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who conducts the ceremony.\n\nWith the date locked in, attention now turns to the details of the day. The United Kingdom being the only monarchy in Europe that retains the ritual of a coronation, it will be a typically royal occasion, full of the pageantry loved by so many. But, at its heart, it is also a deeply religious ceremony.\n\nWhile the specifics of next year’s event have yet to be revealed, coronations have stayed largely the same for more than 1,000 years, so we have a pretty good idea of what to expect.\n\nIt’s likely to start with the King and Queen Consort traveling to the abbey in procession in the Gold State Coach – seen earlier this year in Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Once Charles and Camilla arrive, Buckingham Palace says, the coronation “will reflect the monarch’s role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry.”\n\nThat line from the palace has been interpreted as a hint that Charles’ coronation will be different from the one his late mother experienced seven decades ago.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II sits on a throne during her coronation in Westminster Abbey in London. Centrall Press Photo LTD/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBack then, the planning committee orchestrated a grand state affair to introduce the young, somewhat unknown Elizabeth to the world and assert her position as the new monarch. Britain was still emerging from a world war, and it was felt the country needed an elaborate occasion to rally behind.\n\nThe ceremony – which was the first royal event to be televised – ran for more than three hours and temporary structures were erected within the abbey to accommodate a swollen guest list of more than 8,000 people.\n\nThe core elements of the service were the recognition, oath, anointing, investiture, crowning and homage. The recognition is when the sovereign stands in the theater of the abbey and presents themself to the people. After taking the coronation oath – which is a vow to rule according to law, exercise justice with mercy, and maintain the Church of England – the monarch is anointed with holy oil by the archbishop. This is considered the most sacred part of the service.\n\nThe next part is the investiture, when the sovereign is dressed in special coronation robes and presented with the symbols of the monarchy: the orb, coronation ring, scepter and rod. Then St. Edward’s Crown is the placed atop the monarch’s head before royal princes and nobles of the realm make their way to the sovereign to pay their respects.\n\nThe occasion will also see the Queen Consort crowned in a similar but smaller ceremony.\n\nExperts say Charles III’s coronation will be a significantly more subdued occasion than his mother’s, with arrangements influenced by the ongoing cost of living crisis in the UK.\n\n“We’re no longer the sort of society we used to be,” says Bob Morris, honorary research fellow at University College London’s Constitution Unit.\n\nIt would be “ridiculous for us to have the kind of imperialistic coronation that we had in 1953,” he adds. “Secondly, we’re in the middle of a recession or damn near it. And that’s a very good reason for not splashing the cash.”\n\nSt. Edward's Crown has been used in coronations for English, and later British, monarchs. Jack Hill/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCraig Prescott, a lecturer in law at Bangor University in Wales, tells CNN it’s inevitable the event will be adapted and points to the ceremony’s length as one aspect that could be overhauled.\n\n“(The monarchy is) not a museum. It’s a living, breathing part of our constitutional, political and social arrangements, and so in order to be effective, it has to keep in tune with the times,” he explains. “The coronation service has always sort of shifted as time has gone on.”\n\nPrescott continues: “Although (the Queen’s coronation) was televised, it wasn’t a television event in the modern sense … Those organizing it today will have more than one eye on the idea that this will be primarily viewed through television and a lot of it could be speeded up with a more modern, sharper approach.”\n\nSpecifically with the service, Morris thinks that feudal elements, like the homage by peers, could be removed entirely.\n\nMeanwhile, Prescott suggests prayers and readings could be pared back, and in doing so make space for “the involvement of the other faiths in the UK.”\n\n“We’ve seen that in other royal events, where you have people from other faiths taking part (and) saying prayers from their own faith backgrounds.”\n\nRegardless of ceremonial modifications, Prescott says next year’s royal set piece promises to be spectacular.\n\n“(The coronation) is new for almost everyone,” he says, adding: “When you think about the monarchy, it’s such an old institution but it’s able to deliver something new.”\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nA royal show of force.\n\nThursday was yet another busy day for the working Windsors. Up in Glasgow, Scotland, the King visited the Burrell Collection, where he officially reopened what is regarded as one of the world’s greatest single-person art collections after a six-year refurbishment. While the King was at the museum, the Queen Consort was back in London visiting Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where she met domestic abuse frontline staff working on the maternity ward. Shortly after, on the other side of town, the Prince and Princess of Wales traveled to the Copper Box Arena in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park for an event with Coach Core. The couple’s Royal Foundation launched the programme in 2012, but a decade later it is an independent charity supporting disadvantaged young people through sport apprenticeships. Meanwhile, Sophie, Countess of Wessex celebrated World Sight Day in Malawi, which last week became the first country in southern Africa to eliminate trachoma, an infectious disease that causes blindness. Sophie has been in Malawi and Botswana this week to see the legacy of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, which aims to end avoidable blindness across the Commonwealth and beyond. Since the official royal mourning period ended, all the royals have been showcasing their work with a series of engagements over the past two weeks.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales arrive at Copper Box Arena in London on October 13, 2022.

The lawsuit accuses Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) of engaging in various means of criminal activity to obtain information on high-profile figures over the years. Elizabeth Hurley, Sadie Frost, David Furnish and Doreen Lawrence make up the rest of the plaintiffs behind the legal action, filed last week. They claim they were “victims of abhorrent criminal activity and gross breaches of privacy,” according to a statement from their representatives. The group accuses ANL of hiring private investigators to carry out unlawful acts such as planting listening devices in homes and cars and recording private calls. It also claims the publisher would pay corrupt police officials to obtain inside information, engaged in impersonation and deception to obtain medical records, and would hack into bank accounts and financial transactions by “illicit means and manipulation.” CNN has reached out to ANL for comment.\n\nPrint editions of the Daily Mail newspaper Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nCorgi parade in honor of the late Queen.\n\nCorgi owners descended on Buckingham Palace with their pups on Sunday for a heartfelt tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II.

As owners across the country paid their respects to the late monarch in the month since her passing, many have brought their beloved dogs along, while others have left corgi toys and figurines among floral tributes.\n\nA Corgi is seen at Windsor Castle on September 12, 2022.

But there's ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the November 18 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nWhen King Charles III celebrated his birthday earlier this week, the headlines focused on the new monarch taking on a new park ranger post previously held by his father, Prince Philip.\n\nThen there were, of course, the military bands performing “Happy Birthday” outside Buckingham Palace at the changing of the guard. And many of the family posted celebratory notes and photographs to official social media accounts. All of this will have probably helped make the day a memorable one.\n\nBut separately, the King also moved to address a dilemma that has remained unresolved since long before Queen Elizabeth II’s death.\n\nOn Monday, Charles asked the UK Parliament to allow his siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, to become Counsellors of State. The move would empower them to step in for him temporarily when directed to do so. The King said in a message read out in the upper chamber, the House of Lords, that maintaining the smooth running of the government was behind the request.\n\n“To ensure continued efficiency of public business when I’m unavailable, such as while I’m undertaking official duties overseas, I confirm that I would be most content should Parliament see fit for the number of people who may be called upon to act as Counsellors of State under the terms of the Regency Acts 1937 to 1953 to be increased to include my sister and brother, the Princess Royal and the Earl of Wessex and Forfar, both of whom have previously undertaken this role,” the King wrote.\n\nThe same message was also read out in the lower house, the Commons.\n\nCounsellors of State can fulfil royal duties in Charles's absense. HANNAH MCKAY/AFP/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAt present, by law, the group of royals who can fill in for the sovereign numbers five – limited to the monarch’s spouse and the first four family members in the line of succession over the age of 21. Two counselors can be appointed to act on the monarch’s behalf through a letters patent and help keep the state ticking over. Currently, that means the cohort includes Queen Consort Camilla as well as the Prince of Wales, Duke of Sussex, Duke of York and Princess Beatrice.\n\nExperts have long suggested the existing pool of counselors is too small, while public debate on the topic grew toward the latter part of the late Queen’s reign as she became increasingly frail. Charles and William were authorized to act as counselors on occasion when the Queen was unwell. But it was not lost on many that her other two counselors were Princes Harry and Andrew, despite no longer being working members of the family – albeit for very different, well-covered reasons.\n\nNormally, the machinations of royal duties would remain behind palace walls. But the topic re-emerged with Charles’ accession, and because any changes to the Regency Act require legislation, the discussion was broached in the House of Lords for the first time late last month.\n\nLabour Peer Viscount Stansgate challenged Andrew and Harry’s regency powers, remarking that the Duke of York “has left public life,” while the Duke of Sussex “has left the country.” He queried if it was time “to approach the King to see whether a sensible amendment can be made to this Act?” In response, the Lord Privy Seal, Lord True, said he wouldn’t divulge “any private conversations” he may have had with the King or the Royal Household but that “the government will always consider what arrangements are needed to ensure resilience in our constitutional arrangements.”\n\nPrincess Anne and Prince Edward are set to become Counsellors of State.\n\nThe King’s moves this week confirm that the palace has been thinking about the dilemma and the options available. And adding to the group of official stand-ins is not unprecedented, having previously been done for the Queen Mother in 1953 after Elizabeth II came to the throne.\n\nPractically, it seems there is a desire within Parliament to resolve the issue quickly. A day after Charles’ request, members of the Lords replied to the monarch, assuring him they would act “without delay” and “will provide such measures as may appear necessary or expedient for securing the purpose set out by His Majesty.”\n\nAnd the Lords weren’t kidding when they offered expedience, with the Counsellors of State Bill 2022-23 whipping through the Palace of Westminster at breakneck speed. It was given its first reading by Tuesday afternoon and is set to have its second reading and be debated next week.\n\nExpanding the group of royals who can deputize for the King in his absence is an elegant solution to a potential constitutional crisis. It provides for more flexibility while probably going some way to avoid family awkwardness and shields the two dukes from the public embarrassment that might have arisen had they been stripped of their positions. Charles’ approach means both are still technically counselors on paper but firmly puts an end to speculation over whether Harry or Andrew will ever be called upon.\n\nROYAL TEA MOMENT\n\nPrince William presented England winger Jack Grealish with the iconic number 7 shirt. Eddie Keogh/The FA Collection/Getty Images\n\nWilliam sends England squad off to World Cup in style.\n\nThe Prince of Wales visited the England soccer squad on Monday at St. George’s Park, the team’s HQ, ahead of their departure for the World Cup in Qatar, which kicks off this weekend. Just before the Three Lions swapped the drizzly winter weather for the heat of Doha, William was on hand to wish the team well. “I’m really here to point out that the rest of the country is behind you,” he told the squad, as he presented each player with their shirt number. “We are all rooting for you, enjoy it.”\n\nWhile William serves as president of England’s Football Association, many Welsh fans on social media suggested the visit was tactless for the holder of the Prince of Wales title and questioned his loyalties.\n\nWilliam has never been shy about being a passionate England fan, as we mentioned last week. And he has been a presence in the Wembley stands, along with his son, George, cheering the team on at previous tournaments. However, he sought to address the criticism mid-week during a trip to the Welsh Parliament in Cardiff. “I’m telling everyone I’m supporting both, definitely. I can’t lose,” he said. “I’ve got to be able to play carefully with my affiliations because I worry otherwise if I suddenly drop England to support Wales then that doesn’t look right for the sport.”\n\nWilliam continued that while he was growing up, Wales didn’t qualify for many football tournaments and so he picked England. But he’ll be cheering both teams on in their first games on Monday and more broadly, he’s found a way to back both countries over the years. “I’ve supported England [football] since I’ve been quite small, but I support Welsh rugby. That’s kind of my way of doing it.”\n\nThis year’s tournament is Wales’ first World Cup in more than half a century. The two teams are set to clash in the group stages on November 29.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nKing Charles shares ‘concern’ after Australia floods.\n\nThe King sent a letter to Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese late last week to express his concern after flash floods devastated parts of Victoria, a state in the southeast of the country. “Our heartfelt thoughts are with all those affected and for the losses that have been suffered,” Charles wrote. “It has been particularly inspiring to see how communities have pulled together to protect homes and livestock and to support each other during this appallingly difficult period,” he added. The floods are the latest threat caused by climate change that Australia has faced in recent years – after battling wildfires for months in 2020. According to PA Media, Albanese said in September that he would be “very comfortable” with the King expressing his views on the “importance of climate change. It is about the very survival of our way of life,” he said.\n\nKate visiting Ukrainian refugees who have resettled in the UK.\n\nThe Princess of Wales visited Reading Ukrainian Community Center on Thursday, to meet with displaced Ukrainian families who have arrived in the United Kingdom following Russia’s invasion of their home country.

The Duke of Sussex wrote a letter to bereaved military children through the British charity Scotty’s Little Soldiers, offering his sympathies and sharing how he has navigated his grief. “We share a bond even without ever meeting one another, because we share in having lost a parent. I know first-hand the pain and grief that comes with loss and want you to know that you are not alone,” he wrote. The charity supports children whose parents have died in service of the British armed forces. On Remembrance Sunday, dozens of these brave children marched through London wearing the charity’s black and yellow scarves. Harry also wrote knowingly of the “difficult feelings” acts of remembrance can stir. “Whenever you need a reminder of this, I encourage you to lean into your friends at Scotty’s Little Soldiers,” he said. “I couldn’t be more grateful and relieved that you have amazing people walking beside you throughout your journey.” Over in the United States, Harry commemorated Veterans Day by attending a remembrance service at Pearl Harbor, while on his Archewell foundation’s website, he and wife Meghan praised the “brave men and women” who have “made tremendous sacrifices and embody duty and service.” Read Harry’s full letter here.\n\nPHOTO OF THE WEEK\n\nPrince WIlliam visited the Welsh Parliament, called the Senedd, on Wednesday.

We’ve reached out to the palace for an official statement and will let you know if we hear back.\n\nBut, in a statement emailed to CNN, a COP27 spokesperson confirmed that the King had been “invited as a very special guest” and said the COP president designate was “disappointed” by the reports of his absence. It also warned the United Kingdom against dialing back its climate goals, as the Truss government reviews some of the more ambitious aspects of the UK’s Net Zero strategy.\n\n“The Egyptian presidency of the climate conference acknowledges the longstanding and strong commitment of His Majesty to the climate cause, and believes that his presence would have been of great added value to the visibility of climate action at this critical moment. We hope that this doesn’t indicate that the UK is backtracking from the global climate agenda after presiding over COP26,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson noted Truss was still invited in her capacity as head of the UK government.\n\nFor its part, Downing Street referred CNN to recent comments from the prime minister’s spokesman in which he declined to reveal details of the King and prime minister’s conversations “as a matter of longstanding policy.” However, the spokesman did add that “we have a proud record when it comes to COP, we are forging ahead with our plans for NetZero – 40% of our power now comes from clean energy sources and we will continue to deliver on those promises.” Downing Street said it will confirm Truss’ attendance closer to the event.\n\nThe King walks with Prime Minister Liz Truss and members of her Cabinet in the 1844 Room, at Buckingham Palace on September 10.

And at previous climate summits, he’s played an active role – appearing in his element while pressing for global action.\n\nLast year, while still Prince of Wales, he stepped in for the Queen in Glasgow who, as head of the host nation, was unable to host a reception for visiting delegates following a hospital stay. She did end up sending a video message, but it was Charles who opened the summit in November 2021, imploring countries to work with industries to create solutions to climate change.\n\n“We know this will take trillions, not billions, of dollars,” he told delegates. Climate change and loss of biodiversity pose a great threat and the world must go on a “war-like footing” to combat them, he added. Along with Camilla, William and Catherine, he then attended a number of engagements at the UN climate talks.\n\nCharles also delivered the opening address back in 2015 for COP21 in Paris, where he urged world leaders to “take those long-awaited steps towards rescuing our planet.”\n\nIt may have been assumed that Prince William, now in the role of Prince of Wales, might have headed to Egypt instead, but Kensington Palace has also confirmed he won’t attend this year either.\n\nCharles gave the keynote speech at the opening session of COP21 in 2015. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nAll this has left some to wonder if Charles will have to abandon his environmental platform now he is the sovereign.\n\n“Tradition might suggest that he should remain mum on political matters, a new sovereign is well within his royal prerogative to shape the contours of his reign,” wrote Joseph Romm, a former Acting Assistant Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy during the Clinton administration, in a recent op-ed for CNN.\n\n“Charles can and should make climate change a key focus of his reign, both in public and private. Indeed, it’s probably the only way to keep the monarchy relevant in the coming decades where climate change becomes the world’s dominant issue as its impacts are increasingly widespread and catastrophic,” Romm added.\n\nWhile the King will likely be disappointed to miss COP27, many – including former US Secretary of State and climate envoy John Kerry – believe he will maintain his mantle as a royal eco-warrior.\n\nKerry, who speaks regularly with Charles on climate issues, told CNN last month that the King was “deeply committed on these vital issues.”\n\n“He has always known that at some point he would become King and he doesn’t want to not be able to push what is not a political issue. It’s not ideological, it’s science and it’s a reality and it’s happening all around the world,” Kerry told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.\n\n“Going forward, His Majesty now is absolutely seized by the sense of urgency and the feeling that no nation is yet really doing enough,” he pressed on, adding that he truly feels the King’s “voice can help mobilize.”\n\nThe King and his son previously attended events during the UN climate summit last year in Glasgow. Daniel Leal-Olivas/Pool/Getty Images\n\nKerry also pointed to some of Charles’ projects like the Terra Carta initiative as having helped bring the private sector to the table in recent years and having already made differences in the fight to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd while the new monarch works out how to fuse his passion for the natural world into his role as sovereign, his son William will continue his work through his Earthshot initiative.\n\nThe environmental prize is due to head to Boston in early December for its second iteration. In 2020, William spoke of being inspired to start the prize by his father and grandfather, Philip – an illustration of how continuity has been built into the royal roles over the years. It showed that when Charles became King, William was always going to carry on that work – but very much in his own way.\n\nMark your calendars, royal-watchers. King Charles III will be crowned in Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023, eight months after he succeeded his mother.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY\n\nWe want to know what you think: Should the new monarch keep speaking out on climate issues or should he leave it to other royals to take on?\n\nDrop us an email with your views to royalnews@cnn.com and we’ll look at featuring a few in an upcoming send.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nSophie makes royal history.\n\nA royal show of force.\n\nThe Countess of Wessex hugs Jeanne Mukunilwa, a survivor of conflict-related sexual violence at the City of Joy, in Bukavu, South Kivu Province, during a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo this week.

Well, there’s been an update.\n\nMargrethe II, who this year celebrated her golden jubilee milestone, abruptly announced last week that the children of her younger son, Prince Joachim, will cease holding royal titles from next year.\n\nThe move seemed to spark something of a crisis in the royal household, with the 82-year-old monarch this week apologizing for the “strong reactions to my decision.” Yet despite the concession, she remained resolute in her actions.\n\n“My decision has been a long time coming. With my 50 years on the throne, it is natural both to look back and to look ahead. It is my duty and my desire as Queen to ensure that the monarchy always shapes itself in keeping with the times. Sometimes, this means that difficult decisions must be made, and it will always be difficult to find the right moment,” she added.

Does the British ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritain’s royal hierarchy has changed dramatically in the past several weeks, after King Charles III became the country’s first new monarch for seven decades and several of his relatives stepped into new roles.\n\nBut there is a troubling familiarity to the first major crisis to grip the newly reorganized institution.\n\nThe royals are once again battling serious allegations of racism inside palace walls, after an honorary aide resigned and apologized following complaints that she repeatedly asked a Black British charity boss where she was “really from.”\n\n“It was like an interrogation,” Ngozi Fulani, who runs the domestic violence charity Sistah Space, told BBC Radio 4. “Although it’s not physical violence – it is an abuse.”\n\nThe aide, identified as Lady Susan Hussey in British media, served as the late Queen Elizabeth II’s lady in waiting for more than 60 years and is a godmother to the Prince of Wales.\n\nFulani was attending an event hosted by Camilla, Queen Consort, intended to highlight what she called a “global pandemic” of violence against women, and to celebrate the work of campaigners and charities who tackle the issue.\n\nBut the experience Fulani endured has overshadowed that message. “I have to really question how this can happen in a space that’s supposed to protect women against all kinds of violence,” she told the BBC.\n\nThe timing of the controversy couldn’t have been worse, erupting as it did on the first day of Prince William and Catherine’s visit to the United States for the Earthshot Awards ceremony, their first overseas trip in their new positions. Keen to draw a line under the situation playing out at home, Kensington Palace condemned the remarks of William’s godmother as “unacceptable,” adding that it was “right that the individual concerned has stepped aside with immediate effect.”\n\nNow, the royal institution is facing a fresh round of uncomfortable questions.\n\n“I was shocked. It’s 2022, and somebody can speak like that and think like that,” Diane Abbott, a Labour MP who represents Fulani and the first Black woman elected to the House of Commons in 1987, told CNN. Abbott said the suggestion that a Black person is not truly British is less prevalent today then decades ago, but still exists generationally.\n\n“King Charles III and a lot of people around him are very committed now to modernizing the monarchy. They want to modernize it, they want to keep it relevant,” Abbott said. “But this sort of incident takes them back.”\n\n“Meghan Markle talked about this, and she got roundly abused – and she’s still the target of negativity in the British press,” Abbott added, referring to the Duchess of Sussex. “I think this incident shows that what Meghan Markle was trying to indicate is true.”\n\nNgozi Fulani said the exchange was \"like an interrogation.\" Ken McKay/ITV/Shutterstock\n\nAn increasingly familiar debate\n\nA swell of goodwill surrounded the royals following the Queen’s death, but that sentiment was not limitless and the simple truth remains that the late monarch outshone all of her descendants, including King Charles, in terms of popularity among the public.\n\nIn the wake of his mother’s death, King Charles told religious leaders he felt he had a personal duty to “protect the diversity of our country.” But without the Queen’s unifying presence at the top of “The Firm,” the royals must now respond to serious questions about whether their institution adequately represents a multicultural Britain.\n\nThis was, after all, an aide previously at the heart of the royals’ inner circle. Hussey frequently accompanied Queen Elizabeth II to official engagements, riding alongside her to the funeral service for Prince Philip in 2021. She welcomed prime ministers and dignitaries to Buckingham Palace, stood by the throne at State Openings of Parliament, and was often pictured laughing alongside the matriarch, Charles and other royals at horse-racing events.\n\nBut now, Hussey’s comments have dragged the royal family back into a debate it has sought to dissociate itself from.\n\nQuestions of how robustly the palace confronts racism have swirled since Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, told Oprah Winfrey last year that someone in the family questioned her on the skin tone of her unborn baby.\n\nCNN was told last year that the Queen dispatched Hussey, along with her Dresser Angela Kelly, to offer advice, guidance and tutelage to Meghan after her entry into the royal family – an institution that the duchess has since said ignored her pleas over her mental health and made her feel unwelcome and isolated.\n\nAnd later last year, Britain’s Guardian newspaper unearthed documents, buried in the UK national archives, which revealed that the Queen’s courtiers had banned ethnic minority immigrants and foreigners from holding clerical positions at Buckingham Palace until at least the late 1960s.\n\nLady Susan Hussey was at the very center of the royals' inner circle. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nWhen this emerged, the palace didn’t confirm when this practice had ended but told CNN: “The Royal Household and the Sovereign comply with the provisions of the Equality Act, in principle and in practise. This is reflected in the diversity, inclusion and dignity at work policies, procedures and practises within the Royal Household.”\n\nSuch stories have forced royals to go on the defensive. Prince William told reporters in the aftermath of the Winfrey interview that the royals are “very much not” a racist family; months later, a senior royal representative later said Queen Elizabeth II supported the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAnd royals have since tentatively approached the thorny issue of the monarchy’s historic links to slavery, with then-Prince Charles saying in June that the “time has come” to confront the legacy of the practice. Many activists want more, such as a formal apology from the institution.\n\nIncidents like these recall a number of previous controversies and threaten to undo the efforts of the senior royals to present themselves as in-touch and relevant ambassadors for Britain – a particularly dangerous proposition in the early months of Charles’ reign.\n\nThere is progress – but it’s ‘not fast enough’\n\nHussey’s swift departure, and Kensington Palace’s immediate response, has been noted by some onlookers as a sign that the monarchy is learning from past mistakes.\n\n“A few years ago this incident would have been dismissed and Ngozi would have been regarded as too sensitive,” Abbott told CNN.\n\n“The speed of response this time, and the fact there was an apology and [William’s spokesperson] made a statement, does show that there is some progress on race issues in the royal family,” she said.\n\n“It’s not fast enough,” Abbott added. “I would like to see them have more Black people in the royal household, I would like to see them genuinely open their arms to Meghan Markle, and I would like to see them use their role to try and encourage a genuinely multiracial society.”\n\nOthers have also called for the monarchy to look inward. “There are clues here that this is a pattern; that it’s institutional,” Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality Party who was present at the event and said she witnessed the conversion, told the BBC on Wednesday.\n\n“It really left its mark on me. It left its mark on Ngozi,” she said of the exchange, urging the royal family not to frame the incident as a one-off. “Don’t minimize, don’t deflect,” she said.\n\nAnd however much change is happening inside palace walls, the country is changing faster. On the same day of the Palace reception, results from last year’s national census revealed that people who described themselves as Christian in England and Wales fell from 59% to 46%, the first time it has dipped below half of the population. There was a huge surge in those who said they had no religion, while the number of Muslims rose to 6.5%.\n\nThe Christian faith has legal status in England, with the Church of England as the established church and the monarch as its titular head, the “Defender of the Faith.” The figures provide another example of how cultural attitudes in Britain are shifting away from those in which the monarchy is steeped.\n\nThe palace will hope that public anger over Hussey’s comments will subside following her resignation, but there are more roadbumps ahead. An immaculately timed trailer for the much-hyped Netlix documentary about Harry and Meghan was released on Thursday, with Meghan telling viewers they will “hear our story from us.”\n\nAnd, more significantly, the incident has hinted towards a question that may reappear during Charles’ reign, just as it did at times during his mother’s tenure: Can the royals adapt, or is the institution simply too archaic to represent Britain today?\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the year of Prince Philip’s funeral.

Sign up here.\n\nKigali, Rwanda CNN —\n\nBetter late than never. That was the general reaction to Prince Charles’ opening speech at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali on Friday.\n\nThe prince will succeed his mother as head of the organization – an association of independent states that emerged out of the ashes of the British Empire. That empire will forever be associated with slavery, and Prince Charles made it clear in his opening remarks that he wants to change the status quo and begin a dialogue about it.\n\n“While we strive together for peace, prosperity and democracy I want to acknowledge that the roots of our contemporary association run deep into the most painful period of our history,” he told delegates. “I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many, as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery’s enduring impact. “\n\nThose delegates coming out after the speech appeared moved and heartened by the prince’s words. A more resounding “sorry” would have suited some better but that would open the way for reparation claims and that’s a government issue, not one for the monarchy.\n\nCharles said the Commonwealth needs to “find new ways to acknowledge our past. Quite simply, this is a conversation whose time has come. Your Excellencies, conversations start with listening.”\n\nYusuf Keketoma Sandi was part of the Sierra Leone delegation. Tens of thousands of Africans were kidnapped and brought to Sierra Leone, to be traded and put on slave ships bound for the Americas. It later became a British colony.\n\nHe told us: “Slavery has not been part of the conversation, so the fact that we have the prince today talking about slavery and to see how we want to start that conversation… Sierra Leone is looking forward to that and we hope that when it starts he will pay a visit to Sierra Leone and go and see some of the scars left in Sierra Leone.”\n\nThere are still 15 countries that have Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. Barbados only replaced her with a locally appointed president last year. The Prime Minister of Jamaica voiced the desire to do the same a few months ago.\n\nIn Kigali, Charles made clear he would not stand in the way of countries cutting ties with the monarchy. He said: “The Commonwealth contains within it countries that have had constitutional relationships with my family, some that continue to do so, and increasingly those that have had none. I want to say clearly, as I have said before, that each member’s constitutional arrangement, as republic or monarchy, is purely a matter for each member country to decide.”\n\nThe scars of slavery run deep across the planet. It couldn’t be a more sensitive subject. Royals may have shied away from it in the past but Prince Charles now wants to talk about it and he wants the Commonwealth to be the platform. He wants to be part of the solution instead of a symbol of the problem.\n\nROYAL TEA BREAK\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prince Charles attend the CHOGM opening ceremony in Kigali. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nCharles and UK Prime Minister avoid awkward run-in during Rwanda trip.\n\nSpeculation has been rife in the past few days of possible tensions between Prince Charles and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Johnson’s government is pressing ahead with a policy to send some asylum seekers arriving in the UK to Rwanda for processing and possible resettlement. British newspaper the Times reported that the royal had described the plan as “appalling.” With a bilateral meeting between the two on the fringes of the Commonwealth leaders’ summit in Kigali in the cards on Friday, British media were watching to see if any of the reported tension was visible. However, hours before the event, Johnson made it clear that any conversation he might have with Charles would remain private. “I wouldn’t comment on anything that I say to the Queen or the Queen says to me. Nor will I say anything about what the heir to the throne might say to me or what I might say to him. And that’s never happened and Prime Ministers never talk about that and quite rightly,” Johnson told reporters on Friday morning. For its part, Clarence House said it won’t be commenting on any supposed remarks except to say the prince is politically neutral.\n\nJOIN THE TOUR\n\nAn emotional first day.\n\nPrince Charles arrived in Rwanda on Tuesday night – the first member of the royal family to visit the country. While he’s here to represent the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), he organized a series of engagements around the main event.\n\nThe first day of the visit was heavily focused on learning more about the 1994 genocide and included a journey to Nyamata Church, in and around which at least 45,000 people were massacred. A spokesperson for Clarence House said the royal couple were struck by how important it is never to forget the horrors of the past. But they were also “deeply moved as they listened to people who have found ways of living with and even forgiving the most appalling crimes,” the spokesperson added.\n\nWatch Max’s report:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bloodstained shorts and machetes: Prince Charles visits memorial to Rwanda genocide 03:04 - Source: CNN\n\nDON’T MISS\n\nCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall makes a speech as she attends a Violence Against Women and Girls event at the Kigali Convention Centre on Thursday. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nOne of Camilla’s strongest speeches yet.\n\nThe Duchess of Cornwall took center stage at the Commonwealth meeting on Thursday, as she pressed leaders to step up their efforts to prevent domestic violence. “There is power in this alliance. In the strength of our unity, we, the women and men of the Commonwealth, stand with victims and survivors, who, despite the temptation to hide away in silence, speak up so that others know they aren’t alone – whether in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Pacific or the Caribbean and Americas,” the future Queen said in her address. “In so doing, we have the opportunity to end gender-based violence and those laws and practices that discriminate against women. And each one of us must take personal responsibility not to let this opportunity be lost.”\n\nCarrie Johnson, the wife of the UK Prime Minister, was among the attendees at the Kigali Convention Centre. While there may be reported tensions between their husbands, the two seemed delighted to see each other. Johnson warmly greeted the Duchess when she came over to her table during the event, the pair appearing relaxed as they chatted and laughed together.\n\nWhile she is only here in the capacity of accompanying Prince Charles, the speech showed Camilla is already living up to her future title of Queen Consort and showing the same commitment to the Commonwealth as her mother-in-law.

Perhaps one that caught the public's attention the most was that of Queen Consort Camilla, and what to call her once King Charles III assumed the throne.\n\nThe queen said before her death that it was her \"sincere wish\" that Camilla, then Duchess of Cornwall, be called Queen Consort. Now, she's updating the royal tradition in her own way.\n\nBuckingham Palace said Sunday that Queen Consort Camilla is giving up the antique tradition of appointing \"ladies-in-waiting\" and has picked five of her close friends to be \"Queen's Companions,\" a new title with slightly different duties, in a modest sign of updating in the new reign of King Charles III.\n\nWhat's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?

On some occasions, a companion may attend an engagement instead of a private secretary.\n\nSome of the companions will be in attendance for the first time Tuesday when Camilla, 75, hosts a reception at Buckingham Palace to raise awareness of violence against women and girls as part of the UN 16 days of activism against gender-based violence.\n\nKing Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla make first joint engagement since queen's death\n\nHow does a queen's companion differ from a lady-in-waiting?\n\nNot that much; the new title mostly reflects the slight changes in the job description.\n\nThe job of lady-in-waiting to a queen, reigning or consort, dates back hundreds of years to the Middle Ages when ladies helped the queen with such tasks as bathing and dressing.\n\nRelated:Camila, Queen Consort, awards Booker Prize winner in London to author Shehan Karunatilaka\n\nBy contrast, there's no record of a \"Queen's Companion\" job, according to records (the palace checked).\n\nUnder the late Queen Elizabeth II, who kept the tradition when she became reigning queen in 1952, her ladies-in-waiting, known affectionately as \"Head Girls,\" accompanied her on engagements, helped her with her voluminous correspondence, and sometimes just sat with her and watched TV.\n\nAlso, the late queen always had a lady in attendance, so the job was full time. By contrast, the companions will only be on duty during engagements and they won't be helping with correspondence.\n\nMore:King Charles III welcomes S. African president for his first state visit as sovereign\n\nWill Queen Consort Camilla's companions get paid?\n\nYes, but only nominal amounts, to cover their expenses. Because they will be on duty less time than the ladies, they won't be as costly in the royal budget, but the difference is minimal.\n\nThe pay issue is mostly irrelevant anyway. Ladies-in-waiting (and now companions) usually were picked from the aristocratic, titled and wealthy classes of the United Kingdom.\n\nWho are Queen Consort Camilla's companions?\n\nAccording to the palace, Camilla's companions are: Fiona, the Marchioness of Lansdowne; Mrs. Jane von Westenholz; the Hon. Lady Katharine Brooke; Mrs. Peter Troughton (Sarah); and Lady Sarah Keswick.\n\nThey are all close friends of the new king and queen and are well known in posh circles in the United Kingdom. Troughton is related to the king through his Scottish grandmother, the late Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.\n\nLansdowne has been an interior designer with her own studio, Fiona Shelburne, for more than three decades. Brooke is the daughter of one of the late queen's former ladies-in-waiting, Lady Susan Hussey, who was with Queen Elizabeth for six decades and is also a godparent to Prince William, the Prince of Wales.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/11/01/king-charles-iii-talks-britain-kenya-violent-history-state-visit/71408435007/", "title": "King Charles talks Britain and Kenya's 'violent' history during visit", "text": "King Charles III acknowledged \"wrongdoings of the past\" from the British Empire's rule over Kenya in his first visit to a Commonwealth nation since ascending the throne.\n\nThe British monarch delivered a speech at the State Banquet held at the State House in Nairobi, Kenya, on Tuesday, discussing the U.K.'s relationship with the African nation.\n\nCharles first started by recalling poignant memories his family made in Kenya, including when his late mother Queen Elizabeth II \"arrived here in 1952 a princess, but left as queen\" after the death of King George VI and the moment in 2010 when Prince William \"proposed to his wife, now my beloved daughter-in-law\" Princess Kate.\n\n\"It is the intimacy of our shared history that has brought our people together. However, we must also acknowledge the most painful times of our long and complex relationship. The wrongdoings of the past are a cause of the greatest sorrow and the deepest regret,\" Charles said.\n\n\"There were abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence committed against Kenyans as they waged, as you said at the United Nations, a painful struggle for independence and sovereignty – and for that, there can be no excuse.\"\n\nThe British monarch said he plans to \"deepen my own understanding of these wrongs\" during his visit to Kenya and \"meet some of those whose lives and communities were so grievously affected.\"\n\nThough \"none of this can change the past,\" Charles said, \"by addressing our history with honesty and openness we can, perhaps, demonstrate the strength of our friendship today. And, in so doing, we can, I hope, continue to build an ever-closer bond for the years ahead,\" he concluded. \"As Jomo Kenyatta said, 'Our children may learn about the heroes of the past. Our task is to make ourselves the architects of the future.'\"\n\nBritain's colonial past in Kenya explained\n\nIn the age of colonialism, Kenya was one of the jewels of the British Empire. It was the starting point for an ambitious railway project linking the Indian Ocean coast with the African interior and the destination for thousands of white settlers who built coffee and tea plantations.\n\nBut the colonial administration also replaced Black leaders, pushed local people off their land and imposed crippling taxes.\n\nThat set the stage for the Mau Mau Rebellion of the 1950s, which hastened the end of colonial rule, but continues to cloud relations between the U.K. and Kenya. Colonial authorities resorted to executions and detention without trial as they tried to put down the insurrection, and thousands of Kenyans said they were beaten and sexually assaulted by agents of the administration.\n\nKing Charles takes monarchy's slave ties'profoundly seriously,' supports probe\n\nIn 2013, the U.K. government condemned the \"torture and ill-treatment\" that took place during the rebellion as it announced a 19.9 million-pound settlement with more than 5,000 victims\n\nKenya became independent in 1963, but the country has maintained close, if sometimes troubled, ties with the U.K.\n\nContributing: Danica Kirka and Evelyne Musambi, The Associated Press\n\nEarthshot Prize in NYC:Prince William says 'optimism' and 'hope' is key to climate reform", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/01"}]}

It’s “wide open”, said The Guardian, with several teams “capable of going all the way”. South Africa are the defending champions and “history strongly suggests” that it will be the Springboks or New Zealand who lift the trophy. France are “heavily fancied” too, along with Ireland, the Six Nations grand slam champions and the world’s No 1-ranked team. England, who were “soundly beaten” by South Africa in the final four years ago, have had a “far from ideal” build-up, with a first defeat by Fiji last month “regarded as a new low”.\n\nMany pundits have pointed to the wide-open contest between four teams – France, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa – who are “a cut above the rest”, said Benjamin Dodman on France24. Most analysts agree that France’s “2023 vintage is their best yet”, striking an almost “perfect balance” between the “French flair” of old and a “tighter, more disciplined” style.\n\nIf they don’t perform well, the pressure on France “could be inhibiting”, former England hooker Brian Moore said in The Telegraph. However, if they play well and the “groundswell of opinion in France supports them”, it could be a “very invigorating factor”. If France do make it, “I think they’ll win – although I don’t really like saying that”. Rarely has a host nation “felt a greater sense of approaching destiny”, said Robert Kitson in The Guardian, who tips France to beat South Africa in a “blockbuster final”. On a “highly charged” Saturday night in Paris, “are the hosts really going to be beaten?”.\n\nSouth Africa and the Rugby World Cup are “made for each other”, said Stuart Barnes in The Times. When it comes to the World Cup, they are the “most successful side in the world” and like New Zealand, “they have conquered the world on three occasions”. The Springboks “rise to the occasion” with a game plan that is “hard to beat”.\n\nIn a poll of the 80,000+ strong RugbyPass fanbase, rugby fans worldwide think “this will be New Zealand’s year”. It was by a “sizeable margin”, too, with the All Blacks being the “top team in a whopping 34%” of fans’ predictions. Former Scotland international Jim Hamilton, who is one of RugbyPass’ creative directors, believes there will be a repeat of the 2011 Rugby World Cup final, but France will “get their revenge” and win against New Zealand.\n\nDespite New Zealand’s record 35-7 loss to South Africa in August, All Blacks fans can “take heart from statistical modelling that has them as favourites” to win the World Cup, said economist Niven Winchester on The Conversation. According to Rugby Vision, an algorithm Winchester developed to “predict outcomes” for major rugby competitions, New Zealand have a “33.5% chance” of winning their fourth RWC title. The “next most likely champions” are South Africa (26.2%), France (20.6%) and Ireland (11.9%).\n\nWriting on the BBC, Opta’s Nick Bentley agreed that there are four sides heading into the tournament who are “almost perfectly matched” – and “then there are the rest”. Using thousands of data points and its AI supercomputer to simulate the Rugby World Cup 10 million times, Opta’s tournament predictor makes Ireland favourites with a 21.7% likelihood of lifting the Webb Ellis Cup, followed by France (21.4%), South Africa (20.5%) and New Zealand (20.2%).\n\nWinner betting odds\n\nPrices according to Oddschecker, as of 7 September 2023.\n\nNew Zealand: 10/3\n\nFrance: 7/2\n\nSouth Africa: 9/2\n\nIreland: 5/1\n\nAustralia: 14/1\n\nEngland: 16/1\n\nArgentina: 28/1\n\nScotland: 50/1\n\nWales: 50/1\n\nSee the full list at oddschecker.com\n\nSiya Kolisi captained South Africa to glory in 2019 (Image credit: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images)\n\nRugby World Cup fixtures and TV coverage\n\nThe entire Rugby World Cup will be broadcast live by ITV in the UK, with games shown on ITV1, ITV3 and ITV4.

It was a far closer game than it should have been, but the tie was enough for the USWNT to finish second in Group E and go through.\n\nThat’s the good news. The bad news is the USWNT is likely to face old nemesis Sweden in the round of 16. And they’re not playing like a team built for a deep run. In fact, if not for the near post, they’d be going home. Portugal's Ana Capeta unleashed a corker early in second-half stoppage time and it ricocheted off the post, saving the USWNT to play another day.\n\nDespite Rose Lavelle starting for the first time and Lynn Williams replacing Trinity Rodman, the USWNT had barely any spark. Instead, they were as lackluster as they’d been in the first two games, turning the ball over, making passes into empty spaces and not finishing the chances they did have. When a fire alarm sounded early in the second half at Eden Park, it seemed like a metaphor for this USWNT squad. — Nancy Armour\n\nWhen do the USWNT play next?\n\nThe Americans advance to the knockout stage of the World Cup with their 0-0 draw vs. Portugal, which means they’ll take the second seed out of Group E. That means their next game — likely against Sweden, a familiar foe — will kickoff at 5 a.m. ET on Sunday, Aug. 6. Get the coffee ready. (With its 7-0 shellacking of Vietnam, the Netherlands finished first in Group E.)\n\nUS-Sweden game: Will we see it in Round of 16?\n\nThe USWNT’s next opponent won’t be set in stone until Wednesday morning, but it’s likely to be a team the Americans have plenty of history with: Sweden.\n\nAs the runner-up for Group E, the USWNT will play the winner of Group G at 5 a.m. ET Sunday. Sweden currently leads group G and will close out group play Wednesday against Italy, which is second in the group. Sweden is a frequent opponent of the USWNT. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, the teams met in the opening game, the ninth time they’d played each other in a major world championship. The USWNT was embarrassed that match, losing 3-0.\n\nNext USWNT game? Americans must fix lack of urgency\n\nWhat the U.S. women are saying publicly better not be what they’re feeling privately.\n\nThe reaction to yet another lackluster World Cup performance, with similar mistakes to the previous two, was largely unbothered. They’re into the knockout rounds. How they got there, and how it looked, seemed beside the point.\n\nIf that isn’t a masterful acting job by the USWNT, if this is what they really think, then this team is irrationally confident.\n\n“Because I know this team and I know what we’re capable of,” Alex Morgan said when asked after Tuesday’s scoreless draw with Portugal why she expects anything different going forward. “Just because it hasn’t clicked every moment on the field and we’re not putting the goals in the back of the net doesn’t mean these aren’t the right players for the job. The confidence is there. Now we just have to prove it out on the field.”\n\nWell, yeah. Unless the USWNT finds a way to turn things around – fast – they’re making a very different kind of history than they came here intending. — Nancy Armour\n\nUSWNT vs. Portugal score, highlights\n\nAlthough there were no goals in USWNT vs. Portugal, check out the highlights here.\n\nWomen's World Cup groups, standings\n\nHere are the complete standings for the tournament.\n\nGroup E standings\n\nHere are the Group E World Cup standings.\n\nUSWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski responds to Carli Lloyd\n\nHere's what U.S. women's national team coach Vlatko Andonovski said in response to criticism from former captain Carli Lloyd:\n\n\"One thing I want to say is this team wanted to win this game more than anything else. They put everything they could into the preparation for this tournament. To question mentality of this team, to question their willingness to win, to compete, I think it’s insane. I’ve never seen this team step on the field and not try hard, not to compete. Everyone is entitled to opinion. They can say whatever they want. But I know how this team feels.\n\n\"We owned it. We know it’s not good enough. We’re not happy with our performance. We qualified for the next round. We’re moving on.\" — Nancy Armour\n\nUSWNT vs. Portugal replay\n\nYou can replay any match in full here. In addition, Fox Sports is airing a replay at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday.\n\nUSWNT starting lineup vs. Portugal\n\nThere were some lineup changes for USWNT vs. Portugal. Most notably, Rose Lavelle, the breakout star of the 2019 World Cup, started in the midfield. Lavelle has been hampered by a knee injury the last couple months but her play against the Netherlands in Game 2 last week was crucial. Also, Lynn Williams started at forward instead of Trinity Rodman. Here was the full lineup:\n\nUSWNT vs. Portugal stats\n\nHere's a look at the team stats from the 0-0 draw.\n\nStat USA Portugal Possession 43.80% 56.20% Possession lost in defensive half 34 53 Possession lost in middle third 94 102 Duels 125 126 Duels success rate 54.40% 45.20% Aerial duels 38 38 Aerial duels won 52.60% 47.40% Successful dribbles 10 8 Fouls won 12 14 Offsides 0 0 Corner awarded 6 1\n\nUSA vs. Portugal player ratings\n\nThe stats may show the USWNT holding a 17-6 shot advantage over Portugal, and this is another game in which a U.S. opponent were held without a shot on goal. However, anyone that watched the match would be able to tell you that the Portuguese troubled the U.S. from start to finish, seeing the game’s best chance end with Ana Capeta hitting the post deep in stoppage time.\n\nIt was a dispiriting and disappointing showing in which no player really looked like they’d been given a platform to be their best. If the USWNT is to go on and make history as the first team to win three consecutive World Cups, this has to be by far their worst performance of the tournament.\n\nHere’s a player ratings breakdown from a game in which no one looked particularly good.\n\n— Jason Anderson, ProSoccerWire\n\nRose Lavelle yellow card\n\nRose Lavelle was given a yellow card in the 39th minute for tripping Portugal's Dolores Silva. Lavelle will miss the round of 16 game for yellow card accumulation. She also got a yellow against the Netherlands.\n\nUSWNT yellow cards\n\nAlso receving yellow cards for the U.S. against Portugal: Forward Sophia Smith (52nd minute) and defender Naomi Girma (81st minute). Smith's came after a high knee from the forward bonked the head of a Portugal player. It is her first yellow card of the tournament.\n\nWhy Naomi Girma is essential to the USWNT at 2023 World Cup\n\nDespite making her first appearance with the USWNT just 15 months ago, Naomi Girma become indispensable to the defense, and her poise and vision make it seem as if she’s been with the team forever.\n\n\"She looked like she had three World Cups behind her,\" coach Vlatko Andonovski marveled after Saturday’s World Cup opener, which Girma started and played all 90 minutes. “She was so comfortable.”\n\nGirma disputes that, saying she was nervous before the game began. It was her World Cup debut, after all. Once the opening whistle blew, however, she felt a calm and confidence come over her. The setting might be the World Cup, but it’s still the same game she’s been playing since she was a little girl.\n\n\"As an athlete, playing at the highest level is something you always dream of. So for me, it's a dream come true,\" she said. \"Then for my parents, seeing their daughter play for the U.S., the country they chose, it fills them with a lot of pride. They're so happy. We all feel so grateful. — Nancy Armour\n\nCarli Lloyd calls USWNT's play ‘disappointing, uninspiring’\n\nTwo-time World Cup winner Carli Lloyd had some harsh words for the USWNT after the Americans’ 0-0 draw against Portugal. The tie allows the USWNT to move on to the knockout rounds, though the U.S. will do so as the No. 2 seed, which is a much harder path to the final.\n\nBut according to Lloyd, her former team isn’t headed for the championship game anyway.\n\n“Today was uninspiring. Disappointing. They don’t look fit. They’re playing as individuals and the tactics are too predictable,” Lloyd said on FOX Sports postgame show.\n\nShe reiterated some criticism she’s leveled at U.S. soccer since retiring in 2021, saying “the winning doesn’t matter as much anymore” as much as “a lot of the off the field things that are happening.”\n\n“It started to shift post 2020,” Lloyd said. “You never want to take anything for granted. You put that jersey on for everyone who came before you and everyone who came after, and give it everything you have. I’m just not seeing the passion. It was lackluster, it was uninspiring.”\n\nShe added the U.S. is “playing not to lose versus playing to win — Portugal played to win, and they almost did.”\n\nPushed for specifics about what off-field events she was referencing, Lloyd mentioned the USWNT’s pregame dancing.\n\n“Winning and training and doing all that you can do to be the best individual player, that’s not happening. We saw the dancing,” she said. “There’s a difference between confident and arrogance. Where is the direction going?”\n\nTuesday was hardly the first time Lloyd has been critical of the USWNT this World Cup. She ripped into the Americans at halftime of their Netherlands game, which ended in a 1-1 draw, and before kickoff against Portugal, she said star forward Alex Morgan should be benched. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nUSWNT World Cup history\n\nThe USWNT has won four World Cups overall and are going for their third straight and fifth overall. Here's a complete history of the tournament.\n\nFormer USWNT star Heather O’Reilly weighs in on criticism of Team USA\n\nHere's what the current Fox Sports analyst had to say about USWNT's performance in the group stage.\n\n“To remind everybody what happened in 2015: we got a good result in the first game, then we draw in the second game and then we stumble in our third game … There was so much chatter like, ‘are we going out early? Does this team have it?’ - but that doesn’t help. It doesn’t help the players, it doesn’t help the staff, it doesn’t help the football. We need to get behind the team. And in 2015, our backs were against the wall. We fought back, a couple tactical changes were made. We all know Carli Lloyd made history, but this team needs us to get behind them. They are a talented team. They've only given up one goal in three games.\n\n\"They're very defensive minded group, Vlatko Andonovski, he's conservative coach, so we have to embrace that. For us, it’s the next game. And just like this team - they survived and they advanced. They don't even care who they're playing. They don't care if it's Sweden, they don't care if they go one or two in the group. They're going to take care of business with the next opponent, and they have this crazy self-belief that they're going to move on.”\n\nWatch her comments in full here.\n\nUSWNT coach history\n\nVlatko Andonovski became the 10th head coach of the US women's national team in October 2019, succeeding Jill Ellis.

She scored and had assist in quarterfinal win over Netherlands at Tokyo Olympics. She won NWSL scoring title, MVP and league title in 2016. She co-hosts “Snacks” podcast with fellow USWNT player Sam Mewis.\n\nHometown: Fresno, California\n\nFresno, California Club: NJ/NY Gotham FC\n\nNJ/NY Gotham FC Age: 30\n\n30 Height: 5-7\n\n5-7 Caps: 52\n\n52 Goals / Assists: 15/12\n\nUSWNT press conference\n\nHere is what Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan, Lindsey Horan, Rose Lavelle and Kelley O'Hara had to say about the draw.\n\nUSWNT results\n\nThe U.S. women's national team played to one win and two draws in the group stage of the 2023 World Cup. Here's a look back at all their results so far.\n\nIs Portugal out of the World Cup?\n\nAlthough the Americans were disappointed in the draw, the Portuguese women were sent home with Tuesday’s final Group E result. Megan Rapinoe consoled Jessica Silva, who was sitting on the field with her head between her knees, distraught by the way things ended after her team fought for the chance to advance. It was Portugal’s World Cup debut.\n\n“I think we were the most competent team, and we leave with a bitter feeling,” Silva said. “… We are really very sad for the result, although proud of what we did, of having played like this against a team who have been world champions twice in a row. Look at us, don't forget about us, please realize what Portugal has achieved.”\n\n— Roxanna Scott\n\nMore late subs for USWNT, including Alyssa Thompson\n\nThe youngest player on the roster, Alyssa Thompson, and one of the USWNT’s veterans, Kelley O’Hara, subbed in for the USWNT during stoppage time, replacing Crystal Dunn and Alex Morgan. It is Thompson's first World Cup, and O'Hara's fourth.\n\nTrinity Rodman, Emily Sonnett sub in late for USWNT\n\nIn the 84th minute, the USWNT finally used some subs.\n\nTrinity Rodman and Emily Sonnett subbed in for the U.S. as Lindsey Horan and Lynn Williams went out.\n\nNaomi Girma hit with yellow card\n\nA rough game for the USWNT got rougher in the 81st minute as defender Naomi Girma was given a yellow card. The U.S. remains tied 0-0 with Portugal.\n\nMegan Rapinoe subs in for USWNT\n\nMegan Rapinoe, one of the most beloved players in U.S. soccer history and the star of the 2019 World Cup, subbed in for the USWNT in the 61st minute, replacing Sophia Smith.\n\nRapinoe, who plans to retire at the end of this season, is in a different role for the U.S. this World Cup, but she’s dangerous off of set pieces and experienced. This is her 201st appearance for the USWNT.\n\nYellow card for Sophia Smith\n\nSophia Smith got hit with a yellow card in the 52nd minute, after a high knee from the forward bonked the head of a Portugal player. It is her first yellow card of the tournament.\n\nFalse alarm at the 2023 World Cup\n\nEarly in the second half, an alarm started sounding in Eden Park stadium — but it turns out, it was a false fire alarm. Play continued, everyone in the stadium ignored the sound and after a few minutes, it stopped.\n\nUSAWNT 0, Portugal 0: Instant halftime analysis\n\nVlatko Andonovski made the two changes fans have been screaming for, starting midfielder Rose Lavelle and inserting Lynn Williams over Trinity Rodman at forward. But aside from a spark at the start, it did little good.\n\nThe USWNT was as lackluster as they've been the other two games, turning the ball over, making passes to empty spaces and unable to finish the chances they did have.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, Lavelle picked up her second yellow card, meaning she'll miss the USWNT's round-of-16 game. If the USWNT has a round-of-16 game.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nWhat happens if USA loses to Portugal?\n\nIf the USWNT loses to Portugal Tuesday, its World Cup is done. The Stars and Stripes will not advance to the knockout round with a loss. A tie would get them there, albeit as the second seed from Group E, which is a considerably harder path.\n\nIf Portugal upsets the USWNT, it would be historic — and not in a good way for the U.S. The USWNT has never, since the women's World Cup started in 1991 and Olympic play began in 1996, not made it through the group stage and to the knockout round. With the exception of 2016 Olympics, the Americans have reached semifinals or final at each of those tournaments.\n\nRose Lavelle gets yellow card — again\n\nRose Lavelle was given a yellow card in the 39th minute for tripping Portugal's Dolores Silva. That's brutal for the USWNT. If they make it through to the knockout rounds — no sure thing, with a 0-0 tie late in the first half — Lavelle will miss the round of 16 game for yellow card accumulation. She also got a yellow against the Netherlands.\n\nNetherlands vs. Vietnam score erases USWNT goal differential\n\nWith the Netherlands up 5-0 on Vietnam midway through the first half of the other Group E match (yes, you read that correctly), the advantage the USWNT team had in goal differential — a critical stat when it comes to figuring out seeding for the knockout round — has evaporated. That will make it very difficult for the U.S. to win the group even if they defeat Portugal.\n\nUSWNT game tonight\n\nThe Americans play their final group stage game Tuesday at 3 a.m. ET. They face Portugal.\n\nWhere to watch USA vs. Portugal\n\nAll 2023 World Cup games will be broadcast in the U.S. by Fox, on both its main channel and FS1. It’s also available to stream on FoxSports.com and the Fox Sports app. Spanish-language coverage will be on Telemundo.\n\nUSA women World Cup schedule\n\nThis will be the final group stage match for the Americans. If they advance to the Round of 16 they could play Saturday (if they win Group E) or Sunday (if they come in second). Here are the game times and potential opponents:\n\nSaturday, Aug. 5: Winner Group E vs. Runner-up Group G, 10 p.m. ET\n\nSunday, Aug. 6: Runner-up Group E vs. Winner Group G, 5 a.m. ET\n\nGroup G is currently led by Sweden and Italy, who finish group play Wednesday.\n\nUSA vs. Portugal predictions\n\nNancy Armour, columnist: I think the USWNT comes out flying, much like Australia did against Canada on Monday night, and tags Portugal for a couple of quick, easy goals. Portugal pulls one back in the second half, but the USWNT wins 3-1.\n\nLindsay Schnell, reporter: The USWNT is mad — mostly about how they played vs. the Netherlands. They’ll be on a mission to squash any talk about if the World Cup is just too much for them, and use their anger to fuel a furious start. I expect a 4-1 final, and probably a 2-0 — maybe 3-0 — lead at halftime. They’re out to a send a message.\n\nUSWNT scenarios\n\nHow can the USWNT advance in the knockout round with a win or draw vs. Portugal? We break down every scenario you can think of.\n\nUSWNT needs to be Portugal. It's no 'gimme' opponent.\n\nAUCKLAND, New Zealand — The United States women’s third group-stage game is usually for style points, not survival.\n\nNot at this World Cup.\n\nFor the first time since 2007, the USWNT goes into the final group game still needing to lock up its spot in the knockout rounds. As straightforward as the USWNT’s path to advance is – win or tie and they’re in – so, too, is what would be a catastrophic scenario for a team that’s one of the most successful in the world. In any sport. Men’s or women’s.\n\nLose to Portugal on Tuesday night, and the four-time World Cup champions will almost certainly be headed home. Never has the USWNT failed to reach the semifinals at a World Cup. Never have they bowed out in the group stage, at either the World Cup or the Olympics.\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full column here\n\nUSWNT fans take over New Zealand\n\nAUCKLAND, New Zealand — Did anyone stay behind in the States?\n\nAuckland was awash with USWNT fans ahead of the game, which kicks at 7 p.m. in Auckland. They were all over downtown, with faces painted and in gear that left no doubt about their allegiances. The trains to the stadium were filled with them. The concourses at Eden Park before the game, too.\n\nAnd when the USWNT players took the field for warmups, the cheer that went up would have blown the roof off at Eden Park — if it had a roof.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nMeet the USWNT kids: Charlie, Marcel and Madden steal the spotlight\n\nFor as popular as the USWNT is, there might be a subset of the team that’s even more popular: the children of the USWNT.\n\nThe 2023 World Cup roster has three moms, the most the USWNT has ever taken to a major event. And while Alex Morgan, Julie Ertz and Crystal Dunn have been incredibly successful on the pitch – combine all their accolades and they’ve got six World Cup titles, six Olympic medals and four U.S. Soccer player of the year awards – their kids sometimes get more attention and generate more headlines.\n\nRead Lindsay Schnell's full story here.\n\nMegan Rapinoe, USWNT are 'exactly where we want to be'\n\nAUCKLAND, New Zealand — Megan Rapinoe lives for these types of moments.\n\nThe USWNT can advance to the knockout rounds with a win or a tie over Portugal on Tuesday. Lose, however, and the four-time World Cup champions would almost certainly be knocked out in the group stage for the first time ever at a World Cup or an Olympics.\n\nThe pressure of that, the anxiety, the realization that losing would forever change the way people see this team − it would make most people want to puke.\n\nFor Rapinoe, it’s rocket fuel.\n\n\"It’s a pressure moment, and that’s what the tournament is now. Every single game from here on out is that pressure moment and that’s the best part of being at the World Cup,\" Rapinoe said Sunday, her eyes gleaming.\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full column here.\n\nWhat time is it in New Zealand?\n\nAuckland is 16 hours ahead of the East Coast of the United States. That means the game vs. Portugal will kick at 7 p.m. New Zealand time.\n\nHow old is Sophia Smith?\n\nThe USWNT forward is 22 years old and turns 23 on Aug. 10. In her World Cup debut vs. Vietnam, Smith scored two goals and tallied an assist.\n\nHow many World Cups has Alex Morgan played in?\n\nFour. Alex Morgan has been a staple of the USWNT since her debut on a snowy day in 2010.\n\nShe scored her first goal that fall and since then, she's scored 121 times for the Stars and Stripes and won back-to-back World Cups. The Southern California native was named a captain for this year's tournament where the team will attempt to make history with their third straight title. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nUSWNT World Cup wins\n\nThe USWNT has won four World Cups overall and are going for their third straight and fifth overall.\n\nIs Alex Morgan playing tonight?\n\nYes, the forward is in the USWNT’s starting lineup, and looking to add to her 121-goal total. Morgan missed a penalty kick in the opener vs. Vietnam.\n\nUSWNT jerseys and merch\n\nLooking for official the World Cup kits worn by Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and others? We’d recommend visiting the official U.S. soccer online merch store. Our favorite item is definitely the player bag clip — collect all of them and be the envy of all your friends.\n\nUSWNT suits\n\nThe Americans wore their custom menswear-inspired “business” suits again as they headed to Game 3 of group play vs. Portugal -- though Julie Ertz styled hers in the manner of Las Vegas Aces coach Becky Hammon, with a hoodie underneath her blazer.\n\nUSWNT watch parties near me\n\nLooking for a watch party for the U.S. women’s national team game against Portugal?

Check it out.\n\nUSWNT World Cup roster\n\nThe 2023 World Cup roster is one of, if not the, most diverse in U.S. women's soccer history.

The Americans, who won two of their four World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019, had spent all but 10 months at No. 1 since 2008.\n\nIt's also the USWNT's lowest-ever ranking.

The Australians are unbeaten in the World Cup with eight wins from eight matches and “have lost only two of their past 41 one-day internationals”, including their past seven against England.\n\nIt promises to be a “grandstand finale to a superb tournament”, said the BBC’s chief cricket writer Stephan Shemilt.\n\nEcclestone: ‘let’s put on a show’\n\nEngland spin bowler Ecclestone is the leading wicket-taker at the World Cup with 20 dismissals – and against South Africa in the semi-final she achieved her maiden international five-wicket haul. Alex Hartley, a World Cup winner with England in 2017, believes Ecclestone is “so good” that the 22-year-old “could play first-class cricket for a men’s side”. In this World Cup, “I have seen a whole new level from her in terms of mindset”, Hartley wrote in The Telegraph.\n\nEcclestone believes England are yet to play their best cricket in the tournament and she has urged her team-mates to “put on a show”, Sky Sports reported. “Obviously it’s a great feeling getting through to the World Cup final,” she said. “It’s something we’ve been working towards after we lost three games at the start so it’s great to get to the final and hopefully we can put on a show on Sunday.”\n\nJonassen: ‘It doesn’t get much bigger’\n\nAustralia are “relishing the chance to play the old enemy” in the final on Sunday, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported. Batting star Beth Mooney “hat-tipped” England’s effort in reaching the final after their bad start, but warned that the Aussies “do enjoy beating them to be honest – there is a huge rivalry there”.\n\n“We played them obviously in the first-round game and I think everyone was happy to have a bit of a break from them,” Mooney told AAP. “They fought their way to the final and kudos to them. But not much of what’s happening this tournament matters now because you’ve got to show up at the right time on Sunday.”\n\nPlaying in a World Cup final against England “doesn’t get much bigger”, said Australian spin bowler Jess Jonassen. “We know that England will come at us really hard and have some match-winners, but equally so do we. It’s a rivalry that’s entrenched not only in cricket, but also world sport.”\n\nPredictions: who will win the World Cup?\n\nEngland’s turnaround has been “remarkable”, but Australia have been “head and shoulders above the rest of the world in this format for several years now”, said Malik Ouzia in the London Evening Standard. “They won all three ODIs in convincing fashion during the Ashes this winter and England will have to be pitch-perfect to avoid a similar result here. Australia to win.”\n\nFour predictions have been made for the final by Harshal Singh Surya on Sports Unfold. Batting predictions include Australia’s Alyssa Healy to score more than 35 runs and England’s Danni Wyatt to score the most runs for her team. England bowler Sophie Ecclestone is also tipped to take two or more wickets. The ultimate prediction is for Australia to win the match.\n\nUK start time and live TV and radio coverage\n\nEngland fans will have to set their alarms for the Women’s Cricket World Cup final on Sunday 3 April, which starts at 2am BST.\n\nSky Sports has announced that it will make the final free to watch across the UK.

Others, including Ronaldinho, Luis Suarez, Sergio Aguero and Diego Forlan also made the tournament a pathway to international prominence.\n\nAmong the hundreds of players who will participate in New Zealand, many are already earmarked as rising stars, but standing out amid similarly credentialed players will provide the clearest endorsement yet of their talents.\n\nArgentina, which arrives at the tournament as favorites after winning the South American qualifying championships for the first time in 12 years, will attempt to win the U20 World Cup for the seventh time with the help of a number of high-profile players.\n\nStriker Giovanni Simeone, who was the leading scorer in the qualifying tournament with nine goals, is the son of Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone. The Atletico connection is strong, as Argentina will be captain by Angel Correa, and the dribbling playmaker is among the front-runners for the Golden Ball.\n\nBrazil, which was fourth in the South American qualifiers, made Corinthians forward Malcolm a late replacement in their qualifying campaign and he went on to feature in six matches and grab the attention of Barcelona, Chelsea and Juventus.\n\nGhana's Clifford Aboagye won the Bronze Ball in the 2013 tournament and returns for his second under-20 World Cup as a more mature and complete player, now playing in Spain for Granada. Aboagye's young teammate Godfred Donsah is already a highly sought-after young talent.\n\nCenter-back Niklas Stark was captain of the Germany team that won last year's European Under-19 Championships and is already well established with Nuremburg in the Bundesliga.\n\nThese are only a few of the players who could engage the public's attention over the next few weeks, but others are almost certain to emerge.\n\nIn the absence of 2013 champion France, which failed to qualify, a new champion will be crowned from a field of 24 teams. They include South American powerhouses Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay; African contenders Nigeria and Ghana; Germany, Austria and Portugal; the United States and Mexico — and the tournament will feature debuts for Myanmar and Fiji.\n\nAfter Argentina's six titles — the most-recent in 2007 — Brazil has won the tournament five times, most recently in 2011. Portugal has won it twice, but not since 1991. Russia, Germany, France, Spain, Yugoslavia, Ghana and France have all won a title.\n\nNew Zealand will host the tournament for the first time. Matches will be played at seven venues across New Zealand, most small by international standards, and at the onset of a winter which is typically windy, wet, bleak and cold — testing the resilience of players so far from home.\n\nOrganizers hope those stadiums will be full, but soccer remains a relatively minor sport in New Zealand — it has only one fully professional team, which plays in Australia's domestic league — and the tournament clashes with the final stages of the elite Super Rugby series.\n\nOrganizing committee chairman Dave Beeche has tried to fire interest, saying \"many of these players already have big price tags on their heads in the biggest clubs in Europe. Kiwis really shouldn't miss the chance to see the next Messi crowned in our stadiums.\"\n\nThe event will be played in the shadows of the turmoil gripping the sport on the other side of the globe, with leading FIFA figures among those arrested by Swiss police to face extradition to the U.S. on charges of corruption.\n\nFIFA vice president Jeffrey Webb, who chaired the FIFA organizing committee for the Under-20 tournament and visited New Zealand in February for the draw, was among the seven arrested in Switzerland on Wednesday.\n\nFootball New Zealand chief executive Andy Martin said local organizers \"continue to monitor the situation closely so that we can react appropriately\" but \"do not anticipate that these events will impact on the tournament.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2016/08/08/the-latest-14-gold-medals-await-athletes-in-rio-de-janeiro/88384978/", "title": "The Latest: April Ross baffled by Zika taunts", "text": "AP\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — The Latest from the 2016 Summer Olympics at Rio de Janeiro (all times local):\n\n1:15 a.m.\n\nAmerican beach volleyball player April Ross says she didn't even hear the \"Zika!\" taunts from the Brazilian fans and she isn't sure why they're yelling at her.\n\nThe chants directed at the Americans during the Olympics were loudest toward soccer goalkeeper Hope Solo, who posed for a picture wearing mosquito netting and holding bug spray. Similar but more intermittent taunts were directed toward the Americans at the Copacabana beach volleyball venue.\n\nRoss said after she and Kerri Walsh Jennings beat China on Monday night that she hasn't made any negative comments about Brazil or the Zika threat.\n\n\"Tell them they can stop doing that if they want to,\" she said.\n\nRoss she said she has gotten four mosquito bites since coming to Rio, \"but I'm not worried about it.\"\n\n___\n\n12:45 a.m.\n\nKerri Walsh Jennings and April Ross have cruised to 2-0 in the Olympic beach volleyball tournament.\n\nThe three-time gold medalist and her new partner, who was the silver medalist in London, beat China 21-16, 21-9 on Monday night. The Americans have one match remaining in the group stage, against Switzerland on Wednesday.\n\nWalsh Jennings and Ross have not quite clinched a spot in the knockout stage of the tournament, but they have guaranteed that they won't be eliminated in pool play.\n\nWalsh Jennings and former partner Misty May-Treanor never lost a set in winning gold in Athens and Beijing. They lost only one set in London, where they beat Ross and Jennifer Kessy in the championship.\n\nWalsh Jennings and Ross haven't lost a set in either match in Rio.\n\nA supportive crowd chanted \"U-S-A!\" and waved American flags for the duo, who played in the featured midnight timeslot for the second straight match.\n\n___\n\n12:40 a.m.\n\nThe French men's basketball team rebounded from a disappointing loss in its Olympic opener with a convincing 88-60 victory Monday night over China.\n\nFrance, one of the favorites to medal in Rio after finishing a disappointing sixth at the London Games, lost 87-66 loss to Australia in its first game.\n\nNando De Colo scored 19 points for France and sparked a 12-0 run in the second quarter to take a 40-21 lead and essentially put the game away. De Colo scored nine straight during the stretch.\n\nChina scored just nine points in the second quarter on 4 for 11 shooting from the field. The Chinese fell to 0-2 after losing 119-62 to the United States on Saturday.\n\nFour-time NBA champion Tony Parker scored 14 for France and added eight assists while Rudy Gobert blocked five shots.\n\nYi Jianlian scored a team-high 19 for China.\n\n___\n\n12:25 a.m.\n\nMichael Phelps has set his sights on a 20th gold medal by posting the second-fastest time in the semifinals of the 200-meter butterfly.\n\nPhelps went out strong in Monday night's race, and then backed off a bit in the final 50 to save his energy for Tuesday's final.\n\nHungary's Tamas Kenderesi surged to the wall first in 1 minute, 53.96 seconds.\n\nPhelps was next at 1:54.12, followed by Hungary's Laszlo Cseh and South African Chad le Clos, the defending Olympic champion.\n\nFour years ago, Le Clos pulled off one of the greatest Olympic upsets when he beat Phelps, who had the lead but glided too long on his finish.\n\nNow, it's time for the rematch.\n\n___\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nThey've really picked up the production value at the Copacabana beach volleyball venue for the midnight match with defending Olympic champion Kerri Walsh Jennings.\n\nIn addition to the usual rock and samba music that has been playing during the breaks since the Rio Games began on Saturday, organizers gave Walsh Jennings and her partner April Ross a professional wrestling-style introduction as Monday night turned into Tuesday morning.\n\nWith about 10 minutes before the start of the game against China, the stadium lights were darkened, replaced by searchlights that scanned the sand and the flashlights on fans' mobile phones. When the lights came on, the crowd broke into a chant of \"U-S-A!\"\n\nWalsh Jennings and Ross have been the marquee match in each of their first two scheduled appearances in Rio. The midnight local starting time is designed to maximize television viewership in the United States.\n\nThe gold medal matches will also be at midnight.\n\n___\n\n11:25 p.m.\n\nLilly King of the United States won her showdown with Yulia Efimova after plenty of the bad blood between the two over the Russian's doping record.\n\nAfter staring down Efimova in the ready room and giving her a look of disdain on the deck, King led all the way to take the gold with a time of 1 minute, 4.93 seconds.\n\nEfimova, who heard a round of boos and a few cheers during the introductions, settled for the silver in 1:05.50. The bronze went to another American, Katie Meili, at 1:05.69.\n\nKing was critical of Efimova being allowed to compete in the Rio Games after serving a previous 16-month suspension for doping and testing positive again this year for the now-banned substance meldonium. Possible sanctions over a second violation were put on hold while WADA does more research on the drug.\n\nKing didn't acknowledge Efimova during a raucous victory celebration. Finally, as the two were picking up their credentials at the side of the deck, King gave her rival a quick pat on the shoulder.\n\n___\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nThe United States has extended its domination of the men's 100-meter backstroke.\n\nRyan Murphy gave the Americans their sixth straight gold medal in the event, rallying on the return lap to win with a time of 51.97 seconds Monday night at the Rio Olympics.\n\nMurphy was fourth at the turn, with Australia's Mitch Larkin setting the early pace.\n\nLarkin couldn't hold on. China's Xu Jiayu surged to the silver in 52.31, while another American, David Plummer, stretched for the bronze in 52.40 — just three-hundredths of a second ahead of a fading Larkin.\n\nIt was quite a moment for Plummer, who finally made his first Olympic team at age 30. Now, he's got his first medal.\n\nThe Americans haven't lost the men's 100 back since the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\n___\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nGive another gold to the Iron Lady.\n\nHungary's Katinka Hosszu won the 100-meter backstroke at the Rio Olympics on Monday, adding to her world-record victory in the 400 individual medley.\n\nHosszu didn't set a world record in the back, but her time of 58.45 seconds was good enough for a second gold.\n\nKathleen Baker of the United States settled for the silver in 58.75, while Canada's Kylie masse and China's Yuanhui Fu tied for the bronze in 58.76.\n\nHosszu, whose nickname comes from her grueling schedule, sat up on the lane rope and made a heart sign in the direction of her coach and husband, Shane Tusup.\n\n___\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nSun Yang of China has defied those who complained about his doping past by winning gold in the men's 200-meter freestyle at the Rio Olympics.\n\nYang rallied from his customarily slow start to pass South Africa's Chas le Clos and hold off American Conor Dwyer, touching the wall in 1 minute, 44.65 seconds.\n\nLe Clos, who recently announced that that both of his parents are battling cancer, went out with a totally different strategy. He built a body-length lead over the entire field and tried to hang on. It nearly worked.\n\nBut Yang surged to the front, and Le Clos took silver in 1:45.20.\n\nDwyer claimed the bronze in 1:45.23.\n\n___\n\n11:05 p.m.\n\nMEDAL ALERT: Lilly King of the United States has won gold in the women's 100-meter breaststroke at the Rio Olympics. Russia's Yulia Efimova took the silver, and Katie Meili of the United States claimed the bronze.\n\n___\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nNovak Djokovic's Rio Olympics are over.\n\nThe 12-time major champion lost in doubles Monday, a day after he was eliminated in the first round in singles by 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin del Potro. After he and Serbian teammate Nenad Zimonjic fell 6-4, 6-4 to third-seeded Brazilians Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares in the second round, Djokovic confirmed that he won't play mixed doubles.\n\nThe world's top-ranked player is still seeking his first Olympic gold. He'll be 33 at the 2020 Games, and he said Monday that \"I really hope I will have another shot at the medal.\"\n\nDjokovic left the court in tears Sunday night after losing to a resurgent del Potro, whose ranking has fallen to 145th after three left wrist surgeries.\n\nDjokovic's only Olympic medal is a bronze in 2008 in singles.\n\n___\n\n10:45 p.m.\n\nMEDAL ALERT: Ryan Murphy of the United States has won gold in the men's 100-meter backstroke at the Rio Olympics.\n\n___\n\n10:35 p.m.\n\nMEDAL ALERT: Katinka Hosszu of Hungary has won the gold medal in the women's 100-meter backstroke, her second gold medal of the Rio Olympics. Kathleen Baker of the United States took the silver, while Canada's Kylie Masse and China's Yuanhui Fu tied for the bronze.\n\n___\n\n10:25 p.m.\n\nMEDAL ALERT: Sun Yang of China has won gold in the men's 200-meter freestyle at the Rio Olympics.\n\n___\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nMissy Franklin was a swimming star at the 2012 Olympics.\n\nShe couldn't even make the final of the 200-meter freestyle in Rio.\n\nFranklin endured another stunning disappointment Monday night when she finished last in her semifinal heat with only the 13th-fastest time among 16 swimmers.\n\nFranklin touched in 1 minute, 57.56 seconds, which was actually slower than her time in the afternoon preliminaries.\n\nAs a bubbly, 17-year-old high schooler, Franklin won four golds and a bronze at the London Games. But she's endured a mystifying loss of form since turning pro last summer, struggling just to qualify for two individual events and a relay at the U.S. trials.\n\nIn 2012, Franklin competed in seven Olympic events. Now, all she's got left is the 200 backstroke and a likely spot on the 4x200 free relay team.\n\n___\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nFAILED TO QUALIFY: Missy Franklin has failed to qualify for the final of the women's 200-meter freestyle at the Rio Olympics.\n\n___\n\n10:05 p.m.\n\nAustralian cyclist Melissa Hoskins was released from the hospital hours after a terrifying crash in training, and she still hopes to compete in the team pursuit competition later this week.\n\nThe team of Hoskins, Ashlee Ankudinoff, Georgia Baker, Amy Cure and Annette Edmondson were at race speed of nearly 60 kph (37 mph) when they clipped wheels Monday at the end of the back straight. Edmondson stayed on her bike as the other riders fell hard behind her on the banked wooden surface.\n\nHoskins was put in a back brace as a precaution and taken to a Rio de Janeiro hospital for an examination. Tests revealed no broken bones and she was released several hours later.\n\nAnkudinoff, Baker and Cure walked off the track and were treated for bruises and floor burns.\n\n___\n\n10 p.m.\n\nChina shot the ball so well against Senegal nothing helped the African nation, as it attempted to bounce back from a 65-point opening loss in women's basketball. Despite a small but enthusiastic section of stomping, clapping and singing fans, China rolled to 101-64 win.\n\nMengran Sun and Ting Shao scored 17 points each as China evened its record in group play.\n\nChina (1-1) scored the first 11 points of the game and looked ready to rout Senegal just like the Americans did Sunday. Senegal (0-2), still looking for its first Olympic victory, gave fans reason to cheer by pulling within 34-33 on a 3-pointer by Diodio Diouf with 4:41 left in the second quarter.\n\nThe Chinese went on a 9-0 run capped by a couple buckets by Nan Chen and led 47-38 at halftime. They led 73-53 at the end of the third and finished off the win after shooting 56 percent.\n\n___\n\n9:45 p.m.\n\nWorld record holder Chen Lijun pulled out of the men's weightlifting 62-kilogram class because of leg cramps, which opened the class for Oscar Albeiro Figueroa Mosquera of Colombia to win gold at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.\n\nChen says he pulled out during the snatch round after he found treatment on the cramp to be \"pretty useless.\"\n\nMosquera lifted 142 kilograms in snatch, 176 in clean and jerk and won gold with a total score of 318 kilograms. He was the silver medalist four years ago at the London Games.\n\nEko Yuli Irawan of Indonesia won silver — one spot better than the bronze he won in London, and Farkhad Kharki of Kazakhstan won bronze in his Olympic debut.\n\n___\n\n9 p.m.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic men's basketball team surged after a slow start, beating Venezuela 113-69 on Monday night as Carmelo Anthony passed Michael Jordan for third place on the Americans' career scoring list.\n\nThe game was tied at 18 after one quarter but the Americans soon took control and powered their way to a second straight win to start the tournament.\n\nPaul George scored 20 points and Jimmy Butler had 17 for the Americans. Anthony finished with 14, passing Jordan's total of 256 points late in the first half. Anthony now has 262 points and the four-time Olympian trails only LeBron James (273) and David Robinson (270).\n\nThe Americans play again Wednesday against Australia, which also is 2-0.\n\n___\n\n8:50 p.m.\n\nOne destroyed racket — and one poor set — later, Serena Williams is safely into the third round of the Rio Olympics as she bids for a second consecutive singles gold medal.\n\nThe No. 1-seeded American struggled for quite a while Monday night before emerging with a 7-6 (5), 6-2 victory over France's Alize Cornet.\n\nWilliams started off by taking the first three games, but then dropped five of the following six. During that troublesome stretch, Williams reacted to losing two games in a row by mangling her equipment, slamming it against the back of her sideline chair.\n\nLater, she was forced to erase a pair of set points for Cornet, who had won four of their previous seven matchups.\n\nBut Williams claimed the last three points of the tiebreaker, raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set and was on her way.\n\nNo tennis player ever has won two Olympic singles golds — let alone two in a row.\n\n___\n\n8:45 p.m.\n\nThere's another Savon in the boxing tournament with the hope of fighting for Olympic gold.\n\nErislandy Savon, the nephew of three-time Olympic gold medalist Felix Savon, opened with a unanimous decision victory in a heavyweight bout.\n\nFelix Savon won gold medals in 1992, 1996 and 2000, one of only three fighters to accomplish the feat. He's one of the all-time great Cuban amateur fighters.\n\nErislandy Savon said he was proud to represent his family and Cuba in the Olympics.\n\nThere's no gold around his neck yet, just in his mouth — he had gold-capped bottom teeth that weren't hit very much by British fighter Lawrence Okolie. Savon won 30-27 on the scorecards.\n\nHe had knocked out Okolie three months ago in the World Series of Boxing final. Okolie was proud he went from a tough defeat to a competitive bout against the same fighter in just six weeks.\n\n\"I faced those demons and I knew millions of people were going to watch that,\" he said.\n\n___\n\n8:25 p.m.\n\nThe International Judo Federation says Kosovo's first Olympic judo champion, Majlinda Kelmendi, may be facing sanctions in France for failing to comply with a drug test in June.\n\nDuring her training ahead of the Rio Games, Kelmendi apparently refused to comply when asked by the French anti-doping agency to provide an out-of-competition sample.\n\nThe IJF says in a statement that the procedure is being contested by Kelmendi and her coach but \"looks questionable at the level of the IJF.\" In an email, judo's governing body said that if there were to be sanctions leveled against Kelmendi — who won her country's first ever Olympic medal on Sunday — they would only apply in France.\n\nThe Kosovo Olympic team could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n___\n\n7:35 p.m.\n\nMEDAL ALERT: Australia has won the first gold medal for rugby sevens at the Olympics, beating archrival New Zealand 24-17 in the women's final Monday night.\n\nThe women's world series champions conceded an early try to Kayla McAlister but rallied with two tries before halftime and another two after the break to take a 24-5 lead.\n\nEmma Tonegato's early equalizer for Australia was contentious after she appeared to fumble as she crashed over in the corner but referee Alhambra Nievas awarded it after checking with both assistant referees.\n\nEvania Pelite scored in the corner on the stroke of halftime, moments after New Zealand star Portia Woodman was sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on.\n\nEllia Green and Charlotte Caslick scored for the Australians before New Zealand cut the margin with late tries from McAlister and Woodman.\n\nGhislaine Landry led Canada to the bronze medal, scoring two tries and landing four conversions in a 33-10 win over Britain.\n\n___\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nJapan is off to its best start in women's basketball in 20 years after routing host Brazil 82-66 Monday night for a second straight victory.\n\nThe Japanese didn't qualify in 2008 or 2012 and won only once in 2004. Now they are a win from matching their three victories in Atlanta when Japan went 3-5 and finished seventh.\n\nJapan led 47-33 at halftime. The Japanese built that lead to as much as 27 in the third before Brazil went on a 12-4 run to get within 66-47, giving the home fans a reason to roar and stomp their feet. Mika Kurihara ended the run with her 3 with 1:15 left in the quarter.\n\nBrazil never got closer than 16 the rest of the way, though fans stuck around and cheered to the final seconds.\n\nRamu Tokashiki, who plays for the WNBA's Seattle Storm, led Japan with 23.\n\n___\n\n7:20 p.m.\n\nBeach volleyball has been one of the top tickets at the Olympics, but the venue at Copacabana beach has been sprinkled liberally with empty seats.\n\nWith four matches per session, fans are apparently coming to see their favorite team and then leaving. Never was that more clear than Monday, following Brazil's three-set loss to Austria. With fans streaming out of the 12,000-seat venue, the public address announcer invited those staying behind to move down to better seats.\n\nAnother problem has been the late matches. Saturday's match featuring defending champion Kerri Walsh Jennings and her partner April Ross began at 12:34 a.m. Sunday morning. The times are set to draw maximum viewership in the United States, but the empty white seats look bad on TV.\n\nA day after getting stuck for 40 minutes in an athletes' village elevator before upsetting No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the Rio de Janeiro Games tournament's first round, del Potro was back on court Monday and produced a 6-3, 1-6, 6-3 victory over Portugal's Joao Sousa with the help of 16 forehand winners.\n\nThat match started 15½ hours after del Potro finished beating Djokovic in straight sets Sunday night. Earlier that day, the 6-foot-6 Argentine found himself trapped while trying to get from one floor to another — until getting rescued by countrymen competing in handball in Brazil.\n\nAsked if he took an elevator before facing Sousa, del Potro replied with a laugh: \"Not today.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Games website: http://summergames.ap.org", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/rugby-union/959327/eddie-jones-australia-come-back-to-haunt-england", "title": "Eddie Jones named Australia head coach: will he come back to ...", "text": "When Eddie Jones was sacked as England’s head coach last month, some assumed he’d move on to some “lavishly paid sinecure in the United States”, said Oliver Brown in The Daily Telegraph. Instead, the 62-year-old has “detonated a bomb under the Rugby Football Union” by announcing he’s “going home”. A “mere 40 days after his defenestration at Twickenham”, the Australian struck a five-year deal to replace Dave Rennie as Australia’s head coach.\n\nSo, “like Freddy Krueger in a tracksuit”, said Robert Kitson in The Guardian, Jones is set to return “to haunt English dreams”, starting this autumn at the Rugby World Cup in France, where there’s every chance England will face the Wallabies in the knockout stages. Australia, it’s true, are a struggling side, having been “decimated” by injuries in recent months. But if Jones has specialised at one thing in his career, it’s at “expertly springing the trap” against supposedly superior teams. He did this with Australia against New Zealand in 2003; with Japan against South Africa in 2015; and with England against the All Blacks in 2019. Should he repeat the trick in France, the RFU’s decision to sack him would immediately seem like “one of the all-time great corporate howlers”.\n\nJones is not to be underestimated, said Owen Slot in The Times. After he joined a beleaguered England in 2015, they “won 18 games in succession”, equalling the men’s world record for a winning streak in toptier international rugby. He’s bound to give the Wallabies a “bounce”, which is why the World Cup is such a mouthwatering prospect. But even if Jones is a success in the short-term, that doesn’t mean the RFU were wrong to sack him. Jones excels at turnarounds, but has never been as good at sustaining success. “He builds successful campaigns, he doesn’t build empires.” And last autumn it was abundantly clear that his “England empire had collapsed”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Becca Stanek", "Brendan Morrow", "The Week Us", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/07/26/olympics-2021-live-updates-day-4-womens-gymanstics-softball-gold/5379736001/", "title": "Tokyo Olympics live updates: Biles withdraws; US team wins silver", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nDay four at the Tokyo Olympics will be headlined by one of the most anticipated events of 2021 — the women’s gymnastics team final.\n\nAfter a not-so impressive qualifying round, Simone Biles left the U.S. women’s gymnastics team after struggling to land a vault after one rotation (see more on that below). Without its superstar, the team could not catch the Russian Olympic Committee, and finished with a silver medal.\n\nAn upset win for Alaskan teen Lydia Jacoby in the women's 100-meter breaststroke provided an early highlight in Tuesday's action.

She bailed out of an Amanar, one of her more difficult vaults, and instead struggled to land a much simpler (and lower-scoring) skill.\n\n\"After the performance that I did, I didn’t want to go into any of the other events second guessing myself, so I thought it was better if I took a step back and let these girls go out there and do the job and they did just that,\" Biles told reporters. \"I think tonight they get a gold medal from me in fighting cause they never gave up and they just showed the world what they’re capable of.\"\n\nShe told reporters that she was \"struggling with some things,\" and has gone to therapy and taken medication in the past to cope with high stress and pressure situations. She does not have any significant physical injury.\n\nBiles is qualified to compete in the individual finals for all four apparatuses as well as in the individual all-around finals. She will make decisions about those upcoming competitions on a day-by-day basis.\n\n\"I have to put my pride aside,\" she said. \"I have to do what’s right for me and focus on my mental health and not jeopardize my health and well-being.\"\n\n--Emily Adams\n\n56-year-old U.S. equestrian wins medal\n\nSteffen Peters, a 56-year-old equestrian rider, becomes the oldest U.S. Olympic medalist since 1952. U.S. gets silver behind Germany in team dressage. Peters has participated in four Olympic, winning a team bronze medal on two occasions (in 1996 and 2016).\n\nU.S. softball loses to Japan in gold medal game\n\nIt's deja vu for Team USA.\n\nAt the last Olympic softball competition in 2008, the U.S. lost 3–1 in the gold medal match against Japan. Today, they lost to the same opponent in the same game by the same score differential.\n\nJapan’s winning pitcher was 39-year-old Yukiko Ueno, also the victor in the 2008 game.\n\nThe Japanese team kept the U.S. scoreless, winning 2–0 on its home turf. Japan lost 2-1 to the U.S. on Monday in the finale of round robin play but won the game that counted, handing the Americans their first loss of this Olympics.\n\n--Emily Adams, Jeff Metcalfe\n\nU.S. women win silver in gymnastics team final without Biles\n\nTOKYO – The U.S. women needed to be perfect to erase the 0.8 lead Russia had going into floor, and they weren’t.\n\nGrace McCallum went out of bounds on her second tumbling pass. Jordan Chiles did the same and fell on her third pass. Chiles scored an 11.700 on one of her best events.\n\nSunisa Lee, an unexpected anchor on floor with Biles out, landed a mostly clean routine. While her score led the team, they had not done enough to make up the difference.\n\nCombined with Russia’s powerful tumbling, the U.S. women lost ground.\n\nRussia claimed gold with a team score of 169.528, while the Americans took silver with 166.096. Britain took bronze.\n\nThe win gave Russia its first ever gold medal in the sport and ended a streak dating to 2010 of the U.S. women winning every Olympic or world championship title.\n\nWithout Biles, the Americans didn’t have enough to remain atop the Olympic podium.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nTeam USA in second going into final rotation\n\nTOKYO – It will all come down to floor, where the U.S. women have an uphill battle to win a third consecutive Olympic gold.\n\nRussia took a 2.5-point lead into balance beam but counted two falls on the apparatus to lead by 0.8 going into the final event.\n\nViktoriia Listunova salvaged the rotation for Russia and was the only gymnast to score above 13, despite a wobble and a step forward on her dismount.\n\nThe Americans seized the opportunity.\n\nGrace McCallum led off, saving herself from a fall and scoring 13.666. Sunisa Lee cleanly made her connections and scored a 14.133.\n\nJordan Chiles, who had not been slated to compete on beam until Biles went out, looked composed throughout and switched up her dismount to a double pike, which she could stick more easily to score a 13.433.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nU.S. women move on without Biles\n\nTOKYO – With Simone Biles out of the competition, the U.S. women attempted to recover on uneven bars.\n\nGrace McCallum had a few mistakes – hitting her foot on the low bar – to score 13.700. Jordan Chiles, who was not originally slated to compete on the event and came in when Biles left, executed a clean routine and stuck her dismount.\n\nSunisa Lee, a favorite for an individual gold medal in the event, floated from one bar to the next seemingly effortlessly. Her routine scored a 15.400 to buoy the Americans after Biles’ sudden withdrawal.\n\n\"Simone has withdrawn from the team final competition due to a medical issue,\" USA Gymnastics said in a statement. \"She will be assessed daily to determine medical clearance for future competitions.\"\n\nThe Russians, meanwhile, were as consistent on bars as they were in team qualifying, giving them a 2.5-point lead halfway through the competition.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nSimone Biles out of team gymnastics event\n\nTOKYO – Simone Biles pulled out of the Olympic team final on Tuesday, leaving the competition after struggling to land a vault.\n\nUSA Gymnastics spokeswoman Carol Fabrizio confirmed to USA TODAY Sports that Biles would not compete in the remaining events.\n\nBiles left the competition floor moments after she struggled to land a vault that is second nature for her. On the team’s first event, she shockingly bailed on an Amanar – one of her more difficult vaults – and just barely landed a one-and-a-half.\n\nA visibly upset Biles talked with one of her personal coaches, Cecile Landi, and the team doctor, Marcia Faustin. Though she put on her grips to prepare for uneven bars next, she left the competition floor.\n\nWhen she returned, she took off her grips and put on her warm-ups.\n\nIt was unclear why Biles pulled out or if she was injured.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nTeam USA struggles in first rotation, Biles leaves floor with trainer\n\nGrace McCallum stepped out of bounds on her landing. Jordan Chiles stuck her vault, but barely scored higher than Angelina Melnikova – who did a less difficult vault. And, shockingly, Simone Biles – an Olympic and world vault champion – bailed on an Amanar, one of her more difficult vaults, and barely landed a one-a-half. Biles scored a 13.766, the lowest of anyone in this rotation.\n\nAfter the first, Russia leads by more than a point.\n\nPotentially even worse, Biles left the gym with the team’s trainer before the U.S. women rotated to bars.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nSimone Biles to compete second to last in team gymnastics final\n\nTOKYO — For the first time in years, a major international meet won’t end with Simone Biles’ routine.\n\nWith the Olympic team final set for Tuesday evening here, the United States’ qualifying second means a few things for the order of routines. Here’s a look at how the evening will go.\n\nFirst, all the gymnasts’ scores count. In qualifying, teams put up four on each apparatus and count the best three. Not here. Team final is three up, three count. So any mistake will count against the final score.\n\nIn qualifying Sunday, Russia took first, marking the first time since 2010 that the U.S. team finished anywhere other than first in any phase of Olympic or world championship competition.\n\nWith eight teams in the final, two will compete on each apparatus and rotate together. As the top two countries, Russia and the United States will go in Olympic order of events – vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise.\n\nDuring each rotation, the countries will alternate. So on vault, Russia will go first, then the USA, then Russia, and so on. Countries order their gymnasts from lowest to highest expected scores, so the best athlete on each apparatus goes last.\n\nRussia’s position as top qualifier means that its best gymnast – in this case, Angelina Melnikova – will close out the meet on floor.\n\nBiles, the defending Olympic and five-time world champion on floor, will go second to last.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nU.S. defeated by Great Britain in men's rugby sevens quarterfinals\n\nThe U.S. was defeated by Great Britain, 26-21, in the quarterfinals of the men's rugby sevens competition at Tokyo Stadium.\n\nThe U.S. had built a 21-point lead in the first half only to allow Great Britain to score 26 unanswered points for the win to advance to Wednesday's semifinals.\n\nThe tournament is not over yet for the U.S., which will play Canada in a placing game on Wednesday. The men's semifinal, bronze- and gold-medal games also all take place Wednesday.\n\nThe women's rugby sevens competition will kick off Thursday, with the U.S. opening against China at 9 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n\n-- Jim Reineking\n\nTokyo has record number of new COVID cases\n\nTokyo reported a record number of new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, four days after the opening ceremony at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe 2,848 new cases announced by government officials Tuesday eclipsed the previous record of 2,520 cases, reported on Jan. 7. Tokyo is under a state of emergency for the remainder of the Games.\n\nOlympic organizers, meanwhile, announced seven new cases among their stakeholders Tuesday -- including four residents of the Olympic Village and two athletes. None of the positive cases included Americans, according to a separate announcement by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nCarissa Moore wins gold medal in surfing's Olympic debut\n\nCHIBA, Japan – American Carissa Moore, the top-ranked women’s surfer in the world, found a new way to validate her spot at the apex of the sport.\n\nShe won an Olympic gold medal – the first for women's surfing.\n\nWith the sport making its Olympic debut at the Tokyo Games, Moore defeated Bianca Buitendag of South Africa on Tuesday in the gold medal match at Tsurigasaki Surfing Beach.\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nU.S. women's basketball team defeats Nigeria in Olympic opener\n\nTOKYO — For the first time in a long time, the U.S. women’s basketball team came to the Olympics dogged by some doubts.\n\nNot about whether it would fall short of a gold medal, which is still in the realm of believe-it-when-you-see-it. But the stress level it might take to get there is an open discussion for Team USA, which has six first-time Olympians, relies heavily on a 40-year-old and a 39-year-old and didn’t exactly look primed for a historically dominant run during its training camp in Las Vegas.\n\nBased on Tuesday’s 81-72 win over Nigeria in its Olympic opener, those questions are still valid.\n\n-- Dan Wolken\n\nU.S. shooting team wins fourth Olympic medal\n\nTOKYO — The U.S. shooting team is having a standout performance at the Olympics.\n\nWilliam Shaner got things started at the Asaka Shooting Range when he won gold in the 10-meter air rifle on Sunday. Shaner’s 251.6 broke an Olympic record.\n\nThe record-breaking gold medal shooting performances didn’t stop there.\n\nA day later, Amber English and Vincent Hancock won gold in the women and men’s skeet shooting.\n\nEnglish set an Olympic record with 56 hits. Hancock, who is good friends with English, won gold on the same day, setting a men’s Olympic record with 59 hits.\n\nThree golds and three Olympic records in the matter of two days. No pressure for Mary Tucker and Lucas Kozeniesky who proceeded the three in the 10-meter air rifle mixed team competition on Tuesday.\n\nTucker and Kozeniesky qualified for the gold match after two stages of competition, finishing the series with a score of 418.0. The American duo only trailed China’s Qian Yang and Haoran Yang, who had a total of 419.7, heading into the gold-medal match.\n\nIn the battle for gold, the Chinese shooters were incredibly accurate. The pair didn’t have a single individual shot score below a 9.8. The Chinese team’s accuracy through the rounds was too much for the Americans to overcome, as they defeated the American duo 17-13 to win the gold medal.\n\nTucker and Kozeniesky were awarded the silver to give U.S. shooting four overall Olympic medals.\n\n“U.S. shooting is improving in all of our aspects and we are becoming a better team,” Tucker said. “We’re winning medals together. I hope this keeps getting people interested in the sport. There isn’t a lot of interest in shooting in the U.S. Hopefully us bringing our medal count to four, and we still got a week to go – hopefully that will help.”\n\n-- Tyler Dragon\n\nU.S. wins first medal in women’s synchronized 10-meter platform\n\nTOKYO — The American diving duo of Delaney Schnell and Jessica Parratto took silver in the women’s synchronized 10-meter platform on Tuesday, marking the first time the U.S. has medaled in the Olympic event.\n\nSchnell, 22, and Parratto, 27, finished with 310.80 total points, which was 52.98 points behind first-place China and 11.1 points ahead of third-place Mexico. Since the event was introduced at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, China has taken gold at each subsequent Summer Games.\n\n-- Olivia Reiner\n\nCaroline Marks unable to secure bronze in surfing\n\nCHIBA, Japan — American Caroline Marks, at 19 the youngest qualifier in the women's Olympic surfing competition, missed out on a chance to win a bronze medal Tuesday.\n\nMarks, a native of Florida, lost to Amuro Tsuzuki of Japan at Tsurigasaki Surfing Beach in the bronze medal match.\n\nEarlier in the day, Marks won her quarterfinals heat against Brisa Hennessy of Costa Rica. She then lost to Bianca Buitendag of South Africa, relegating her to the bronze-medal matchup.\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nCanada wins its first-ever Olympic medal in softball\n\nCanada defeated Mexico, 3-2, in the bronze-medal game in softball to capture the country's first-ever Olympic medal in the sport.\n\nCanada opened the scoring in the second inning on a two-out, two-run single by Emma Entzminger. After Mexico tied the game in the top of the fifth inning, Canada got the winning run in the bottom half of the inning on a sacrifice fly by Kelsey Harshman that scored Janet Leung.\n\nThe United States will face Japan in the gold-medal game Tuesday at 7 a.m. ET (on NBC Sports Network). In 2008, the last time softball was competed at the Olympics, Japan defeated the U.S. in the gold-medal game. Before that setback, the U.S. had won three straight gold medals dating back to the sport's Olympics debut in 1996.\n\n-- Jim Reineking\n\nNaomi Osaka stunned in third round by Marketa Vondrousova\n\nTOKYO – Two things seemed clear through the first two days of Naomi Osaka’s quest to win an Olympic gold medal. The first was how much it meant to her to be representing Japan, which bestowed her the honor of lighting the Olympic flame at the Opening Ceremony. The second was that her tennis seemed up to the occasion.\n\nBut that’s the amazing thing about sports. Everything we think we know can change in the blink of an eye.\n\nJust like that, Osaka’s run is over after a shocking 6-1, 6-4 loss to Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic, continuing the trend of high seeds bowing out early in the women’s singles draw.\n\nBased on nearly every factor imaginable, it would have been hard to see this coming. Vondrousova, a 22-year old lefty, surprisingly made the French Open final in 2019 but has just one WTA title to her name. Her form lately has been inconsistent at best, having fallen to No. 42 after a stint in the top 20.\n\nThis was Osaka’s first tournament since withdrawing from the French Open, citing the need to take a break for her mental health. Her focus now will turn to defending her U.S. Open title later this summer, but in many ways, her entire year had been built around trying to win a gold medal in Tokyo.\n\nNow that dream is gone, opening up the field reminiscent of the 2016 Olympics when longshot Monica Puig took gold.\n\n-- Dan Wolken\n\nAmerican surfer Carissa Moore to go for gold\n\nAmerican surfer Carissa Moore will compete for an Olympic gold medal Tuesday after winning her semifinals heat.\n\nMoore, a four-time world champion, defeated Amuro Tsuzuki of Japan by a thin margin.\n\nShe will face South Africa’s Bianca Buitendag, who defeated American Caroline Marks in the other semifinals heat.\n\nThe top-ranked women’s surfer in the world, Moore, 28, entered the competition as the favorite.\n\nEarlier in the day, she won her quarterfinals heat against Silvana Lima of Brazil.\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nAmerican surfer Caroline Marks to vie for bronze\n\nAmerican surfer Caroline Marks will compete for an Olympic bronze medal Tuesday after coming up short in her semifinals heat.\n\nMarks, 19, lost to Bianca Buitendag of South Africa at Tsurigasaki Surfing Beach.\n\nMarks, a native of Florida, will face the loser of the semifinals heat between fellow American Carissa Moore, a four-time world champion, and Amuro Tsuzuki of Japan.\n\nEarlier in the day, Marks won her quarterfinals heat against Brisa Hennessy of Costa Rica.\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nSURFING AT THE OLYMPICS:Everything you need to know about new Olympic sport\n\nAlaska's Lydia Jacoby wins women's 100 breaststroke, teammate Lilly King gets bronze\n\nTOKYO – Alaskan teen Lydia Jacoby pulled off the upset in the women’s 100-meter breaststroke, becoming the first American woman to win gold in swimming in these Olympics.\n\nShe beat U.S. teammate Lilly King, who was chasing her second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the breast.\n\nJacoby won in 1:04.95 followed by Tatjana Schoenmaker from South Africa and King, who took bronze.\n\nKing, 24, brashly predicted at last month’s U.S. Olympic trials that American women could win every individual race at these Olympics.\n\nShe also famously called out Russia’s twice-suspended Yulia Efimova, slapping the water in celebration after defeating her in Rio in 2016.\n\n-- Christine Brennan\n\nU.S. to play Great Britain in men's rugby quarterfinals\n\nThe U.S. men's rugby team fell to South Africa 17-12 to finish second in Pool C after posting a 2-1 record in round-robin play.\n\nThe U.S. will play Great Britain in the quarterfinals Tuesday at 5 a.m. ET (on NBC Sports Network). Great Britain won silver in the 2016 Olympics, which marked the return of rugby sevens to the Olympic docket after 92 years.\n\nThe other quarterfinal matches are New Zealand-Canada (4:30 a.m. ET), South Africa-Argentina (5:30 a.m. ET) and Fiji-Australia (6 a.m. ET).\n\nFiji are the reigning gold medal winners. The U.S. did not qualify for the quarterfinals in 2016.\n\n-- Jim Reineking\n\nNo back-to-back golds for Ryan Murphy in men's 100 backstroke\n\nTOKYO — Ryan Murphy fell short of his goal of repeating as Olympic champion in the men's 100 meter backstroke as Russian Olympic Committee swimmers Evgeny Rylov (51.98 seconds) and Kliment Koleskinov (52.00) took gold and silver ahead of him on Tuesday.\n\nMurphy swam a 52.19 to claim bronze, despite entering the final with the top time of 52.24, five one-hundredths of a second ahead of Koleskinov.\n\nThe University of California-Berkeley graduate also won gold in the 200-meter back and the 4x100 medley relay in Rio, his first Olympics. He can still repeat in the 200-meter backstroke as qualifying heats begin on Wednesday.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nUSA's Regan Smith earns bronze in women's 100 backstroke\n\nTOKYO – American Regan Smith, the former world-record holder in the women’s 100 backstroke, won the bronze medal Tuesday morning at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre\n\nCurrent world-record holder Kaylee McKeown of Australia won gold in 57.47 seconds followed by Canadian Kylie Masse in 57.72. McKeown's time was an Olympic record.\n\nSmith was third in 58.05.\n\nSmith, 19, one of 11 teenagers on the U.S. Olympic swimming team, the most since 1996, set the Olympic record in qualifying Monday in 57.86 seconds. She was the third swimmer to do it here, following Masse and McKeown. They are the only three swimmers in history to break 58 seconds.\n\n-- Christine Brennan\n\nRoss/Klineman cruise in beach volleyball\n\nTOKYO – The second-seeded U.S. women’s beach volleyball duo of April Ross and Alix Klineman remain undefeated (2-0) in pool play at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe pair easily defeated Liliana Fernandez Steiner and Elsa Baquerizo McMillan of Spain in straight sets under rainy and windy conditions at Shiokaze Park.\n\n\"When it's windy you have to play a little lower, there's just details you have to change. You can't play the same way you always play, but it's part of beach volleyball. We're used to it.\" Baquerizo McMillan said.\n\nBut the Spaniards' preparation for the poor weather did not meet their match.\n\nThe Americans took the first set 21-13 on a statement ace by Ross, just as the rain was starting to pick up. The drizzle continued through the second set, but the U.S. pair finished off the game with a 21-16 set.\n\nNext up, Ross and Klineman will face Sanne Keizer and Madeleine Meppelink of the Netherlands on Friday.\n\n-- Alex Ptachick\n\nUS track coach gets lifetime ban for sexual, emotional misconduct\n\nTOKYO – Track coach Alberto Salazar has been permanently banned by the U.S. Center for SafeSport for sexual and emotional misconduct.\n\nSalazar has 10 days to appeal the decision, which was handed down Monday. The SafeSport center does not reveal details of investigations.\n\nIn 2019, a handful of runners, including Mary Cain, Kara Goucher and Amy Yoder Begley, revealed that they had been emotionally and physically abused while working with Salazar as part of the Nike Oregon Project team.\n\nIn January 2020, SafeSport temporarily banned Salazar. The decision Monday makes it a permanent ban, pending any appeal.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nAwesome images of teen's title-winning performance\n\nAt the age of 13, Momiji Nishiya made history on Monday as Japan’s youngest Olympic champion when she won the gold medal in the women's street skateboard competition.\n\nNishiya edged another 13-year-old, Rayssa Leal from Brazil, at the Ariake Urban Sports Park. USA TODAY Sports looks back on this historic performance with seven memorable photos of Nishiya's successful quest for gold.\n\nBermuda smallest country to ever win gold after triathlon win\n\nFlora Duffy made history by winning gold in the women's triathlon Tuesday as she made Bermuda the least-populated nation to ever win an Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe win also made Duffy the first person from Bermuda to win a medal of any kind at the Olympics since Clarence Hill in 1976. Bermuda has an estimated population of 63,903, according to World Bank. For reference, the entire population would be able to fit inside the 65,000 seat Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.\n\nDuffy broke the record held by Liechtenstein, who won gold in the 1980 Winter Olympics in alpine skiing.\n\nDuffy held on to the victory with a time of 1:55:36. She beat out silver medalist Georgia Taylor-Brown of Great Britain, who finished with 1:56:50. Katie Zaferes of the U.S. won bronze with a time of 1:57:03.\n\nGrace McCallum replaces Jordan Chiles in U.S. women's gymnastics lineup\n\nThis is the Olympics of the unexpected, and that includes the U.S. women’s gymnastics lineup for Tuesday's team final.\n\nGrace McCallum will compete on uneven bars and balance beam rather than Jordan Chiles, despite Chiles scoring higher on both events all year. The surprise move follows Chiles’ struggles in qualifying, as the Americans finished second for the first time since the 2010 world championships.\n\nMcCallum and Simone Biles will compete on all four events while Chiles will do vault and floor exercise and Suni Lee will do uneven bars and balance beam. Teams must count all three scores on each event, meaning the choice of McCallum over Chiles is not insignificant.\n\nChiles had been the most dependable of the U.S. women this year, not counting a single fall in her first four meets. That’s 32 events, for those keeping track. She outscored McCallum on both bars and beam at the U.S. Classic in May, Day 1 of the U.S. championship and both days of Olympic trials.\n\nBut Chiles had a rough day in qualifying, falling twice on beam and dragging her feet across the mat during uneven bars. The Americans dropped her score on each of those events.\n\nThe lineup decision will put additional scrutiny on national team coordinator Tom Forster, who initially said the selection committee would use scoring potential to choose the Tokyo team. But he went in rank order instead, selecting McCallum over Skinner despite Skinner giving the U.S. a higher-scoring team.\n\nAsked to explain his reasoning, Forster said the gold medal wasn’t going to be decided by tenths of a point.\n\n\"Our athletes are so strong that I don’t think it’s going to come down to tenths of a point,\" he said last month. \"We didn’t feel like it was worth changing the integrity of the process simply for a couple of tenths.\"\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nSurfing finals condensed thanks to typhoon forecast\n\nThe first-ever Olympic surfing competition has faced challenges from Mother Nature throughout the qualifying rounds, and the finals are now being condensed due to volatile weather and surf conditions.\n\nTokyo organizers made the decision to run both the men's and women's finals back to back on Tuesday morning rather than running one final Tuesday and one Wednesday,\n\nSo far, waves have been few and far between for the Olympians competing in Tsurigasaki, Japan, but an impending typhoon is likely to provide better surf conditions on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Kurt Korte, the official forecaster for the Olympic surfing competition, the storm is expected to stir up waves up to seven feet high, but high wind speeds could lead to overly-choppy waters. The surf is expected to die down by Wednesday in Japan, so the surfing competition is taking advantage of the small but promising window to give athletes a competitive final.\n\n-- Emily Adams", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/rugby-union/954777/rugby-union-scotland-england-victory", "title": "Rugby union: Scotland's morale-boosting victory over the Wallabies ...", "text": "Scotland were one of the surprise packages of this year’s Six Nations, beating both England and France away from home, said Alasdair Reid in The Times. And on Sunday, Gregor Townsend’s side proved those wins “were no flashes in the pan” by battling to a 15-13 victory against Australia.\n\nThe match was too error-strewn to be a classic, said Michael Aylwin in The Guardian, but it contained plenty of drama. Scotland’s two debutants, hooker Ewan Ashman and flanker Josh Bayliss, were especially impressive, said Richard Bath in The Daily Telegraph. Indeed, 21- year-old Ashman – called into action in the tenth minute – was responsible for the afternoon’s stand-out moment: a wonderful, twisting try in the corner to give his team a crucial lead in the second half.\n\nHis performance personified Scotland’s overall effort: “assured, confident, and doggedly hanging in there when things got tough”. The team can’t rest on their laurels, as they now face world champions South Africa.

Last week they dismantled Tonga 69-3, their standout performer being another young substitute: 22-year-old Harlequin fly-half Marcus Smith, who came on for the final 28 minutes and scored one of his team’s 11 tries.

Hamas’ armed wing posted video purporting to show its fighters emerging from tunnels and firing rockets at Israeli tanks east of Gaza City.\n\nLess than a week after launching a modified ground incursion from three fronts, Israeli forces have made considerable headway. “We are located at the gates of Gaza City,” said Brig Gen. Itzik Cohen, commander of the 162nd Armored Division.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis intensified and the war's combined death toll reported by Palestinian and Israeli authorities climbed above 10,000, but in a rare peaceful development, Egypt allowed hundreds of foreign passport holders and dozens of seriously injured Palestinians trapped in Gaza to flee through the Rafah crossing.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said multiple Americans left Gaza and others are expected to follow suit in the coming days, but did not specify how many made it out. Department spokesman Matthew Miller said about 400 U.S. citizens are seeking to leave the territory, and along with their family members, the total trying to exit is close to 1,000.\n\n“We do expect to be able to get all our Americans out. It will take time,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “This was the first step.”\n\nContributing: Michael Collins\n\nDozens killed in Israeli airstrike:Hamas commander among the dead in Gaza\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Connectivity was gradually being restored after civilians in Gaza faced another major cut to communications and internet services, according to Paltel, the main telecommunications provider. Internet and communication services have been repeatedly interrupted in Gaza and humanitarian aid agencies have warned that blackouts severely disrupt their work.\n\n∎ After being interrupted by a protester calling for a cease-fire during a fundraiser in Minneapolis, President Joe Biden said there should be a humanitarian halt of the war. “I think we need a pause,” Biden said in response. “A pause means give time to get the prisoners out.”\n\n∎ Jordan, an important U.S. ally in the region, recalled its ambassador from Israel and told Israel’s ambassador to remain out of the country because of the war \"and the humanitarian catastrophe it is causing,” Deputy Prime Minister Ayman al-Safadi said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to travel to Jordan on Friday after first meeting with Israeli officials.\n\n∎ The government of Cyprus said it is working toward sending ships loaded with medical supplies, food and clothing to Gaza after its president, Nikos Christodoulides, got the OK on Tuesday during a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n∎ U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “is appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza,” including the killing of Palestinians by Israeli airstrikes in the Jabaliya refugee camp Tuesday and Wednesday, his spokesman said.\n\n∎ The Palestinian death toll has reached 8,805, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, 130 Palestinians have been killed, authorities there said. More than 1,400 Israelis have died, most of them civilians killed in the first hours of the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage, Israeli authorities say. About 240 people were taken hostage.\n\nInside an American family's fight:Family desperate to free their loved ones held hostage by Hamas\n\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency reports 70 staff members dead\n\nIn a report issued Wednesday, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNWRA, said the number of its workers killed in Gaza rose to 70.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, three additional UNRWA staff have been killed, bringing the total to 70 UNRWA colleagues killed since 7 October,\" the report states.\n\nUNWRA also reported that more than 690,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering in 149 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip. The agency reiterated that available aid remains insufficient and providing humanitarian assistance continues to be a challenge due to lack of fuel, ongoing bombardment, and widespread destruction of infrastructure.\n\nUNRWA’s Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, crossed into Gaza on Wednesday and met with Palestinians and aid groups. In a statement that followed, Lazzarini called for a humanitarian ceasefire and \"urgent\" fuel deliveries to Gaza.\n\n“Our calls are falling on deaf ears. A humanitarian ceasefire is long overdue,\" Lazzarini said. \"Without it, more people will be killed, those who are alive will endure further losses, and the once vibrant society will be in grief, forever.\"\n\nPalestinian dual nationals, the injured among Gaza escapees\n\nAmong those escaping Gaza through Egypt were 335 foreign passport holders, mostly Palestinian dual nationals but also some foreigners, according to Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority. In addition, 67 critically wounded Palestinians and their companions were evacuated for treatment, and some personnel from aid organizations got out as well, Abu Omar said.\n\nEgypt is concerned about taking in Palestinian refugees whom Israel might not allow back after the war, and also about a mass exodus from Gaza that could bring Hamas members and other extremists to its population. Egypt has supported Israel's blockade of Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007.\n\nMore than 2 million Palestinians remain trapped in Gaza, many exposed to the Israeli airstrikes that followed the brutal attack by Hamas militants on Israeli border communities Oct. 7.\n\n\"The situation in shelters remains critical, with very limited assistance available and no additional space to accommodate the increasing number of internally displaced people,\" the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees said in a statement.\n\nThe UNRWA said more than 670,000 Palestinians living in about 150 UNWRA shelters across Gaza are \"facing deteriorating humanitarian conditions and health and protection risks.\" The organization itself is grappling with extreme danger, saying 70 of its workers have died in the war.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes target refugee camp for second day\n\nIsraeli airstrikes again hit apartment buildings in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a Hamas stronghold near Gaza City, causing an undetermined number of deaths and injuries, the Hamas-run government said. The Israeli military said it had \"significantly expanded\" ground operations in the area.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in a tweet it \"eliminated'' Muhammad A'sar, describing him as the chief of Hamas’ anti-tank missile unit in Gaza and the leader of attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians.\n\nWednesday's assault came a day after a flurry of Israeli airstrikes on Jabaliya caused dozens of casualties, flattened apartment buildings and killed what the Israeli military said was a Hamas commander and numerous militants who had established headquarters in the camp. The buildings tumbled when Hamas tunnels beneath them collapsed, Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing Wednesday.\n\n\"These once again demonstrate how murderous terrorists use civilians as a ‘human shield,’ civilians whom we have called upon to evacuate for their own safety,\" Hagari said.\n\nThreats against Jews, Arabs and Muslims up since war started\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday's arrest of a Cornell University student for threatening Jewish students illustrated Justice Department coordination with local law enforcement to combat hate crimes.\n\nPatrick Dai, 21, of Pittsford, N.Y., was charged with posting threatening messages in an online discussion calling for the deaths of Jewish people. One post said “gonna shoot up 104 west,” referring to a dining hall that caters predominantly to Kosher diets located next to the Cornell Jewish Center.\n\nGarland noted a “significant increase in the volume and frequency” of threats against Jewish, Arab and Muslim communities nationwide since the start of the Israel-Hamas war Oct. 7.\n\n“As this arrest shows, we are focusing our efforts on confronting and disrupting illegal threats wherever they arise,” Garland said Wednesday at a Washington seminar for a program he initiated called “United Against Hate.” “The Justice Department has no tolerance for violence or unlawful threats of violence fueled by antisemitism or Islamophobia.”\n\nKristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, said reported hate crimes remain at the highest levels in more than a decade. Prosecuting the cases is a top priority, and more than 80 defendants have been charged since January 2021, she said.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nReporters Without Borders files war crimes complaints against both sides\n\nReporters Without Borders said Wednesday that it has filed a complaint for war crimes committed against some of the 34 journalists killed since the war began. The complaint includes eight Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza and one Israeli journalist in Israel. The group says the deaths justify an investigation by the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe complaint says the Palestinian journalists were killed − and two others wounded − in bombings of Gaza. The Israeli journalist was killed during Hamas’ attack in southern Israel the day the war began. Other deaths are still being investigated and could draw war crime complaints, the group said.\n\nThe group also cites the\" deliberate, total or partial, destruction\" of the newsrooms of more than 50 media outlets in Gaza.\n\nWhite House developing plan to combat Islamophobia\n\nThe Biden administration is developing a national strategy to combat Islamophobia amid skepticism from many Muslim Americans, the Associated Press reported, citing people briefed on the matter. AP said the the White House originally was expected to announce plans to develop the strategy last week but was delayed partly because of concerns from Muslim Americans that the administration lacked credibility given its zealous support of Israel.\n\nThe launch has been anticipated since the administration in May released a national strategy to combat antisemitism that made passing reference to countering hatred against Muslims.\n\nLebanon prime minister calls for five-day cease-fire\n\nNajib Mikati, leading Lebanon's paralyzed government, called Wednesday for a five-day cease-fire for humanitarian purposes as Hezbollah and Israeli troops continue to clash along Lebanon's border. Mikati, struggling to keep the war from expanding into his country, said the pause would accommodate prisoner exchanges and allow for talks aimed at ending the fighting.\n\n\"The decision to go to war today is in Israel's hands,\" Mikati said.\n\nIsrael, which has steadfastly rejected previous calls for a cease-fire, said Wednesday that its military had intercepted a surface-to-air missile launched from Lebanese territory toward an Israeli drone. In response, Israeli aircraft struck the \"origin of the missile launch, as well as the terrorists who carried out the launch,\" the military said.\n\nClashes on the Lebanon-Israel border have also wounded Lebanese civilians, according to human rights agencies.\n\nTwo Lebanese shepherds were injured Wednesday and are now missing, according to a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping force on the border. UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said the Lebanese army had requested assistance from peacekeepers to evacuate two people near the border.\n\nThe Israeli army suspended fire to allow the Lebanese army and UNIFIL to search for the shepherds but Tenenti said they could not be found.\n\n“Due to the darkness and presence of land mines in the area, the search will have to resume in the morning,” Tenenti added.\n\nAnd human rights group Amnesty International said civilians in southern Lebanon have also been injured by Israeli forces using shells containing white phosphorus.\n\nHostage crisis brings war home to Brooklyn\n\nBrooklyn resident Alana Zeitchik's life has been in turmoil since Oct. 7, when her mother called in a panic, worrying about the fate of six Jewish family members in Israel taken hostage by Hamas. Zeitchik’s days have been a mix of news and social media hits ever since. Trips to the United Nations. Meetings with lawmakers. Long-distance texts and voice messages to her family back in Israel desperately trying to find their relatives.\n\n\"I can't wrap my brain around it. My mind goes to like the worst torture film I've seen, so I just can't do it,\" said Zeitchik, 38.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/13/israel-war-hamas-gaza-live-updates/71149583007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas war news: Death toll exceeds 3,000", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from the Israel-Hamas war from Friday, Oct. 13. For the latest news and updates on the conflict in Israel, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Saturday, Oct. 14.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday said addressing the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a top priority, as Palestinians began to evacuate by foot, car and donkey cart ahead of a planned Israeli ground operation.\n\nAs of Friday, the Israel Defense Forces said more than 1,300 Israelis have died and 3,200 were injured. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said 1,799 people have died and 7,388 others were injured.\n\n\"We can’t lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do Hamas,” Biden said, speaking at an event in Philadelphia. “And they’re suffering as a result as well.”\n\nHe spoke Friday with family members of Americans missing in Israel in a meeting the White House described as \"emotional.\" Other Americans and transplants from the U.S. who made it through the initial Hamas attacks and out of danger described harrowing moments and journeys home.\n\nMeanwhile, the world waits, uncertain about next steps as the war turns a week old and experts have said they expect Israel to continue pounding Gaza and possibly launch a ground invasion within hours.\n\nBiden said he’s directed his team to work with the governments in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab nations and the United Nations to surge humanitarian relief to those impacted by the war.\n\nHamas staged a shocking and brutal attack on Israel nearly a week ago and has fired thousands of rockets since. Israel has responded with a heavy aerial bombardment and has sealed off the Gaza Strip, stopping all entry of food, water, medicine and fuel to its 2.3 million people.\n\nIsrael-Hamas War newsletter:Sign up to get the latest news and analysis from USA TODAY into your inbox.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The number of Palestinians displaced increased by 25% over the past 24 hours, according to an early Friday update from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. More than 423,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza and two-thirds are taking shelter at U.N. schools.\n\n∎ Airstrikes have left cities and refugee camps in ruins. And Gaza has been experiencing a full electricity blackout amid Israel's siege of the territory, \"which has brought essential health, water and sanitation services to the brink of collapse, and exacerbated food insecurity,\" according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz has said electricity, water and fuel will not be provided until Israeli hostages are returned.\n\n∎ Public officials and law enforcement agencies across the United States have expressed concern over potential protests on Friday in response to Hamas leadership's call for a global \"Day of Rage.\" The D.C. region has enhanced its security in the area, including in the U.S. Capitol complex, and other major cities have also been on alert.\n\n∎ Hamas' media office said about 70 people, including women and children, were killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit cars full of people fleeing south from Gaza City on Friday. It was not immediately clear what the intended target was or whether militants were among the passengers hit.\n\n'Humanity on both sides':A gulf of perspectives is growing among US millennials amid war in Israel\n\nFirst charter flight evacuating Americans leaves Israel\n\nThe State Department’s first charter flight taking Americans out of Israel has landed in Athens, Greece, the State Department said Friday.\n\n“The State Department will continue to organize these charter flights for as long as there is a demand from US citizens for departure assistance,” John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security matters, said.\n\nAmericans who left Israel on the charter flights have to make their own travel arrangements to the U.S. once they make it to the safe locations, according to the State Department.\n\nThe American death toll from last week’s Hamas attack in Israel remains at 27, while 14 Americans are unaccounted for.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPresident Biden speaks with families of Americans held hostage by Hamas\n\nPresident Joe Biden met virtually Friday with the families of 14 Americans who remain unaccounted for since last weekend's brutal attacks in Israel when Hamas militants took civilians hostage.\n\n\"The president conveyed directly to these families that they have been in his prayers and reaffirmed for them that the United States government is doing everything possible to locate and bring home their loved ones,\" said John Kirby, the National Security Council's coordinator for strategic communications.\n\nThe White House said the Zoom call, which lasted over an hour, was \"emotional.\"\n\nThe White House believes a small number of the 14 unaccounted-for Americans are being held captive by Hamas as hostages, and officials are working to gather more information. At least 27 Americans were killed.\n\n“I think they have to know that the president of the United States of America cares deeply about what’s happening,” Biden said in an interview on \"60 Minutes,\" according to a clip released ahead of Sunday’s broadcast.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nDining with Bruno Mars one day, hiding in stairwells the next\n\nKenneth Whalum, a Memphis pastor, arrived in Israel on Oct. 2 to watch his son perform a concert in Tel Aviv as a trombonist and singer in Bruno Mars’ band.\n\n“The crowd was composed of Israelis and Palestinians, and they were all singing in unison with Bruno,” he told the Memphis Commercial Appeal. “It was unbelievable. It was surreal.”\n\nOn the night of Oct. 6, Whalum dined with the band and Mars at a five-star restaurant in Tel Aviv, before preparing to fly home the next day. But Saturday morning, the sirens started.\n\nWhalum said he took shelter at different points along his journey out, first in his hotel where an employee barricaded the door with a steel bar, and later in stairwells with other passengers at the airport.\n\n“I just had a sense… that God was going to get me out, and that he was going to get my son out,” he said. “I was not afraid.”\n\n- John Klyce, Memphis Commercial Appeal\n\nWhite House: No indication of threat to US after Hamas attack in Israel\n\nThe White House said Friday there’s no indication of a threat to the U.S. following last week’s surprise Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nJohn Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security matters, said Biden met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room on Thursday to discuss “the current homeland threat environment” following the attack.\n\nHe said the president also discussed efforts to safeguard Jewish and Muslim communities and protect diplomatic facilities in eight U.S. cities: Washington, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco.\n\n\"At this time, none of our intelligence agencies have any specific intelligence indicating a threat to the United States stemming from the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel,” Kirby said. “That said, we continue to remain vigilant.\"\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nUN agency condemns Israel's evacuation order\n\nIsrael's call for about a million people to move south within the Gaza Strip drew backlash from a United Nations agency and aid workers.\n\n\"The scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone-chilling. Gaza is fast becoming a hell hole and is on the brink of collapse,\" the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said in a Friday statement. \"The call from Israeli Forces to move more than 1,000,000 civilians living in northern Gaza within 24 hours is horrendous. This will only lead to unprecedented levels of misery and further push people in Gaza into the abyss.\"\n\nThe evacuation order further alarmed civilians and aid workers. Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, told The Associated Press through tears that there was no way 1 million people could evacuate that fast.\n\n“Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you make it, if you’re going to live,” Farsakh said.\n\nPalestinians rush to leave northern Gaza ahead of possible invasion\n\nPalestinians fled by foot, car, truck and donkey cart after Israel’s forces warned about half the population of the Gaza Strip to go south. The United Nations agency said the warning could have disastrous effects amid a growing humanitarian crisis in the sealed-off territory.\n\n\"Conditions are very bad,\" Yaser Betar, a Texas native, told USA TODAY.\n\nIsrael's evacuation order for parts of Gaza came ahead of an expected ground offensive against Hamas militants. The order calls for people living in north Gaza to move south of the Wadi Gaza area, which is in the middle of the territory. The southern end of Gaza sits against the Egyptian border, which is closed. Hamas told residents to remain.\n\nFamilies were streaming down a main road out of Gaza City, the biggest city, packed with blankets and possessions, even as Israeli strikes hammered neighborhoods in southern Gaza, the Associated Press reported. But many hesitated to leave amid uncertainty about safety anywhere in Gaza, as suffering has been rising in the territory.\n\n“We're waiting here. Hundreds of thousands of people are walking to leave Gaza City to go to the south border because they are preparing for a big invasion,” said Betar, who was visiting family when the conflict broke out.\n\nBetar described the desperate rush to evacuate in a brief phone call with USA TODAY as horns honked and voices yelled in the background.\n\n“They say if you stay in the city you will be killed,\" Betar said. \"Me and family, we're just 15, 16 people, are leaving right now.”\n\nIsraeli forces, Palestinians clash in West Bank\n\nViolent clashes broke out Friday between protesters and Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank after the leader of Hamas called for a “global day of rage” in support of Palestinians.\n\nHamas urged its supporters to confront Israeli Defense Forces in the West Bank, and confrontations were reported in several cities as thousands of people gathered to cheer Hamas.\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry has reported casualties as a result of confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinians. It’s unclear if any of those occurred Friday.\n\n– Rama Yousef and Michael Collins\n\nReuters journalist killed in shelling in Lebanon\n\nThe Reuters news agency on Friday confirmed the death of one of its journalists working in Lebanon during an exchange of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border between Israeli troops and members of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group. Several other journalists were injured.\n\nReuters videographer Issam Abdallah had been providing live video feeds of military activity and had posted footage earlier Friday of bombings in the vicinity of Alma Al-Shaab, a village near the border.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that an Israeli shell landed in a gathering of international journalists covering clashes on the border, killing Abdallah and wounding six other journalists.\n\nQatar’s Al-Jazeera TV said two of its employees, Elie Brakhya and Carmen Joukhadar, were among the wounded. Reuters also said its journalists Thaer Al-Sudani and Maher Nazeh were injured and are seeking medical care.\n\nThe Lebanon-Israel border has seen sporadic acts of violence since Saturday’s attack on southern Israel by the militant Palestinian group Hamas. Journalists from around the world have been going to Lebanon with concerns that war might break out between Hezbollah and Israel, the AP said.\n\nHow many people live in the Gaza Strip?\n\nAbout 2.3 million people live in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael’s military has told some 1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza and head to the southern part of the besieged territory.\n\nWhy can't Gaza residents leave the area entirely?\n\nThe Gaza Strip is surrounded by blockades imposed by Israel and Egypt.\n\nEgyptian officials have long tried to encourage Palestinians to remain in their territory, in part because accepting refugees could widen the longstanding regional conflict. Gaza was initially populated by Palestinians displaced from the land that became Israel in 1948.\n\nGazans must “stay steadfast and remain on their land,” President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said on Thursday, the New York Times reported. “Egypt will not allow the Palestinian cause to be settled at the expense of other parties.”\n\nWhat is Hamas 'day of rage'\n\nIsraeli authorities warned Jews around the world of the potential for violence Friday on what they said Hamas had declared to be an international \"day of rage.\" Although little evidence of widespread violence materialized by midday Friday, police agencies across the United States and around the world braced for the possibility of localized violence, particularly directed at synagogues or during street protests.\n\n\"It is reasonable to assume that there will be protest events in various countries that are liable to turn violent,\" reads the statement from Israel's National Security Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nWhat is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian exclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. There have been no elections since. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nWhat is the IDF?\n\nIDF stands for Israel Defense Forces, the umbrella name for the country's air force, army and navy.\n\nUnder law, every Israeli citizen is required to serve a term in the military, with men typically serving 32 months and women serving 24 months.\n\nAccording to the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) Military Balance 2023, Israel has 169,500 active military personnel in the army, navy and paramilitary, along with about 465,000 in reserves.\n\nThe IDF has a modern military with multiple advanced American-made fighter jets.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/11/02/israel-hamas-gaza-war-live-updates/71418747007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war updates: Gaza City surrounded; pressure for a ...", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.\n\nThe Israeli military said Thursday it has surrounded Gaza City, heightening concerns about civilian casualties at a time when Israel faces increasing pressure to agree to a humanitarian halt in the war.\n\n“IDF troops completed the encirclement of Gaza City, which is the focal point of the Hamas terrorist organization,'' Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari was quoted as saying in an IDF tweet.\n\nA rising Palestinian death toll that has surpassed 9,000 − including more than 3,600 children − and images of widespread destruction in densely populated areas of Gaza have contributed to growing unease among Israel supporters and Arab nations with which it has peaceful relations. That continued even as more Americans and other foreign passport holders fled Gaza on Thursday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has endorsed a humanitarian \"pause,'' a message likely to be underscored in Friday's visit to Israel by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is also expected to push for better protections for civilians and more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.\n\nWhile Israel did not immediately respond to Biden's suggestion, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that the country will not accept a ceasefire on Thursday and said “We are advancing … Nothing will stop us.”\n\nWith a growing number of Gaza hospitals shutting down as they run out of fuel, the Israeli military chief said Israel would allow fuel supplies into the territory if they could be kept away from Hamas. Netanyahu promptly shot down that notion, saying, “We are assisting with humanitarian aid, including food, medicine and water. ... There has been no decision on fuel.”\n\nBesides grappling with deteriorating living conditions, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza remain in the path of advancing Israeli ground forces, which engaged in heavy fighting with militants Thursday. Israel has repeatedly urged north Gaza residents to move south, but some are unable to, others resist and yet others who heeded the advice found themselves still in harm's way as Israel bombarded the south.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Israeli government said in a statement it is \"severing off all contact with Gaza'' and will no longer allow Palestinians from the territory to work in Israel. About 18,000 Palestinians held those jobs, a significant benefit considering Gaza's unemployment rate of about 50%.\n\n∎ A total of 102 trucks carrying humanitarian aid arrived in Gaza on Thursday, the Palestine Red Crescent said. That figure represents more than a quarter of all the assistance that has come in since the convoys started rolling into Gaza on Oct. 21, though the fighting makes distribution difficult.\n\n∎ The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said four of its schools-turned-shelters in Gaza were damaged by airstrikes in the past day, killing a reported minimum of 24 people.\n\n∎ The Palestinian death toll has reached 9,061, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, 130 Palestinians have been killed, authorities there said. More than 1,400 Israelis have died, most of them civilians killed in the first hours of the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage, Israeli authorities say.\n\n∎ Connectivity was gradually being restored after civilians in Gaza faced another major cut to communications and internet services, according to Patel, the territory's main telecommunications provider. Humanitarian aid agencies say such interruptions severely disrupt their work.\n\nHouse approves nearly $14.5 billion in military aid for Israel\n\nThe House of Representatives approved nearly $14.5 billion in Israel aid Thursday afternoon.\n\nAid to Israel, a close ally of the United States, for the ongoing conflict, has garnered widespread bipartisan support, but House Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposal for standalone Israel funding has drawn considerable backlash from the Democratic-controlled Senate and the White House.\n\nTo pay for the Israel assistance, the bill includes a provision pulling back additional funding for the Internal Revenue Service that was originally allocated from the Inflation Reduction Act, a law championed by President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats.\n\nBiden has said he would veto the bill, which was approved 226-196, with most Republicans voting for the legislation and most Democrats voting against it.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Ken Tran, Francesca Chambers, and Riley Beggin\n\nBiden says 74 Americans leave Gaza, after five Wednesday\n\nBiden said Thursday that the U.S. has helped 74 American citizens leave the Gaza Strip in the first wave of evacuations from the Hamas-controlled territory.\n\nBiden called the development \"good news,\" relaying the figure to reporters ahead of an Oval Office bilateral meeting with Dominican Republican President Luis Abinader. The White House said five Americans got out of Gaza on Wednesday.\n\nThe evacuations come after Biden on Wednesday announced the U.S. had \"secured safe passage\" for wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals to exit war-torn Gaza, which he credited to \"intense and urgent American diplomacy with our partners in the region.\"\n\nAbout 800 people have departed the territory through the Rafah crossing into Egypt in the last two days after negotiations with Egypt, Israel and Qatar, which mediates with Hamas.\n\nAbout 400 U.S. citizens are seeking to leave Gaza. Along with their family members, the total seeking to exit is close to 1,000, according to the State Department.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nHezbollah may be plotting 'all-out war' against Israel\n\nIncreasing attacks against Israel from across its northern border with Lebanon − mostly from Hezbollah but some also coming from its ally and fellow militant group Hamas − threaten to open a second front in the war.\n\nHezbollah said Thursday it launched a combination of antitank missiles, mortar fire and exploding drones against 19 military targets in Israel, which responded with airstrikes and artillery shelling aimed at Hezbollah command centers, arms depots and launch sites.\n\nLebanon’s state-run National News Agency said four civilians were killed, bringing to 10 the number of Lebanese fatalities since Israel's war with Hamas also sparked hostilities north of the Israeli border. Israel said two people were injured in the mostly vacated northern town of Kiryat Shmona.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is expected to speak publicly about the Israel-Hamas war for the first time Friday in what Jonathan Schanzer, a Middle East expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, calls \"the most important speech of his life.''\n\n\"There are signs Nasrallah is preparing to announce an all-out war against Israel,'' Schanzer wrote, \"opening a second major front where the Israeli military will face an adversary that is better armed and more entrenched than Hamas in Gaza.''\n\nGaza's only cancer hospital shuts down amid fuel shortage\n\nGaza’s main cancer treatment center, the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, ran out of fuel, forcing it to halt most of its treatments and care and endangering the lives of 70 patients, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Thursday on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe U.N. also raised concerns over reports that the Al Hilo Hospital in Gaza City was struck by shelling Wednesday night. “The hospital had absorbed and replaced Shifa hospital’s maternity ward, which is being used now to treat the wounded,” OCHA said in a statement.\n\nFourteen out of 35 hospitals across Gaza are not operating amid a massive fuel shortage.\n\nIsrael cut off the Gaza Strip from food, water, fuel and medicines in the days following Hamas' vicious assault on Oct. 7. And while trucks with humanitarian aid have been moving into southern Gaza since Oct. 21, fuel essential for hospitals, ambulances and water desalination plants remain banned by the Israeli authorities, according to the U.N.\n\nAmericans awaiting evacuation from Gaza: 'The situation is so horrible'\n\nYaser Betar, a native of Denton, Texas, has been attempting to leave the Hamas-controlled territory for weeks, ever since the Israeli military began its counterattack after a surprise Hamas invasion triggered the worst escalation in the conflict in decades.\n\n\"The situation is so horrible here in Gaza. Definitely, I will never come back again,\" Betar texted in a WhatsApp message to USA TODAY.\n\nGuidance from the U.S. government has been sporadic, spotty and unreliable, family members of American citizens said.\n\n\"They're just worried, and they're eager to leave, and they don't want to give in to a false sense of hope,\" said Mai Abushaaban, whose mother and sister are waiting to evacuate around 20 minutes away from the Rafah crossing. \"Three times before this has happened and they don't actually leave.''\n\nRead more here.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nOfficials: Some Hamas militants on Oct. 7 were found with synthetic stimulant\n\nTwo Israeli security officials with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed to USA TODAY that the synthetic stimulant Captagon, a methamphetamine-like substance, was found on at least some of the Hamas fighters killed during or after the stunning Oct. 7 raids on Israel, bolstering an Oct. 19 report by Israel's Channel 12 News that was not based on official sources.\n\nOfficially, the Israeli Defense Forces declined to confirm or deny the use of Captagon by Hamas fighters. \"We can't comment on this matter,\" a spokesperson told USA TODAY.\n\nBut the Israeli security officials said small bags of the drug, which can come in the form of a tablet or cocaine-like powder, were found along with bullets stashed in the pockets of clothes and tactical gear worn by some of the Hamas fighters who stormed two dozen communities along Israel's southern border with the Gaza Strip. One of the officials said that small bottles of liquid containing a white fluid with traces of Captagon were also found on the Hamas militants.\n\nAnd they said the highly addictive amphetamine used throughout the Middle East, including by young drug takers at rave parties, also was found on some of the Hamas fighters who were captured alive by Israeli army and police responding to the attacks. That could help authorities determine what role, if any, the drug played in the attacks, now considered to be the deadliest in Israel's 75-year history, which have sparked an escalating war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nRead more here.\n\n− Josh Meyer and Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWhat is the Rafah border crossing?\n\nThe Rafah crossing is a pedestrian border between Gaza and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. It's currently the only viable point of exit for Palestinians and others seeking to escape the besieged enclave.\n\nEgypt, Hamas and Israel agreed to open the border for a limited time to allow for people with foreign passports, some critically injured Palestinians and aid workers to cross, the embassy said. One of those aid groups includes 22 Doctors Without Borders staffers.\n\n\"There are still over 20,000 injured people in Gaza with limited access to health care due to the siege,\" the nonprofit said.\n\nThe United Nations said in an Oct. 22 update that truckloads of humanitarian aid has poured into Gaza via the crossing. The U.N. also said on Wednesday about 80 sick and wounded Palestinians and 500 foreign passport holders gained entry into Egypt via the crossing.\n\n− Krystal Nurse\n\nBiden: 'I think we need a pause' in war to get 'prisoners' out\n\nBiden on Wednesday said he thinks there should be a humanitarian “pause” in the Israel-Hamas war so more hostages can get out of the Gaza.\n\n“I think we need a pause,” Biden said in response to a protester who interrupted him at a Minneapolis fundraiser. “A pause means give time to get the prisoners out.”\n\nAbout 240 people were taken hostage on Oct. 7 in Hamas' surprise attack that killed nearly 1,400 people.\n\nSettler violence against Palestinians surges in the West Bank, UN says\n\nViolence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank increased significantly from an already high average of three incidents per day in 2023 to seven a day, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nSince the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, the U.N. recorded 171 settler attacks against Palestinians: 26 incidents resulted in casualties and 115 of the attacks involved damage to 115 Palestinian properties. The U.N. did not include cases of harassment, trespassing or intimidation. However, those cases have also surged \"under the pressure on Palestinians to leave their land,\" the office said.\n\nAs of Wednesday, more than 820 Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank have been displaced amid settler violence and increased movement restrictions since Oct. 7, according to the U.N. relief wing.\n\nThis year has been the deadliest in the West Bank since the second Palestinian uprising against Israel two decades ago. West Bank land has been occupied by Israel since 1967. The U.N. considers Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory a flagrant violation of international law.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/10/07/history-of-israel-and-palestine-conflict-and-the-latest-hamas-attacks-war-in-gaza-in-maps/71098600007/", "title": "Timeline of conflict: Why the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian fighting is ...", "text": "Intense fighting is raging in Israel and Gaza after Hamas militants launched thousands of rockets into Israel and gunmen infiltrated Southern Israel. \"We are at war, and we will win it,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. The fight may be the worst since 2021, but it's part of a complex, bitter conflict that reaches back to the first world war.\n\nThe dispute is rooted in pre-biblical times. Though its borders have shifted over the years, Palestinian territories used to be what is now Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nBoth Israeli Jews’ and Palestinian Arabs’ history, culture and identity are linked to the Palestinian territories and to the ancient city of Jerusalem, “one of the most bitterly contested cities on earth,” according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire controlled the region for about 400 years before its defeat, along with Germany, in World War I. Britain was given control of Palestine by the League of Nations in 1920, under an order called the British Mandate.\n\nIn 1917, the British government signaled its support for the establishment of a Jewish state in Israel with the Balfour Declaration.\n\nWhile the declaration stated support, it also said that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestinian territories, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”\n\nJewish migration from eastern and central Europe surged from 1922 to 1947 as Jews fled persecution and the destruction of their communities during the interwar period and during World War II. By the end of the Holocaust, more than 6 million European Jews had been murdered, and many survivors were left stateless.\n\nAs the number of Jewish immigrants increased, many Palestinians were displaced. They began pushing back and violence resulted.\n\nIn 1929, 67 Jews were killed in the Hebron massacre, part of Palestinian riots against Jewish immigration in Palestine.\n\nDisputed territory\n\nGaza: Also known as the Gaza Strip, it’s the home to about 2 million Palestinians, many of them displaced after leaving or being driven from Israel during the War of Independence.\n\nWest Bank: Smaller than Delaware, the West Bank is east of Israel. About 3 million Palestinians live there, most of them Muslim Arabs. The West Bank contains a number of Jewish holy sites, which are visited by thousands of pilgrims every year.\n\nEast Jerusalem: Jerusalem itself is a divided, disputed city. It was cut in two after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Israel controlled the western portion and Jordan controlled the east. Israel captured the entire city in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nThough Jerusalem's ownership is disputed, Israeli officials claim it as the undivided capital of Israel. In 2017, the Trump administration moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a formal recognition of Jerusalem as the capital.\n\nHowever, most nations do not acknowledge Jerusalem as belonging to either Israelis or Palestinians.\n\nWho's fighting?\n\nHamas\n\nHamas is the largest Palestinian militant group and has fired rockets from Gaza at Israeli cities in the fighting.\n\nIt was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and hasand has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006, then wresting militarily control from another leadership group in 2007. It's committed to the destruction of Israel and is considered a terrorist group by the U.S., the U.K. and other nations.\n\nIsraeli Defense Forces\n\nThe IDF is the combined armed forces of Israel, including army, navy and air force. It was established in 1948, two weeks after Israel declared itself a state.\n\nInternational community tries, fails to bring peace\n\n1947: The U.N. votes to divide Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states and make Jerusalem an international city. Arabs reject the plan, which is later dropped.\n\n1948: After the British Mandate expires on May 14, the Jewish People's Council meets in Tel Aviv and establishes the State of Israel. The U.S. officially recognizes the new nation later that day; the USSR acknowledges it three days later.\n\n1949: The Armistice Agreements is a U.N.-mediated attempt to bring peace to Palestine. Israel signs agreements with Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon to reach a formal peace treaty within six months, but the effort ultimately fails.\n\n1956: Egypt nationalizes the Suez Canal and bars Israeli ships from using it and the Straits of Tiran, another shipping route. Israel, aided by Britain and France, invades Egypt. The Soviet Union, an ally of Egypt, threatens nuclear retaliation, and the U.S. pressures British, French and Israeli forces to withdraw. The U.N. deploys a peacekeeping force.\n\n1964: The Palestine Liberation Organization, a group with the goal of uniting Arab groups and liberating the Palestinian territories through armed struggle, is formed in Egypt.\n\n1967: The Six-Day War grows out of the Suez Canal conflict. Egypt orders the U.N. force to leave, closes the Straits of Tiran to Israel again, and plans a secret attack against Israel.\n\nIn a preemptive strike, Israel attacks Egypt and later Jordan and Syria, capturing Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nShift in the state of Israel\n\n1973: The Yom Kippur War starts with Egypt and Syria attacking Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. The war is an attempt to reverse the defeat of the 1967 war.\n\nCaught unaware, the Israelis counterattack and win. The U.S. helps secure disengagement agreements from combatants, laying groundwork for future peace efforts.\n\n1979: The Camp David Accords, an Israeli-Egyptian peace deal, is set up by President Jimmy Carter and signed by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.\n\n1979: Israel begins gradual withdrawal from the Sinai.\n\n1987: Palestinians stage the first of two uprisings, or intifadas, in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank, using mass boycotts, civil disobedience and attacks on Israelis. More than 50 Israeli civilians are killed. The intifada lasts more than five years, ending in September 1993.\n\nThe Israeli military kills 1,070 Palestinians, including 237 children, according to B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization. Jewish settlers kill 54 Palestinians. The U.S. and the U.N. criticize Israel's use of lethal force.\n\n1991: In response to the intifada, the Madrid Conference, a historical gathering of all participants in the Arab-Israeli conflict, is chaired by the U.S. and Russia.\n\n1993: Oslo I, known as the Declaration of Principles, is signed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It establishes a timetable for a Middle East peace process.\n\n1995: Oslo II is signed, a second agreement in which the Palestine Liberation Organization recognizes the state of Israel and Israel allows Palestinians limited self-government in Gaza.\n\n2000: President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat gather at the Camp David summit, a meeting intended to end hostilities. It ends without an agreement.\n\nPalestinians, frustrated over failures to create a Palestinian state, begin the second intifada in September, which lasts until February 2005. B'Tselem estimates more than 3,100 Palestinians and nearly 1,000 Israelis are killed.\n\n2005: Israel withdraws from Gaza but retains control.\n\n2007: Hamas, the militant Palestinian group, wins elections in Gaza.\n\n2008: Israel launches a major military campaign against Hamas in Gaza after increased rocket fire from militants. The fighting ends on Jan. 18, 2009, with 1,440 Palestinians and 13 Israelis killed.\n\n2012: Israeli forces kill Ahmed Jabari, a Hamas military chief, in a missile strike. The strike is part of an Israeli operation to eliminate weapons and militants in Gaza. Hamas says the killing has \"opened the gates of hell.\"\n\n2014: Hamas kidnaps and kills three Israeli teens in the West Bank, igniting the Gaza War, in which rocket attacks and airstrikes kill 2,251 Palestinians and 73 Israelis. A senior Hamas leader praises the kidnapping and says it was intended to spark a new Palestinian uprising.\n\nThe war lasts 50 days and ends with a truce. A U.N. report says both sides may have committed war crimes, which Israel and Hamas dispute.\n\n2017: The Trump administration says it will move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, in effect an official U.S. recognition of Israel's claim to the city. The embassy is relocated in 2018.\n\n2018: Protests break out on the Gaza-Israeli border as the U.S. Embassy is relocated. Demonstrators throw explosives and rocks across barrier fences and are met with gunfire and tear gas. At least 58 Palestinians are killed, the Gaza health ministry says.\n\n2021: Fighting erupts again as Israeli police raid the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem on April 13, the first night of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and disconnect speakers broadcasting prayers as Reuven Rivlin, the Israeli president, is speaking at the Western Wall, a site sacred to the Jewish people.\n\nPolice then close a nearby plaza, a popular gathering place. Palestinians and Jews begin attacking one another, and Israeli police raid the mosque on May 7.\n\nThe raid, on what's considered a holy Muslim site on one of the holiest nights of Ramadan, is viewed by Muslims as an insult.\n\nHamas and other militants fire rockets into Israel from Gaza on May 10. Israel counterattacks with airstrikes.\n\nA ceasefire went into effect on May 21. It lasted until June 16, when Hamas sent incendiary balloons – helium balloons or kites with flammable devices attached – across the Gaza border into Israel.\n\nThe devices caused 20 ground fires in fields near the border, according to the Israeli fire brigade. Hamas launched the devices after Israeli officials permitted ultranationalist demonstrators to march in Jerusalem.\n\n2022: In the spring and summer of 2022 Israel experienced a string of terrorist attacks that led it to take what it described as preemptive action, including airstrikes targeting senior commanders and weapons depots, against Iran-backed militant groups such as Islamic Jihad.\n\nAt least 44 Palestinians, including 15 children, were killed in three days of violence in August 2022.\n\n2023: In January too this year, Israel launched the first of two raids against the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, where it said Palestinian militants and activists were hiding out.\n\nThe second raid, in July 2023, saw Israel send about 1,000 soldiers, backed by drone strikes, to Jenin to demolish what it characterized as a militant \"command center.\"\n\nOctober 2023: In the biggest offensive in years, dozens of gunmen from the Palestinian militant group Hamas infiltrate southern Israel in a stunning surprise attack that coincided with a major Jewish holiday. Overnight and into the morning, Hamas launched thousands of rockets into Israel. Israel’s national rescue service said at least dozens of people were killed and hundreds wounded.\n\nCONTRIBUTING Katharine Vogel\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; The Associated Press; United Nations; Reuters; U.S. State Department", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/11/03/israel-hamas-gaza-war-live-updates/71434474007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war updates: Hezbollah leader speaks; US drones", "text": "On Friday, Israel fired an airstrike on an ambulance outside of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, killing at least 15 people and injuring 50 others, according to health authorities in Gaza, CNN reported.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces said in a statement that they targeted the ambulance because it was being used by Hamas and carrying militants, according to Reuters.\n\n“An IDF aircraft struck an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone,” the statement reads. \"A number of Hamas terrorist operatives were killed in the strike.\"\n\nDr. Ashraf Al-Qidra, a spokeperson for the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, concurred that Israel was responsible for the attack on the vehicle, which was headed to the Rafah Crossing, CNN reported.\n\nOfficial: Hamas tried to get its wounded fighters out of Gaza\n\nThe Palestinian militant group Hamas tried to secure passage out of the Gaza Strip for some its wounded fighters as part of an agreement that allowed for limited evacuations from the besieged territory, a U.S. official said Friday.\n\nHamas’ demands during negotiations with Egypt, Israel and the U.S. slowed down the talks, said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHamas said it would allow foreign nationals to leave through the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza as long as a number of wounded Palestinians were on the list, the official said. But once negotiators vetted the list of possible evacuees provided by Hamas, they discovered that one-third of them were Hamas fighters, the official said.\n\n“It was just unacceptable to Egypt, to us, to Israel,” the official said.\n\nThe deal that was eventually reached allowed wounded Palestinian civilians, but not Hamas fighters, to leave Gaza along with foreign passport holders. More than 1,000 people, including more than 100 Americans, have evacuated Gaza since the arrangement was announced Wednesday.\n\nIsrael 'refuses a temporary cease-fire that doesn’t include a return of our hostages'\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials about \"concrete steps\" to minimize the deaths of civilians in Gaza, securing the release of more hostages, increasing humanitarian aid to the region and the ongoing ground offensive as Israeli forces encircle Gaza City.\n\nBlinken stressed the United States' support for Israel's right to defend itself with the caveat that how Israel carries out its military campaign to defeat Hamas \"matters,\" adding that it threatens to limit public support and eventual peace talks. He did not offer details about the steps he discussed with Israeli officials, including the humanitarian pauses he and President Joe Biden have encouraged.\n\nShortly after Blinken spoke in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said in a statement that Israel \"refuses a temporary cease-fire that doesn’t include a return of our hostages.”\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of stranded Palestinian laborers in Israel and the West Bank have been expelled and began their return to the besieged enclave.\n\nAt the Rafah crossing, more foreign nationals and wounded Palestinians in Gaza were allowed to leave the Gaza Strip on Friday under an apparent agreement among the U.S., Egypt, Israel and Qatar, which mediates with Hamas. Over 800 people have escaped since Wednesday's partial opening of the Rafah crossing, the only viable way out of Gaza.\n\nIsrael has allowed over 260 trucks carrying food, water and medicines through the Rafah crossing, but aid workers say it’s not enough and will not reach civilians in north Gaza where Israeli troops have tightened their perimeter around Gaza City, and where tens of thousands of civilians remain in the path of escalating battles between militants and Israeli ground forces.\n\nNearly half of the hospitals across Gaza, including the only cancer facility, are not operating amid a massive fuel shortage. Netanyahu on Thursday said his administration has not made a decision on whether to allow fuel to get to the medical facilities.\n\n'Circle of blood':The club no Israeli or Palestinian wants to be in. Yet, they urge peace.\n\nThe Palestinian death toll − which has surpassed 9,000, including more than 3,600 children − and images of widespread destruction in densely populated areas of Gaza have contributed to growing unease among Israel supporters and Arab nations with which it has peaceful relations. Since the war began, more than 1,400 Israelis have died, most of them civilians killed in the first hours of Hamas' surprise attack.\n\nOther Developments:\n\n∎ World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told reporters Friday that 70% of the victims in Israel and Gaza who've been killed since Oct. 7 are women and children. “It’s the innocent civilians that are losing here,\" said Lindmeier. \"Let’s think about the victims.\"\n\n∎ Israeli military forces killed a \"Hamas battalion commander during overnight operations,\" according to a statement on X, formerly Twitter, by the Israel Defense Forces, adding: \"Our ground, aerial and naval forces continue to operate to eliminate Hamas’ chain of command and terrorist capabilities.\"\n\n∎ In raids across the occupied West Bank overnight, Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians and arrested many others. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage, 130 Palestinians have been killed and more than 820 have been displaced amid settler violence and increased movement restrictions.\n\n∎ The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, on Friday said nearly 50 of their buildings, including schools and shelters where around 700,000 Palestinians have taken refuge, have been struck by airstrikes. Four of its schools-turned-shelters in Gaza were damaged by airstrikes in the past day, killing a reported minimum of 24 people.\n\nHezbollah leader says group will not limit involvement in conflict\n\nHezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah broke his silence for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, saying Friday that the Iran-backed group would not limit its involvement in the conflict to the northern border between Israel and Lebanon.\n\nHowever, Nasrallah, who has not appeared in public for years over fears he could be assassinated by Israel, appeared to stop short of formally declaring war on Israel.\n\nLebanon-based Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and U.K., has since the outbreak of the war been attacking Israel's military across the border with shells and rockets.\n\nNasrallah said the Hamas attacks exposed \"the frailty, weakness and total fragility of Israel,\" adding that Israel is \"more fragile than a spider’s web.\"\n\nIn his speech, held in a secret location but broadcast live to thousands of people at a rally in Beirut, Nasrallah said the Hamas attacks were \"100% Palestinian\"; that no other groups were involved in its planning. He also cast doubt on Israel’s ability to achieve its aim of releasing the hostages held in Gaza.\n\n‒ Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUS uses unarmed drones to search for hostages in Gaza\n\nThe Pentagon has been flying unarmed drones over Gaza in search of hostages, the Defense Department acknowledged on Friday.\n\nThe drone flights began after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people, Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. Hamas militants also seized 200 people hostages in the attacks, including U.S. citizens.\n\nThe drone flights indicate deeper involvement by the U.S. military in the conflict than previously acknowledged. U.S. military experts have advised their Israeli counterparts on lessons learned from urban combat in Iraq, U.S. officials have said.\n\nDrones have the ability to feed video and still footage from surveillance sensors to forces involved in hostage rescue attempts.\n\n‒ Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBlinken says Israel must do more to protect Palestinian civilians\n\nBlinken told reporters Friday that he's urged Israel \"to do more to protect Palestinian civilians\" in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The secretary of state said Israeli leaders agreed to address and \"hold accountable\" extremist settlers attacking and displacing Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\n“We’ve provided Israel advice that only the best of friends can offer on how to minimize civilian deaths while still achieving its objectives of finding and finishing Hamas terrorists and their infrastructure of violence,” he said.\n\nHumanitarian pauses were an “important area of discussion,\" Blinken said, adding that questions raised in his various meetings asked how, when and where humanitarian pauses can happen, as well as how to connect a pause to the release of hostages, and how to ensure that \"Hamas doesn’t use these pauses or arrangements to its own advantage.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, we believe this can be a critical mechanism for protecting civilians,\" he said. Blinken also reiterated that while balancing urgent needs, the United States is focused on \"setting the conditions for a durable and sustainable peace and security.\"\n\n\"The United States continues to believe that the best viable path, indeed the only path, is through a two state solution,\" he said. \"That's the only guarantor of a secure Jewish and democratic Israel, the only guarantor of Palestinians realizing their legitimate right to live in a state of their own, enjoying measures of security, freedom, opportunity and dignity. The only way to end a cycle of violence once and for all.\"\n\nIsrael expels workers, 'severing all contact with Gaza'\n\nIsrael's security cabinet late Thursday announced that it is expelling thousands of Palestinian workers who have been stranded in Israel and the West Bank since the outbreak of the war almost a month ago.\n\nAbout 18,000 Palestinians in Gaza previously routinely crossed into Israel for work via the now sealed off Gaza-Israel border. But since Oct. 7 many of them have been arbitrarily detained by Israel.\n\nUSA TODAY last month encountered a group of about 130 workers who had been arrested, beaten and then transferred from Israel to Ramallah, a Palestinian city in the West Bank. In addition to their ill-treatment, they spoke about the difficulties of staying in touch with family members in Gaza amid Israel's intensifying bombing campaign that has now claimed more than 9,000 lives.\n\n\"I am powerless to help them, and for every 10 times I try to reach them on the phone, I get through maybe once,\" said one worker, speaking about his wife and 12 children from the grounds of a school in Ramallah where he and other Palestinians in Gaza had been given temporary shelter.\n\nIn a statement, Israel's security cabinet said the move to expel the workers was aimed at \"severing all contact with Gaza,” adding that there \"will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza.\"\n\nThe statement did not explain how, when or to where precisely the workers would be returned. Gaza is an active war zone that Israel's military is bombarding hundreds of times per day.\n\n‒ Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWhat is the Rafah border crossing?\n\nThe Rafah crossing is a pedestrian border between Gaza and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.

And he pushed back against requests from the United Nations and humanitarian organizations for a cease-fire, pointing out the U.S. did not agree to cease-fires after the Pearl Harbor and 9/11 attacks.\n\n“Calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism,’’ Netanyahu said. “That will not happen.’’\n\nHe also asked other countries to join Israel's fight against \"the enemies of civilization.''\n\n“This is a time for war, a war for our common future,’’ Netanyahu said. “Today we draw a line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism.’’\n\nAsked about the huge death toll inflicted on Palestinians by Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes – the fatality count has surpassed 8,300, including 3,200 children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry – Netanyahu said “not a single civilian’’ would die if they went to the safe zones in southern Gaza. However, that’s not possible for all the Gaza Strip residents, and Israeli forces have also bombarded the territory’s southern end.\n\nNetanyahu, who is facing growing criticism over his government's failure to prevent the Hamas attack and his refusal to take responsibility, also said he does not intend to resign.\n\nHundreds in Russia try to storm plane:News reports said protesters shouted antisemitic slogans\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Israeli military announced Monday the rescue of a female soldier from Hamas captivity in what Netanyahu called a \"successful action\" by the Shabak security agency and the Israel Defense Forces.

Ori Megidish, 19.\n\n∎ The relief organization CARE reports that some patients at overcrowded Gaza hospitals are having surgery without anesthesia, including pregnant women who require C-sections, and that some women are being released as soon as three hours after giving birth.\n\n∎ The U.N. warned that Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza were hitting close to hospitals where more than 100,000 displaced people are staying amid thousands of patients and staff. Dr. Sobhi Skeik, director of the Turkish Palestinian Hospital south of Gaza City, said an airstrike Monday damaged two rooms and the hospital's oxygen system and water supply.\n\n∎ The number of Israelis who have evacuated homes and communities near the Gaza border has surpassed 250,000, Israeli officials said.\n\n∎ A combined total of nearly 60 trucks with humanitarian aid came into Gaza from Egypt on Sunday and Monday, an increase from previous convoys but still far less than what relief workers say is needed.\n\nHamas built a tunnel network in Gaza:Here’s how Israeli forces will fight it\n\nRussia blames outside interference for riot targeting flight from Israel\n\nRussian officials on Monday blamed Ukraine and the West for the riotous upheaval at Russia's airport in the predominantly Muslim region of Dagestan when a flight from Israel was landing Sunday. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Kyiv called for the riots on social media, rallying \"egregious Russophobes\" in the Dagestan region.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blamed Russian authorities, tweeting that antisemitic sentiment is common in Russia and emanates from its leaders. Ukraine’s ambassador to Israel, Yevgen Korniychuk, told The Times of Israel that Russian security forces sent to the airport \"were sitting aside and smoking cigarettes. They did nothing.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called a meeting Monday of top security and law enforcement officials. More than 20 people were injured in the riot, which prompted Israel to advise its citizens to leave the northern Caucasus district.\n\nThe plane from Tel Aviv was greeted by hundreds of angry demonstrators storming onto the landing field. The crowd waved Palestinian flags and held banners saying “Child killers are not welcome in Dagestan” and “We’re against Jewish refugees.”\n\nIncidents of settler violence on West Bank Palestinians double\n\nDuring a White House presentation last week, President Joe Biden said he was alarmed by the incidents of \"extremist settlers'' attacking Palestinians in the West Bank and added, \"It has to stop now.''\n\nIt hasn't. The U.N. said the number of settler-related episodes of violence in the West Bank has more than doubled since Oct. 7, from three to seven a day compared to the first nine months of the year. Of those, 26 resulted in casualties, 113 in damage to Palestinian property and 28 to both.\n\n\"More than one-third of the incidents involved threats with firearms, including shooting, by settlers,'' the U.N. said. \"Almost half of all incidents involved Israeli forces accompanying or actively supporting Israeli settlers while carrying out the attacks.''\n\nAs of Sunday, Israeli forces and settlers have killed 123 Palestinians − 33 of them children − in the West Bank, half of them during search-and-arrest operations, according to the U.N. More than 2,100 Palestinians were injured in those confrontations, about a quarter of them by live ammunition.\n\nWater scarcity in Gaza nearing ‘catastrophe’, UNICEF head says\n\nThe executive director of the United Nations Children’s Fund, or UNICEF, expressed concerns to the U.N. Security Council Monday about the diminishing water supply in Gaza.\n\nCatherine Russell said the remaining clean water in Gaza was “quickly running out,” which could result in more deaths. One desalination plant was operating at 5% capacity, and all six of Gaza’s wastewater treatment plants were not operational due to lack of fuel or power, Russell said. The agency estimated 55% of water supply infrastructure required repair or rehabilitation.\n\n“The lack of clean water and safe sanitation is on the verge of becoming a catastrophe,” Russell told the council. “Unless access to clean water is urgently restored, more civilians, including children, will fall ill or die from dehydration or waterborne diseases.”\n\nUNICEF said people in Gaza have access to less than three liters, or 0.8 gallons of water a day per person to drink, cook and wash. The minimum emergency threshold is 15 liters, or about 4 gallons of water.\n\nIsrael blocking exit routes in Gaza as incursion intensifies\n\nIsrael appeared to begin blocking exit routes from northern Gaza as its ground invasion of the occupied enclave intensified Monday amid pockets of resistance from Palestinians who refused repeated Israeli orders to evacuate.\n\nFierce clashes took place as Israeli forces penetrated deep into northern Gaza near Beit Lahia, a city of 90,000, the Palestinian media outlet Al-Ayyam reported. The Israeli military said its forces were pushing into the territory, encountering militants attempting to launch anti-tank missiles and mortar shells. Dozens of the militants were killed, the Israelis said.\n\n“The objectives of this war require a ground operation,” the Israeli military chief of staff Herzi Halevi said. “The best soldiers are now operating in Gaza.”\n\nVideo circulating on social media showed an Israeli tank and bulldozer blocking Gaza’s primary north-south highway, which the Israeli military had said could be used to flee to southern Gaza.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting Monday at the request of the United Arab Emirates to discuss the humanitarian plight of Palestinians. Although almost 1 million Palestinians have heeded warnings from Israel and fled northern Gaza, hundreds of thousands remain, many refusing to leave and others unable. The ground invasion got underway last week as the war intensifies since it began with a surprise and brutal Hamas attack on Israeli border communities Oct. 7.\n\nGerman chancellor confirms death of woman in Hamas video\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz confirmed the death of German-Israeli Shani Louk, 23, who was kidnapped from a music festival in the first hours of the attack by Hamas militants. Video circulating that day showed militants parading Louk's semi-naked body through the streets of Gaza. Scholz said Louk was \"brutally murdered\" and that Hamas must be held accountable.\n\n\"This shows the full barbarity behind the Hamas attack,\" Scholz wrote on social media. \"This is terror, and Israel has the right to defend itself.\"\n\nThe Vatican seeks two-state solution, end to violence\n\nThe Vatican on Monday called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian homeland issue and urged both sides to avoid escalating the war. Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, the Vatican’s secretary for Relations with States, told Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian that the pope had \"serious concern\" about the war. Iran had requested the phone conversation, the Vatican said.\n\n“Archbishop Gallagher expressed the Holy See's serious concern about what is happening in Israel and Palestine, reiterating the absolute necessity to avoid escalating the conflict and to achieve a two-state solution for a stable and lasting peace in the Middle East,' the Vatican said in a statement.\n\nAntisemitic, threatening messages draw probe at Cornell University\n\nCampus police were sent to Cornell University's Jewish center after “horrendous, antisemitic messages” threatening violence appeared on a discussion board Sunday, university President Martha Pollack said in a statement. The University Police Department is investigating and has notified the FBI of a potential hate crime, she said. She urged the campus community to work together to reinforce \"a culture of trust, respect and safety\" at the Ivy League school in Ithaca, New York, more than 200 miles northwest of New York City.\n\nThe war has generated extensive and sometimes angry activism on multiple college campuses in the U.S.\n\n\"We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,\" Pollack said. \"The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community.\"\n\nOn Monday, NBC News reported the Biden administration is unveiling new efforts to combat antisemitism on college campuses across the country after an uptick in incidents since the conflict began in early October.\n\nThe proposal entails a partnership between the Department of Justice and Homeland Security and campus law enforcement agencies to track hate-related threats and provide federal resources to colleges, according to NBC News.\n\nGround attack will take place underground\n\nAs Israeli troops push deeper into Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, the ground attack won’t look quite like the traditional door-to-door skirmishes seen in Fallujah, Mosul and other past urban clashes. Instead, it will happen largely out of sight and underground, deep in a warren of connecting tunnels that Hamas has been digging and lining with concrete for more than a decade. The battle to control and destroy this subterranean labyrinth, estimated at more than 300 miles, will be a key strategy for the Israeli military, according to military analysts and experts – and will make the incursion into Gaza unlike any past urban conflict.\n\n“It’s going to be an undertaking like nothing the (Israel Defense Forces) has ever done,” said retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, who ran U.S. security coordination with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority from 2019 to 2021. “And frankly unlike anything we’ve ever done.”\n\n− Rick Jervis\n\nContributing: Vanessa Arredondo, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/02/israeli-ground-troops-have-neared-gaza-city-plus-usa-today-domestic-security-correspondent-josh-meye/71420159007/", "title": "Israeli ground troops have neared Gaza City: 5 Things podcast", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Israel reaches 'gates of Gaza City'\n\nIsraeli ground troops have neared Gaza City.

Today, Israeli ground troops move toward Gaza City. Plus we take a look at the drug Captagon, and its reported link to Hamas and the Justice Department expands its work against foreign agent activity.\n\n♦\n\nIsraeli troops approached Gaza City yesterday less than a week after launching a ground incursion into Gaza. Israeli airstrikes also continued pounding the Jabalia refugee camp and killed a key Hamas figure for a second day in a row. That's as Egypt allowed hundreds of foreign passport holders and dozens of seriously injured Palestinians to flee the Gaza Strip yesterday. The US State Department said the group included Americans and that hundreds of US citizens are seeking to leave the territory. The limited opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt came after weeks of talks between Egypt, Israel, the US, and Qatar, which mediates with Hamas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden again called for a humanitarian pause in the war. The Biden administration meanwhile is developing a national strategy to combat Islamophobia. The launch has been anticipated since the administration in May released a national strategy to combat antisemitism, which made reference to also countering hatred against Muslims. The Israel Hamas War has left a brutal death toll. According to the global charity Save the Children, more children have been killed in just over three weeks in Gaza than in all of the world's conflicts combined in each of the past three years. And during Hamas' October 7th rampage in Southern Israel, Israeli officials said babies and small children were among the more than 1,400 killed. About 30 children were also taken among the roughly 240 hostages taken by Hamas. Gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry says more than 3,600 Palestinian children have been killed. Part of more than 8,800 people killed in all in the territory.\n\n♦\n\nIsraeli security forces told USA TODAY that they found Captagon, a powerful stimulant used by ISIS fighters on killed and captured Hamas militants. I spoke with USA TODAY Domestic Security Correspondent Josh Meyer to learn more. Josh, thanks for hopping on.\n\nJohn Meyer:\n\nAlways a pleasure, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Josh, let's start here. What exactly is Captagon?\n\nJohn Meyer:\n\nYou know it's called by many names, the Jihadi drug, Captain Courage, the Poor Man's Cocaine but essentially it's a synthetic stimulant, very much like methamphetamine, and it's been made on the black market for many years now and made very popular by ISIS terrorists, or at least common by ISIS terrorists. And it is now believed to have been used by the Hamas terrorists in the October 7th brutal attacks on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people and in which more than 220 people were kidnapped.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. And Josh, what did these anonymous Israeli officials say about the drug being found on some of the Hamas fighters who raided Israel last month?\n\nJohn Meyer:\n\nWell, I've been trying for weeks now to get the Israeli government to confirm that they were found after there was a report by an Israeli TV show, but nobody was talking. But my partner Kim, found two Israeli security officials with direct knowledge of the matter and they confirmed to us that this substance was found on at least some of the Hamas fighters that were killed during or after the raids on Israel and also on some of the ones that were captured. So interrogations of them may provide more information about whether and how widespread the use of Captagon was by the people doing the attacks.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJosh, one expert you spoke with said this October 7th series of Hamas attacks seemed to really differ from their usual playbook. How might Captagon have influenced militants to carry out these brutal atrocities?\n\nJohn Meyer:\n\nI mean, so when ISIS was using it, ISIS became notorious for being really, really brutal, public beheadings, torture and so forth, burning people alive. That is different than Hamas had been before. Hamas was considered a US designated terrorist organization for many years, but according to Anne Speckhard, who I talked to, this is not the kind of viciousness and brutality that she knew Hamas to be engaged in 20 years of studying the group and interviewing Hamas fighters. So she said that this is sort of something different. She wasn't sure if it could be linked to Captagon, but she said it makes sense that this could have been what made them so violent and so brutal.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Josh, does the US have any strategy for disrupting Captagon supply flows in the Middle East or elsewhere?\n\nJohn Meyer:\n\nIt does actually. So the US is very concerned about it. A lot of the terrorists and militants that have been fighting US troops in the Middle East, the US is concerned that they've been consuming a lot of Captagon. The annual sales and production of the drug is now in the billions of dollars. Earlier this year, the US government developed an inter-agency strategy for disrupting the global Captagon trafficking networks. And it's a very expansive program, it's multi agency and it's trying to shut down the network, which is operating right now from Italy to Malaysia, all across Europe and so forth. And the big concern, of course, is that the Assad regime in Syria is believed to be producing much or most of the Captagon worldwide.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJosh Meyer, fantastic insight for us as always. Thank you, Josh.\n\nJohn Meyer:\n\nMy pleasure. Thanks.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. took the witness stand yesterday in his father's real estate fraud trial. He became the first of the former President's children to testify in a case where $250 million in damages and a New York ban on the entire Trump organization is at stake. Donald Jr. Said he did not recall whether he worked on financial statements concerning his father's assets and liabilities. The New York Attorney General's office has described the statements from 2011 to 2021 as fraudulent and misleading and said they included highly inflated asset valuations. Don Jr. Said he was a point person on getting Trump hotel management deals done during that period, but he said when it came to various accounting issues, he relied on the expertise of others. Eric Trump is also expected to testify this week, followed by Ivanka Trump and their father next week.\n\n♦\n\nSenator Bob Menendez pleaded not guilty last week to conspiring to act as a foreign agent while serving as a public official. The latest criminal charge against him marks an expansion of the justice department's work against foreign agent activity. I spoke with USA TODAY, Justice Department correspondent Aysha Bagchi for more. Aysha, thanks for hopping on 5 Things.\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nThanks. I'm glad to be here.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Senator Bob Menendez pleaded not guilty this week to conspiring to act as a foreign agent while serving as a public official. Those charges were added to an already existing indictment. Aysha, what exactly is at issue in this case?\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nWell, the new charge is a charge that, based on my reporting with my colleague Josh Meyer, hasn't actually been brought very often, if at all. It has to do with the prohibition in the law against public officials acting as foreign agents of foreign governments. And what the Justice Department is saying here is that Senator Bob Menendez was acting as a foreign agent on behalf of the Egyptian government, and the charges really have to do with Bob Menendez's role in foreign policy. He was the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during the years that are really the focus of the indictment from 2018 to 2022. And according to prosecutors, that money had a lot of influence over military sales and military aid to Egypt. And the senator has denied the allegations. He pleaded not guilty and said he looks forward to being exonerated in court.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Aysha, this Menendez foreign agent charge builds on the justice department's work more broadly against foreign agent activity. Why have they upped their focus on this and what are some other cases they've honed in on?\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nAs part of our reporting we have basically learned that the Justice Department started taking a particular law, that has been on the books for decades, much more seriously following the 2016 presidential election. The law is called the Foreign Agents Registration Act or FARA. There actually has been a unit within the Justice Department going back a long time that is dedicated to dealing with this law. But that unit did not bring many prosecutions until after the 2016 election. And it seems like the big driver between the change in behavior and the more aggressive stance from the Justice Department had to do with concerns about foreign interference, especially Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBut then those prosecutions took on a life of their own. You can see the Justice Department bringing prosecutions, not just having to do with issues about election interference, but even more broadly with this law that has to do with people who are acting on behalf of foreign governments needing to register and identify themselves, basically to prevent covert foreign influence in the American process. Here they have brought a charge that is tied back to that registration law, but it actually has to do with public officials being prohibited from ever acting as an agent on behalf of a foreign government as defined by whether they needed to register under the law. But even if they registered, they're just not allowed to do it.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what are the concerns about possible government overreach with this expansion of foreign agent related prosecutions?\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nBecause the government has been bringing prosecutions under this law, FARA, recently and there hadn't been a big track record before of what those prosecutions look like and what the government would go after, there are big question marks about the line between acting on behalf of a foreign government and just using your normal speech rights. As part of our reporting, we talked to people who are concerned about prosecutors using the law to go after nonprofits, maybe partisans and Congress pushing for FARA to be a means of prosecuting people who just advocate for things that you don't like. And the question about when you're lobbying for a foreign government can be kind of a tricky line to draw.\n\nAnd some people told us that they are concerned that the point of these prosecutions is supposed to be or should be about espionage, really preventing foreign influence, spying, those types of things within the United States, but that there's a risk of this going further and you can actually see a series of letters from people in Congress today that have encouraged the Justice Department to look into the activities of nonprofits. Of course, there are two sides to this debate. There is a law that says you're supposed to register if you are acting on behalf of a foreign government seeking to influence our policy. But we have definitely heard concerns about this being used as a kind of political football to just go after people who say things that you don't like.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Aysha Bagchi covers the Justice Department for USA today. Aysha, thank you so much for your time on this. Really appreciate it.\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nThanks, Taylor. Happy to be here.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe Federal Reserve held its key interest rates steady yesterday, but left the door open to another hike possibly as soon as next month. That's amid a strong economy and job market. The decision leaves the Fed's benchmark short-term rate at a 22-year high of 5.25 to 5.5% after an aggressive campaign of rate increases aimed at taming the nation's most severe inflation surge in four decades. This marks the first time the Fed has left its federal funds rate unchanged at consecutive meetings in nearly two years.\n\n♦\n\nBe sure to stay tuned to the 5 Things channel this afternoon for another special, this time on how climate change is upending our fishing industry.

Hospitals say they are running low on medical supplies and fuel for emergency generators amid a territory-wide power blackout. Israel is still launching waves of airstrikes across Gaza that have destroyed entire neighborhoods, as Palestinian militants fire rocket barrages into Israel.\n\nThe opening came after two weeks of after more than a week of high-level diplomacy by various mediators, including visits to the region by U.S. President Joe Biden and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Israel had insisted that nothing would enter Gaza until some 200 people captured by Hamas were freed, and the Palestinian side of the crossing had been shut down by Israeli airstrikes.\n\nThe head of the U.N.’s World Food Program said the aid was insufficient. “The situation is catastrophic in Gaza,” Cindy McCain told The Associated Press. “We need many, many, many more trucks and a continual flow of aid,\" she said, adding that some 400 trucks were entering Gaza daily before the war.\n\nThe opening came hours after Hamas released an American woman and her teenage daughter, the first captives to be freed after the militant group's Oct. 7 incursion into Israel. It was not immediately clear if there was any connection between the two.\n\n“Our fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear,” President Joe Biden said. “These individuals and their families will have the full support of the United States government as they recover and heal, and we should all respect their privacy in this moment.”\n\nIsrael-Hamas War newsletter:Sign up to get the latest news and analysis from USA TODAY into your inbox.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n∎ The border crossing between Egypt and Gaza opened on Saturday, letting first aid convoy inside the besieged Palestinian territory.\n\n∎ The death toll of Israelis and Palestinians surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five wars involving the narrow, densely populated strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n∎ The Israel Defense Forces said Friday more than 1,400 people have died and 4,600 others are injured. In Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said 4,137 people have died and 13,162 are injured.\n\n∎ Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Friday that following the defeat of the Hamas militant group, the Israeli military does not plan to control “life in the Gaza Strip,” The Associated Press reported. Gallant further added that there are three planned phases for the Israel-Hamas war, including airstrikes, ground maneuvers and the eventual ceasing of “responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip.”\n\n∎ The Israel Defense Ministry in a statement Friday said the majority of the 200 people taken hostage by Hamas are still alive, according to CNN. The IDF said about 10-20 of the hostages are over the age of 60; over 20 are under the age of 18.\n\n∎ The UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestine refugees, issued a statement on X on Friday saying two workers were killed in Gaza. Since the war began, there have been a total of 16 UNRWA workers killed. “UNRWA continues to advocate for adherence to international humanitarian law – @UN staff and civilians must be protected at all times,” the agency said.\n\n∎ Spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Ravina Shamdasani on Friday said 14 Palestinians were reportedly killed in a drone strike on Thursday.\n\nTwo Americans held hostage by Hamas are freed\n\nJudith Tai Raanan and Natalie Shoshana Raanan, the mother and daughter released Friday after being held hostage by Hamas, had been visiting Israel from their home in suburban Chicago.\n\nThey were released by Hamas' armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, which said they were freed for \"for humanitarian reasons,” Reuters reported. CNN, citing a source familiar with the negotiations, said the two have been handed over to the Red Cross and are “on their way out.” They are being released because the mother is in poor health, CNN said.\n\nUri Raanan, 71, said he saw the news Friday that Hamas was releasing an American mother and daughter, and he spent the day hoping they meant his daughter, Judith, and granddaughter, Natalie.\n\nUri said he has spoken to Judith since her release and believes she will be home soon.\n\n“She’s doing good. She’s doing very good,” Uri, who is based in the Chicago suburb of Bannockburn, said Friday. “I’m in tears, and I feel very, very good.”\n\nNatalie and Judith are believed to be on their way to Tel Aviv to reunite with relatives before returning to the U.S., Uri said, meaning his granddaughter will be able to celebrate her 18th birthday next week with family and friends.\n\nMeir Hecht, a rabbi in Evanston, Illinois, told USA TODAY earlier this week that Judith worked in health care and was a bright, kind and involved member of the community. Her teen daughter recently graduated from Deerfield High School and loved art and animals, he said.\n\nThe pair had planned to visit relatives in Israel for about six weeks, he said.\n\nThey were staying in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, near the Gaza Strip, as house guests when the attack began Oct. 7, according to the Israeli Prime Minister's Office.\n\nAfter their disappearance, the Israeli government and the U.S. State Department confirmed to the women's relatives that they were hostages in Gaza, said Hecht, who has remained in constant touch with the family. But they had received no further word on their condition.\n\nThe community north of Chicago prayed for their release over nearly two weeks, the rabbi said, while the women's relatives endured “unimaginable” pain.\n\nThe two Americans are among at least 199 hostages that have been held since Hamas staged a surprise attack on southern Israel two weeks ago, killing more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers.\n\nIsrael responded by hitting Gaza with a series of airstrikes that the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry says has killed 2,800 people. Israel also has been setting the stage for a ground invasion that could begin any day. Fears are rising that other countries and groups could get pulled into the conflict, causing it to engulf the Middle East.\n\n- Chris Kenning, Joey Garrison and Michael Collins\n\nUN: ‘Restrictions’ preventing humanitarian aid into Gaza at Egypt border\n\nAt the Egyptian border, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that “restrictions” are preventing humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, which has been cut off by Israel from food, water, fuel and electricity since Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack.\n\n“We are actively engaging with all the parties in order to clarify these restrictions so we can have these trucks moving towards where they’re needed. We need these trucks moving as soon as possible,” said Guterres, adding: “We have two million people here who are suffering tremendously.”\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, on Friday wrote on X, \"We hope the Rafah crossing will open today. More delays will result in more suffering and more deaths.\"\n\nUS and EU reaffirm support for Israel, express concern over Gaza\n\nFollowing a U.S.-European Union summit in Washington D.C. on Friday, American and EU officials demonstrated continued support for Israel in its military operation but said it should be in accordance with international law, including humanitarian law.\n\n“We will work closely with partners in the region to stress the importance of protecting civilians, supporting those who are trying to get to safety or provide assistance, and facilitating access to food, water, medical care, and shelter,” a joint statement said. “We are concerned by the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It is crucial to prevent regional escalation.”\n\nOfficials also expressed joint support for a two-state solution.\n\nIn a call Friday morning, Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed plans to get humanitarian aid into Gaza through Egypt. Biden also reiterated the “importance of operating consistent with the law of war to include the protection of civilians in Gaza,” the White House said.\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff tells Jewish students: \"It's been a tough couple of weeks\"\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff stopped by a Jewish day school on Friday in Washington, D.C., to talk with students about the war in Israel. Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, is the first Jewish spouse of a U.S. president or vice president.\n\n\"It's been a tough couple of weeks,\" he said as he spoke to a group of eighth graders. \"My emotions are very raw.\"\n\nThe second gentleman told students that President Joe Biden held his hand after the attack, looked him in the eye and asked him how he was doing.\n\n\"It really helped me get out there and speak about how horrible the situation is and how I was feeling,\" Emhoff told the students.\n\nHis visit on Friday to Milton Gottesman Jewish Day School was his second to the campus. Emhoff visited to help students prepare for Passover at the school in April 2022.\n\nEmhoff has emerged as an important conduit between the Biden administration and the Jewish community. The White House said Thursday that Emhoff met in Washington, D.C., with Natalie Sanandaji, an American who survived Hamas' attack on a music festival in Israel.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nBiden administration requests billions from Congress for aid to Israel, Ukraine\n\nThe Biden administration formally asked Congress for more than $105 billion in emergency funding for the wars in Israel and Ukraine. The aid package earmarks $10.6 billion for military support for Israel.\n\nThe aid package, however, cannot pass through Congress until the House of Representatives names a speaker. The chamber has been without a speaker for more than two weeks, since lawmakers ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., during a vote triggered by a group of conservative rebels. Republicans have been unable to elect a successor for McCarthy, bringing the business of the House to a standstill.\n\nBiden, during a primetime address from the White House on Thursday, argued that U.S. leadership abroad and congressional aid to both countries is essential.\n\n\"Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy,\" Biden said.\n\nHistoric Greek Orthodox church hit by Israeli airstrike in Gaza City\n\nAn Israeli airstrike hit a Greek Orthodox church in Gaza City late Thursday, resulting in an unverified number of death and injuries, along with displacing Palestinians who were taking refuge there. The Gaza health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said at least 16 people were killed and many others were injured in the blast.\n\nMohammed Abu Selmia, director general of Shifa Hospital, told The Associated Press that dozens were wounded at the Church of Saint Porphyrios but could not give a precise death toll because bodies were still under the rubble. The Holy Orthodox Order of the Holy Great Martyr George confirmed the blast, adding that more than 500 people were being housed at the church and monastery.\n\n\"The bombs hit the two church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping. Presently, survivors are searching the rubble for other casualties,\" the order said in a statement Thursday.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, a child of Palestinian and Syrian immigrants, confirmed Friday that several of his relatives died at Saint Porphyrios Orthodox Church where they had been sheltering when the airstrike hit.\n\n“The Palestinian Christian community has endured so much. Our family is hurting badly. May God watch over all Christians in Gaza—and all Israelis and Palestinians who are suffering, whatever their religion or creed,” Amash said.\n\nIsrael acknowledged the blast on Friday, issuing a statement that the church was not the intended target of the airstrike.\n\nThe blast comes after an explosion Tuesday that rocked the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, in whose compound many Palestinians had been seeking refuge from the persistent Israeli bombardment. According to a preliminary U.S. intelligence analysis, the death toll was on the \"low end\" of 100 to 300.\n\nWesterners accused of 'hypocrisy' for silence during Israeli war crimes\n\nHuman Rights Watch has accused Western states like the U.S. and Europe of \"double standards\" for their failure to condemn Israel's war crimes in the Gaza conflict.\n\nThe agency said American and European governments quickly condemned war violations by Russian forces, including surprise attacks, unlawful killings, and torture. Eighteen months later, Hamas was denounced for the surprise assault on Israel. But since Oct. 7, these states have been mostly silent about Israel's actions in Gaza, HRW said in a statement.\n\n\"Where is the outrage at statements by Israeli political leaders that seek to blur the all-important distinction between civilians and combatants in Gaza even as they order ever more intense bombardment of this densely populated territory, reducing city blocks and neighborhoods to rubble?\" said HRW Deputy Program Director Tom Porteous. \"Where are the clear and unequivocal calls for Israel to respect international norms in its attack on Gaza, let alone for accountability?\"\n\nThe agency said the Western state's hypocrisy is \"flagrant and obvious,\" and they risk undermining years of humanitarian efforts to standardize norms that protect civilians during times of conflict.\n\nWhat is the IDF?\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces, also known as the IDF, is the national military of Israel. It has three branches: the army, navy and air force. It is a conscripted military service, meaning Israel mandates IDF service for Jewish, Druze and Circassian citizens over the age of 18, with some exceptions. It was established in 1948, two weeks after Israel became an independent country.\n\nBefore the war began, the IDF had 169,500 active troops and was the 28th largest military in the world by active personnel, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance 2023. There were also 465,000 reserve personnel to supplement active military forces if deemed necessary.

The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material, and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/15/israel-hamas-war-live-updates/71194572007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war updates: Families of hostages are notified", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israeli-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken will return to Israel on Monday after completing a six-nation sweep across the region aimed at preventing the war from spreading, and he’s bringing back critical words from a neighbor.\n\nState-run media in Egypt, one of the countries Blinken visited, reported that President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi told him Israel’s pounding of Gaza last week exceeded \"the right of self-defense\" and turned into \"a collective punishment.\" The conflict, which has killed more than 4,000 people, has raised concern that it could spark a wider regional war.\n\nIn Cairo, Blinken once again underscored President Joe Biden's position that the U.S. would support Israel “today, tomorrow and every day,” but also said Israel must take “every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians.”\n\nThe last topic is particularly sensitive not only because of the respect for human life the U.S. and Israel share but also because a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza could inflame public opinion in the Arab world, possibly hurting efforts to improve relations between Israel and other Middle East countries that have been warming up to that notion.\n\nSome analysts have said sabotaging those efforts was a major goal of Hamas’ attack. The growing desperation in Gaza for water, food, fuel and medicines after Israel cut those off could play into Hamas' hands.\n\nBlinken told reporters there was a common theme to the feedback he heard from Arab leaders during his trip: \"A determination of shared view that we have to do everything possible to make sure this doesn’t spread to other places, a shared view to safeguard innocent lives, a shared view to get assistance to Palestinians in Gaza who need it, and we’re working very much on that.\"\n\nThe Associated Press, citing a senior administration official, reported Sunday that Biden is considering a trip to Israel in the coming days but no travel has been finalized. The move would be considered a powerful symbol of sympathy and support following the brutal attack by Hamas, but also potentially viewed as tone-deaf by Arab nations as civilian casualties mount in Gaza.\n\nIsrael-Hamas War newsletterSign up to get the latest news and analysis from USA TODAY into your inbox.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Ambassador David Satterfield was appointed Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues, where he will focus on ensuring \"life-saving assistance can reach vulnerable people throughout the Middle East,\" the State Department announced Sunday.\n\n∎ Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where thousands have sought safety, said it would bury 100 bodies in a mass grave after its morgue overflowed. \"An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding under our eyes,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, adding that it can no longer provide humanitarian assistance.\n\n∎ The United Nations said about 1 million Gaza residents have been displaced in just a week, about half of them finding refuge in U.N. schools and other facilities where water supplies are diminishing.\n\n∎ Pope Francis renewed his appeal for peace, restraint and release of the hostages: \"I strongly demand that children, the elderly, women, and all civilians are not victims of the conflict.\"\n\nMass evacuation of Gaza surpasses 600,000\n\nIsraeli authorities notified 155 families their loved ones were being held by Hamas on Sunday, when the war intensified as the number of Palestinians who have evacuated northern Gaza surpassed 600,000.\n\nIsrael has ordered more than 1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza ahead of an impending ground invasion, creating a humanitarian crisis that has brought protests from the U.N. and around the world. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said thousands had already left despite efforts by Hamas to slow the process.\n\nTo help expedite it, the IDF vowed not to carry out operations along the primary road south from northern Gaza from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday and encouraged residents to take advantage of that window of time. \"Be assured, Hamas leaders have already ensured their safety and that of their families,\" the IDF said in social media posts.\n\nHagari told the families of hostages the military is making every effort possible to free them.\n\n“To the families of the hostages, I know that for you every second is an eternity. We will do everything to bring your loved ones home,” Hagari said in a translation by the Times of Israel.\n\nBiden: Reoccupying Gaza would be a 'big mistake'\n\nIn an interview with \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday, President Joe Biden warned Israel not to reoccupy Gaza, saying it would be \"a big mistake.\" Biden, who spoke with CBS' Scott Pelley, said: \"What happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don’t represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again.\"\n\nBut \"taking out the extremists\" there, Biden added, \"is a necessary requirement.\"\n\nBiden also said he supported a humanitarian corridor to aid civilians impacted by the conflict and to allow people to leave Gaza.\n\nU.N. calls for hostages release, access to aid\n\nSecretary-General of the U.N. António Guterres on Sunday made a humanitarian appeal on X, formerly known as Twitter, asking Hamas to release hostages without conditions, and asking Israel to allow fast and \"unimpeded\" aid for the civilians of Gaza.\n\n\"Each one of these two objectives are valid in themselves,\" he said in the message. \"They should not become bargaining chips and they must be implemented because it is the right thing to do.\"\n\nGuterres said in a statement that Gaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies. The U.N. said it has food, medical supplies, and fuel stocks in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel, which can be dispatched within a couple hours but officials need to make sure they can travel safely through Gaza.\n\nWhite House condemns murder of 6-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois\n\nOn Sunday evening, the White House released a statement condemning the stabbing murder of a 6-year-old boy in Illinois in what officials are calling a hate crime.\n\nA 71-year-old Illinois man was accused Sunday of fatally stabbing a 6-year-old and seriously injuring a 32-year-old woman. Authorities believe it was a targeted attack in response to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe suspect was identified as Joseph Czuba, of Plainfield Township, and was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the sheriff's office.\n\n“The child’s Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek—a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace,” Biden said in a release. “This horrific act of hate has no place in America.”\n\nBiden urged Americans to come together and reject Islamophobia.\n\nPope Francis calls for humanitarian corridors\n\nPope Francis on Sunday made an appeal to establish humanitarian corridors to provide aid to people under siege in Gaza, and for Hamas to release its hostages, according to Reuters.\n\n\"I forcefully ask that children, the sick, the elderly and women, and all civilians do not become the victims of the conflict,\" he said during his weekly address in St. Peter's square. \"May humanitarian rights be respected, above all in Gaza, where it is urgent and necessary to guarantee humanitarian corridors to help the entire population,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday the Vatican offered to mediate in the conflict.\n\nSen Graham to Iran: 'If you escalate this war, we're coming for you'\n\nA day after Iran’s foreign minister warned Israel that its attacks on Gaza could fuel expansion of the war across the Middle East, Sen. Lindsey Graham warned Iran that it could become a U.S. military target if it attempts to expand the war. Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian had said if Lebanon-based militant Hezbollah, funded by Iran, joins the battle it would \"cause a huge earthquake\" in Israel.\n\n“While a great number of Palestinians are being killed by the Zionist regime on a daily basis, the US administration calls on others to show self-restraint,\" Amirabdollahian said.\n\nGraham, speaking Sunday on \"Meet the Press,\" applauded President Joe Biden for his strong support of Israel and said the Israeli military was trying to destroy Hamas while protecting as many Palestinians as possible.\n\n\"Here's my message,\" the Republican from South Carolina said. \"If Hezbollah, which is a proxy of Iran, launches a massive attack on Israel, I would ... introduce a resolution in the United States Senate to allow military action by the United States in conjunction with Israel to knock Iran out of the oil business. Iran, if you escalate this war, we're coming for you.\"\n\nSee how US Navy shipsin the Mediterranean are positioned to support Israel\n\nUS, Britain trying to get Rafah crossing into Egypt opened\n\nThe U.S. and British governments are pushing for the Rafah crossing into Egypt to be opened so their citizens can escape the war and humanitarian aid can come into Gaza, the BBC reported Sunday.\n\nThe crossing in southern Gaza is controlled by Egypt, Israel and Hamas, and British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC he was working with the first two and other influential entities in the region to facilitate passage.\n\nAmerican and British nationals in Gaza are being told to head south and be on the alert for an announcement of the crossing opening, which may come suddenly and be in effect for a limited time.\n\nHezbollah, Israel clash on border\n\nIsraeli fighter jets were striking Hezbollah military infrastructure in Lebanon on Sunday, the IDF said. Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel, and Israel returned the fire, the IDF said.\n\nHezbollah spokeswoman Rana Sahili said the fighting doesn't indicate Hezbollah has decided to fully enter the war. She described the clashes as “only skirmishes” representing a \"warning\" if Israel does not cease its attack on the civilian population in Gaza.\n\nIsrael says it killed key Hamas commander\n\nThe IDF said it killed Billal Al Kedra, who led the Hamas commando forces responsible for the Kibbutz Nirim massacre in the early hours of the Oct. 7 invasion. More than 100 men, women and children were slaughtered and dozens of homes destroyed in the kibbutz, less than a mile from the Gaza border, Israeli authorities say.\n\n\"IDF fighter jets operated in Gaza and neutralized Billal Al Kedra,\" the IDF said in a statement that included video of the strike. \"Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist operatives were also neutralized.\"\n\nWHO says Israel's hospital evacuation orders are a 'death sentence'\n\nThe World Heath Organization pleaded with Israel on Sunday to immediately reverse evacuation orders for hospitals in northern Gaza, saying the deadlines are impossible to meet and risk additional loss of life.\n\nFuel is expected to run out at Nasser Hospital in Gaza by Monday, hospital critical care consultant Dr. Mohammed Qandeel said. That could mean death for some seriously wounded Gazans who have taken refuge there, Qandeel said. Basic supplies are also scarce.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that attacks on health care facilities are already causing additional deaths and injuries. He added that health workers were \"staying by their patients’ sides.\" WHO called on Israel to protect health facilities, health workers, patients and civilians.\n\n\"The health situation in north Gaza is dire,\" Tedros wrote on social media. \"Evacuation orders by Israel to hospitals are practically impossible to implement and are a death sentence for the sick and injured.\"\n\nCongressional delegation scrambles for cover in Tel Aviv\n\nA bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation was in Tel Aviv on Sunday when they were hustled into a shelter to wait out a rocket attack, Sen Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said.\n\n\"It shows you what Israelis have to go through,\" Schumer, who's Jewish, said on social media. \"We must provide Israel with the support required to defend itself.\"\n\nOther senators in the delegation include Republicans Mitt Romney of Utah and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana along with Democrats Mark Kelly of Arizona and Jacky Rosen of Nevada. Schumer described the delegation's meetings with Israeli leaders as productive and pledged to lead the Senate effort to provide Israel with the support required to defend itself from this \"monstrous attack\" from Hamas.\n\nIsrael restoring water service to southern Gaza, national security adviser says\n\nIsrael was restoring water service to southern Gaza on Sunday after initially cutting off water, food and fuel supplies following Hamas’ attack on Israel, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Aid workers, however, said they had yet to see water flowing out of taps.\n\nThe U.S. is working with Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the U.N. to ensure that \"innocent Palestinians get access to those basic necessities,” Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\nSullivan said the Biden administration still does not have precise information on the number of Americans being held hostage by Hamas or where they are being held. That's one reason the U.S has not sent Navy SEALs or other special forces to try to recover them, he said.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nPalestinian and Israeli death toll surpasses 4,000\n\nThe Palestinian death toll climbed to 2,670, the Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday, making this the deadliest of five Gaza wars for Palestinians. Another 9,600 have been wounded.\n\nMore than 1,400 Israelis have been killed in the initial assault by Hamas and subsequent rocket attacks from Gaza, the IDF said. The overwhelming majority of all those killed in the war were civilians. For Israel, this is the deadliest war since the 1973 conflict with Egypt and Syria.\n\nThe State Department on Sunday confirmed the deaths of 30 U.S. citizens and said that 13 Americans are missing and feared killed or taken hostage.\n\n\"We extend our deepest condolences to the victims and to the families of all those affected,\" the State Department said. \"The U.S. government is working around the clock to determine their whereabouts and is working with the Israeli government on every aspect of the hostage crisis, including sharing intelligence and deploying experts from across the United States government to advise the Israeli government on hostage recovery efforts.\"\n\nIsrael said at least 155 people were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza, an undetermined number of them Americans.\n\nLooking from afar:People with loved ones in Israel, Gaza with constant trauma\n\nCrisis touches families, loved ones around the world\n\nPeople with ties to the region are dealing with traumatic stress even though they may be thousands of miles from the conflict. The war between Israel and Hamas has inflicted an immediate crisis far beyond the Middle East, touching loved ones’ lives abroad, and placing Americans living far from kibbutzim and refugee camps in a state of constant emergency. Mental health experts warn that the violent, shocking images and news about the conflict exacerbate traumatic stress. The barrage of information and images can have profound effects on health and well-being.\n\n“What we are seeing right now is needless, preventable suffering,” said Dr. Alishia Moreland-Capuia, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard and the founder and director of the Institute for Trauma-Informed Systems Change at McLean Hospital, near Boston.

Logan had come to the temple to pray one last time, and to tell Minkowicz what he had decided.\n\nMinkowicz, who leads Chabad Lubavitch of Southwest Florida, has been working to counsel those distraught by the attack. Many in his congregation have lived in Israel or have family there, sheltering in bunkers or joining the army. A number of them feel adrift, terrified for their loved ones abroad, he said.\n\nSome, like Logan, have left to join the fight. Others wish they could help protect their country and their families. But the fact that they can’t is a constant source of pain and anger.\n\nLogan, who holds dual citizenship with the U.S. and Israel, is one of roughly 360,000 reservists Israel has mobilized, and could soon be deployed on a ground offensive into Gaza.

Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas who's the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Hamas onslaught Saturday likely resulted from a \"failure of intelligence'' and that it was uncertain how both the U.S. and Israel were caught by surprise.\n\n“We know that Egypt had warned the Israelis three days prior that an event like this could happen,” McCaul told reporters. \"We know that this had been planned perhaps as long as a year ago.''\n\nMcCaul added that \"a warning was given,'' but it wasn't clear at what level of government.\n\nNetanyahu has denied having prior knowledge of the attack, calling those reports \"absolutely false.\" Other reports indicate the information may have been passed along but never reached his desk because it lacked details.\n\nMcCaul said the focus now is on keeping the conflict from expanding with the involvement of other militant groups in the region.\n\n\"We're very concerned about the fidelity of our intelligence and the escalation of a conflict in the Middle East that could turn into a global Jihad movement in Israel,'' he said.\n\nUS casting wide net in search for missing Americans\n\nIn addition to the 22 Americans killed, 17 Americans are still missing in Israel following the Hamas attack, the White House said Wednesday – and the figures could rise further.\n\n\"I think we all need to steel ourselves for the very distinct possibility that these numbers will keep increasing,\" said John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security matters. \"We might find out that more Americans are part of the hostage pool.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. knows some of the Americans − a \"very small\" number − are being held hostage by Hamas but does not know their condition or location. He said the administration is doing \"everything we can\" to locate them and bring them home.\n\n\"We don't know if they're all in one group or broken up into several groups. We don't know if they're being moved and with what frequency and to what locations,\" Kirby said. “Tough to get more detail.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. is \"casting the net wide\" on hostage-recovery efforts, citing discussions with the Israeli government, other Middle East allies and countries such as Qatar that \"that have open lines of communication with Hamas.\"\n\nThe rising death toll is eight more than the 14 Americans who were confirmed dead Tuesday.

Ford aircraft carrier off the coast of Israel, where it was deployed shortly after the Hamas attack. But the combination gives the U.S. a powerful presence in those waters.\n\n\"We’re sending a loud and clear message that the United States is ready to take action should any actor hostile towards Israel consider trying to escalate or widen this war,\" Kirby said.\n\nIsrael announces bipartisan war Cabinet: 'Israel first of all'\n\nThe Israeli government established a bipartisan war Cabinet to focus on war issues. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be joined by a leading opposition figure, former Defense Minister Benny Gantz and current Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\n\"Israel first of all,\" Gantz tweeted.\n\nHamas has said it kidnapped more than 100 Israeli soldiers, men, women, children and older adults and are holding them in Gaza. The Israel government, under intense public pressure to eradicate Hamas, has mobilized 360,000 reservists and could be preparing to launch a ground offensive into Gaza, possibly within days.\n\nEU will continue to financially support Palestinians\n\nEU foreign ministers, meeting in a teleconference, agreed overwhelmingly to continue financial support for Palestinians, said Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Borrell cited a \"clear distinction\" between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, which controls the smaller West Bank enclave. Hamas is a terrorist organization while the Palestinian Authority is an EU partner, he said.\n\n\"Not all the Palestinian people are terrorists,\" Borrell said. \"So a collective punishment against all Palestinians will be unfair and unproductive. It will be against our interests and the interest of the peace.\"\n\nThe ministers also reiterated a long-term commitment to a political solution based on creation of a free Palestinian state.

The raids began at dawn Wednesday and continued into the day, targeting farmland, police stations, government buildings, factories and other crucial locations, the online outlet reported. Emergency vehicles have been unable to reach some of the battered areas because of the intensity of the raids.\n\nWho is Hamas leader Mohammed Deif?\n\nIsraeli airstrikes late Tuesday struck the family house of Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ military wing, killing his father, brother and at least two other relatives in the southern town of Khan Younis, senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said. Deif has not been seen in public and Israeli authorities say they don't know where he is.\n\nOnline hate heats up as war intensifies\n\nGroups that study online hate speech say it has spiked in recent days – not just for Jewish communities but also for Palestinians. And representatives of both communities agree on one thing: U.S.-based social media companies are still not doing anywhere near enough to rid their platforms of hate against targeted groups.\n\n“When it comes to serious crises like these where you're going to see the worst of the worst types of violent content, gore, incitement to violence, it's really incumbent on social media companies to coordinate across platforms,” said Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center for Tech and Society, “in order to make sure that the platforms play the minimal amount of role possible in inflaming further violence.” Read more here.\n\n− Will Carless and Jessica Guynn\n\nSome colleges pull students from study abroad programs\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to more than two dozen colleges, many with a history of having a presence in Israel or large study abroad programs, to ask how their programs have been affected by the unfolding crisis.\n\nSome schools confirmed students have safely left the area. Others said students and staff remained in the region while their institutions monitor the situation and put in place new safety protocols. A small number of schools reported that by chance this semester they have no students and faculty studying in Israel.

The struggle to come home – and the fear for loved ones left behind in the deadly war zones of Gaza and Israel – is very real for many Americans as the world watches the violence abroad unfold.\n\nThe U.S. citizens longing to return to America include several people from church groups, including those in Naples, Florida, visiting Jerusalem for religious reasons, Salt Lake City-based Palestinian-Americans visiting family members and New Jersey Jewish residents who were celebrating the Simchat Torah holiday. They told the USA TODAY Network their trips turned from a tranquil, joyous crusade away from home into a nightmare from which they needed to swiftly escape.\n\nMark Schwartz, a councilman and volunteer firefighter in Teaneck, New Jersey, and his friends where among those who traveled to Israel for Simchat Torah.\n\n\"I got a flight to Bulgaria and will somehow get to New Jersey,\" Schwartz told NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network. “Everyone is in a mournful mood.\" Read more here.\n\n− Kayla Jimenez\n\nWhy did Hamas attack Israel now?\n\nHamas has vowed to annihilate Israel and for years has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and other deadly attacks. On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.\n\nHamas says the assault was a response to activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem that is the third holiest site in Islam. The site, which is also located on the holiest site for Jews − who refer to it as the Temple Mount − has long been a flashpoint between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli security services routinely raid the compound.\n\nBut Hamas leaders also say they were pushed to attack because of unrelenting Israeli crackdowns on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − thousands of prisoners being held in Israeli jails and Israel's blockade of Gaza.\n\nIsrael countered by declaring war against Hamas and ordered its military to undertake take a \"complete siege\" of Gaza.\n\nOnline hate surges:Why everyone is blaming social media.\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nHow large is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian exclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nHow did the hostilities between Israel and Palestinians start?\n\nThe current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel, which prides itself on its military prowess, and the Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since 1948 when Israel was founded and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip.\n\nAt the center of the conflict: Who has the right to the land? Both Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem.\n\nBefore Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. In 1947, the United Nations adopted a resolution that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish. Large-scale migration of Jewish people to escape persecution, including by Nazis, prompted the U.N. solution.\n\nA war between Israel and its Arab neighbors surrounding its founding in 1948 led to Israeli expansion into 77% of Palestinian mandate territory, and over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or was expelled, according to the U.N.\n\nSeveral conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. The war also led to a second expulsion of Palestinians, according to the U.N.\n\nHamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means.\n\nPalestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation beginning in 1987 and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/11"}]}

He would have had trouble qualifying for the third Republican debate on Nov. 8 in Miami.\n\nAs supporters cheered, Pence told the Las Vegas forum that while he is leaving the presidential race, \"I will never leave the fight for conservative values.\"\n\nPence did not, however, endorse any of the remaining presidential candidates.\n\nPence, Trump and Jan. 6\n\nA former congressman and governor of Indiana, Pence may be back in the news in 2024. He may be called as a witness in the federal trial of Trump on charges that he tried to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the highest-profile moment of his political career, Pence refused Trump's demand that he, in his capacity as president of the Senate, throw out electoral votes that elected Biden. Pence said he lacked the legal right to essentially hand the election to Trump.\n\nThat decision preceded the pro-Trump insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021. It also drew continuous criticism of Pence by Trump and his allies, both before and during the vice president's brief presidential campaign.\n\nPence testified before a Jan. 6 grand jury in April.\n\nTrump told supporters in Las Vegas late Saturday that Pence should endorse him because “I made him vice president.” The former president added that he doubted he would get Pence’s supportbecause “people in politics are very disloyal.”\n\nEndorsement: Other candidates praise Pence\n\nSome of the remaining candidates quickly praised Pence, perhaps hoping he will endorse them.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, also speaking to the Republican Jewish Coalition, said the vice president has long fought for Israel, for Republicans, and for Americans in general.\n\n\"We all owe him a debt of gratitude,\" Haley said.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said on the social media site X, formerly Twitter, that Pence has been “a prayer partner, a friend, and a man of integrity and deep conviction.”\n\n“The Republican Party is stronger today” because of Pence’s leadership, Scott said. “I have no doubt Mike and Karen will continue to serve this nation and honor the Lord in all they do.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called Pence \"a principled man of faith who has worked tirelessly to advance the conservative cause.\"\n\n\"Casey and I appreciate Mike and Karen for their willingness to put themselves forward in this campaign and wish the Pence family well in their next steps,\" DeSantis said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie praised Pence’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021: “Mike Pence stood for the constitution of the United States. He deserves our thanks as Americans for putting his oath of office and the Constitution of the United States before personal and political pressure.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee said Pence's biggest problem was the Trump Republican agenda.\n\n\"Pence set the tone for the Republican primary, ensuring Republican candidates lined up behind an extreme agenda of banning abortion nationwide, slashing Social Security and Medicare, and campaigning for election deniers,\" said DNC spokesperson Sarafina Chitika. \"Good riddance.”\n\nNo traction against Trump\n\nPence ended his longshot bid for the GOP presidential nomination after being unable to gain traction in a party that has been transformed by the person he helped elect in 2016: Trump.\n\nThe first former vice president in modern times to run against the president under whom he served, Pence had been unfailingly loyal to Trump until the president pushed him to block Congress’ certification of their electoral loss.\n\nDuring the campaign, Pence said Trump disqualified himself for a second shot at the White House by asking him to ignore the Constitution.\n\nTrump responded by calling Pence disloyal. Other Republicans opposed to Trump, however, declined to get behind Pence's 2024 candidacy, pointing to his previous subservience to Trump during the 2016 campaign and the presidency.\n\nHistory also trended against Pence; of the last ten vice presidents, only two have been elected president: George H. W. Bush and Joe Biden.\n\nUnable to catch Trump\n\nSo far, Pence and other challengers have been unable to make Trump's legal problems an issue against him. The former president is dominating the field while Pence has been polling in the single digits and had lackluster fundraising.\n\nStill, running for president gave Pence the chance to be his own man after four years of bending himself to Trump’s will, and to tell his side of the story.\n\n“I do think Mike Pence wanted to reclaim his own identity,” David Axelrod, who served as senior advisor to former President Barack Obama, said on a recent episode of the podcast “Hacks on Taps.”\n\nPence tried to re-introduce himself\n\nPence had argued he was well known but not known well – and sought to reintroduce himself to voters.\n\nBut what he is most known for – Jan. 6 – kept coming up on the campaign trail. He was both attacked for his defiance of Trump and praised for it, though those who praised him weren’t necessarily going to vote for him.\n\nPence’s bid was also a bit of an about face from 2016. As Trump’s running mate, Pence lauded Trump for creating a movement.\n\nThis year, Pence warned Republicans that Trump’s populism is a “road to ruin” for the party.\n\nHe urged Republicans to return to the tenets of the pre-Trump GOP, limited government, social conservatism and hawkish national security.\n\nBut his throwback to Ronald Reagan Republicanism was not a winning message.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/01/2024-presidential-election-candidates-republican-democratic/11641319002/", "title": "2024 presidential candidates: A comprehensive list of everyone ...", "text": "The 2024 election cycle has kicked off.

In 2022, he threw his hat in the ring for the GOP nomination for Michigan governor before being disqualified because of invalid signatures.\n\nHis views: Johnson told a group of Iowa voters in July that he was \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, anti-woke and anti-China,\" − and \"if you don't like it, well, tough.\" His campaign's signature \"2 cents\" proposes cutting 2 cents off every dollar of federal discretionary spending.\n\nMore on Johnson's 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nLatest Perry Johnson news: Explore\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 37\n\nFamily: Ramaswamy married Apoorva Tewari, a throat surgeon and assistant professor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in 2015. The pair have two sons together.\n\nPrevious political experience: Ramaswamy is framing himself as an outsider, an entrepreneur-turned-political-hopeful who will give the establishment a run for its money.\n\nHe is a former biotech investor who founded pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. Ramaswamy left the company in 2020 amid clashes with colleagues over how to respond to the murder of George Floyd and the public outcry that followed. He now heads up Strive Asset Management.\n\nHe is the author of three books, including \"Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,\" which explores how American politics and capitalism have become increasingly intertwined.\n\nHis views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education.

He was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and has one brother.\n\nPrevious political experience: Scott first entered politics in 1995 during a special election for City Council in Charleston. His profile grew nationally when he suggested posting the 10 Commandments outside the council building, a proposal that was denied.\n\nScott served for two years in the state legislature before being elected in 2010 to the House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. He served one term before being appointed to the Senate by then-governor Nikki Haley and becoming the first Black U.S. senator from the state.\n\nScott is pitching himself as a more hopeful alternative to Trump, drawing on Reagan-era ideals and centering a tone of optimism.\n\nHis views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He’s anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his “signature legislation,” Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into “distressed communities” across the country.\n\nMore on Scott's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 76\n\nFamily: Trump is the son of real estate magnate Fred Trump. Born and bred in New York, he first made his name developing skyscrapers and casinos.\n\nTrump first married in 1977, wedding Czech-born model Ivana. The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.\n\nTrump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.\n\nPrevious political experience: When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nPrior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nMore on Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThird-party 2024 presidential candidates\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAge: 69\n\nFamily: Kennedy bears a powerful last name in Democratic politics.

Though he originally launched his campaign as a Democrat, Kennedy is now running on an Independent ticket.\n\nKennedy has been married three times and has six children. He wed current wife Cheryl Hines in 2014. Hines is a television star best known for her role on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"\n\nPrevious political experience: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison. In 2017, former President Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website.\n\nMore on Kennedy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical Party: Green Party\n\nThough West originally announced his candidacy under the People's Party, he later officially filed as a Green Party candidate.\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: West has been married five times and has two children.

He has taught at a number of Ivy League institutions and works now as a professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary.\n\nIn a video uploaded to Twitter, West announced his 2024 candidacy saying, \"I enter in the quest for truth, I enter in the quest for justice.\" As a third-party candidate, West alleged \"neither political party wants to tell the truth\" on various issues. His bid with the People's Party represents the first independent ticket to enter the race thus far.\n\nHis views: West is a proponent of Medicare for All, and removing oil and gas subsidies as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists \"end the wars\" as a key priority which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.\n\nMore on West's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThese presidential candidates have ended their 2024 campaigns\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 63\n\nFamily: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.\n\nPrevious political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat. He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.\n\nPence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself.\n\nHis views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate.

Prior to that he was Miami City commissioner and served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2022 to 2023.\n\nViews: Suarez has said he did not support Trump in either 2016 or 2020, instead using his ballot to write in the names of Florida Sen.

Suarez was excluded from the Republican debate stage since the Republican National Committee (RNC) qualifying rules required at least 1% in three national polls or a mix of national and early-state polls between July 1 and Aug. 21, and a minimum of 40,000 donors with 200 in 20 or more states.\n\nThe RNC concluded Suarez had not met the criteria and left him out of the Fox News-hosted encounter.\n\n“I agree that if you can’t meet the minimum thresholds, you shouldn’t be trying to take the time involved away from being productive,” Suarez said to reporters at the Iowa State Fair earlier this month.\n\nTrump skips Iowa:Trump gives priority to Palm Beach County, skipping major Iowa conference\n\nA Democratic National Committee spokesperson, Ammar Moussa, wrote in a statement after Suarez suspended his campaign: \"One fewer Republican who wants to ban abortion nationwide.

Ron DeSantis in what has become a heated battle for second place in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump still dominates the race. He’s ahead by 27 percentage points – a lead that has expanded slightly despite his mounting legal problems.\n\nA new Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows 43% of likely Republican caucusgoers choose Trump as their first choice for president, up from 42% in an August Iowa Poll.\n\nDeSantis and Haley are now tied for second place with 16%.\n\nThat’s a drop of 3 percentage points for DeSantis, who was the first choice of 19% of caucusgoers in August. And it’s a 10-point jump for Haley, who was at 6%.\n\n“You just have (Haley) rising. You have DeSantis kind of holding on for second place,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the Iowa Poll. “But both of them are on ground that you could only describe as shaky compared to the solid ground that Donald Trump stands on.\n\n“If anything, he’s showing improvement.”\n\nRecently, Haley and DeSantis have spent more time battling with each other than with Trump, particularly over their approach to the Israel-Hamas war. Each has targeted the other in television ads and on the campaign trail.\n\nAnd both candidates have recently announced they would increase their Iowa presence as the race to caucus day on Jan. 15 enters its final months.\n\nAaron Rush, a 39-year-old poll respondent from Waterloo, lists DeSantis as his top choice for president but is weighing supporting Haley. He said he’s been watching presidential polls and debates to help him decide between the two.\n\nMore than anything, he says, he wants to find a candidate who looks like they can beat Trump. He likes U.S. Sen. Tim Scott but doesn’t include him in his top two because of the senator’s poorer showing in other polls.\n\n\"The ability to beat Trump right now is more important than any sort of policy differences you're going to get between the rest of the field,” Rush said.\n\nThe remaining candidate pool is largely stagnant.\n\nScott is at 7%, down from 9%; former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 4%, down from 5%; entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy held steady at 4%; North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum rose from 2% to 3%; and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson rose from 0% to 1%.\n\nTexas pastor Ryan Binkley is at 0%, failing to gain support after also polling at 0% in the August Iowa Poll.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence dropped out of the race Saturday, saying “this is not my time.” The new Iowa Poll results backed that up, with only 2% of likely Republican caucusgoers naming him their first choice. That was down from 6% in the August Iowa Poll.\n\nPence’s first-choice votes were redistributed to poll respondents’ second-choice candidates in the poll.\n\nOverall, likely Republican caucusgoers say their first choice for president is more about issues (63%) than leadership style (29%) as they wade through the still-crowded field.\n\nThe poll of 404 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Oct. 22-26 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nNikki Haley rises with independents and suburbanites\n\nHaley has doubled her support with independents, which has helped propel her into the second-place tie, Selzer said.\n\nIn August, Trump and DeSantis were nearly evenly split among independent caucusgoers, with 21% supporting Trump as their first choice and 19% supporting DeSantis.\n\nBut Trump now leads DeSantis with independents 33% to 12%.\n\nAnd Haley has also overtaken the Florida governor with independents: 22% list her as their first choice for president – up from 10% in August.\n\n“This is a group that is fickle and on the small side,” Selzer said. But it could be an important group to watch as the race progresses, she said.\n\nIndependents make up 21% of the poll’s respondents.\n\nKelly Hester, a poll participant who identifies as an independent, said Haley is her top choice for president.\n\n“The Republicans have ticked me off as of lately with their stance on gay rights, transgender and especially abortion rights,” she said. “But I definitely lean Republican fiscally.”\n\nShe thinks Trump has “ticked off too many people” and won’t be able to defeat Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nHester said she saw Haley during the debates and appreciated her positions on foreign policy, abortion and border security, and she thinks Haley has a better shot at winning than Trump.\n\n“I would like to hear her (in person), because I'm not set in stone,” Hester, a Solon resident, said. “But so far, she's definitely been my favorite.”\n\nOne possible advantage for Haley, Selzer said, is that she gets support across a much broader demographic range than DeSantis.\n\nIn addition to her strong showing with independents, Haley leads both Trump and DeSantis with suburban poll respondents: 32% say Haley is their first pick for president. DeSantis is at 29%, and Trump is at 24%.\n\nHaley also leads DeSantis among those with a college degree, 22%-16%; among men 65 or older, 23%-17%; white women with a college degree, 24%-15%; and women 44 or younger, 22%-13%.\n\nDeSantis leads Haley among men under the age of 45, 22%-13%.\n\n“It's not just one particular group where she's really dug in,” Selzer said. “She's digging in across demographics.”\n\nSo how much crossover is there between supporters for Trump, DeSantis and Haley?\n\nOf those who name DeSantis as their first choice for president, 27% name Haley as their second choice. But 41% say their second choice is Trump.\n\nFor Haley, 34% of her first-choice supporters pick DeSantis as their second choice for president, 19% select Scott and 14% choose Burgum. Just 12% say Trump is their second-choice candidate.\n\n“To my mind, she's done the best job of differentiating that she is the non-Trump candidate, to the extent that they don't see him as even a second choice,” Selzer said.\n\nOf those who name Trump as their first choice for president, 41% say DeSantis is their second choice. Haley is at 16% and Ramaswamy is at 15%.\n\nTrump supporters are more enthusiastic, locked in than Haley or DeSantis supporters\n\nIn addition to leading overall, Trump performs better than his opponents across nearly every demographic the poll tested, including among first-time caucusgoers.\n\nTrump has maintained his lead there, with 49% of first-time caucusgoers saying he is their first choice. DeSantis is at 15%, and Haley is at 14%.\n\nThose who name Trump as their first choice are also more enthusiastic about their pick, the poll shows.\n\nOverall, 30% of likely caucusgoers say they are extremely enthusiastic about their first choice for president.\n\nAmong Trump voters, it’s 47% – about twice what it is among DeSantis voters (25%).\n\nAmong Haley voters, it is even lower, at 19%.\n\nThat may be a sign that although Haley is the only candidate seeing substantial upward momentum in this poll, Selzer said, the ground underneath her could be “a little shaky.”\n\nTrump’s support is also more firmly locked in.\n\nOverall, 54% percent of likely Republican caucusgoers have a first choice for president and say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. Fewer, 41%, say their minds are made up.\n\nBut that number is much higher among Trump supporters, with 63% percent saying their minds are made up. A smaller share, 37%, say they could still be persuaded to pick another candidate.\n\n“This solid ground is what makes people want to say he's invincible,” Selzer said of Trump.\n\nPoll respondent Dennis Canarsky, 73, said that as long as Trump is in the race, he plans to support him.\n\n“If Trump’s not running, I would have to look to see what (the other candidates) stand for,” Canarsky, a Republican, said. “Otherwise, it’s Trump all the way. He’s my hero. Him and Jesus are my heroes.”\n\nSupport for DeSantis and Haley is less solid.\n\nThirty percent of DeSantis’ supporters say their minds are made up, while 70% could still be persuaded.\n\nAnd for Haley, even fewer, 26%, say their minds are firmly made up. The rest, 74%, say they could still be persuaded.\n\nIs it inevitable that Donald Trump will win the Iowa Caucuses?\n\nTrump leads by a commanding margin, but Iowa caucusgoers have not shut the door on alternatives, the Iowa Poll suggests.\n\nIowa caucusgoers are known for considering many candidates before slowly zeroing in on one person by caucus day.\n\nThe poll shows that just 4% of respondents have narrowed the list of candidates they are considering to just one. Instead, 22% are considering two candidates and 72% are considering three or more candidates.\n\nOverall, 67% of likely Republican caucusgoers say they are considering caucusing for Trump, even if he is not their first choice.\n\nThat 67% includes the 43% who say he is their first choice, 12% who say he is their second choice and 12% who say they are actively considering him.\n\nTrump’s total is matched by the 67% who say they are considering caucusing for DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis’ universe of support includes the 16% who say he is their first choice, 27% who say he is their second choice and 25% who say they are actively considering him.\n\nAlthough Haley is tied with DeSantis overall, the poll shows she has a smaller universe of people considering her, at 54% (although that’s up from the 40% who were considering her in August).\n\nHer footprint includes the 16% who say she is their first choice, 17% who say she is their second choice and 22% who say they are actively considering her.\n\nScott follows with 49% who say they are actively considering him (down from 53%). That includes the 7% who name him as their first choice, 10% who name him as their second choice and 32% who are considering him.\n\n\"He's on the cusp of being in the top tier,” Selzer said. “Most of that is people saying that they're actively considering him. … But that's not where you want (your support) to be happening, unless you've got a very specific strategy that is designed to identify people who are on the edge and sort of make them – force them – to take a different look. Because the look they're getting now isn't sufficient to turn into first- or second-choice votes.”\n\nTrailing the polling leaders are Ramaswamy (32%, down from 34%), Burgum (19%, down from 23%) and Christie (16%, down from 21%).\n\nHutchinson and Binkley are in the single digits, with footprints of 9% and 6% respectively.\n\n“These are campaigns that don't appear to be getting traction,” Selzer said.\n\nRon DeSantis viewed favorably by highest percentage of Iowa GOP caucusgoers\n\nAlthough Scott had the highest net favorability rating in August, DeSantis now holds that title.\n\nToday, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 69%, up from 66% in August. And he is viewed unfavorably by 26%, down from 29%. Another 5% aren’t sure.\n\n“He’s likeable enough – with higher favorables than Trump,” Selzer said. “It’s just that many more want Trump as their first choice.”\n\nTrump is viewed favorably by 66% – a new high, after getting 65% in August. And he is viewed unfavorably by 32%, compared with 33% in August. Just 1% are not sure.\n\nScott also maintains high favorable ratings, with 61% saying they view him favorably, compared with 59% in August. Another 22% view him unfavorably, up from 17%. Another 17% are not sure.\n\nIn addition to climbing to tie for second place with DeSantis, Haley’s favorability ratings have also improved, though she remains lower than DeSantis, Trump and Scott.\n\nNow, she is viewed favorably by 59% of likely Republican caucusgoers, up from 53% in August. She is viewed unfavorably by 29%, up slightly from 26% in August. The percentage of those who are not sure about Haley has shrunk from 21% to 13% as she becomes better known.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy viewed more unfavorably in Iowa\n\nThree candidates are underwater with their favorability rating, viewed unfavorably by more likely caucusgoers than favorably: Binkley, Christie and Hutchinson.\n\nRamaswamy has become better known since August, when 41% of likely Republican caucusgoers didn’t know enough about him to say whether they had a favorable or unfavorable view of him.\n\nThat is down to 20% now following two national debates where Ramaswamy claimed the spotlight – but his negatives almost doubled during that same time.\n\nThe percentage of those who view him unfavorably has risen from 20% to 37%, while the percentage of those who view him favorably has increased from 38% to 43%.\n\nChristie remains the candidate with the highest unfavorable rating. The former New Jersey governor has not campaigned in Iowa this cycle, but he has been featured in both debates aggressively attacking Trump.\n\nChristie is viewed favorably by 20% of poll respondents, down from 28% in August. And he is viewed unfavorably by 69%, up from 60%.\n\nContributing: Samantha Hernandez, Des Moines Register\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect their proportions among voters in the list.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 404 voters likely to attend the 2024 Iowa Republican caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register, NBC News and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2021/10/06/2024-presidential-campaign-iowa-visits-hint-republican-candidates-ahead-caucuses/5698091001/", "title": "2024 presidential candidates: The Republicans, Democrats likely to ...", "text": "Not every politician traveling to Iowa runs for president — but every politician who runs for president travels to Iowa for the first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\nAnd even though Iowa Democrats' caucuses may have slipped from the front of the pack, Iowa Republicans will still hold their caucuses before anyone else, making it the starting point for choosing America's next president.\n\nWith President Joe Biden officially announcing his reelection bid, we're getting a clearer sense of the field of candidates.\n\nSo who is running for president in 2024?

Asa Hutchinson\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, is running.\n\nHe is one of the most recent candidates to join the fray after announcing his 2024 campaign April 2.\n\nThe 72-year-old Republican has called himself a \"non-Trump\" candidate and Republican \"alternative,\" even as he reaches out to the former president's voters.\n\nHe has urged Trump to drop out of the race, saying he would be a distraction.\n\n“When you’re looking at Trump, it’s going to be a circus,” Hutchinson said.\n\nHe more recently championed Republicans' battle against \"woke\" causes at the Iowa Faith & Freedom kickoff. Hutchinson recalled instructing schools in Arkansas not to allow transgender students to use restrooms that aligned with their gender identity.\n\n“It is starting (in D.C.) with the Biden administration, where they’re pushing a leftist social policy in our businesses and our schools,\" Hutchinson said.\n\nMore:Asa Hutchinson says he will 'bring out the best of America' ahead of likely presidential bid\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nRepublican businessman Vivek Ramaswamy is running.\n\nHe may not be a household name, but the 37-year-old entrepreneur who has grown a cable news following for railing against “wokeism” is confident he can make waves with his fledgling presidential campaign.\n\nRamaswamy, a Republican, made his first tour of Iowa in February after announcing days earlier he is running for president.\n\nRamaswamy has been traveling to Iowa frequently. At the recent Faith & Freedom Coalition spring kick-off, the 37-year-old author said in an interview that he believed abortion should be left to the states.\n\n\"Murder, I think abortion is murder,\" he said. \"Murder is regulated at the state level. I think we've got to keep it there. I think there's danger where once you federalize the issue, the same shoe can fit the other foot, politically speaking, and that could put us right back in the same quagmire at the federal level.\"\n\nMore:Vivek Ramaswamy brings anti-woke message to Iowa in 1st visit as a presidential candidate\n\nBusinessman Perry Johnson\n\nMichigan businessman Perry Johnson is running.\n\nThe Republican launched his campaign with a Super Bowl commercial, announcing he was airing $192,000 worth of TV ads in the Des Moines, Sioux City, Cedar Falls and Quad Cities media markets during the matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"The Democrats gave Iowa the middle finger, but we are going to give Iowa the respect and attention it deserves in its historic role as the leadoff state for our Republican Party,\" he said in a statement.\n\nJohnson was also at the Faith & Freedom Coalition kickoff where he and Ramaswamy said they would shut down the U.S. Department of Education entirely — eliciting cheers from the crowd.\n\nHe told the Register in an interview that he supported abortion restrictions at the state level, but he declined to say whether he would support any sort of federal restrictions.\n\n\"I'm not going to spend my whole time on this issue when I've made it so strong and everybody in the world knows where I stand,\" he said.\n\nMore:Who is Perry Johnson? Iowans will see a Super Bowl ad announcing his White House plans\n\nRadio host Larry Elder\n\nConservative radio host Larry Elder, a Republican, is running.\n\nHe told the Des Moines Register last fall he was considering a run for president, and he confirmed the decision in April during an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\n\"America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable,\" he wrote in a tweet announcing his campaign. \"We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That’s why I’m running for President.\"\n\nElder was among the possible candidates who spoke at the Iowa Faith & Freedom kickoff.\n\n\"The biggest power that the president has is the bully pulpit,\" said conservative radio host Larry Elder. \"We need to bring religion, God back to our country.\"\n\nMore:Conservative radio host Larry Elder teases possible presidential run, regardless of Trump\n\nUS Sen.

He has made more than a half-dozen public trips to Iowa since 2019 and has increasingly sounded like a candidate for president.\n\nHe traveled to Iowa after forming a presidential exploratory committee and has been sharing his message with Iowans and voters across the country on his “Faith in America” tour.\n\nMore:Tim Scott kicks off first presidential candidate visit to Iowa to tout 'school choice'\n\nMore:Tim Scott inches toward 2024 run, calling in Iowa for 'creating converts to conservatism'\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis is running.\n\nThe hard-charging Republican is considered the primary challenger to Trump, even though his status has faltered recently with several Florida lawmakers endorsing the former president.\n\nDeSantis has steered Florida hard right with initiatives such as the \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation and his feud with Disney.\n\nHe was treated with star status on his recent trip to Iowa, where he railed against \"woke ideology.\"\n\n“There’s certain little enclaves in our country that may be popular,” he told a crowd of several hundred people at a Davenport casino March 10. “But it’s not popular with the vast majority of people. And I think it showed. From what we showed in Florida, not only can you have a good agenda and deliver, you can make big inroads with the electorate.\"\n\nDeSantis' visit came as a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed he is viewed favorably by 74% of Iowa Republicans — nearly on par with the 80% who view Trump favorably. But a greater share of Iowa Republicans viewed Trump unfavorably: 18% compared with DeSantis' 6%.\n\nTrump has taken note, using a familiar playbook to attack \"Ron DeSanctus\" at every opportunity.\n\nMore:DeSantis in Iowa calls for 'positive alternative' to Biden.

Randy Feenstra in Iowa's heavily conservative 4th Congressional District, touring the 2022 Iowa State Fair with U.S. Sen.

Robert Kennedy announced in April he would challenge Biden for the party's presidential nomination.\n\nKennedy is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website.\n\n\"I've come here today to announce my candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States,\" Kennedy said in his announcement. \"My mission over the next 18 months of this campaign and throughout my presidency will be to end the corrupt merger of state and corporate power that is threatening… to impose a new kind of corporate feudalism in our country.\"\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson\n\nMarianne Williamson, an author and spiritual leader, is running.\n\nShe is seeking the Democratic nomination, running on a progressive platform. She has criticized the establishment in the Democratic Party and Biden for failing to be bold.\n\n“The president is taking an incremental approach to change,” Williamson told a crowd at Michigan State University earlier this month. “The president is not seeking any fundamental economic reform.”\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is not running.\n\nPompeo, a Republican, flirted with a candidacy, attending a series of events across Iowa in March 2021, and he spoke at the Family Leadership Summit in July 2020 and July 2021.\n\n“My wife Susan was born in Iowa City, but she was raised in Wichita. She spent her summers at Coralville and Strawberry Point,” he said at the 2021 Family Leadership Summit. “So that's why I'm back, I don't know why some of these other folks coming back now. I can't figure it out.”\n\nBut in April, Pompeo announced he won't be seeking the nomination.\n\n“I have made a decision,” Pompeo told Fox News host Bret Baier. “I was on your show a number of months back and you asked what I was going to do in 2024. Susan and I now have been thinking about it and prayerfully have come to the conclusion that we’re not going to join the race in 2024.”\n\nMore:Mike Pompeo, Joni Ernst, and former Gov.

Ted Cruz of Texas is not running for president.\n\nCruz leveraged a sophisticated ground game and widespread evangelical support to defeat Trump and win Iowa's 2016 GOP caucuses. He told Newsmax in July 2021 that he is \"certainly looking at\" running for president again in 2024.\n\nHe campaigned on behalf of U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst in October 2020, and he returned to headline a fundraiser for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson as she prepared to run for reelection in 2022. He traveled to Iowa in August to hold a fundraiser with U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\nBut he announced in February he would seek a third term for senator, effectively bypassing another run for president.\n\nMore:Possible 2024 presidential contender Ted Cruz says 'the road to revival' comes through Iowa\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is not running.\n\nHogan was flipping pork chops and shaking hands at the 2022 Iowa State Fair, a key stop on the Iowa caucus campaign trail. Hogan, a Republican who was elected twice to lead the blue state of Maryland, has been answering questions about whether he will run for president since he visited Iowa in 2019 as vice chair of the National Governor's Association.\n\n\"I've said that I really am focused on finishing out my term as governor until next January,\" Hogan told the Register. \"But you know, I care about country and I care about our party and I definitely want to be a voice and I want to play some role in the future. Exactly what that is, I'm not quite sure.\"\n\nIn March, Hogan announced he would not run for president in 2024.\n\nUS Sen. Marco Rubio\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is not running, or at least he has no plans for it.\n\nIn March, he told radio host Hugh Hewitt he wasn't considering a potential presidential campaign.\n\n“I don’t have any plans to run for anything this year because, you know, timing is everything in life and we’ve got a lot of stuff going on. I’ve really been focused on (the Senate) and I was hoping we’d be in the majority these next two years. That’s where I was focused on, but now we’re in the minority, but we have a majority in the House,” Rubio said.\n\nRubio, who came in third place during Iowa's 2016 GOP caucuses, made some early trips to Iowa in 2021, stoking speculation he might seek the White House once again. But he told reporters at the time that he was focused on helping the friends he made in the first-in-the-nation caucus state while gearing up for his own reelection Senate bid.\n\n“Having done this once, there's no purpose of being coy about it: I'm running for reelection in Florida to serve in the United States Senate,” he said. “I'm not having any conversations about running for president, but I have friends here.”\n\nMore:What does it take to be first? These states want to replace Iowa on the presidential calendar\n\nWhen is the presidential election?\n\nThe next presidential election is in 2024, but like in years past, the start of the campaign begins far earlier.\n\nRepublican candidates and potential candidates have already flooded Iowa, which will host its first-in-the-nation caucuses in early 2024. A date has not been set.\n\nThe 2024 general election will be the 60th quadrennial presidential election and is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nUSAToday contributed to this report.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Ann Selzer, who conducted the Iowa Poll. “And someone who has already held the office and who won the state twice would be presumed to be the front-runner, and I don't know that we can say that at this point.\n\n“There's nothing locked in about Iowa for Donald Trump.”\n\nTrump’s favorability numbers put him about on par with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is making his first trip to Iowa Friday as he weighs a possible presidential run. And they’re substantially higher than those for declared challenger Nikki Haley and likely candidate Mike Pence.\n\nThe data represent an early test of Iowans’ feelings toward the growing crop of candidates as they begin the task of vetting and winnowing the field during a busy caucus year.\n\nThe poll of 805 Iowans, including 257 self-identified Republicans, was conducted March 5 through 8 by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nQuestions asked only of Republicans have a margin of error of plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.\n\nPoll respondent Steven Goodenough, a 72-year-old Republican from Guthrie Center, said he voted for Trump in 2020 and would consider voting for him again in 2024, but he’s interested in hearing from the other candidates already making their way to Iowa.\n\nHe said Trump may be his current top choice “by default,” but he’s interested in seeing how he conducts himself on the campaign trail.\n\n“I’m not a dyed-in-the-wool Trump fan,” Goodenough said. “I am probably more middle of the road with him. So, I'm looking for other options. But you know, I probably would vote for him again if he is the candidate.”\n\nMore:Iowa or bust: Why the 2024 Iowa caucuses will be key to deciding GOP nominee\n\nGoodenough said he likes that Trump brought “balance” to the judiciary, both in the Supreme Court and in other federal appointments, and he thought Trump’s policies helped stimulate the economy.\n\nBut he expressed disappointment that Trump is already bringing a combative personality to the campaign trail, as evidenced by his attacks on candidates such as Haley and DeSantis.\n\n\"I think that was evident during the presidency that he might have gotten further if he was not so combative,\" Goodenough said.\n\nFewer say they would 'definitely' vote for Donald Trump in 2024 general election\n\nIf Trump were to become the GOP nominee for president, 74% of Iowa Republicans say they would likely vote for him in the 2024 general election.\n\nThat includes 47% who say they would definitely vote for him and 27% who say they would probably vote for him.\n\nJust 9% said they would be unlikely to vote for him, with 5% saying they would probably not vote for him and 4% saying they definitely would not vote for him.\n\nAnother 12% say they “might or might not” vote for him, 3% say they wouldn’t vote at all and 2% were unsure.\n\nMore:Ron DeSantis makes his Iowa caucuses debut with stops March 10 in Des Moines, Davenport\n\nThat’s a substantial shift from June 2021 when the Iowa Poll last tested the question.\n\nThen, 69% of Iowa Republicans said they would definitely vote for Trump in the 2024 general election — 22 percentage points more than say the same today — and another 15% said they would probably do so.\n\nIn 2021, just 4% said they would be unlikely to vote for Trump, with 2% saying they probably would not and 2% saying they definitely would not.\n\nAnother 10% said they “might or might not” for him, 1% wouldn’t vote at all and 1% were unsure.\n\nThe question is relevant in a caucus cycle where Republicans are already beginning to discuss “electability” and who would be best positioned to take on Democratic President Joe Biden, who is expected to seek a second term.\n\nDan Leinen, a 64-year-old poll respondent from Woodburn, said he is a Republican, but his views on Trump changed drastically following the Jan. 6th U.S. Capitol riot.\n\nLeinen said he didn’t like how Trump dealt with his election defeat and wouldn’t consider voting for him again — even if he were the Republican nominee for president.\n\n“I don’t think we need anybody like that in the White House,” he said.\n\nKendall Kirschbaum, a 21-year-old poll respondent and Republican from Lake Mills, said she thinks Trump was a strong president who successfully tackled key issues while in office, including promoting a strong economy, keeping down inflation, achieving low unemployment rates and strengthening security on the border, while also being good to farmers and small businesses.\n\nShe said she recognizes his social media presence may have been offensive to some, but she said it didn’t really bother her.\n\n“Growing up, I really just heard of him as not necessarily a political figure but more as a celebrity,” she said.\n\nBut after hearing Trump speak on policy, she said she realized “I really liked this guy. He is straightforward and he seems like he is going to get stuff done and he thinks like a businessman.”\n\nDonald Trump’s favorability falls; Ron DeSantis starts out strong\n\nA September 2021 Iowa Poll showed Trump was viewed favorably by 91% of Iowa Republicans. That fell to 83% in October 2022, and now it is at 80%.\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s unfavorable numbers have climbed, with the percentage of Iowa Republicans viewing him unfavorably more than doubling — from 7% in 2021 to 18% now.\n\nAmong independent Iowans, 35% view Trump favorably — down from 40% in October 2022 — and 63% view him unfavorably.\n\nTrump is set to return to the state March 13 for a rally in Davenport, just days after DeSantis makes his Iowa debut in the same city. Trump is expected to address education policy in his first Iowa campaign stop of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nThe numbers follow a tumultuous couple of years for the former president, who is facing multiple investigations related to his involvement in efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election, his handling of classified documents and his past business practices.\n\nThose investigations continue as other declared and potential presidential contenders begin making their appeals to Iowans.\n\nMore:Donald Trump to make first Iowa trip of 2024 presidential campaign\n\nDeSantis, who is attending public events with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds in Davenport and Des Moines Friday, is viewed favorably by 74% of Iowa Republicans — just behind Trump’s 80%. He is viewed unfavorably by 6% of Iowa Republicans, with 20% saying they aren’t sure.\n\nIndependent Iowans are nearly evenly split on DeSantis, with 35% viewing him favorably, 33% viewing him unfavorably and 32% saying they’re not sure.\n\nDeSantis has emerged in national polling as the early favorite to challenge Trump.\n\nA Real Clear Politics rolling average of polling shows 45% of respondents say Trump should be the Republican nominee for president, while 29% say it should be DeSantis. No other potential candidate is currently polling in double digits.\n\nPoll respondent Alex Barry, a 31-year-old Cedar Rapids Republican, said he views Trump “very favorably” and would vote for him in a general election, but he worries that Trump, 76, would fail to gain necessary support.\n\nBarry said he thinks DeSantis would have a better chance of beating Biden.\n\nBarry called DeSantis, 44, a “younger, fresh face” and praised his “strong stance on parental rights.”\n\n“I liked what he did with COVID — he stayed open and didn’t restrict everybody,” he said. “… He just seems like the right guy to me.”\n\nGrowing share have unfavorable view of Mike Pence; Nikki Haley relatively unknown\n\nPence, who served as Trump’s vice president and was previously the governor of Indiana, is viewed favorably by 66% of Iowa Republicans.\n\nPence has the highest unfavorable rating of the four politicians tested among Iowa Republicans at 26%. Another 7% are not sure.\n\nThose numbers have changed substantially since June 2020, when the Register last tested Republican Iowans’ attitudes of Pence. Then, 86% viewed him favorably, while just 7% viewed him unfavorably and 7% were not sure.\n\nSince then, many of Trump’s most loyal followers have turned on the former vice president after he refused to help Trump overturn the results of the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThat day, some who rioted at the U.S. Capitol erected makeshift gallows and chanted “hang Mike Pence” as others flooded the halls of Congress in search of the vice president.\n\nJust 58% of Iowa evangelicals — the group consistently showing the most support for Republicans and seemingly one of Pence’s most natural constituencies — say they have favorable feelings toward him.\n\nGoodenough, the poll respondent from Guthrie Center, is a pastor and said he was disappointed with Pence’s handling of the 2020 election and wished the vice president had done more to investigate allegations of fraud.\n\n“I think he's a good man,” Goodenough said. “But I'm not sure he's really qualified for the job of the president.”\n\nPence has traveled to Iowa multiple times since losing the 2020 election with Trump, and he’s been well-received at events around the state. He’s scheduled to return March 18 for a foreign policy forum alongside U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\nMore:Mike Pence rails in Iowa against 'radical gender ideology' as caucuses start to simmer\n\nHaley, the former governor of South Carolina and Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, was also in Iowa this week, holding events in Council Bluffs, Nevada and Des Moines.\n\nShe announced her campaign in February and immediately traveled to Iowa where she has been advocating for a “new generation” of leaders, urging Iowans to look forward, rather than back at Trump.\n\nAccording to the poll, she is viewed favorably by 53% of Iowa Republicans and unfavorably by 8%. However, she is much less known than the others, with 40% saying they don’t know enough about her to form an opinion.\n\nKirschbaum, the Lake Mills Republican and Trump supporter, a 21-year-old poll respondent and Republican from Lake Mills, said she needs to learn more about Haley before coming to a strong opinion about her, but she likes that Haley is in the field of candidates.\n\n“I really like how she provides that kind of strong, independent female portrayal,” Kirschbaum said. “I feel like that’s a really good example, especially for the Republican party.”\n\nMore:Nikki Haley is carving a lane in the Iowa caucuses as Donald Trump looms. Here's how:\n\nStill, Kirschbaum said she currently prefers Trump for the GOP nomination, followed by DeSantis.\n\nAlthough favorability numbers don’t necessarily indicate how candidates will perform in a head-to-head race, Selzer said they are a helpful indication of name identification and visibility and help set the stage for the campaigning that will come.\n\nThey also show the “intensity” of Iowa Republicans’ feelings about the candidates, she said.\n\nFor DeSantis, a plurality of 42% rate their feelings as “very favorable.” Trump also has a plurality of Iowa Republicans saying they feel “very favorably” about him, at 44%.\n\nBut for Pence and Haley, the plurality say they feel slightly less intense, rating their feelings as “mostly favorable.” For Pence, it is 49% and for Haley it is 37%.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 805 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/10/19/2024-voters-gop-candidates-drop-out/71218329007/", "title": "Thin out the 2024 field? N.H. voters want more GOP candidates to exit", "text": "During one of the busiest periods in the still early 2024 presidential campaign, White House hopefuls are making a civic pilgrimage to New Hampshire.\n\nThe Republican contenders are chatting with people at diners, coffee shops and bookstores. Some are trekking to the state capitol in Concord to sign their name at a historic desk to be on the ballot.\n\nOthers are sharing their messages through several town halls and other stops, including a GOP dinner that happens once every eight years.\n\nVoters have a message, too: some of you need to drop out.\n\n\"It’s still early. There's still a lot on that stage,\" said Laura Williams, a registered Republican from Rochester, N.H., who plans to vote in the primary. \"Let some weed themselves out, and those that rise to the top, you know, we’ll wait it out and see.\"\n\nWhether Granite State natives or political tourists traveling across states lines to get a closer glimpse at the candidates, many are wishing for fewer options after what some called a disastrous second primary debate hosted by the Republican National Committee in California.\n\n\"Frankly, I was put off by all their debate performances in the last one. They were all talking over one another,\" Vaughn Annis, a retired chemical engineer, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"The field was too crowded on that stage to get anything as a meaningful debate.\"\n\nAnnis, a registered Republican who hails from Henniker, N.H., hasn't made up his mind on a presidential candidate, but he is giving Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott closer attention.\n\nA candidate he would like to see exit this race is former Donald Trump, the frontrunner with a commanding lead.\n\n\"Where I have voted in the past for him, I think Trump needs to step aside and let others move forward, younger people in the party that aren't as controversial,\" Annis said. \"I think that would be helpful for not only the party but also the country.\"\n\nTrump rules, but N.H. primary remains fluid\n\nA USA TODAY/Boston Globe/Suffolk University survey of likely voters showed Trump at 49% with Haley, a former South Carolina governor, the closest rival at 19%.\n\nThe non-Trump voters say they are hoping one of the other Republicans can break through, but they are by no means certain that's possible.\n\nLarry Provencher, a semi-retired artist in Exeter, N.H., fears Trump may be the Republican nominee, adding how he believes the former president \"just lost a few upstairs.\"\n\nHe said when interacting with voters, the other candidates need to share their vision in detail and forget about the frontrunner.\n\n\"You know, like, Chris Christie, I think his main goal is to get Trump out. I want to hear what else you're gonna do,\" Provencher said.\n\nThose in the anti-Trump camp said they are hoping if some of the other candidates exit, they will unite behind a single challenger. In the most recent example, former Rep. Will Hurd, of Texas, left the race and endorsed Haley.\n\nHaley, a former UN ambassador, has surged in the New Hampshire poll ahead DeSantis, the governor of Florida who was once held as chief alternative to Trump.\n\nNorman Stuart, a veteran and retired machine shop worker, attended a Haley event at the Rochester American Legion last week. He was impressed with her, but he remains undecided.\n\nAlthough Stuart said he was considering several of the candidates, who he declined to name, he stated emphatically: \"I did not go to Wolfeboro to see Trump.\"\n\nThat provides a glimmer of light for the other Republicans, who hold out hope that despite Trump's strong standing in the polls, there are some signs the race is fluid.\n\nThose surveyed in the Suffolk poll, for instance, are split 48%-44% when asked whether Trump's nomination was inevitable or whether some other candidate could win the nomination.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 said they might change their minds before the January primary.\n\nBut the Trump base is fiercely loyal, with 84% saying their minds were made up to back him and just 15% saying they might switch to someone else.\n\n“I know a lot of people don't like him. I don't like his personality. I think it stinks,\" said Ronald Sassi, of Chichester, N.H., who wants Trump to win. \"But he doesn't have any lobbyists telling him what he has to be or beholden to them.\"\n\nIndependents giving single-digit candidates a shot\n\nJo-Ann Jacob, an independent from Exeter, N.H., doesn't want to rush in making a choice before she gets a chance to hear from more candidates.\n\nSeveral of the Republican contenders are \"too much\" in the sense they brag about themselves or insult others. She prefers the more somber style of North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum or former Vice President Mike Pence, who she describes as more \"down to Earth.\"\n\nBoth men are in the basement of the polling at 1%, according to the Suffolk University survey.\n\nOther independent voters, who can participate in the New Hampshire GOP primary, said they aren't sure what to make of the current field yet.\n\n“At this point, I'm really unsure,” Lynne Chase, a registered nurse who lives in Grantham, N.H., told USA TODAY.\n\nChase, who identifies as an independent, said she has \"deep concerns\" about the country's partisan divide, and how, \"this is the pool that we have to select from.\"\n\n\"That's why I choose to remain a middle ground voter,” she said.\n\nOther voters said they are drawn toward Haley and Burgum because of their experience and record as their state's chief executive.\n\n“When you govern a state, you have a lot of experience in governing within a structure of government,” Patricia Squires, a Republican from Wolfeboro, N.H., told USA TODAY.\n\nDistaste of a Biden-Trump rematch\n\nMany voters shared how they aren't crazy about the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch in 2024, but don't see a way to change that probability.\n\nRachel McKaig, a Democrat, said there is a general frustration that President Joe Biden will be the party’s likely nominee come next November.\n\n“I genuinely wish we had another candidate,” said McKaig, a University of New Hampshire graduate. \"I just can't see him doing anything amazing over the next four years, because he hasn't done anything amazing in the past four years.”\n\nGiven its status as the \"first-in-the-nation primary,\" New Hampshire draws a fair amount of out-of-state visitors.\n\nThose voters said they were impressed with lesser-known candidates they had a chance to see in-person, but admit there is an underlying pessimism that makes it hard for others to take that contender seriously.\n\n“I just know that you look at the people who are ascending because that tends to continue,\" said John Sweeny, a retired appellate judge who came to New Hampsire from Hudson Valley in New York.\n\n\"The ones who were staying flat – it would take a miracle for something to happen that they're going to say, ‘Oh, wow, you're wonderful. I didn't notice you before. Let me pay attention to you now,’\" he added. \"It just doesn't happen.\"\n\nShawn Rieke, a retired technician from Johnstown, Colo. who is vacationing in New England, waited outside the old State House for a glimpse of DeSantis after he filed.\n\nPeople may not like Trump's \"crudeness\" or the personal attacks he makes, but they agree with him on many issues, he said. They also think the criminal charges against him are politically motivated.\n\n\"At this point it looks like it's pretty much locked up,\" Rieke said. \"It is what it is.\"\n\nRepublican Rachel Hannah Swift, 46, who comes from Hagerstown, Maryland said no one is happy with the prospect of a Biden-Trump re-match, and she has a unique response: Running for president herself.\n\nAs her colorful car blared pop music outside of the old State House, Swift said: \"These politicians are kinda boring...They don't have a lot going on.

He made his first campaign stops in New Hampshire and South Carolina back in January.\n\nFellow Republicans Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, former Vice President Mike Pence, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy all traveled to Iowa last month.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley made her second trip to Iowa Friday and campaigned in New Hampshire last month after launching her presidential campaign.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, perhaps Trump's biggest rival, made his first Iowa pit stop on Friday.\n\nBut why are so many Republicans flocking to Iowa and New Hampshire? Here's a brief explainer.\n\nWhy are Iowa and New Hampshire important?\n\nSince 1972 Iowa has held the crucial first-in-the-nation caucuses. Since 1920, New Hampshire has held the first primary of the presidential campaign season.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary has helped to make or break campaigns by building national excitement and momentum for the winners. Low-ranking losers have generally dropped out of the presidential race following their defeat.\n\nIn some years, successful candidates were able to overcome a loss in the two states and capture the presidency.\n\nTrump lost the Iowa caucuses to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016. President Joe Biden lost in Iowa in 2020, calling it a “gut punch.”\n\nHe also lost the New Hampshire primary to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and then he went on to become the Democratic presidential nominee after building momentum from winning the South Carolina primary.\n\nWill he or won't he?:Republican Sen. Tim Scott weighs a historic White House bid\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nTimothy Hagle, political scientist at the University of Iowa and author of \"Riding the Caucus Rollercoaster 2020: The Democrats' Race to Win the Iowa Caucuses,\" said Republicans have been late this election cycle to spending time introducing themselves to Iowans mainly due to Trump.\n\n\"We normally see people coming here fairly early and in fact we would often see people coming and helping out our candidates in the midterm elections,\" Hagle said.\n\n2024 race:Nikki Haley begins Iowa courtship, tells those considering Trump to 'look forward'\n\n\"Trump is unusual. He's not an incumbent, but as a former president, who's running again, he certainly has much higher name recognition and support base than most other candidates would have,\" he added. \"And so I think it's kind of delayed some people for getting into the race.\"\n\nHaley is the only major candidate to have entered the race to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination. Other candidates like DeSantis are inching closer to a formal presidential announcement and are holding tours and meetings with Republicans across the nation.\n\nBut Trump continues to cast a shadow over the race for the nomination.\n\nTrump's support in Iowa eroding but still leading in New Hampshire\n\nA new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows Trump's support may be fading.\n\nLess than half of Iowa Republicans, 47%, said they would \"definitely\" vote for Trump according to the poll; In June 2021, 69% said they would support him./ That's a 22 percentage point drop.\n\nTrump and DeSantis have roughly the same \"very favorable\" rating at 44% and 42% respectively, which is well above Haley at 16% and Pence at 17%.\n\nYet in a survey of New Hampshire voters released Tuesday, 58% said they would support Trump, while only 17% would support DeSantis—a 41 percentage point lead.\n\nIowa Poll:Donald Trump’s Republican support erodes in Iowa, even as many remain committed\n\nThe survey, conducted, by Emerson College Polling/7 News WHDH, also showed Gov. Chris Sununu polling at 7%.\n\nTyler Clark, a New Hampshire Republican consultant, said voters in the Granite State are looking to choose a Republican who can also help local and state GOP candidates win in 2024.\n\n\"What we've been dealing with since 2016 is we haven't been able to recapture that initial Trump factor spark where it propelled our candidates in areas that we underperformed in the past,\" Clark said.\n\nClark said Trump helped the GOP perform well with rural voters, \"but we've lost suburban educated voters the last few cycles.\"\n\nWhose running for president?:Current and former governors offer glimpse into what could be contentious 2024 presidential election\n\nDNC shakes up primary calendar\n\nThis year, the Democratic National Committee approved a plan that reorders the 2024 primary season.\n\nThe plan demotes Iowa and moves South Carolina in first position. Next, Nevada and New Hampshire hold joint primaries. The next two states in the early primary season are Georgia and Michigan.\n\nYet, New Hampshire state law requires it to be first in the primary season, which has caused consternation for local Democrats. And Iowa law also requires it to be the first-in-the-nation caucus.\n\n\"Because of the uncertainty, we don't know what the Democrats are going to do,\" said Hagle of the dilemma Iowa Democrats face.\n\nClarke, meanwhile, said New Hampshire voters take their first-in-the-nation status seriously.\n\n\"Despite what pundits in D.C. say or party bosses, particularly (what) the DNC says about how we're not representative of the rest of the country, demographically, I think we produce better candidates because we really take it seriously,\" Clarke said.\n\nThe race to 2024:Democrats approve 2024 primary calendar that demotes Iowa, boosts South Carolina", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/13"}]}

Perry hosted \"SNL\" in October 1997.\n\nRumer Willis recalled being on the set of \"The Whole Nine Yards\" and sequel \"The Whole Ten Yards\" with Perry and her dad, Bruce Willis. \"He was so kind and funny and sweet with my sisters and me,\" she wrote in an Instagram Story. \"That movie still makes me laugh so much.”\n\nSelma Blair posted a photograph smiling with Perry on her Instagram page, calling the \"Friends\" star \"my oldest boy friend.\"\n\n“All of us loved Matthew Perry, and I did especially.

Though he went on to star in a number of films and TV series, including \"17 Again\" and \"Mr. Sunshine,\" it was his role as Chandler Bing on \"Friends,\" opposite Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc, that defined his career.\n\nStarting Wednesday, TBS will remember Perry by airing Chandler Bing's best moments on \"Friends\" in the week following the actor's death.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chandler's \"most hilarious and heartwarming episodes\" will be broadcast 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The best episodes of Chandler and Joey's friendship will air Thursday from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and the best of Monica and Chandler's relationship can be seen 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nEncores will run 6 to 10:30 a.m. Saturday and 6:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Sunday.\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander, Gary Levin, Laura Trujillo, Kim Willis, KiMi Robinson, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/10/29/matthew-perry-remembered-why-we-all-loved-friends-star/71371576007/", "title": "Why Matthew Perry was 'Friends' with all of us: Remembering the ...", "text": "Matthew Perry was \"Friends\" with all of us.\n\nThat's what it felt like, at least. As one of the six cast members of the iconic NBC sitcom, which ran from 1994 to 2004, Perry's Chandler Bing was an intimate part of millions of people's lives, with his sardonic one-liners and ever-cynical spirit. Along with his fellow castmates Matt Le Blanc, David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow, Perry helped make \"Friends\" one of the biggest TV shows of all time and made his face recognizable all over the world.\n\nSo when news broke that the actor had died Saturday at the age of 54, it was as if all of us had lost a close friend, someone who had graced our living rooms for a decade, someone we knew intimately, even if none of us really knew Perry at all.\n\nBut that was the majesty of his performance as Chandler, the least conspicuously likable character on the sitcom that often used him for the most brusque and grating comic relief. Known for the construction \"could I be more ...?\" and nasally on-and-off-again girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler), Chandler did not start the series with the handsome pining of Ross (Schwimmer) and his will-they-or-won't-they tension with Rachel (Aniston) or the sweet dumb charm of Joey (Le Blanc), who went through one-night stands like so many sandwiches. He was there to crack wise and keep everyone else honest, a nice foil to Monica's (Cox) neuroses (more on her later), Phoebe's (Kudrow) zaniness, Joey's cluelessness, Rachel's coolness and Ross's snobbery.\n\nSad news:'Friends' star Matthew Perry, sitcom great who battled addiction, dead at 54\n\nOver 10 seasons, Perry dove deeper and deeper into the character until it hardly seemed like he had to try very hard to inhabit Chandler. By Season 5, when creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane wisely paired Chandler with Monica in a far more satisfying relationship than Ross and Rachel's, Perry made Chandler a romantic and a cynic in equal measure. When he and Monica propose to each other in the Season 6 finale, you believe every word of his speech: \"You make me happier than I ever thought I could be, and if you let me, I will spend the rest of my life making you feel the same way.\" Who thought millions could swoon over a character who didn't want to get out of his recliner and kept a chick and a duck as pets?\n\nThere was more than \"Friends,\" if you can believe it, although, like his co-stars, Perry had trouble shaking the character that made him rich and famous. In underrated \"Fools Rush In\" (1997), he starred opposite Salma Hayek and proved his rom-com bonafides. His comedy proved unflappable in \"The Whole Nine Yards\" (2000) and its 2004 sequel. And even in a string of never-quite-successful TV series including NBC's \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\" (2006-07) and NBC's \"Go On\" (2012-13) his performance never faltered. He even showed off his uncanny ability for villainy in CBS drama \"The Good Wife\" and Paramount+'s spinoff \"The Good Fight.\" Chandler Bing's smarm was used for evil there, not good.\n\nCelebrities react:Adele, Shannen Doherty, Morgan Fairchild pay tribute to 'Friends' star Matthew Perry\n\nPerry had a turbulent personal life, which will certainly be the subject of much conversation in the wake of his far-too-premature death. He detailed his alcohol and drug use and health struggles in his memoir \"Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing,\" published in 2022. Last fall, Perry said he was 18 months sober, and grateful to be alive and to finally share his story with concerned \"Friends\" fans and addicts who face stigma and judgment.\n\n\"In the end, admitting defeat was winning,\" he wrote. \"Addiction, the big terrible thing, is far too powerful for anyone to defeat alone. But together, one day at a time, we can beat it down.\" It was a brave and difficult story for him to tell, and far more serious than what fans were used to seeing from a sitcom star. But Perry was the kind of person who did the difficult thing.\n\nPerry's death shouldn't overshadow his life. His talent, his charisma and his comedy live on in 234 episodes (streaming on Max), and in the memories of fans who tuned in for Must See TV every Thursday night for a decade. He is mourned and celebrated, remembered and cherished.\n\nHe couldn't be any more loved.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/entertainment/chris-pratt-backlash/index.html", "title": "Chris Pratt says backlash to Instagram post about his wife made him ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChris Pratt understands that social media trolling tends to accompany success in Hollywood, but he’d like to do his best to protect his family from it.\n\nIn a new interview with Men’s Health, the actor addressed the public backlash he received last November over an Instagram post he wrote about his wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger.\n\n“I said something like, ‘Find someone who looks at you the way my wife looks at me.’ And then I gave her some s*** in the thing and said, ‘But I love you.

I think there’s a distinction between being religious—adhering to the customs created by man, oftentimes appropriating the awe reserved for who I believe is a very real God—and using it to control people, to take money from people, to abuse children, to steal land, to justify hatred. Whatever it is.

This is the third expanded product recall for the Asheville, North Carolina, company, that makes products such as Dr. King’s Children’s Cough Relief, Dr. King’s Children’s Ear Relief Formula and Dr. King’s Cold Sore treatment.\n\nLast month, King Bio recalled Aquaflora Candida HP9, Lymph Detox and Baby Teething liquids for possible microbial contamination, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Two weeks ago, the company expanded that to 32 more products including Dr. King’s Baby Colic Relief and Dr. King’s Natural Medicine Children's Cough Relief, the FDA says.\n\nAfter an FDA inspection, the agency contacted the company and recommended recalling all products that include water including Natural Pet Pharmaceuticals and Natural Veterinary products for pets.\n\n• Prescription drugs: Mislabeling of blood pressure medication led to another FDA recall. A specific lot of hydrochlorothiazide tablets (PW05264, USP 12.5 milligrams) has been recalled after a bottle was found to contain a different kind of diuretic, spironolactone tablets (USP 25 milligrams) used to treat congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver and other ailments.\n\nBoth medications help bodies get rid of extra salt and water, and the effects of mixing up the medications would depend on the individual but can range from \"limited\" to \"life-threatening,\" the FDA said. Drug maker Accord Healthcare Inc. said they have not received any reports of adverse incidents relating to this recall.\n\n• Over-the-counter drugs: Pfizer voluntarily recalled one specific lot of bubble-gum flavored Children's Advil over mislabeling concerns.\n\nAccording to the alert, the liquid pain reliever and fever reducer's dosage cup measures in teaspoons, while the instructions on the label are described in milliliters. This could potentially make it easy for an overdose to occur upon use of the product.\n\nThe specific lot of the 4-ounce bottles (R51129) was distributed nationally from May 2018 to June 2018.\n\n• Nose sprays: In another measure related to the King Bio recall, HelloLife in Grand Rapids, Michigan, recalled four nose sprays – Neuroveen, Respitrol, Thyroveev and Compulsin – all produced at King Bio's Asheville facility, due to possible microbial contamination. The recall was for a single lot of 2-ounce bottles of each product with expiration dates of July 2019. For more information, visit the FDA site.\n\nAlso, Product Quest Manufacturing, maker of the CVS Health 12-Hour Sinus Relief Nasal Mist, expanded a voluntary recall from earlier this month, originally dealing with a specific lot of the spray to include all of its nasal products and baby oral gels. The initial recall was made because the nasal mist could have a \"microbiological contamination.\"\n\nThe expanded recall, made out of an abundance of caution, includes all the products manufactured at the company’s Holly Hill, Florida, facility, some with expiration dates into the year 2020, the FDA says.\n\nRepeated use of a contaminated nasal product can lead to potential infection, which can be life-threatening in certain patient populations, such as those with cystic fibrosis or immune-compromised individuals, the FDA says. And repetitive use of an oral gel containing a pathogen can potentially lead to life-threatening infections in certain patients including babies or very young children.\n\nProduct Quest, which has said it had not identified any incidents connected to the nasal sprays and gels, makes products sold as store brands for retailers including CVS, Dollar Family Dollar, Rite-Aid, Meijer, Walgreens and other stores. Product names include: Humist Saline Nasal Mist, Rhinall Drops, CVS Saline Nasal Mist, CVS Allergy Saline Nasal Mist, CVS Baby Saline Nasal Gel, Family Dollar Saline Nasal Spray, and Well At Walgreens Maximum Strength Nasal Spray.\n\n• Ground beef: The week included two recalls over concern for possible E. coli contamination of ground beef products.\n\nSupermarket chain Publix recalled an undetermined amount of potentially contaminated products made with ground chuck and shipped to Florida stores over concerns of E. coli contamination, the Agriculture Department says. The ground beef products – including bacon & cheddar burgers, Spanish meatballs, and swiss and mushroom sliders – were shipped to two dozen counties in Florida including Brevard, Citrus, Hillsborough, Sarasota and St. Lucie. They were purchased by consumers between June 25 and July 31, the USDA says.\n\nCargill recalled about 12 tons of ground beef for possible E. coli contamination, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The 25,288 pounds of ground beef products from Cargill's Fort Morgan, Colorado, plant were produced Aug. 16,and shipped to warehouses in California and Colorado. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products, the USDA says.\n\n• Baby formula: Although there technically was no recall, pharmacy retailer CVS pulled Enfamil powdered baby formula from shelves nationwide after a Florida mother found what appeared to be all-purpose flour in a package she purchased near Tampa. In its internal review, CVS said it has found no related problems in markets outside of Tampa.\n\nEnfamil maker Mead Johnson Nutrition says there has been no recall, and the company has been cooperating with CVS and the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation, spokesperson Lynn Kenney told USA TODAY. CVS resumed sale of Enfamil prodcuts in its stores by the end of the day Friday, CVS spokesman Gary Serby told USA TODAY Saturday.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/03/17/coronavirus-all-household-essentials-you-can-still-buy-online-cvs/5066324002/", "title": "Coronavirus: The household essentials you can still buy at CVS ...", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nWith the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic causing shortages of household essentials like hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and cleaning wipes, as well as some over-the-counter medicine like Advil and first-aid kits, many people are having trouble finding these products at their local stores and pharmacies. But thankfully, CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid's online shops still have some of these items that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend in stock.\n\nWe rounded up the household essentials and over-the-counter medicines that are still available at these stores and will continue to update this list as inventory dwindles or restocks. While we're focusing on the products that are still being sold online, your local pharmacies might have some supplies that are available in-store only, so double-check the items that state \"only in stores\" to see if you can get it in your area. It's also important to note that these items may have a delay in shipping due to their current high demand.\n\nAs a public service reminder, we'd like to remind everyone that buying household essentials is all well and good, but hoarding (buying more than you really need) actively harms your friends and neighbors. So please, buy responsibly.\n\n1. Hand soap\n\nWhile hand sanitizer may be one of the highest demanded products on the market right now, the CDC says that the most effective way to protect yourself from coronavirus is to wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If you're in need of some extra hand soap as you've been washing them more frequently, you can grab some online at Walgreens and Rite Aid right now.\n\n2. Toilet Paper\n\nToilet paper can be especially hard to find right now, both in stores and online, but you're going to want to may sure you have a few rolls in stock if you're going to be stuck at home for a while. Currently, you can still find some at Walgreens right now. Unfortunately, this list doesn't include our favorite toilet paper, Charmin Ultra Soft.\n\n3. Paper towels\n\nSince paper towels are disposable, they're ideal to use if you're living with someone who is affected by the coronavirus, according to the CDC. They're great for cleaning and disinfecting homes and you can toss them immediately once you're done with them. Bounty Select-A-Size topped our list of the best paper towels, but you can find a few brands for sale at Rite Aid—though they may take more than two weeks to ship to you.\n\n4. Disinfectant spray\n\nDisinfectant wipes and spray are hard to come by currently, but you can still find some at Walgreens. The CDC recommends using household cleaners with at least 70% alcohol, which can help clear surfaces of harmful bacteria and potentially guard against the spread of coronavirus.\n\n5. Trash bags\n\nTrash bags are essential for disposing of all your used disinfectant wipes, tissues, paper towels, and general trash. In fact, the CDC recommends devoting a lined trash bag to anyone impacted by coronavirus as well as using gloves when removing garbage bags and disposing of trash. We like the Glad ForceFlexPlus as they’re the best trash bags we’ve ever tested, but there are others available at Walgreens and Rite Aid.\n\n6. Laundry detergent\n\nLaundry detergent is one of those things you're definitely going to want to make sure you have enough of when you're home for an extended period of time. Our top pick for the best laundry detergent is Persil ProClean Liquid Laundry Detergent. It's the best at getting rid of stains and will cleanse your clothes thoroughly. You can still grab it at Rite Aid, alongside a few other detergents.\n\n7. Tissues\n\nWhile the coronavirus symptoms do not include a runny nose—but rather a dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath, according to the CDC—it's still a good idea to have some extra tissues. You can use them to cough into (and dispose of immediately), and they'll be necessary if you end up with a runny nose from allergies or the common cold. After testing the best tissues on the market, we found that Puffs Ultra Soft were our favorite and the least irritating. You can grab them as well as a few other brands at Rite Aid.\n\n8. First aid kit\n\nWhether you're self-quarantined or just working remotely for an extended period time, you're going to want a first aid kit for any potential minor injuries that come up. That way you won't be running around looking for bandages later. Find one that comes with all of the supplies you’ll need to treat a wide variety of problems at home.\n\n9. Pain and fever relievers\n\nAccording to the CDC, a high fever is one of the main symptoms someone who’s contracted coronavirus will present. So be sure to have Tylenol, Aspirin, or other fever reducers on hand in case you or someone you live with become affected by illness. It can also be useful for reducing the discomfort of a dry cough. But according to the health minister of France, anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and cortisone could aggravate coronavirus, and should be avoided at this time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Companies knew 'from the beginning.'\n\n►Formula shortage:How to feed your infant during the formula shortage\n\nWhy is there a baby formula shortage?\n\nSupply for this essential good has been low since November of last year, and in recent months, it's only gotten worst. Abbott Nutrition recalled their Similac, Alimentum and EleCare formulas back in February after four infants fell ill and two infants died, leading to concerns about bacterial contamination in the Michigan facility. The plant was temporarily shut down by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and finally reopened its doors on June 4. In starting production back up, the plant has been prioritizing EleCare formula, which is hypoallergenic and critical for infants and children who have severe food allergies or gastrointestinal disorders. Though storms in the Midwest last week halted EleCare production, Abbott says there is enough supply to meet demand until production begins again.\n\nWhat stores sell baby formula?\n\nWhile many places are out of formula, you can rest assured that there are still a number of storefronts that have it in stock; the trick is knowing where to look. Sometimes, this means looking in places you might not expect to find baby formula, like office supply chains or drugstores. We’ve compiled a list of places that carry infant formula. If the retailer near you is out of stock, check back often for updates as restocks are common. Note that some stores may have formula available for purchase in-store even though they appear to be sold out online.\n\nAlbertson’s: Supermarket giant Albertson’s offers baby formula in stock for pick up and delivery.\n\nALDI: This discount grocery store chain has several formulas available for in-store purchase.\n\nAmazon: Amazon has a large selection of baby formula listings, along with predicted ship dates.\n\nBed, Bath and Beyond: Bed, Bath and Beyond carries brands like Similac and Enfamil in store.\n\nBJ’s: Warehouse club BJ’s has a wide variety of top-rated baby formula in stock for pick up, same-day delivery and in-store.\n\nBuybuyBaby: BuybuyBaby carries several brands of baby formula for both in-store and shipping.\n\nCostco: Warehouse giant Costco has brands like Enfagrow available for shipping and in store.\n\nCTown Supermarkets: Located in the northeast, several CTown stores have formula in stock.\n\nCVS: Pharmacy chain CVS stocks baby formula in powder and liquid form both in- store and online.\n\nDuane Reade: The New York drugstore chain is owned by Walgreens and shoppers can browse Walgreen's stock for shippable options or shop in-store.\n\nFood Lion: Food Lion has a few brands available in stock online.\n\nGopuff: GoPuff is a commerce platform that has no-contact delivery available for Enfamil and Similac products.\n\nH-E-B: Texas-based H-E-B carries Gerber baby formula and others in stock online.\n\nHy-Vee: Hy-Vee is a supermarket chain located throughout the Midwest and has several different types of formula available.\n\nIGA: Supermarket chain IGA carries formula in-store and online.\n\nJewel-Osco: This Midwestern grocery chain stocks a number of brands and has online shopping as well as pickup and delivery options.\n\nKroger: Kroger’s has a selection of baby formula online and in-store.\n\nMeijer: Meijer is a supercenter located throughout the Midwest. When in stock, baby formula can be bought in-store, ordered online for pick up in-store or online to be shipped.\n\nOffice Max and Office Depot: The office supply stores (which share a parent company) stock a limited amount of formula in select stores.\n\nPiggly Wiggly: Piggly Wiggly is a supermarket center located American Southern and Midwestern regions, and carries brands like Similac and Enfamil.\n\nPrice Rite: Northeastern supermarket chain Price Rite has powder formula available for purchase online.\n\nPublix: Florida-based grocery chain Publix has different kinds of baby formula like powder, concentrated liquid or milk-based.\n\nRiteAid: Drugstore chain RiteAid carries baby formula in stock for shipping and pick up in-store.\n\nSafeway: Safeway grocery stores have a wide selection of baby formula in stores and online.\n\nSam’s Club: Walmart-owned Sam’s Club has baby formula for shipping and in-store.\n\nSave A Lot: Discount supermarket Save A Lot offers online ordering through Instacart in addition to in-store shopping.\n\nShopRite: The grocery store chain stocks brands like Enfamil and Gerber and offers shopping online as well as in-store pickup and brick-and-mortar shopping.\n\nSmart and Final: This chain located in the western U.S. lists formula in stock on its website.\n\nStop&Shop: Stop&Shop is temporarily limiting infant formula purchases to four per customer, but offers online buying and in-store shopping for a number of brands, with some in-stock for shipping.\n\nTarget: Target carries all major brands of formula and ships nationally.

When it comes to new, unopened packages of formula, some have shelf lives of up to 18 months. (You can find this information in the form of a \"use by\" date on the container.) It's important to adhere to this date, as formula becomes less nutritious after that point. A package that has been opened generally lasts for a month, according to the CDC. Prepared formula at room temperature lasts for only two hours, while prepared formula that is refrigerated is good for up to 24 hours.\n\n►Related:How to ship and store baby formula\n\nShould I stock up on baby formula?\n\nWhen buying formula, it's important to remember that other families are going through the shortage, too—and hoarding limited stock will make the product worse. Storefronts, whether in-person or online, are also limiting the amount of formula shoppers can buy. “Due to increased demand and various supplier challenges, infant and toddler formulas are seeing constraint across the country. Similar to other retailers, we put into effect purchase limits of three per transaction on all infant and toddler formula to help improve inventory,\" a spokesperson for Walgreens told Reviewed. \"We continue to work diligently with our supplier partners to best meet customer demands.”\n\nSome stores have even moved their stock behind the counter, which means you'll need to ask an employee for formula instead of finding it on the shelf.\n\nHow to switch baby formulas\n\nIf formula is still in stock in your area but you're having trouble finding your regular brand or type, switching may be your best bet. Make sure to consult a pediatrician before making any changes to your baby's diet, but “80 percent of babies can be on any regular, non-specialized formula,” said Dr. Karen Chorvat, a pediatrician in the Chicago area. “All are nutritionally similar and most babies can switch without a lot of repercussions or issues.” (If your baby has allergies or other dietary needs, you need to switch to a formula with similar ingredients—check with your pediatrician for next steps, Dr. Chorvat said.)\n\nParents of older infants can also explore other options, she said—some brands of toddler formula, generally aimed at babies up to 24 months, are indicated for use in babies as young as 9 months. “If you have a 9 month old, it might be worth asking about a shift,\" said Dr. Chorvat. Babies who are closer to the 12-month mark for switching to cow's milk recommended by the CDC can also speak to their pediatrician to see if starting the transition earlier is a viable option for them, she said.\n\n►More: Expert tips for when—and how—to transition your baby off of formula\n\nWhat should I do if I run out of baby formula?\n\nMake your first call to your pediatrician—they may have recommendations or even samples they can share. Dr. Edmond Saraff, a pediatrician at So Cal Integrative Wellness Center, suggests reaching out to family or members of your community who may have extra they can share. Consider connecting with your local community both in-person and online—websites like Facebook and Nextdoor can connect you with local parents and resources.\n\nWhile our list is helpful for finding places to buy formula online, it may be helpful to expand your search beyond big chains and try shopping in person at local stores. Always make sure to call ahead to see if the store you're going to has formula available. Dr. Chorvat said that for parents already accessing local food banks may find formula there. Another option could be getting donated breast milk from milk banks.\n\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (or WIC) is also a great resource. The mission of the WIC is to provide mothers with breastfeeding support, nutritious foods, information on healthy eating as well as healthcare referrals. Your local WIC may be able to provide formula or help put you in touch with someone who can.\n\nWhen will the baby formula shortage end?\n\nRetailers are working diligently to restock supplies as they are able to. \"We’re continuing to work with our baby formula vendors to address this issue,\" said Matthew Blanchette, the Senior Manager of Retail Communications at CVS.\n\nThe Biden Administration has taken steps to get more formula on the shelves including simplifying product offerings to increase the speed and scale of production, cracking down on price gouging and increasing the supply of formula through increased imports. To alleviate supply stress, the FDA has relaxed restrictions on the sale of foreign formulas. Additionally, delivery of critical formulas from foreign nations through President Biden's 'Operation Fly Formula' has brought in 13 million 8-oz bottles since its inception. Last week alone, foreign deliveries supplied the U.S. with 4 million of those 13 million 8-oz bottles.\n\nAs for the Michigan plant, Abbott entered into an agreement with the FDA outlining steps needed to resume production. After meeting those requirements, Abbott restarted production on June 4th, prioritizing gettinEleCare back on the shelves for consumers beginning on or about June 20. This timeline will likely be pushed back a couple of weeks, says Abbott, due to last week's storms halting production temporarily. However, Abbott states that there is currently enough supply to meet demand until production begins again.\n\n►Related: Everything you need to know about European baby formula\n\nThere’s more where this came from.

McDermott\n\nDemocrat and Chronicle\n\nDramatic flooding in and around Montreal that has forced the evacuation of thousands seems a world away. People in the Rochester area, especially the hundreds who are coping with high water of their own, probably give scant thought to the plight of the Quebecois.\n\nBut the two regions, Montreal and Rochester, have a direct yet often unrecognized symbiotic relationship. Connected by 250 miles of lake and river, our water is theirs.\n\nAnd this spring especially, we're flooding and so are they.\n\nUnrelenting rain has pelted both regions this spring. More than 11 inches has fallen on Rochester and the southern shore of Lake Ontario since March 1. More than 13 inches of rain has fallen on Montreal, an island city surrounded by the St. Lawrence River, in that time.\n\nLake Ontario, from one end to the other, is swollen to its highest point in more than 20 years. Bouts of strong winds, the most recent one in the Rochester area on Friday, have eaten away huge chunks of shoreline and sent waters surging into shoreline homes. A state of emergency has been declared along the shoreline in New York.\n\nAnimated GIF - Find & Share on GIPHY\n\nAt the other end of those 125 miles, the St. Lawrence has broken century-old water level records. The river at Montreal Harbor is nearly four feet higher than normal for this time of year. Several thousand people in Quebec have been evacuated from their homes at some point in the last few weeks, and the federal and provincial governments have pledged millions of dollars to help with recovery.\n\nRead more:\n\nIf this is symbiosis, the point of unity is the giant Mose-Saunders hydroelectric dam, which spans the St. Lawrence. Ontario, the world's 12th largest freshwater lake, drains into the St. Lawrence. Gates at the dam can be opened or closed to alter the flow from one to the other.\n\nDuring times of high water, balancing the levels on Lake Ontario with those on the St. Lawrence near Montreal is a ticklish undertaking.\n\nLike two people on opposite ends of a teeter-totter, one goes up when the other goes down. Let more water out of the lake, and the levels around Montreal rise. Lower the water there and it goes up at Rochester.\n\nNot everyone acknowledges this relationship. The south shore of Lake Ontario, from the Niagara River to Sodus Point in Wayne County and beyond, has echoed with calls by everyday citizens and politicians alike to simply open the gates and release more water into the St. Lawrence. Toss the rule book in the trash, they say, and drain the damned lake.\n\nBut, officials counter: That simply cannot be done to any substantial degree without making flooding along the St. Lawrence far worse. By the peculiar calculus that applies, lowering the lake level a single inch would raise the river at Montreal by 10.\n\nThe appointed international board that oversees the outflow of water from lake to river met last week in Washington, D.C.\n\nThey have just begun operating under a new set of water-level rules, Plan 2014. Many people in the stretch of southern lake shoreline centered on Rochester blame that plan for the current flooding. People elsewhere on the lake and on the river mostly do not.\n\nBut Plan 2014 and the high water in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence topped the board's agenda. Water has risen high enough to invoke a special provision that, in theory, lets the board maximize the outbound flow to help distressed shoreline interests.\n\nBut the statement the board issued when its meeting ended was fatalistic. It cautioned that the lake could not be lowered without further inundating Montreal and environs, and pointed out that the water line in both places remains at remarkably high levels.\n\n\"Coastal jurisdictions should prepare for the possibility of major coastal flooding,\" the statement said.\n\nA Brighton engineer who is the senior U.S. member of that 10-member board, Frank Sciremammano, had a tone of resignation when he was asked how the meeting had gone.\n\n\"There's nothing more to be done, since the downstream situation is bad and getting worse,\" he said.\n\nSwollen rivers\n\nBrown flood water lapping at her calves, Stephanie Kennedy stood in the middle of Montreal's Rue Jean-Yves the other day and relived her encounters with the surge.\n\n\"We had this about two weeks ago, and we thought it was really bad,\" said Kennedy, who lives near the Prairies River, a delta channel that connects the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers. \"This time it’s even worse and it went up in one day. Now it's scary.\"\n\nWariness and fear are rampant throughout low-lying areas of metropolitan Montreal, the largest of dozens of communities in the Canadian province of Quebec afflicted by floodwaters this spring.\n\nThe Island of Montreal, with 140 miles of shoreline in southwestern Quebec, has hosted human settlements for thousands of years. It was a logical place for a village: uplands for visibility and comfort, and two rivers, the St. Lawrence and Ottawa, to provide food and transportation.\n\nBut nearly 2 million people now live on the boomerang-shaped island. A half million more live on the neighboring island of Laval, and many more in nearby shoreline communities.\n\nNow crowded with homes and businesses, these areas at the confluence of two mighty rivers are prone to floods. In most years, the floods are minor.\n\nThis year, they're not.\n\nMost of Quebec's rivers have reached flood stage this season. Sixteen hundred people living near the Richelieu River, which flows north from the New York border to the St. Lawrence, have had to leave their homes. At Gatineau, on the Ottawa River west of Montreal, more than 300 homes were evacuated last week. The city government has posted rescue videos, including one that shows a solitary woman clutching a small white poodle leaving her home in a boat.\n\nIn mid-April, 500 homes were flooded out and a state of emergency was declared at Rigaud, a community of about 7,500 people on the Ottawa closer to Montreal. Waters receded but returned last week, again threatening hundreds of homes.\n\n\"It's already worse than it was last time,\" Rigaud's communications director Marie-Andree Gagnon told CBC News. \"Homes that had water in their basements in April now have basements full of water.\"\n\nThe Ottawa, which drains a vast area to the north of Lake Ontario, is a lesser-known but major influence on water levels in Lake Ontario.\n\nIt joins the St. Lawrence just above Montreal and contributes a huge volume of water to that river. In springtime, the movement of water from Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence often has to be scaled back at the hydroelectric dam to make room for the Ottawa's flow.\n\nThis year, however, the record-breaking rains in Quebec and eastern Ontario made a mockery of that plan.\n\nThe flow out of Lake Ontario was adjusted 25 times in April, holding back more water in the lake when flooding worsened near Montreal, then upping the flow when the flooding abated. The board that oversees the releases said the goal was to share the pain so that neither of the two suffered to a greater degree than the other.\n\nBut there is so much water in Lake Ontario and the rivers in Quebec, and so much rain week after week, that everyone is in considerable pain. Even as the lake level spiked upward late last week, the outflow was scaled back three times in 24 hours to protect flood-stricken Montreal.\n\nSerge Fortier, who lives near the Prairies River in Montreal's Pierrefonds district, suffered from a similar fate to Kennedy — floodwaters that played cat and mouse.\n\n“We got flooded about a week and a half ago. Within two days the water just went away. There was nothing. Then they came, a couple days later, and picked up all the sandbags. And the next day, Wednesday, this came up out of nowhere,\" he said on Thursday, gesturing to river water that had reached the front steps of his home.\n\nThe exact cause of flooding and high waters remains a mystery to many people, said Krista Fazackerley, who works for a conservation agency whose territory includes the eastern end of Lake Ontario and the western reaches of the St. Lawrence, an area buffeted by rain and high water.\n\n\"People don't quite understand who regulates what. Sometimes they don’t even understand the flow of water,\" said Fazackerley, communications coordinator at the Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority in Kingston, Ontario. \"This Lake Ontario stuff, these levels, are new for us. People are contacting us and saying, 'What are you doing about the Lake Ontario level?' They’re still trying to grapple with it.\"\n\nMore: Rochester weather: Rising water levels, wind take toll on lakeshore\n\nElsewhere in Lake Ontario\n\nAt the far eastern end of Lake Ontario, conditions last Tuesday were \"terrible.\"\n\n\"We had 4-foot waves rolling in with a 35 mile-per-hour wind. It was beating up some of the houses,\" said Fred Jackson, fire chief in Chaumont, a small lakeside village in Jefferson County. As that storm hit, volunteers filled 4,100 sandbags in six hours.\n\nAs of late this week, they were holding their own. \"Nothing has been wrecked yet, but I’ve got one lady I’m keeping an eye on. Right now the waves are slapping on the bottom of her house. She’s not real impressed with that,\" Jackson said.\n\nHe knows there are some who are clamoring for more water to be released from Lake Ontario, but accepts the notion that that's just not possible right now.\n\n\"We can’t let water out into Quebec without flooding them,\" Jackson said. \"It’s a very delicate thing.\"\n\nThere's been no fierce winds lately at the other end of the lake, which dominated by the large Canadian city of Hamilton. But still, high water has flooded the basements or crawlspaces of dozens of shoreline homes. Rainfall there has set a record.\n\nTo the north and east, Toronto, the largest city on Lake Ontario and one of the most water-oriented, has had its share of trouble.\n\n\"I've never seen the amount of erosion we're seeing on the beaches right now,\" said Jolanta Kowalski, a spokeswoman for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. \"It's just too much water and nowhere for it to go, It's the perfect storm, if you will. We have rain, frozen ground, runoff from winter and it's been relentlessly raining.\"\n\nHer agency has 100,000 sandbags at the ready in southern Ontario if Toronto leaders call for them.\n\nSandbagging has become a staple of life on the charming and popular Toronto Islands, which lie in Lake Ontario just off the city's downtown.\n\n\"We’re basically a sandbar. The water comes up and there’s nothing we can do about it,\" said Lorraine Filyer, a leader in the cottage community of 700 that live on the largest island, Ward's. \"There are places that are under water, a few that are low-lying. Ducks and Canada geese have taken over. Beaches have basically disappeared.\"\n\nFilyer, who has lived on the 4-mile-long island since 1970, said some structures were nearing the point of being damaged. \"Nobody has been flooded yet but this is the highest I’ve seen it since 1973,\" she said, referring to an infamous year of high water on the lake.\n\nAs of Saturday, Lake Ontario was roughly two feet above its average level and about a half-foot below its all-time high from 1952.\n\nFerries are still running, though service has been scaled back a bit. Evacuation plans have been drawn up, and members of the tight-knit community have devoted time to studying the high water and its causes.\n\nMany shoreline residents in the Rochester area blame the new lake-level regulatory regimen, Plan 2014, for their woes. They note that the plan was designed to allow higher lake levels to remain in place for longer periods of times, though numerous experts have said this spring that heavy rain, not human decision-making, is to blame.\n\nDebate about Plan 2014 is almost entirely absent from news stories and commentaries on the Canadian side of the lake, and from interested parties along the St. Lawrence. On Ward's Island, Filyer said residents have brought the subject up. But everyone there seems to discount it.\n\n\"We don’t blame the plan. We don’t,\" she said. \"People want to blame anybody but God, you know what I mean? Anything but natural forces. But sometimes it’s just the weather.\"\n\nSORR@Gannett.com\n\nMCDERMOT@Gannett.com\n\nIncludes reporting by Glenn Russell of USA TODAY Network's Burlington, Vt., Free Press.\n\nFULL COVERAGE\n\n► Shoreline residents prepare for more flooding\n\n► Sodus Point: Still open but flooding issues mount\n\n► Flooding, rain sends sewage into local waterways\n\n► No relief for the weary; more rain in forecast\n\n► Sandbags available for Charlotte residents\n\n► Homeowners deal with flooding along lake\n\n► Sodus marina operator: Nothing was done to prevent flooding\n\n► Gov.

In the United States, drought and sea level rise clashed at the mouth of the historically low Mississippi River. And in South Africa, climate change made rainfall that triggered deadly floods heavier and twice as likely to occur.\n\nYet against the backdrop of these catastrophic events, this year also sparked some glimmers of hope:\n\nScientists in the US successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it used – a huge step in the decades-long quest to replace fossil fuels with an infinite source of clean energy.\n\nAnd at the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit in Egypt, nearly 200 countries agreed to set up a fund to help poor, vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters they had little hand in causing.\n\n“There was some encouraging climate action in 2022, but we remain far off track to meet our goals of reducing global heat-trapping emissions and limiting future planetary warming,” Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN. “There must be a stronger collective commitment and progress toward slashing emissions in 2023 if we are to keep climate extremes from becoming even more devastating.”\n\nHere are the top 10 climate and extreme weather stories of 2022.\n\n10. Tonga volcano eruption and global tsunami\n\nA zoomed-in view of the Tonga eruption, taken by Japan's Himawari-8 satellite, about 100 minutes after the eruption started. Simon Proud/Uni Oxford, RALSpace NCEO/Japan Meteorological Agency\n\nWhen the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in January, it sent tsunami waves around the world. The blast itself was so loud it was heard in Alaska – roughly 6,000 miles away. The afternoon sky turned pitch black as heavy ash clouded Tonga’s capital and caused “significant damage” along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.\n\nThe underwater volcanic eruption also injected a huge cloud of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, more than 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) above sea level, according to data from NASA satellites.\n\nAt the time, experts said the event was likely not large enough to impact global climate.\n\nBut months later, scientists found that the eruption actually belched an enormous amount of water vapor into the Earth’s stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The massive plume of water vapor will likely contribute to more global warming at ground-level for the next several years, NASA scientists reported.\n\n9. Rivers hit record lows\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Severe drought reveals incredible discovery at bottom of Mississippi river 00:45 - Source: CNN\n\nSearing temperatures, lack of rainfall and low snowpack pushed some of the world’s most vital rivers to new lows this year.\n\nNorthern Italy saw its worst drought in more than 70 years. The 400-mile River Po hit a record low due to an unusually dry winter and limited snowpack in the Alps, which feeds the river. The drought impacted millions of people who rely on the Po for their livelihood, and roughly 30% of the country’s food, which is produced along the river.\n\nAlso fed by winter snowpack in the Alps along with spring rains, Germany’s Rhine River dropped to “exceptionally low” levels in some areas, disrupting shipping in the country’s most important inland water way. Months of little rainfall meant cargo ships began carrying lighter loads and transport costs soared.\n\nMeanwhile in the US, extreme drought spread into the central states and gauges along the Mississippi River and its tributaries plummeted. Barge traffic moved in fits and starts as officials dredged the river. The Mississippi River dropped so low that the Army Corps of Engineers was forced to build a 1,500-foot-wide levee to prevent Gulf-of-Mexico saltwater from pushing upstream.\n\n8. US passes landmark climate law\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs \"The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022\" into law during a ceremony in the State Dining Room of the White House in August. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nAfter more than a year of negotiations, Democrats in late July reached an agreement on President Joe Biden’s long-stalled climate, energy and tax agenda – capping a year of agonizing negotiations that failed multiple times.\n\nBiden signed the bill into law in August and signaled to the world that the US is delivering on its climate promises.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin was influential in delaying the bill’s passage. Multiple White House and Biden administration officials for months had tried to convince the senator to support the bill over dinners in Paris and ziplining in West Virginia.\n\nAn analysis suggests the measures in the bill will reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 and would put Biden well on his way to achieving his goal of slashing emissions in half by 2030.\n\n7. Hurricane Nicole\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We are in trouble here in Daytona': Coastal homes collapse into the ocean 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\nHurricane Nicole was the first hurricane to hit anywhere in the US during the month of November in nearly 40 years. The rare, late-season storm also marked the first time that a hurricane made landfall on Florida’s east coast in November.\n\nAlthough Nicole was only a category 1, it had a massive wind field that stretched more than 500 miles, coupled with astronomically high tides that led to catastrophic storm surge. Homes and buildings collapsed into the ocean in Volusia County, with authorities scrambling to issue evacuation warnings.\n\nHurricane Nicole flooded streets, destroyed power lines and killed at least five people. The storm came just 42 days after deadly category 4 Hurricane Ian wreaked havoc on the west coast of Florida.\n\n6. A breakthrough at COP27\n\nProtesters demonstrate during the UN's COP27 climate conference in November in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed at the UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to set up a new fund for “loss and damage,” meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters. It was the first time wealthy, industrialized countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the US and the EU, agreed to establish such a fund.\n\n“We can’t solve the climate crisis unless we rapidly and equitably transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels, as well as hold wealthy nations and the fossil fuel industry accountable for the damage they have done,” Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN.\n\n5. A summer of flooding\n\nSubmerged vehicles in Jackson, Kentucky, in July. Between 8 and 10 inches of rain fell within 48 hours from July 27 to 28 across Eastern Kentucky. The month was Jackson's wettest July on record. Michael Swensen/Getty Images\n\nThe summer’s series of floods started off in Yellowstone National Park in June, when extreme rainfall and rapidly melting snow washed out roads and bridges in the park, causing significant damage to the nearby town of Gardiner, Montana, at the park’s entrance. Authorities had to rescue more than 100 people from the floods.\n\nThe year also brought several 1,000-year rainfall events. A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it’s only seen on average once every 1,000 years – under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.\n\nDeadly flooding swept through Eastern Kentucky and around St. Louis in July after damaging, record-breaking rainfall in a short period of time.\n\nCalifornia’s Death Valley, after a yearslong dry spell, saw its rainiest day in recorded history.\n\nMeanwhile, down south, parts of Dallas, Texas, got an entire summer’s worth of rain in just 24 hours in August, prompting more than 350 high-water rescues.\n\n4. Europe’s deadly heat wave\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Wildfires threaten London during record-breaking heat wave 01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nEurope experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022 by a wide margin. While the heat kicked off early in France, Portugal and Spain, with the countries reaching record-warmth in May, the most significant heat came in mid-July, spreading across the UK and central Europe.\n\nThe UK, in particular, topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time on record. Stephen Belcher, the UK Met Office’s chief scientist, said this would have been “virtually impossible” in an “undisrupted climate.”\n\nThroughout western Europe, the heatwaves gravely increased wildfire risk, with one London fire official noting that the 40-degree day led to an “unprecedented day in the history of the London Fire Brigade.”\n\n3. The West’s water crisis\n\nVideo Ad Feedback As water levels drop at this major lake, bodies begin to appear 03:19 - Source: CNN\n\nThe past few years have been a reality check for western states that heavily rely on the Colorado River for water and electricity. Plagued by decades of overuse and a climate change-fueled drought, the river that serves 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico is draining at an alarming rate.\n\nThe water levels in its two main reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have plunged rapidly, threatening drinking water supply and power generation. In late July, Lake Mead – the country’s largest reservoir – bottomed out and has only rebounded a few feet off record lows. Its rapidly plunging levels revealed human remains from the 1970s and a sunken vessel from World War II.\n\nThe federal government implemented its first-ever mandatory water cuts this year for states that draw from the Colorado River, and those cuts will be even deeper starting in January 2023.\n\n2. Catastrophic flooding in Pakistan\n\nFlood-affected people carry belongings out from their flooded home in Shikarpur, Sindh province, in Pakistan in August. Asif Hassan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFloods caused by record monsoon rain and melting glaciers in Pakistan’s northern mountain regions claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people this summer, with millions more affected by clean water and food shortages. More than a third of Pakistan was underwater, satellite images showed, and authorities warned it would take months for the flood waters to recede in the country’s hardest-hit areas.\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said the Pakistani people are facing “a monsoon on steroids,” referring to the role that the climate crisis had in supercharging the extreme rainfall. The hard-hit provinces Sindh and Balochistan saw rainfall more than 500% of average during the monsoon season.\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming emissions, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\n\n1. Hurricane Ian\n\nDestruction in the wake of Hurricane Ian on October 4 in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Ian was a Category 4 storm when it made landfall in southwest Florida in late September and left a trail of destruction from the Caribbean to the Carolinas. Insured losses from Ian are expected to reach up to $65 billion, according to recent data from reinsurance company Swiss Re.\n\nThe storm first struck Cuba before undergoing rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a category 3 hurricane in just 24 hours – something scientists told CNN is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms. That same week, Super Typhoon Noru in the Philippines grew from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept, catching officials and residents unaware and unable to prepare.\n\nHurricane Ian’s size and intensity allowed it to build up a storm surge higher than any ever observed in Southwest Florida, devastating Fort Myers and Cape Coral. Ian killed more than 100 people, most by drowning. It will likely be one of the costliest hurricanes on record not only in Florida, but in the US.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/25/weather/christmas-arctic-winter-storm-power-outages-sunday/index.html", "title": "Prolonged winter storm causes at least 37 deaths and leaves ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe prolonged winter storm that brought heavy snow, high winds and brutal cold to most of the US this past week has killed at least 37 people and had hundreds of thousands without power on Christmas morning.\n\nPerhaps the worst impact was around Buffalo, New York, where 43 inches of snow fell as of Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service. The snowfall and blizzard conditions made roads impassable, froze power substations and left more than a dozen people dead, Erie County officials said.\n\nThe conditions eased slightly on Sunday, allowing emergency responders to get out and see the extent of the problem.\n\n“I don’t want to say that this is going to be it because that would be a fallacy for me to say that, because we know that there are people who have been stuck in cars for more than two days,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Sunday. “There are people in homes who are below freezing temperatures.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul called it the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history” due to its power and its extended length.\n\n“It’s a crisis of epic proportion,” Hochul told CNN’s Paula Reid on Sunday.\n\nOver the past week, this winter storm brought dangerously cold temperatures, blizzard conditions and coastal flooding to almost the entirety of the US, wrecking Christmas plans along the way.\n\nMore than 55 million people were under wind chill alerts Sunday morning, and freeze warnings are in effect across the South.\n\nThe blizzard conditions persisted Sunday across the Great Lakes, while frigid cold temperatures gripped the eastern two-thirds of the country.\n\nSome major cities in the Southeast, Midwest and East Coast recorded their coldest Christmas in decades. In Florida, it will be the coldest December 25 since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nNew York City also saw record cold temperatures on Christmas Eve at several locations, including its JFK and LaGuardia airports. The high at Central Park was 15 degrees, marking it the second-coldest December 24 in at least 150 years, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to rebound later in the week with a much-welcomed warming trend with above-normal temperatures.\n\nAbout 250,000 homes and businesses in the US had no electricity service as of about 11 a.m. ET Sunday, with nearly half of those affected in Maine and New York, according to PowerOutage.us. Since the start of the storm the number of outages has at times exceeded a million customers.\n\nPower grid struggling with cold\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

The operator warned rolling blackouts could happen if the strain becomes too much.\n\nIn New York, utility companies Con Edison and Natural Grid US also urged customers to conserve energy, citing extreme weather conditions and increased energy demand on interstate pipelines carrying natural gas into the city.\n\nMeanwhile, a shortage of electricity in Texas prompted the US Department of Energy to declare an emergency Friday, allowing the state’s energy provider to exceed environmental emissions standards until energy usage drops.\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, frigid temperatures are hampering efforts to repair a large water main break late Saturday, which has caused a loss in water pressure for residents, city officials said.\n\n“We are grateful to the crews who are braving these frigid temperatures on this Christmas Eve night, while working to restore pressure to residents. Their sacrifice does not go unnoticed and is appreciated not only by this administration, but also by every resident who is affected,” the release stated.\n\nThe brutal weather conditions have also snarled travel during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday, and more than 2,800 canceled for Christmas Day.\n\nDangerous weather conditions claim lives\n\nSnow covers a vehicle on December 24, 2022, in Hamburg, New York. John Normile/Getty Images\n\nOut of the 17 weather-related fatalities recorded across New York, 16 were in Erie County, officials said, and one was a fatal carbon monoxide poisoning reported in Niagara County, according to the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nBlistering blizzard conditions swept the region, and Poloncarz, the county executive, said about 500 motorists found themselves stranded in their vehicles Friday night into Saturday morning, despite a county driving ban put in place during the storm.\n\nNational Guard troops had been called in to help “rescue people that are stuck in vehicles,” he said.\n\nOf the deaths reported early Sunday – with individuals ranging in age from 26 to 93 years of age – “some were found in cars and some were found actually on the street in snow banks,” Poloncarz said.\n\nTwo died in separate incidents Friday night when emergency medical personnel could not get to their homes in time for medical emergencies, Poloncarz said Saturday morning.

The city of Geneva, which is tucked into a bend in the river and between two lakes, is particularly inundated.\n\n“This area historically floods, and many residents stick it out” in their homes, Lerner told CNN in a phone interview. Lerner was not sure how many residents may have already left because of the flooding.\n\nThe St. Johns River begins southeast of Orlando and flows north through dozens of cities on the east side of the Florida Peninsula before it drains into the Atlantic Ocean in Jacksonville.\n\nThe river flows across 300 miles, yet only drops around 30 feet – making this river one of the slowest in the world, according to Scott Kelly, a forecaster at the National Weather Service in Melbourne.\n\n“It is a very, very lazy river,” Kelly told CNN. “Very slow moving.”\n\nKelly suspects the flooding could go on “perhaps for a couple of months,” and officials expect this slow-moving disaster to creep north over the next few weeks.\n\nThe water in Geneva “will eventually move to the Astor area,” Lerner said. “It’s a very slow trickle process.”\n\nAstor is an unincorporated community in Lake County and is on the west side of the river, just south of Lake George. Lerner said there is usually a two-week delay for water to flow from Geneva to Astor; so they should see the water level rise soon.\n\nWater pushes into homes and businesses along the St. Johns River in DeLand, Florida.

Chris Fau\n\nThe National Weather Service expects more rain in the region over the next few days as a cold front pushes through Florida.

Several inches of snow will also make for difficult travel late this afternoon through early Thursday.\n\nThursday: Thursday will be the most difficult day for travel. The storm will be hitting the Midwest extremely hard with heavy snow and strong winds. Western Minnesota will face not only blizzard conditions, but potentially deadly wind chills Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very difficult or impossible,” said the weather service. “This event could be life-threatening if you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero range.”\n\nChicago could also face blizzard conditions with winds gusting as high as 50 mph, with 2 to 4 inches of snow forecast.\n\n“Overall, concern continues to increase in the quick development of dangerous conditions Thursday afternoon with potentially significant impacts to the evening peak travel window,” warned the weather service office in Chicago.\n\nSnowfall early Wednesday in Glasgow, Montana.

This will leave millions finding a way to stay warm as temperatures plummet to well below freezing.\n\nSnow could fall as far south as Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and even Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday. Little to no accumulation is expected for most of the southern cities, however, Nashville could pick up about an inch of snow.\n\nIn anticipation of what will be a week of travel nightmares, United, American, Delta, Southwest and Jet Blue have issued travel waivers for dozens of airports across the country from the South to the Northeast, because in addition to snow covering roadways, low visibility could make air travel dangerous.\n\nAt least 1,000 flights had been canceled across the US, according to the flight tracking site Flightaware on Wednesday evening.\n\nChicago’s O’Hare International Airport leads the way, followed by Denver International and Chicago’s Midway International.\n\nCancellations at those airports could have a wider impact because they are busy hubs where travelers often change planes in order to reach other destinations. Thursday is expected to be the busiest pre-Christmas day for travel.\n\nFriday: The storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone” Thursday evening into Friday. A bomb cyclone is when a storm rapidly intensifies – and drops 24 millibars (a term used to measure atmospheric pressure) in 24 hours.\n\nThe storm is expected to reach the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane as it reaches the Great Lakes, with the weather service describing the strength of the low a “once-in-a-generation” event.\n\n“This is a case in which snow totals may not tell the whole story. Even small snow amounts, when combined with very strong wind gusts and plummeting temperatures, can cause poor visibility and slick spots on roads. The sudden arrival of these conditions can increase the danger,” the weather service explained.\n\nThe storm will be over the Great Lakes on Friday and continuing to produce heavy snow across much of the Midwest. Portions of Michigan could pick up more than a foot of snow by Friday, making travel impossible at times.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Michigan – where travel conditions will become difficult to impossible as the storm peaks Thursday into Friday. Major cities like Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Twin Cities and Detroit are under winter storm warnings for heavy snow and near blizzard conditions.\n\nHeavy rain will also blanket much of the I-95 corridor, adding to the travel troubles and lengthy airport delays.\n\nEven in places where the snow has ended, strong winds will continue to blow 30 to 40 mph across much of the Midwest and into the Northeast.\n\nFriday night into Saturday morning, New England will get a quick shot of snow and windy conditions.\n\nTravelers check in at Minneapolis' St. Paul Airport, Wednesday, December 21, 2022.

In the 10th, Reds pinch-hitter Ed Armbrister attempted a sacrifice bunt and bounced the ball in front of the plate. Catcher Carlton Fisk fielded the ball but collided with Armbrister and threw the ball into center while trying to force Cesar Geronimo at second.

With one out and a man on second base, Miami’s Luis Castillo hit fly ball down the left field line which several fans along with Alou tried to catch. If Alou had caught the ball, the Cubs would have been four outs away from winning their first NL pennant since 1945. Instead the Marlins went on to score eight runs in the inning for an 8-3 victory and then won the series the next night.\n\n2006 — Magglio Ordonez hit two home runs, including a series-ending, three-run shot in the bottom of the ninth to lead Detroit to a 6-3 victory and a ALCS sweep of Oakland.\n\n2015 — Jose Bautista wiped out the need for protests or umpire reviews with a three-run homer after three Texas Rangers errors for a 6-3 victory in the deciding Game 5 of the Division Series.

Or Al Dark, who won a World Series with the Oakland Athletics in 1974 and took the San Francisco Giants to the World Series in 1962, ultimately falling in seven games to the New York Yankees.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\nStill, Bochy stands above them all.\n\nHow many World Series has Bruce Bochy won?\n\nOf course, we just witnessed Bochy win a championship in his first season with Texas, but Bochy was an integral part of the early-2010s Giants dynasty. Bochy's Bay Area boys won three World Series over the course of five years, most recently in 2014 against the Kansas City Royals, who won the World Series the following year. Two years prior, his Giants swept the Detroit Tigers.\n\nTwo years before that, the Giants took down the Texas Rangers, 4-1 in the series.\n\nThat's right. Bochy has now won a World Series with the Texas Rangers and beaten them in a World Series.\n\nHas this ever been done before?\n\nIn short, no. This is the first time a manager has ever beaten a team in the World Series and then gone on to manage that team to a title. None of the managers on that list above accomplished the feat Bochy has.\n\nThat said, there is someone who accomplished something similar.\n\nCasey Stengel won seven World Series as the manager for the New York Yankees between 1949 and 1958. In that stretch, he took down the Brooklyn Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Giants, and Milwaukee Braves.\n\nCoincidentally, Stengel won two Fall Classics as a player, in 1921 and 1922, as an outfielder for the New York Giants. Both of those came against the New York Yankees. So, not only was Stengel on both sides of a title with the Yankees (beating them as a Giants player; winning as Yankees manager), but he was also on both sides of a title with the Giants (beating them as Yankees manager; winning as a Giants player).\n\nWhere does Bruce Bochy rank all-time among MLB managers?\n\nBochy is a shoe-in for Cooperstown at this point in his career. Here is where he ranks all-time in several key managerial categories:\n\nGames: 4,032 (7th all-time)\n\n4,032 (7th all-time) Wins: 2,093 (10th)\n\n2,093 (10th) Playoff wins: 56 (4th)\n\n56 (4th) Pennants: 5 (T-9th)\n\n5 (T-9th) World Series Titles: 4 (T-4th)\n\nWorld Series:The D-Backs biggest weakness was exposed in Game 4", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2023/10/15/mlb-playoffs-league-championship-series-bracket/71191751007/", "title": "MLB playoffs: 100 wins means nothing come baseball's postseason", "text": "PHOENIX — Let’s face it, the first two rounds of the postseason provided all of the drama of a Gilligan’s Island re-run.\n\nThere were a potential 32 games in the first two rounds and only 22 games were played.\n\nThe best-of-three wild-card round featured four two-game sweeps.\n\nThe best-of-five Division Series brought us two sweeps, two four-game series and not a single one went the distance.\n\nThere were barely had any lead changes the first two rounds.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\nLet’s see, the Los Angeles Dodgers did not lead a single inning in the 27 innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles led in only one of 27 innings.\n\nAtlanta led in only two of 36 innings.\n\nThere was only one lead change in the Houston Astros-Minnesota Twins series.\n\nThe noise you heard wasn’t a defect on your TV set – but the crying from the networks with these historically low ratings.\n\nSo, now that the 100-victory Dodgers, Orioles and Atlanta are sitting home after being bounced in the Division Series, a cheap and lazy narrative has taken root that the playoff system must be changed.\n\nThe critics will tell you these upsets devalue the integrity of the 162-game regular season.\n\nWell, hate to break the news – but that's complete and utter nonsense.\n\nThe first-round byes had nothing to do with those quick eliminations.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that these 100-victory teams were severely flawed when they got to the postseason.\n\nIt’s a miracle the Dodgers won 100 games with all their pitching woes and injuries. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts deserves a statue for leading them to their runaway season. But by the time they reached the postseason to play the Arizona Diamondbacks, it was a complete mismatch.\n\nTheir starting rotation of Clayton Kershaw, Bobby Miller and Lance Lynn lasted a combined 4 ⅔ innings, yielding a 20.50 ERA. Kershaw didn’t get out of the first inning. Miller didn’t get out of the second inning. And Lynn didn’t get out of the third inning.\n\nThat wasn’t a fluke. That was reality. The rotation was such a mess that the lone starter remaining from their opening-day starting rotation was Kershaw.\n\n“I’ve got to figure out a way to get these guys prepared for whatever format, whatever series,” Roberts said. “Yeah, the regular season, I think we do a great job. But the last couple of postseasons it just hasn’t gone well for us. So, I’ve got to figure it out.”\n\nCertainly, it didn’t help the cause that Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman went 1-for-21, with their team hitting .177 while scoring just six runs– the D-backs’ total in the first inning of Game 1. But instead of blaming the layoff, they happened to be facing D-backs prized starters of Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly, along with talented rookie Brandon Pfaadt.\n\n“I hate to say that this break got us swept,” Dodgers infielder/outfielder Enrique Hernandez said. “It’s just, everything aside, we just didn’t play good baseball. I’m not worried about what the Orioles did, or what the other NLDS series is looking like. …\n\n“I’m here. I live here. I’m with my guys. We didn’t play good baseball. There’s no other way to put it. They played better, and this happened.”\n\nThe Orioles had a terrific season, finishing with the best record in the American League. Brandon Hyde should run away with the AL Manager of the Year award with Mike Elias the Executive of the Year. Yet, they had a shaky starting rotation and never recovered from the loss of All-Star closer Felix Bautista. They also got little help at the deadline. Their only three additions to the pitching staff were Shintaro Fujinami, Jack Flaherty and Jacob Webb. They were all busts, with Fujinami failing to make the playoff roster while Flaherty was demoted to the bullpen.\n\nLittle wonder they gave up 21 runs in three games to the Texas Rangers, and were swept for the first time since May, 2022.\n\n“They outplayed us,” Orioles catcher James McCann told reporters. “It’s just that simple.’’\n\nAtlanta cruised all season with the National League’s best record, all but wrapping up the NL East title by the All-Star break. But when the postseason hit, they were without veteran starter Charlie Morton and 2022 21-game winner Kyle Wright, while ace Max Fried missed the final two weeks of the regular season with blister problems. Their offense also disappeared at the worst time, hitting .186 while scoring just eight runs in the four games.\n\n“We’re not a group that makes excuses,” said Atlanta starter Spencer Strider, who got beat twice. “I’m not a person that makes excuses. I think that the people trying to use the playoff format to make an excuse for the results they don’t like are not confronting the real issue. You’re in control of your focus, your competitiveness, your energy. And if having five days off (means) you can’t make that adjustment, you’ve got nobody to blame but yourself.\n\n“If we truly want to win a World Series, if that’s our goal, then we’re going to have to change something or add something, in the way we prepare and the way that we focus.’’\n\nThe expanded postseason format, which gives the teams with the two best records in each league a first-round bye, is not changing. At least not for 2024. MLB will re-evaluate it after next season, but there likely won’t be any modifications until MLB expands to 32 teams.\n\nListen, 100-victory teams failing to reach the World Series is hardly a new phenomena.\n\nThere have been 43 teams who won 100 or more games in the wild-card era, but just five of those teams won the World Series, a mere 11.6% since 1995.\n\nIf you go back to 1980, there were 53 teams who have won 100 games, and just seven have won the World Series (13.2%).\n\nYet for those wanting to blame the system, three different GMs uttered the same refrain.\n\n“Hey, if you want to give us a first-round bye for winning the wild-card next year,\" one NL GM said, “I’ll take it right now.\"\n\nCertainly, the layoff had no effect on the defending World Series champion Astros. They badly wanted to win the division for the first-round bye, winning it on the final day of the season, and then knocked off the Twins, hitting .261 with 10 home runs. They got the bye last year, too, had another four days off after winning the ALCS, and cruised to the World Series title.\n\nThe key, Astros manager Dusty Baker says, may simply be mental.\n\n“We stayed locked in during the layoff,\" Baker said. “The fact that we had to play up until the last day of the season to get in, I think that's even more important than the layoff. You look at the Dodgers, you look at the Braves, they had like two weeks prior to that, and they had a layoff.\n\n“So, even though they were playing and winning, that's almost mentally three weeks to a month off.\"\n\nForget the Moneyball theory that winning in October is a matter of sheer luck.\n\nBruce Bochy wasn’t just lucky when he led the San Francisco Giants to three World Series titles from 2010-2014.\n\nThe Dodgers are not unlucky by winning at least 100 games four consecutive full seasons and not having a parade to show for it.\n\nYou better have a strong rotation with at least two front-line starters. You better have a powerful bullpen. And you better have clutch hitters who can perform on the big stage.\n\nIt’s no fluke why the Astros and Phillies may be on a collision course to meet up once again, which would be only the second World Series rematch since 1959.\n\nIf teams really want to change their postseason fate, they need to do something about it.\n\nDon’t be content just to get there, rely on a platoon system, consistently employ bullpen games and expect to be like the Astros in October, who are playing in their seventh consecutive ALCS.\n\n“I do think there’s certain things that are important in the postseason, but I don’t think that there’s a formula, right?” Atlanta GM Alex Anthopoulos said in his season-ending press conference. “Because then, whether it’s the Phillies or any other team, they’d be winning the World Series each year, right? And there’s plenty of great teams. And you could talk about the Braves teams that got to the World Series, or other teams that got there and didn’t win. But I think that’s what makes baseball great, is that you’re constantly looking for answers, in terms of what gets you to a World Series. …\n\n“It’s human nature that we all want to be able to pinpoint and say, ‘Here’s why, here’s the answer, change this, fix that, problem solved, you win the World Series.’ Well, the other 11 teams are going through the same thing.\"\n\nMaybe, it’s time to steal a page out of the Astros and Phillies’ playbooks.\n\nSure, you want your team to survive the grueling 162-game season to get into the dance, but if you want that ring ceremony, you better build your team for October.\n\n“Look, obviously we would love to win 100 games in the regular season,\" Phillies All-Star catcher J.T. Realmuto told The Athletic in their celebration. \"We would love to run away with the division like the Braves got to do the last six years. But at the end of the day, our goal is to win a World Series.\n\n“It’s not necessarily to beat the Braves. It’s not necessarily to win the division. It’s to win a World Series.\"\n\nSo, enough with the blame game.\n\nForget the excuses.\n\nYou want to play in the World Series? Construct your team for the postseason, not a mid-week series in June.\n\nYes, the D-backs deserve to be here\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks realize they barely got into the dance, winning just 84 games, but they’re not about to apologize for still being around in the NLCS.\n\n“This is the biggest questions I’ve had to answer over the last seven to 10 days,\" D-backs manager Torey Lovullo says. “'Do you think you guys deserve to be here?'\n\n“Hell yeah, I do, because that’s a good baseball team there. We just had a lot of young moments, and you can see how good we are when we don’t have the young moments.\"\n\nSo it's infuriating to hear the doubts?\n\n“It kind of makes me laugh,\" Lovullo says, “but I will say it motivates me personally. I know it motivates our team. And as a very, very famous college football coach who’s having a tremendous amount of success and is coaching his butt off with his players behind him says, We’re keeping receipts. I’ll leave it at that. We have a long list of receipts right now.\"\n\nAround the basepaths\n\n– Philadelphia Phillies starter Aaron Nola and the Phillies never came close to reaching a contract extension last winter and it’s unknown whether they can bridge that gap now.\n\nNola was seeking an eight-year contract in excess of $200 million, while the Phillies were hoping to sign him to a four- or five-year deal.\n\nTalks broke off, Nola bet on himself and if he continues to pitch well this postseason, he just might get that payday from someone else.\n\n– MLB vice president Michael Hill, the former president of the Miami Marlins, has no interest in leaving his position for the Boston Red Sox or any other team at this time.\n\n– While the Dodgers still are the favorite to sign free agent Shohei Ohtani, the Angels are cautiously optimistic that Ohtani will stay with them.\n\n– Japanese right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto, 25, also is high on the Dodgers’ wish list, along with the New York Yankees and Mets.\n\n– The St. Louis Cardinals will strongly pursue Minnesota Twins free agent Sonny Gray this winter.\n\n– Joey Votto and the Cincinnati Reds appear to be on their way to a breakup. The Reds have no interest in picking up the $20 million option in Votto’s contract, and Votto has shown little interest in a part-time role.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays could be an ideal fit to bring Votto back home.\n\n– While David Stearns got a five-year contract for about $50 million to be president of baseball operations for the New York Mets, the Nats gave Mike Rizzo just a two-year extension for less than one-third of the money to run their organization.\n\n– Congratulations to former umpires Joe West and Ed Montague, who are officially on the Hall of Fame contemporary era ballot with six other players, executives and managers, including former manager Lou Piniella.\n\n– The Diamondbacks plan to reward manager Torey Lovullo with a multiyear contract extension this winter. Lovullo’s current contract expires after the 2024 season.\n\n“I'd love to stay there for the rest of my career, the rest of my life,\" Lovullo says. “And if it happens that the Diamondbacks want to extend me, of course, I would be thrilled.”\n\n– Delino DeShields, who was part of the purge of the Washington Nationals’ overhaul, should be on everyone’s list for managerial and coaching candidates.\n\n– One of the best moves made this offseason was the Royals’ hiring of scouting director Brian Bridges.\n\n– The Seattle Mariners’ shrewdest move this winter could be signing Padres free-agent ace Blake Snell, a Seattle native, and trading some of their young pitching depth for position players.\n\n– Excuse Atlanta if they don’t want to face Bryce Harper ever again in the postseason.\n\nIn the last two years, he went 14-for-29 with five home runs in the Phillies’ two NLDS victories over Atlanta.\n\n– Dayton Moore plans to stay with the Texas Rangers as a special assistant instead of joining close friend Chris Getz of the Chicago White Sox. DeJon Watson, formerly of the Nats, would be an ideal fit with his vast experience in all phases of a front office.\n\n– The Milwaukee Brewers have no choice but to keep Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes one last season before he hits free agency if they want to contend in 2024.\n\nThey’ll be without co-ace Brandon Woodruff all next season after he udnerwent shoulder surgery.\n\nYet this is also an organization that has 12 arbitration-eligible players who are projected to earn more than $70 million, including shortstop Willy Adames, who is also eligible for free agency in a year.\n\n– Hard to believe that the four players who will finish in the top four of the NL MVP balloting – Ronald Acuña Jr., Mookie Betts, Matt Olson and Freddie Freeman – hit just .137 in the NLDS with only one extra-base hit in 51 at-bats.\n\n– The Boston Red Sox have interviewed assistant GM Eddie Romero among their internal candidates to replace Chaim Bloom as their chief baseball officer, but Phillies GM Sam Fuld may still be the favorite.\n\n– Starter Jordan Montgomery’s stock has risen sharply with his stellar performance since joining the Rangers and should be in line for a fat payday with his former teams, the Cardinals and Yankees, expected to pursue him.\n\nMontgomery has been the Rangers’ best starting pitcher since after acquired from the St. Louis Cardinals at the trade deadline, yielding a team-best 2.79 ERA and team-leading 67⅔ innings.\n\n– Astros first baseman Jose Abreu is showing that he’s certainly built for October.\n\nThe dude struggled until September, dove in 28 runs in his last 26 games, and then went out and hit .316 with three homers and eight RBI in the ALDS.\n\n– The San Francisco Giants, who are interviewing current coaches before looking outside of the organization to replace Gabe Kapler, have not hired a first-time manager in 30 years, going back to Dusty Baker in 1993.\n\n– You can’t win a World Series in April, but as the Philadelphia Phillies and Texas Rangers have discovered, you can win home-field advantage.\n\nThe Phillies and Rangers opened the season against each other, and with the Rangers sweeping the three-game the series, they have the World Series tiebreaker over the Phillies if both 90-win teams reach the World Series.\n\n– The Diamondbacks made a number of shrewd moves to get to the postseason, but none bigger than their trade of outfielder Daulton Varsho to the Blue Jays for catcher Gabriel Moreno and outfielder Lourdes Gurriel Jr.\n\nThey are not in the postseason without them while Moreno is emerging as one of the finest young catchers in the game.\n\n– The Chicago White Sox will be hiring their third hitting coach in three seasons after firing Jose Castro, who replaced Frank Menechino.\n\nThe White Sox hit .238 and ranked last in the major leagues in on-base percentage (.291), 11th in the American league with 171 home runs and 12th with a .384 slugging percentage.\n\n– The Phillies have become agents’ favorite team, showing that by spending money can indeed make a huge difference despite what happened in New York and San Diego.\n\nThe Phillies had an opening-day payroll of just $68.9 million in 2019.\n\nOwner John Middleton has since dropped $1.04 billion acquiring Bryce Harper, J.T. Realmuto, Zack Wheeler, Kyle Schwarber, Nick Castellanos and Trea Turner.\n\nThey now have a juggernaut.\n\n– D-backs manager Torey Lovullo says one of the keys to their success this year has been the leadership and play of 38-year-old veteran Evan Longoria.\n\n“I don’t like phonies, nobody likes phonies,’’ Lovullo says. “This is a team full of real people that act real. Talk real. And believe real.\n\n“And Evan Longoria stands on that foundation every single day.’’\n\n– The coolest matchup of the entire postseason is in the ALCS with Dusty Baker, 74, and Bruce Bochy, 68, the longtime friends and the two oldest mangers in baseball, who have combined for 4,276 wins, four World Series titles and seven pennants in their managerial careers.\n\nThis is only the second time in history that two managers with at least 2,000 victories opposed each other in the postseason, joining Tony La Russa of the St. Louis Cardinals and Joe Torre of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2009 NLDS.\n\n– Quote of the week, provided by D-backs closer Paul Sewald, who was stunned by the Seattle Mariners’ decision to trade him at the deadline, only to become the key of the D-backs’ dramatic bullpen turnaround\n\n“You always like to do better than your ex in a breakup,” Sewald said. “And I'm doing a little bit better than my ex.”\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/playoffs/2023/10/06/mlb-playoffs-bracket-power-rankings-postseason-world-series/71077078007/", "title": "MLB playoff power rankings: Eight teams left chasing World Series", "text": "A bloodless and ruthlessly efficient wild-card round certainly cleaned out the playoff pool, but did little to establish which clubs might be firmly positioned as World Series favorites.\n\nIn fact, it probably clouded the issue.\n\nAs Major League Baseball’s postseason bracket challenge gets trimmed from 12 hopefuls to eight, the formality of the four wild-card series certainly created a fresh set of challenges for the higher-seeded and ostensibly superior division winners who await in the American and National League Division Series.\n\nAnd the clearest path to a pennant and the World Series that follows looks much more cluttered.\n\nNonetheless, USA TODAY Sports will take aim at ranking the remaining playoff pool, based on the best path to the World Series as the four Division Series tip off Saturday:\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\n1. Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nWhoa. You mean a team with a sore-shouldered ace capable of pitching five innings a week, backed by a kiddie corps of starters should be booking its Fall Classic reservations?\n\nWell, you can’t get to the World Series unless you survive the NL Championship Series. And there’s no NLCS unless you survive the NLDS.\n\nAnd the Dodgers have by far the simplest assignment of the four top seeds.\n\nThey’ll welcome 84-win Arizona to Dodger Stadium to open the proceedings, thanks to the Diamondbacks’ “upset” of a Milwaukee club without No. 2 starter Brandon Woodruff. No Central club has advanced to a World Series since 2016, so the loss wasn’t exactly a stunner.\n\nLos Angeles went 8-5 against Arizona this year and will start Clayton Kershaw in Game 1. Whether the future Hall of Famer can pitch more than the once a week he’s gone in the past month remains to be seen.\n\nBut a high-octane and playoff-seasoned Dodgers offense should take the heat off young starters Bobby Miller and Ryan Pepiot, who may become household names by November. Most important: The Dodgers only have to beat one of Atlanta and Philadelphia to get to the Fall Classic.\n\n2. Minnesota Twins\n\nYeah, not sure just what we’re smoking here. But we had a sneaking suspicion the Twins’ pitching really was for real coming into the playoffs, and Pablo Lopez and Sonny Gray only reinforced that notion in dismissing the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nCan they topple the playoff-seasoned Houston Astros? Well, Carlos Correa is on their side for this one. Swiping a game off Justin Verlander or Framber Valdez at Minute Maid Park would send the Twins back to their suddenly crazed home field.\n\nBeyond that, Lopez, Gray, Joe Ryan, Bailey Ober and Kenta Maeda form a solid base to survive the best-of-seven series to come. Hey, sometimes you gotta roll the dice.\n\n3. Baltimore Orioles\n\nThere’s no more proving if they’re for real. The Orioles answered every question effusively down the stretch, and in this bloated playoff environment, 101 wins counts for an awful lot.\n\nThe only problem is the Texas Rangers tumbling from AL West champ all the way down to a wild-card series. Now, Baltimore faces an ALCS-caliber matchup a round early – and the first to three wins.\n\nHaving wisely managed their young pitchers’ workloads, the Orioles have enough pitching. The question is whether an offense prone to dry spells can consistently produce against the shortened playoff staffs they’ll face.\n\nWe’ll deem them the official “Don’t let them get hot” club of October: Survive the Rangers, and the Orioles might not be stopped.\n\n4. Philadelphia Phillies\n\nThe most fascinating division series is a rematch from last year – and this time, a Phillies conquest won’t be considered such an “upset.”\n\nOh, Atlanta is as scary as it looks on paper: 104 wins, 307 home runs, the presumptive NL MVP in Ronald Acuña Jr. It’s just that Philly’s pitching is looking far deeper right now – and that could be the case in every series going forward.\n\nZack Wheeler and Aaron Nola showed they can lead the way in sweeping aside Miami. But it’s the weapons they’ve scarcely deployed yet – lefty starters Ranger Suarez and Cristopher Sanchez, and a deep bullpen led by Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman and intriguingly dominant rookie Orion Kerkering – that bodes particularly well for the later rounds.\n\nApparently, they can also hit the ball a little.\n\n5. Atlanta Braves\n\nWe’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Spencer Strider may be the most significant individual this postseason.\n\nNo pitcher is as dominant as the 20-game winner and 281-strikeout man, and his starting assignment in Game 1 against the Phillies is huge. Manage the pitch count and shut down the Phillies, and Atlanta has a massive leg up in that NLDS.\n\nMake a couple mistakes and fail to get through six innings, and the Braves’ quietly concerning pitching depth is suddenly a huge issue.\n\nAn off day between Games 1 and 4 means Strider can start twice on regular rest, the latter outing coming at Citizens Bank Park, where 45,000 frothy participants apparently took Strider’s cheeky general comments about fandom rather personally.\n\nTwo Strider wins would alleviate pressure on lefty Max Fried, who hasn’t pitched in two weeks due to a blister and diminish the import of a likely piggyback effort from Bryce Elder and Kyle Wright.\n\nThat Braves offense? It rolls nine deep. But it may only go as far as their arms take them.\n\n6. Texas Rangers\n\nTexas looked dead in the water after failing three times to lock down the division, but Tampa Bay’s pop-gun offense was just what an injury-wracked, bullpen-challenged club needed.\n\nNow, can the Rangers slug their way into the final four?\n\nBy far the biggest bright spot in the wild-card round was Nathan Eovaldi’s dominant start, after an injury-filled and ineffective second half. Jordan Montgomery and Eovaldi will start Games 2 and 3 of the ALDS, which puts a huge burden on expected Game 1 starter Dane Dunning.\n\nIt seems unlikely a club missing both their Plan A, B and C starters in Jacob deGrom, Max Scherzer and Jon Gray and a bullpen whose 4.77 ERA is worst among playoff teams can pull together enough pitching in a best-of-seven series. But Marcus Semien, Corey Seager and Adolis Garcia are healthy. Slugfests, anyone?\n\n7. Houston Astros\n\nFar be it from us to say the Astros’ ownership of the AL is over with. Four ALCS titles in six seasons earns them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut we do have our doubts this year.\n\nHouston spent September in an unfamiliar role – first assuring it would even reach the playoffs, and then needing a Rangers loss on the last day of the year and a tiebreaker to win the division.\n\nThe potholes they navigated to get here might be too deep going forward.\n\nA pitching staff that saw Cristian Javier’s ERA leap by more than two runs and Framber Valdez’s more than half a run can no longer be the backbone – even if Justin Verlander is back, for old times’ sake. While Bryan Abreu and Hector Neris are reliably dominant, the bullpen is not the lockdown unit it was a year ago, not with Ryan Pressly’s concerning peripherals and Rafael Montero’s implosion.\n\nThe epic quartet of Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman, Kyle Tucker and Yordan Alvarez means the club can get back in any game in a hurry. But this time, perhaps there’s one too many holes to patch.\n\n8. Arizona Diamondbacks\n\nSure, it’s possible: The Diamondbacks can pull a 2006 Cardinals – they of the 83 wins – and chug their way into the World Series.\n\nJust not particularly probable.\n\nIt’s nice that top starters Merrill Kelly and Zac Gallen are aligned for the first two games of the NLDS. But while the Diamondbacks survived a Brandon Pfaadt start to win Game 1 of the wild-card series, their back-end rotation weaknesses and mid bullpen will eventually surface.\n\nFor now, enjoy the Corbin Carroll highlight reel while you can. You’d think the Dodgers saw enough of him to take utmost care with the presumed Rookie of the Year. The Brewers learned that lesson too late.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2023/04/16/boston-red-sox-marathon-2013-bombing-patriots-day-world-series/11675112002/", "title": "Patriots Day: Red Sox knew what 2013 World Series meant after ...", "text": "They will be standing alongside one another at Fenway Park on Sunday, basking in the glory of their triumph on a baseball field, but also fighting back tears and the raw emotions of that horrific afternoon still searing their souls.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of their improbable 2013 World Series championship, but the reality is that baseball will only be the backdrop, with everyone recognizing just what their achievement meant to a shaken community.\n\nIt was 10 years ago on Patriots Day, April 15, 2013, that two bombs went off, 14 seconds apart at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed. Seventeen people lost limbs. Nearly 300 people were injured.\n\nIt was the largest terrorist attack in America since 9/11.\n\n“It’s something that will stay with me, for all of us, forever,’’ Jonny Gomes, one of the leaders of that World Series team told USA TODAY Sports. “We are going to be celebrating a World Series championship season, but at the same time, there’s a very sobering event that happened.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\n“I’m not sure it’s a celebration, but a remembrance.’’\n\nThe Red Sox have won four World Series titles in the last 20 years, including the 2004 World Series that broke their 86-year curse, but none will ever have the impact of that 2013 season.\n\n“With all respect to the different championship teams,’’ said Red Sox president Sam Kennedy, who was born and raised in Boston, “that team is the most important team in our time here given the magnitude of what happened here at the finish line.\n\n“Patriots Day is so important in the ethos of New Englanders, with kids not having school, the Marathon, our [11 a.m.] Patriots Day Game. It’s the greatest sports day in Boston. This whole region was robbed of that innocence. Our lives have never been the same.\"\n\nThe Red Sox just finished playing their early baseball game that day, winning 3-2 over Tampa Bay on Mike Napoli’s walk-off double, They quickly showered, trying to beat the traffic, and boarded the bus headed to Logan Airport for Cleveland.\n\nThe first bomb went off at 2:49 p.m., 39 minutes after their game ended.\n\nThen, a second bomb.\n\nThey had no idea what happened until they were on the bus and started seeing the horrifying images on their cell phones.\n\n“I remember we thought there was an electric transformer explosion,’’ Gomes said, “and then you start seeing these gruesome photos, blood all over the place, body parts all over. Then, you see all of these firetrucks, ambulances, police cars all pouring into the city from the other side of the freeway. And we’re hauling ass away from town.\n\n“We’re supposed to be these heroes that play for the Red Sox, and we’re leaving. It didn’t sit right with me. It was a sobering moment.’’\n\nThe Red Sox landed in Cleveland and quickly organized a team dinner at the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. No one talked about baseball. They instead talked about life. They talked about rallying around the city. They talked about winning the World Series.\n\n“I remember when I got traded over there at the deadline,’’ pitcher Jake Peavy said, “I go into the clubhouse early and run into Jonny Gomes. He says, 'Glad to have you, we’re one day closer to the parade.’ I didn’t know what he was talking about. I walked over to Salty [Jarrod Saltalamacchia], and I said, “Hey, my family is coming to town, and Gomes said something about a parade. Is there something going on for the kids?’\n\n“He says, 'Man, he’s talking about the World Series parade.\n\n“Yeah, we’re going to win the World Series.’’\n\nThe truth is the Red Sox, a team mostly filled with veterans on short-term contracts, were talking about the World Series back in spring training. Gomes told his teammates he was not going to shave until after the World Series “so when the playoffs start, this thing is going to look majestic.’’ Dustin Pedroia told Red Sox president Larry Lucchino before they played a single spring-training game that the team was going to go all of the way. Lucchino laughed at him, and then told them if that happened, he’d buy him a car.\n\nThe Red Sox returned to Boston after their three-game series in Cleveland and this time, their buses were the only vehicles on the highway. The city was on lockdown searching for the bombers.\n\n“I remember being on the phone with city hall officials, Mayor [Thomas] Menino,’’ Kennedy said. “He kept insisting that we were playing. He said, 'We’re not letting these guys shut us down.'\"\n\nThe first game of their series on Friday was canceled. That evening, the terrorists were found. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police shootout. His brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was captured inside a boat in the suburb of Watertown and today is on death row.\n\nThe city, finally able to breathe again, slowly filtered out to Fenway Park to watch the Red Sox and Royals play Saturday afternoon, April 20, in perhaps the most emotional game of their lives. The Red Sox invited all of the first responders, doctors, nurses, hospital workers, FBI officials, marathon workers, government officials and everyone who played a role in the healing of the city.\n\n“There must have been 250 people in that clubhouse,’’ Kennedy said, “hugging each other, crying together. It was just this outpouring of emotion.’’\n\nThey gathered together on the field for a 25-minute ceremony, and David Ortiz, who had been on the injured list to open the season and was at Triple-A Pawtucket when the bombings occurred, was suddenly asked if he could say a few words to the crowd. Ortiz, unprepared, slowly walked out, and stepped up to the mic with the American flag draped across the Green Monster, thanked everyone, and then uttered the line that will live forever in Boston history.\n\n“This is our [bleeping] city, and nobody gonna dictate our freedom.\n\n“Stay strong.’’\n\n“It was like a shock at first,’’ Gomes said. “Like, did he really say [bleep]? Come on, I think he said [bleep]. The place just went nuts.’’\n\nIt was perfect, with even Mayor Menino giving Ortiz a high-five as he walked off the field.\n\n“I didn’t even know that I said that,’’ Ortiz would later say.\n\nThe Red Sox won that game, 4-2, on Daniel Nava’s three-run homer. They were moved by the resiliency of the city and spent the next few weeks and months privately visiting victims in hospitals. They went to local fire stations and police departments. They were all in this together now.\n\n“People say that the fans jumped on our back that year,’’ Peavy said. “That’s wrong. We rode on their back. They carried us. We had to win the World Series that year.\n\n“We knew what it meant.’’\n\nThis was one of the most unique teams in baseball history, a team that came off a last-place, 69-93 season, their worst in 47 years. They fired manager Bobby Valentine and brought in John Farrell. They overhauled the makeup of the clubhouse. GM Ben Cherington brought in gritty veterans on short-term deals who had winning pedigrees.\n\nThey nearly went wire-to-wire, in first place all but 14 days, running away with the AL East and having the time of their lives.\n\n“There will never be another team like it again,’’ Peavy said. “It was truly a team where the prisoners ran the prison. We knew how to win. We knew what it would take. And nobody was going to stop us.\n\n“I mean, the things we did, let me tell you, we had some crazy characters.’’\n\nThere was that time in Tampa when they lost their third consecutive game. They called a closed-door, players-only team meeting, and posted signs throughout the clubhouse, making sure the media was aware of it.\n\nThey kicked the media out and spent the time talking about playoff shares and postseason plans.\n\nIt was mid-May.\n\nThere was the August night in Toronto when the players hung out at a local bar, perhaps a bit overserved, headed back to the hotel at 2 in the morning, when someone came up with the idea of waking up beloved third base coach Brian Butterfield.\n\nThey knew Butterfield went to bed early so Pedroia tiptoed down the hotel hallway, knocked on Butterfield’s door, and told him that he really needed to talk to him. Butterfield groggily opened the door, and as soon as it cracked open, there were about 15 Red Sox players barging through the door.\n\nRecalled Peavy: “We told Butter, 'I don’t know if you know this, but we're winning the World Series. We got to know, Game 7 on the line – you ready to call a squeeze play? You ready to call a steal?'\n\n“So there’s Butter, actually calling signs in his underwear, when we’re all liquored up.’’\n\nSaid Gomes: “We even had him practicing shaking guys’ hands after rounding third base when we hit World Series home runs. It was outrageous.’’\n\nWell, maybe not quite as ludicrous as the day before the playoffs when Farrell called a team meeting. The players thought it was pointless. They had been winning the whole year doing things their own way, so why change now?\n\nWell, with the entire team gathered in the weight room, pitcher Ryan Dempster bursts through the door 30 seconds into the meeting, wearing nothing but a jock strap, eye-black on his face, his mouth filled with chewing tobacco, holding a bottle of Captain Morgan.\n\nDempster, as his alter-ego “Jack Hammer,\" told Farrell the team just needs to concentrate on the three F’s:\n\nFundamentals.\n\nFoul tips: “Catchers, you got catch those foul tips so we can have strikeouts.’’\n\nFour-run homers: “Boys, load the bases up so when we hit those homers, we’ll get more runs out of it.’’\n\nMeeting over.\n\nIn six games, so was the World Series, with the Red Sox beating the St. Louis Cardinals and winning their first championship at home since 1918.\n\nThe party lasted for days, right through the parade, when they rode in duck boats (with Peavy actually purchasing one) and stopping just before the finish line of the Marathon on Boylston Street.\n\nGomes climbed out of the duck boat, clutching the World Series trophy, placed it at the finish line, draped a Boston Strong jersey over it, and stepped back.\n\n“I put the World Series trophy down,’’ Gomes said, “and I’m thinking, 'Damn, this is right where the bombs went a couple of months ago.' It was pretty emotional.’’\n\n“I’ll never forget that moment, I’ll never forget that team,’’ David Ross said. “It changed my life.’’\n\nSays Pedroia: “The toughest baseball team I’ve ever seen. That team would have won in any era.’’\n\nAnd, yes, just in case anyone wonders, Pedroia did get that car.\n\nPedroia reminded Kennedy after they clinched a playoff berth in mid-September about the offer, slapped the picture of a Ford Raptor car on his desk, and told him: “Make sure Lucchino doesn’t forget.’’\n\nThe car was delivered a few months later.\n\nEven now, 10 years later, Red Sox players are stopped on the streets.\n\n“That just resonated with so many people,’’ Ross said.\n\n“We were just doing our job, and feeding off all of the love we received.’’\n\nThe Red Sox visited the Marathon finish line Saturday for the ringing of the bells. They’ll be honored at Fenway on Sunday with Marathon victims and their families in attendance. And Monday, Ortiz will be the Grand Marshal of the 127th Boston Marathon, with Dempster and former Red Sox infielder Brock Holt running the marathon.\n\n“This will be as emotional a moment as time is standing still,’’ Peavy said, “honoring victims, and making sure they get their day of remembrance along with all of the first responders. We can celebrate who this team was. What this city meant to us. And tell the story how we unified and pulled something off larger than life.\n\n“We are Boston Strong.’’\n\nLongo loving life\n\nArizona Diamondbacks third baseman Evan Longoria is showing he can still play.\n\nLongoria planned to retire this winter unless Arizona or the Tampa Bay Rays called, and the D-backs jumped on him, valuing his leadership skills in a clubhouse filled with kids.\n\nWell, he is delivering on the field too, hitting .333 with a 1.074 OPS this season.\n\n“I want to produce on the field first and foremost,” Longoria says. “I’m still putting on a uniform to go out and play the game. I don’t want to go out there and go 0-for-4 and be the guy who guys ask questions on the bench about how it was 15 years ago. That’s not the only thing I want to do.\n\n“When you have results, it makes it easier to have those conversations when you help the team win.”\n\nAnd although there are players barely old enough to drink in the clubhouse, and some don’t have to shave, Longoria says their maturity level is as if they have been around the game for 20 years.\n\n“These kids now already are experienced with the way they handled themselves,’’ Longoria said. “I think kids now, freshmen in high school, are being videotaped and put on the internet and talked about as a prospect in the scouting world. It has a certain way of taking the youth away from you. You have to become more mature. I see kids now 14, 15, 16 years old, doing the media stuff.\n\n“The first time I ever did an interview with the media was probably when I got drafted. These kids are having to learn all of those things a lot earlier, and it makes for a more mature player once they get to the big leagues.\n\n“Younger players now are definitely more mature and more ready to handle the challenges of the big leagues when they get here.\"\n\nNumbers to know\n\n– There have been only seven teams in history who have started a season 10-0, with the Rays tying the modern-day record with a 13-0 start. How has that translated into October?\n\n1987 Brewers (13-0): 91-71, missed playoffs.\n\n1982 Atlanta (13-0) 89-73, lost in the NLCS.\n\n1981 Athletics (11-0): 64-45, lost in the ALCS.\n\n1966 Cleveland (10-0): 81-81, missed playoffs.\n\n1962 Pirates (10-0): 93-68, missed playoffs.\n\n1955 Brooklyn Dodgers (10-0): Won the World Series.\n\n– Shohei Ohtani entered Saturday having reached base in 35 consecutive games, hitting .315 with a .383 on-base percentage and .488 slugging percentage during the streak, while also going 5-1 with a 0.82 ERA in seven starts on the mound. He has given up just 15 hits and no homers in 44 innings in the stretch. He hasn’t given up more than four hits in any of those starts while pitching at least five innings.\n\nThe only pitcher in major-league history with a longer streak is Jacob DeGrom, who did it eight times in 2021 with the Mets.\n\n– Pardon the Giants if they don’t want to see Dodgers infielder Max Muncy again any time soon. Muncy hit four homers and drove in 11 runs in their series this past week. He has now hit 25 homers in his first 75 games against the Giants, the second-most by any player in his first 75 games against them, trailing only Gary Sheffield (26).\n\n– Interestingly, right-handed hitters have benefited much more than left-handed hitters with the ban of shifts.\n\nRight-handed hitters have seen their batting average on ground balls increase from .250 a year ago to .264 this year, while lefties have increased their batting average from .226 to .230.\n\nOverall, batting averages are up 16 points, stolen bases have increased by 30% and the average game time is down 31 minutes to 2:37, which would be the lowest since 1984.\n\n– Mariners outfielder Jarred Kelenic certainly is looking like the star everyone envisioned when he burst on the scene two years ago, entering Saturday hitting .366 with four homers, seven RBI and a 1.202 OPS.\n\nThe last Mariners player 23 years old or younger to homer in four consecutive games?\n\nYep, Ken Griffey Jr.\n\n– How stunning was it to see the Twins score nine runs in the first inning against the New York Yankees on Thursday, winning 11-2, and again on Friday in their first two games of the series at Yankee Stadium?\n\nIt was the Twins’ biggest inning at Yankee Stadium in the 62-year history of the franchise and their largest margin of victory over the Yankees in 32 years. This is a team that was 2-16 at Yankee Stadium since 2017, 38-98 since 2003, and has lost 13 consecutive postseason games to the Yankees.\n\n– The New York Mets on Friday became the first team in baseball history to draw at least 17 walks and score at least 17 runs on the road in their 17-6 victory over the pitiful Oakland A’s, including four walks with the bases loaded.\n\n– The sad-sack Athletics entered Saturday still without a victory from a starting pitcher, the longest drought in franchise history to open a season.\n\n– How would you like to face the middle of Atlanta’s order these days?\n\nRonald Acuña: .390 batting average, 1.056 OPS, three homers, 11 RBIs.\n\nMatt Olson: .304, 1.070, five homers, 14 RBIs.\n\nAustin Riley: .327, .967, three homers, eight RBIs.\n\nAround the basepaths\n\n– MLB owners are keeping a close eye on the three-year-old lawsuit filed by three minority partners of the Arizona Diamondbacks against managing partner Ken Kendrick that’s now scheduled for trial May 1.\n\nThe three minority owners – Jim Weber, Alfredo Molina and Chuck Carlisle – accused Kendrick of illegal tactics to force them from their partnership unless they dramatically increased their investments. Kendrick settled with 17 of the 22 minority partners who owned less than 1% of the team, two agreed to increase their investment, and the other three are fighting to receive their fair value.\n\nIf the case goes to trial in two weeks, attorneys are expected to have Kendrick open the Diamondbacks’ financial records, which could cause plenty of discomfort among owners.\n\n– Salt Lake City officials may be lobbying MLB to be considered as an expansion city, but realistically, they have no prayer. Their only hope for an MLB team would be if the Oakland A’s attempt to move to Las Vegas stalls, and the A’s instead relocate to Salt Lake.\n\nNashville remains the clear-cut favorite for an expansion franchise with Montreal, Charlotte and Portland in the running to be the second expansion team.\n\n– The San Diego Padres, who have struggled just to be a .500 team in the early-going, could get a huge boost on Thursday when Fernando Tatis Jr. is eligible to return after his PED suspension. Tatis, who has not played in a major-league game in 18 months, has put on a show at Triple-A El Paso in his rehab assignment, hitting .478 with four homers and 11 RBI in his first six games.\n\n“Based on what we saw in spring training and who he is, there’s obviously a high expectation level,” Padres manager Bob Melvin told reporters. “But you do have to temper it knowing that he has not played in basically a year and a half. … He is also a very special talent, so nothing would surprise me.\n\n“To ask a 1.000 OPS at the end of the season, I don’t know, but man, he looked good in spring training.”\n\n– Now that the Chicago Cubs locked up outfielder Ian Happ to a three-year, $61 million extension, this winter’s free-agent class is even thinner. The class is led by Shohei Ohtani, of course, with Blue Jays third baseman Matt Chapman being the second-best hitter on the market followed by perhaps Mariners right fielder Teoscar Hernandez.\n\nThe others include Yankees center fielder Harrison Bader, Angels infielder Gio Urshela, Diamondbacks outfielder Lourdes Gurriel and perhaps San Francisco Giants outfielder Michael Conforto, who has an opt-out in his two-year deal.\n\nThe best pitchers on the market outside of Ohtani are Dodgers ace Julio Urias, Aaron Nola of the Phillies and Japanese right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Marcus Stroman of the Cubs and Max Scherzer of the Mets also have opt-out clauses.\n\n– The New York Mets have to be ecstatic that the Detroit Tigers outbid them by $20 million for shortstop Javier Baez when he was a free agent two years ago and signed a six-year, $140 million contract. He has been a disaster, hitting .159 this season with only two extra-base hits, and was benched this past week for his mental errors.\n\nHe has an opt-out after this season, but who in their right mind would pay him remotely close to the four years, $98 million still left on his contract after the season?\n\n– The Diamondbacks are trying to decide how much longer they can stay patient with veteran starter Madison Bumgarner, whose struggles continue. He is 0-2 with a 7.90 ERA this season, yielding 18 hits and 11 walks in just 13 ⅔ innings. He has a 7.28 ERA dating back to last July.\n\nThe trouble is that he’s also their highest-paid player, and is owed $37 million the next two seasons on a team that has the smallest payroll in the NL West.\n\n– The Marlins’ marketing department is displaying awful taste celebrating the Cubs’ arrival April 28-30 as Steve Bartman Appreciation weekend.\n\nPlease, all Bartman ever asked was to simply be left alone, receiving death threats after his attempt to catch a foul ball at Wrigley Field may have prevented Moises Alou from catching it during the 2003 NLCS.\n\nCan’t the Marlins just celebrate the fact they beat the Cubs that year, recovering from a 3-1 deficit to advance and win the World Series over the Yankees?\n\n– The Mets have got to be wondering what in the world happened to Darin Ruf. He hit .152 in 28 games after being traded to the Mets last August, and just .167 with a .265 on-base percentage and .233 slugging percentage this spring when he was released.\n\nHe returned to San Francisco this week, and immediately reverted back to form, promptly going 2-for-4 with a double and an RBI in his first game back and .333 in his first three games.\n\n“Anywhere you struggle, fans are going to be tough on you, but in New York it’s magnified,” Ruf told The Athletic. “I think the media there really runs with what fans’ perceptions are. So you’re kind of getting crushed by two entities. Even if you’re not on social media a heck of a lot, you still have an idea and you see things.”\n\n– Matt Chapman could certainly be in for a big payday this winter if he keeps up this torrid pace. The big-spending teams like the Yankees, Dodgers, Mets and Cubs all could use him.\n\n– While MLB wanted to speed up the games, they almost forgot about the dent it could have on beer sales.\n\nSo, teams are compensating by extending their alcohol sales through the eighth inning with the Houston Astros actually now selling throughout the entire game. No word if they’re going to offer to-go cups.\n\nYet, you can be assured if there’s an uptick of DWIs, accidents or simply worse behavior in the stands, MLB may have to step in and order sales to stop again after the seventh inning.\n\n“The reason we stopped [selling alcohol in] the seventh before was to give our fans time to sober up and drive home safe, correct?” Phillies reliever Matt Strahm told the “Baseball Isn’t Boring” podcast. “So now with a faster pace game, and me just being a man of common sense, if the game is going to finish quicker, would we not move the beer sales back to the sixth inning to give our fans time to sober up and drive home?”\n\nHe certainly has a point.\n\n“When you mess with billionaires' dollars, they find a way to make their dollars back,\" Strahm says. “I think as a fan of the game, and just looking out for people, it would make more sense they stopped the sales in the sixth.\"\n\n– Crazy moment of the week: The Dodgers fans gave Cubs outfielder Cody Bellinger a huge ovation in his first at-bat at Dodger Stadium, thanking him for the memories, only for him to get an automatic strike for a pitch-clock violation getting into the box too late.\n\n– Milwaukee Brewers lefty Wade Miley, who never has to worry about a pitch clock with his quick pace, says he hates the pitch clock, and will be sick to his stomach if he sees it decide a game.\n\n“I really hope we never see that happen, I just hate it,’’ Miley says. “But you know what, we’ve got no one to blame but ourselves. We were the ones dilly-dallying out there. We made the games go way too long. So now we’re paying the price for it.’’\n\n– Kudos to Phillies All-Star Bryce Harper for volunteering to play first base when he returns with the Phillies already losing Rhys Hoskins for the season and Darick Hall until mid-summer. Harper is still recovering from his elbow ligament reconstruction and will first return as a DH before he’s cleared to play the field. He has been taking batting practice every day.\n\n– The renovated Rogers Centre in Toronto has created a rather, well, intimate experience with the opposing bullpen and the Blue Jays fans.\n\nThey are awfully close together and at least one beer can has already tossed into the bullpen.\n\n“The interaction with the fans is going to be really interesting to follow as the summer gets warmer and rivals come in,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “I can imagine there are going to be quite a few interactions between the opposing teams and the patrons that come to the game. Heads up on that one.’’\n\n– Bally Sports continues to televise the Twins, Guardians and D-backs games despite not paying the clubs. They owe the Guardians $55 million, the Twins $42 million and the Diamondbacks $30.8 million.\n\n– Pretty cool for the D-backs to have Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant at their game on Monday and Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner at their game on Tuesday.\n\nGriner and her wife spent time after the game taking pictures with Milwaukee Brewers shortstop Willy Adames.\n\n“I love the two of them,’’ Adames says. “Just great, beautiful people. It’s so great to see Brittney finally out of Russia and home where she belongs.’’\n\n– Yes, that was 73-year-old Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker backstage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers when the Astros were in Minneapolis last weekend. He got the tickets through former pitcher Bronson Arroyo, who played for Baker in Cincinnati.\n\n“I needed it,” Baker said. “My spirit needed it.”\n\n– Congratulations to Craig Counsell, who has now managed more games than anyone in Brewers history with 1,185 games and counting.\n\n– D-backs speedy outfielder Corbin Carroll has a huge fan in Freddie Freeman: “I really like Corbin Carroll. He’s so fun to watch. He’s going to be good for a long, long time. That whole team is going to be fun to watch.’’\n\n– Fabulous book by Kirk McKnight, “The Voices of Baseball: The Game’s Greatest Broadcasters Reflect on America’s Pastime.’’ The book includes interviews from 50 MLB broadcasters, including 11 Hall of Famers, and a tribute from 35 broadcasters to the late, great Vin Scully.\n\n– Also, check out former Blue Jays manager John Gibbons’ entertaining book, “Gibby: Tales of a Baseball Lifer.’’\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/16"}]}

Text messages can be sent to the three-digit number as well.\n\nVeterans can now dial 988 and press 1 to reach the Veteran Crisis Line.\n\n“One of the goals of 988 is to ensure that people get the help that they need when they need it, where they need it. And so, when a person calls 988, they can expect to have a conversation with a trained, compassionate crisis counselor who will talk with them about what they’re experiencing. If it’s the case that they need further intervention, then likely the crisis counselor will connect with a local mobile crisis team,” Dr. Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, the administrator of SAMHSA, said earlier this month during a call with reporters.\n\n“Some of the goal is to, where possible, minimize unnecessary contact or connection with police departments when what a person needs is connecting with either a mobile crisis worker or anyone within the mental health and behavioral health system of care,” she added.\n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has been in operation since 2005 and is funded by SAMHSA.\n\nIn 2020, the US Federal Communications Commission’s five leaders unanimously voted to finalize 988 as the three-digit number Americans can dial to be connected to the existing lifeline’s network of trained counselors.\n\nThat year, the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 became law, amending the Communications Act of 1934 to designate 988 as “the universal telephone number for the purpose of the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system operating through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and through the Veterans Crisis Line, and for other purposes.”\n\nAs 988 will become an easier number to remember for mental health crises – similar to how people can dial 911 for medical emergencies – there has been growing concern among leading mental health and suicide prevention groups that 988 call centers may not be ready to handle an anticipated influx of calls.\n\nThe call line received 3.6 million calls, chats and texts in 2021, and that number is expected to double in the first full year after the 988 transition, according to SAMHSA.\n\nBob Gebbia, the CEO of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told CNN that a “big concern is that the demands might outstrip the capacity very quickly and these centers will be overwhelmed.”\n\n“When that happens, then calls get dropped, waiting times go up, and the individuals who are on the other end and struggling don’t get the connection they need,” Gebbia said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSince the FCC’s approval in 2020 of 988, the federal government and Vibrant have been gearing up for the nationwide implementation of the three-digit number by providing grants to states to support call centers and actively trying to recruit more crisis counselors.\n\nPeople who are interested in learning more can visit the SAMHSA website.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard Veronica Stracqualursi", "Jacqueline Howard", "Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/healthcare/2022/07/16/988-crisis-line-mental-health-how-it-works-oklahoma/65374658007/", "title": "How the new 988 crisis call line works in Oklahoma", "text": "A new three-digit phone number, 988, will launch nationwide Saturday for anyone to call or text in a mental health crisis.\n\nIn some states, 988 will simply work as a shortcut to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. In Oklahoma, calls are being answered by an in-state crisis call center to address and deescalate mental health crises in the moment and serve as an entry point for Oklahomans to get connected with other mental health resources.\n\nOklahoma’s 988 line has been operational since July 5. In that time, more than 575 calls have been answered, and mobile crisis teams have been dispatched 34 times, according to the nonprofit managing the call center.\n\nWhat is 988?\n\n988 is the three-digit phone number to call in a mental health crisis, whether that is thoughts of suicide, substance abuse issues or other mental health problems, like depression or anxiety.\n\nOklahomans can call 988 if they’re in any sort of substance-abuse or mental-health related crisis, said Jeff Dismukes, a spokesman for the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.\n\nMore:For Oklahomans facing mental health crises, 988 call center could make 'world of difference'\n\n“But it’s also just a resource for Oklahomans statewide to be linked to the right services at the right time,” he said. “I’m extremely excited about this, just from an advocate standpoint.”\n\n988 can also be used to get help if a loved one needs support in a crisis.\n\nWho answers 988 calls in Oklahoma?\n\nCalls to 988 in Oklahoma are answered by Solari Crisis and Human Services, an Arizona-based nonprofit that won Oklahoma’s crisis call center contract.\n\nSolari has established an Oklahoma City call center to run the state’s 988 line. Solari has since 2007 offered crisis-line services in Arizona, and later added other services in the state like dispatching mobile crisis teams.\n\nWorking in Oklahoma is Solari’s first time running a full crisis line outside of Arizona.\n\nIf Solari’s Oklahoma call center is at capacity, Heartline and Family and Children’s Services will serve as a backup, Oklahoma’s mental health commissioner has said previously.\n\nMore:How the 988 mental health hotline will make a difference, according to experts\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMost crisis calls — about 80%, according to the state mental health department — will be resolved with a call to the 988 line.\n\nBut if necessary, Oklahoma’s 988 call center can dispatch a mobile crisis team to come to the caller. The mobile crisis teams include a licensed mental health professional and a certified peer recovery support specialist or case manager.\n\nThe state is already working with a dozen treatment providers across the state to operate mobile crisis teams, and more will come online “very soon,” said Dismukes, with the state mental health department.\n\nNorthCare, a mental health clinic in Oklahoma City, is one of the organizations staffing a mobile crisis team and has responded to 11 calls since 988’s launch. The team was “able to put boots on the ground pretty quickly,” said the clinic’s Vice President for Growth Connie Schlittler.\n\nNorthCare’s Champions team — launched earlier this year as a collaborative effort with the Oklahoma City Police Department — has been tasked with responding to 988 calls. While the team works in tandem with the police department to respond to some mental health calls to 911, the response to 988 is different.\n\n“Their intent is that the police department would not be involved in our response to (988) calls,” Schlittler said.\n\nDepending on the situation, 988 call takers will be able to arrange transportation to a mental-health urgent care facility or crisis center.\n\nAt any step along the way, the 988 call center can schedule follow-up appointments for the caller with mental health treatment providers in their area.\n\nMore:988 becomes the new 3-digit suicide prevention hotline on July 16: What to know\n\nHow is response different?\n\n988 and 911 are meant for different services, but the two systems will work together.\n\nA response from emergency services or law enforcement may be necessary in some cases — for instance, if a suicide attempt is in progress — but the goal of 988 is to help stabilize people in crisis “in the least restrictive manner” possible, according to the national Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA.\n\n“Families might be reluctant to call 911 because they’re worried about a law enforcement response,” Dismukes said. “I do hope that this helps break down some of those barriers.”\n\nLess than 2% of calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline have required referral to emergency services like 911, according to the state mental health department.\n\nBut coordination between the 988 and 911 systems will be “crucial,” said Oklahoma City police chief Wade Gourley at a May city council meeting.\n\n“People will still call 911 on mental health emergencies, just because that's what they've been conditioned to do,” Gourley said. “But now that dispatcher has the opportunity … to hand that off to the 988 number and get an alternative response.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/12/988-suicide-prevention-number-fcc-approval/4411812002/", "title": "Suicide prevention hotline to have three-digit number for mental ...", "text": "A three-digit suicide prevention hotline number will soon make seeking emergency mental health help more like calling 911, federal regulators announced Thursday.\n\nWhen the months-long process is completed, U.S. residents will be able to call 988 for help in a mental health emergency, just as 911 connects people in need to first-responders for other emergencies.\n\nCurrently, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline uses a 10-digit number, 800-273-TALK (8255). That number routes callers to one of 163 crisis centers, where counselors answered 2.2 million calls last year.\n\n“The three-digit number is really going to be a breakthrough in terms of reaching people in a crisis,” said Dwight Holton, CEO of Lines for Life, a suicide prevention nonprofit. “No one is embarrassed to call 911 for a fire or an emergency. No one should be embarrassed to call 988 for a mental health emergency.\"\n\nIt's not a hotline, it's a 'warmline': It gives mental health help before a crisis heats up\n\nA Thursday release from the Federal Communications Commission says formal rule-making on the 988 number has begun — it's a process that started with a congressional statute in 2018 and was the subject of an FCC report released in August.\n\nSo far, the FCC has only proposed requiring all telephone service providers to accommodate the 988 number within 18 months. The next step is a comment period on the implementation, including the project's time frame.\n\nLast year, a USA TODAY investigation reported that more than 47,000 Americans killed themselves in 2017, citing a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. Since 1999, the suicide rate has climbed 33 percent.\n\nSuicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. and is often called a public health emergency.\n\n\"There’s been so much more put into every one of those causes of death than suicide. ... If you didn’t do anything for heart disease and you didn’t do anything for cancer, then you'd see those rates rise, too.\" John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, told USA TODAY last year.\n\nPublic health experts say suicide is preventable.\n\nCrisis Text Line provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in crisis when they dial 741741.

Suicide disproportionately affects marginalized groups – Black Americans, Native Americans, rural residents, teens and young adults and LGBTQ people.\n\n“We hope any American in a suicide crisis will come to know that 988 is the number to call for immediate help and assistance,” Pai said at the commission's open meeting Thursday. “With the implementation, we anticipate that many more Americans will receive help from suicide prevention and many more lives will be saved.”\n\nThe number to contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-TALK (8255), which received 2.2 million calls in 2018.\n\nAn FCC report published last August found that having a three-digit hotline would ease access to resources for people struggling with suicidal thoughts.\n\nAdvocacy groups celebrated the unanimous vote.\n\n“The Trevor Project is thrilled that the FCC continues to recognize the importance of suicide prevention and highlight the need for special services for LGBTQ youth,\" said Sam Brinton, vice president of governmental affairs at the Trevor Project, a nonprofit group that focuses on suicide prevention among the LGBTQ community.\n\nContributing: Alia E.

Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

The 988 line will improve the state’s ability to quickly connect Ohioans in crisis with community behavioral health treatment and social service resources, officials said.\n\nThe three-digit help line is being paid for with $280 million in federal funding, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use Dr. Miriam Delphin-Rittmon announced Monday\n\nThe new number will also handle text and chat, officials said.\n\nUntil the service is up, the officials stressed, the national suicide prevention line remains: 800-273-8255.\n\nAnd for those who want to be linked with mental health services, Find Treatment at SAMHSA.gov, is a free, confidential, 24-7 referral and information service.\n\nMental health crisis felt nationally\n\nBoth adults and children are suffering from a nationwide mental health crisis. In 2019, Becerra said, suicide was the second-leading cause of death in teens and young adults and 10th leading cause of death in the nation, Becerra said.\n\nThe crisis has been a topic of conversation among school and government officials as well as private health care providers in Ohio.\n\nIn November 2020, the crisis among children was raised to the forefront in the Mason City School district, where 15 students were taken to hospitals for suicidal thoughts in a three-week period, according to Superintendent Jonathan Cooper.\n\nThe issue has resurfaced this month after Forest Hills Schools had two students die in a week, although the cause of death is not yet clear in one of these students' deaths.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services has been involved in planning for almost a year. The department received a $360,000 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s 988 State Planning Grant through Vibrant Emotional Health, which administers the lifeline. Through the grant, the department is leading the development of plans for Ohio in preparation for the projected infrastructure needs, volume growth, and access to the lifeline’s new 988 number, state records show. Vibrant awarded grants to 49 states and territories.\n\nA multitude of Ohio stakeholders have been involved in the planning stage. Among them are representatives from the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation, Gov. Mike DeWine's office, RecoveryOhio, the Ohio Council of Behavioral Health & Family Services Providers, Ohio Hospital Association, Ohio Department of Public Safety, Ohio Telecom Industry, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Cincinnati's Talbert House and numerous other departments and agencies.\n\nThe federal funding announced Monday will be a new opportunity for additional dollars to support implementation, officials said.\n\nKids' mental health:Ohio legislators may finally create a plan to address the crisis\n\nIn the Cincinnati area, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center has announced a new inpatient, behavioral health center to be up and running in 2023.\n\n\"Every 11 minutes, an American dies from suicide,\" Becerra said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated the crisis.\n\nServing as 911 for mental health crises\n\nThe new network will be \"just like 911\" but for mental health crises, Becerra said. It will be a partnership with states and territories, bolstered by the $280 million in 2022 to transition access from the national 10-digit number to the 988 line, Becerra said. The funding will cover infrastructure and staffing for the line, the officials said.\n\nOf the $282 million announced Monday, $177 million will be used to strengthen and expand the existing crisis network’s operations and telephone infrastructure, including centralized chat and text response, backup capacity and a sub-network for Spanish speakers. The rest, $105 million, will go to build up staffing at local call centers.\n\nThree-digit dialing to reach suicide hotline counselors has long been a goal for mental health advocates, lawmakers in Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the telecommunications industry.\n\nHHS leaders called 988 an easy-to-remember help line that will ensure a streamlined system across the country because, currently, some states are better equipped than others to provide immediate services, Becerra said.\n\n\"This network depends on everyone doing their part,\" Becerra said. \"What we're trying to do is be the glue.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/07/18/mental-health-suicide-prevention-number-988-live-rhode-island/10087111002/", "title": "988 hotline RI: What to know about suicide prevention number", "text": "988, the nation's new three-digit suicide-prevention and mental-health crisis phone number, went live on Saturday, July 16.

Some advocates have questioned whether states will be ready for the increased call volume projected after the switch to the 988 model.\n\nIn the first year of 988's implementation, the number of contacts for the lifeline is expected to increase to 7.6 million – a twofold increase compared with the 3.3 million calls, texts or chats in 2020, according to a report in December 2021 from SAHMSA.\n\nWhat experts say: Delphin-Rittmon acknowledged that some crisis response centers are worried about the size of workforces in their states and about resources for this launch. She said she has been working with state representatives on funding and to \"assess their overall readiness.\" .\n\nThe launch of 988 provides \"an opportunity to expose gaps and weaknesses in our system,\" which would allow centers to see where additional investments may be needed, said Angela Kimball, national director of advocacy and public policy at the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\n\"Will it work perfectly?\" she said. \"No. Because changing crisis response won't happen overnight.\"\n\nARE STATES PREPARED?

This increases the risk of fire while the vehicles are being driven or are parked.\n\nAffected are certain Kia Sportage SUVs from 2014 through 2016, and the 2016 through 2018 K900 sedan. Recalled Hyundais include certain 2016 through 2018 Santa Fe SUVs, 2017 and 2018 Santa Fe Sports, the 2019 Santa Fe XL and 2014 and 2015 Tucson SUVs.\n\nThe automakers say they have 11 reports of fires in the U.S. but no injuries.\n\nDocuments posted Tuesday by U.S. safety regulators say owners should park the vehicles outside and away from structures until repairs are made.\n\nMore:Hyundai, Kia recall more than 550K vehicles because turn signal can flash in wrong direction\n\nMore:A former Hyundai engineer is now a multimillionaire in whistleblower case\n\nDealers will replace a fuse. In addition, Hyundai dealers will inspect the control modules and replace them if needed. Hyundai will mail notification letters starting April 5, and Kia will send them March 31.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says owners can go www.nhtsa.gov and enter their 17-digit vehicle identification number to see if their automobile is being recalled.\n\nHyundai said that when it finds a safety defect \"we act swiftly and efficiently to recall the vehicle and fix the problem at no cost to affected customers.\"\n\nKia said there are warning signs that drivers could see or smell. The antilock brake warning light could come on, and they could smell something burning or melting, or see smoke coming from the engine compartment.\n\nTuesday's recalls come after U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration stepped up a series of investigations into engine compartment fires that have plagued the Korean automakers.\n\nIn December, the agency consolidated two investigations from 2017 into a new a new engineering analysis covering more than 3 million vehicles from the 2011 through 2016 model years. At the time, NHTSA had received 161 complaints of engine fires, some of which occurred in vehicles that had already been recalled.\n\nThe first recall from the companies related to engine failures and fires reaches to September 2015. Since then they have issued at least eight more recalls for a host of engine problems, according to NHTSA documents.\n\nThe agency said it's evaluating whether previous recalls covered enough vehicles. It also will monitor the effectiveness of previous recalls \"as well as the long-term viability of related programs and non-safety field actions being conducted by Hyundai and Kia.\"\n\nAt the time, the automakers said they have undertaken numerous recalls to address engine issues, including recalls, new engine monitoring technology and providing extended warranties.\n\nMichael Brooks, chief counsel for the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said the recalls Tuesday are different from the engine failure problem that caused most of the previous Hyundai-Kia fire recalls. \"Although NHTSA has the authority to order a recall and potentially a buyback of all affected vehicles, the separate fire defects that have plagued millions of Hyundai vehicles across multiple model years makes this a very difficult task,\" he said.\n\nIn November 2020, NHTSA announced that Kia and Hyundai must pay $137 million in fines and for safety improvements because they moved too slowly to recall more than 1 million vehicles with engines that can fail. The fines resolved a previous probe into the companies' behavior involving recalls of multiple models dating to the 2011 model year.\n\nKia was to pay $27 million and invest $16 million in safety performance measures. Another $27 million payment will be deferred as long as Kia meets safety conditions, NHTSA said.\n\nKia denied the U.S. allegations but said it wanted to avoid a protracted legal fight.\n\nData collected by the Center for Auto Safety show more than 30 U.S. fire and engine-related recalls from Hyundai and Kia since 2015. The recalls involve more than 20 models from the 2006 through 2021 model years totaling over 8.4 million vehicles.\n\nMany of the recalls involved manufacturing defects that stopped oil from flowing through the engine block. Many involved expensive engine replacements.\n\nHyundai and Kia also did a U.S. \"product improvement campaign\" covering 3.7 million vehicles to install software that will alert drivers of possible engine failures.\n\n► Stay connected and stay informed.

And it's the worst in the industry when it comes to recalls and warranty work,\" said John McElroy, a longtime industry observer and host of \"Autoline After Hours\" webcast and podcast. \"It’s been going on for years and they haven’t solved it yet.\"\n\nNew headaches\n\nRecalls generally affect a whole production run of hundreds or thousands of vehicles that may have safety problems and involve automakers alerting federal regulators when they're caught. Meanwhile, warranty costs are filed by individual car owners as they discover problems.\n\nThese billions in costs are viewed by financial analysts as unforced errors.\n\nFord has cited in earnings reports the troubled launches of its 2020 Explorer and Aviator — and the launch of newvehicles, including the award-winning electric Ford Mustang Mach-E and the popular Ford Bronco, have not been without drama.\n\nIn recent weeks:\n\nFederal safety regulators opened an investigation into the 2021 Ford Bronco for \"catastrophic\" engine failure while driving after 32 reported experiences from customers.\n\nFord stopped delivery of the 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E in mid-June because of an outstanding recall related to the 2021-22 models losing power while driving. A fix is expected sometime in the third quarter, possibly as early as July.\n\nOwners of the 2021 Ford Expedition and 2021 Lincoln Navigator filed a lawsuit against Ford because their vehicles have been recalled for a defect that may result in spontaneous combustion and the company has not identified a solution yet.\n\nFord notified regulators that the four-door 2021-22 Ford Bronco may have a defective child safety lock on the passenger side of the back seat, allowing young children to open the door from inside despite indicating otherwise.\n\nAlso, the past has come back to haunt Farley, who took the helm of Ford in October 2020 with the promise of improving quality.\n\nFord recalled 2.9 million vehicles earlier this month that may shift into different gears than intended or roll away while parked, specifically the 2013-19 Escape, 2013-18 C-Max, 2013-16 Fusion, 2013-21 Transit Connect and 2015-18 Edge.\n\nThese chronic costs frustrate Ford executives and consumers. Stockholders aren't thrilled, either.\n\n\"I own thousands of shares of Ford stock thinking that with the advent of electric vehicles the stock price would go up substantially. I was wrong primarily due to all the recalls and other screw-ups at Ford,\" said Jerry Decker, a financial analyst from Flushing who drives a 2019 Ford F-150.\n\n\"I suspect a large part of the problem is that they bought out or forced out older more experienced engineers for young ones. And now the young ones are making the same mistakes the older ones did when they were young,\" he said. \"... How in the hell can they not figure out why their $100,000 SUVs keep burning up? Please ask Ford management how they plan to stop the recalls and if they plan to in some way get their more experienced engineers involved.\"\n\nHis concerns about buyouts and experience are echoed by industry analysts, including McElroy, who said Ford needs to work harder.\n\n\"They'll stop and say, 'This and this caused the transmission to malfunction and we've solved the problem.' But do they go a layer below? How did we end up with this problem? Was somebody on vacation and we didn’t know the engineer was gone?\" McElroy said. \"Was there a breakdown in communication between a supplier and Ford? Did they not have enough people? They're not digging deep enough to figure out the systemic problems that led to these defects.\"\n\n'Speed is important'\n\nTo help with that, Farley this year recruited quality czar Josh Halliburton to contain the problem.\n\n\"We know the path to leadership in quality is not a fast one. The entire team is working very hard to create not only incredible products and experiences but high-quality ones,\" Halliburton told the Detroit Free Press after the third major recall this month.\n\n\"Speed is important in this industry but does not necessarily result in poor quality control. Ford has the right quality control systems in place,\" said Halliburton, who moved to Ford after a career at J.D. Power, a globally respected consumer research, data and analytics firm that focuses on quality.\n\nNow it's a matter of execution.\n\n\"How we as a company handle the recalls is important,\" Halliburton said. \"We also know that consumers value companies that act with integrity and transparency and that’s what we do. We want to provide customers the best experience possible with our vehicles and deliver a high-quality product.\"\n\nIn April, he referred to Ford as complacent and promised to change the culture.\n\nMore:2020-21 F-150 windshields may come loose; 2020 Super Duty payload wrong\n\nMore:Appeals court: Ford committed fraud by selling defective Super Duty trucks\n\nMore:Ford wants defective Bronco hardtops to disappear forever after supplier issues\n\nJon Gabrielsen, a longtime auto industry consultant from Ann Arbor who now lives in Mexico, said, \"Warranty and recall problems begin in product development when corners are cut and shortcuts are taken.\"\n\nWhether at Ford or anywhere else, he said, \"every component and every system in a developing vehicle must be tested to ensure that it will survive the rigors of the real world. Only by getting it right in product development can one avoid the recalls and safety issues three to 10 years later.\"\n\nWithout dramatic change, consequences could be dire, Gabrielsen said. \"Only by dramatically increasing product development discipline and rigor today can Ford be confident it won’t be having the same issues in three years with things starting development today.\"\n\n'Underperforming vs. peers'\n\nAnalyst Dan Levy of Credit Suisse global investment bank visited Ford in Dearborn in June, following the recall announcements.\n\nHe highlighted concerns in his investor note June 17.\n\n\"Quality challenges stem from issues with suppliers and design robustness,\" Levy wrote. Management \"fully acknowledges quality is an issue that must be addressed, that Ford is underperforming vs. peers, and that warranty spend is not competitive vs. peers.\"\n\nFlawed design rather than manufacturing problems led to the Mach-E recall specifically, Levy wrote. \"Powertrain was also noted as an area where Ford has had quality issues. To address the issues, Ford is in the process of completely redesigning its end-to-end quality operating system to improve design robustness, which should drive earlier identification of issues.\"\n\nBillions wasted\n\nIn 2020, Farley, then Ford chief operating officer, revealed warranty costs reached $5 billion in 2019, up $1.5 billion in recent years — and fixing vehicle launch problems had cost the company an estimated $1 billion.\n\nAll automakers have costs related to warranties and recalls, which ebbs and flows during different product cycles, but Ford executives have acknowledged consistently over the past two years the importance of conquering this cost problem.\n\nIn first quarter 2021, Ford CFO John Lawler touted \"real improvement\" in warranty costs, which the company \"lowered by $400 million\" from a year earlier. In the previous three years, he said during an earnings call, Ford saw its warranty expenses increase by more than $2 billion.\n\nWorse than GM and even Apple\n\nEric Arnum, editor of Warranty Week, aggregates all warranty data for companies globally based on their federal regulatory filings. These costs include recalls.\n\n\"Ford was the largest claims payer of all in the U.S. last year,\" he said in April, \"bigger than Apple, IBM, HP, Raytheon or even GM.\"\n\nArnum emphasized that all automakers have bad years with warranty and recall costs.\n\n\"It just so happens, it's Ford's turn in the doghouse,\" Arnum said this month. \"I hope they recover from it. I expect they will.\"\n\nMore:2021 Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator customers sue over unfixed fire risk\n\nMore:Ford recalls 350,000 SUVs including about 39,000 for engine fire risk\n\nMore:$70K Aviator up for a top automotive honor — but some buyers have horror stories\n\nEvery year, automakers set aside a dollar amount for every car sold to budget for anticipated warranty repair costs, which include recalls. According to Warranty Week data, Ford towered over its competitors in per vehicle budgeting in 2021:\n\nFord was $1,041 — up from $940 in 2020\n\nGeneral Motors was $713, up from $498 in 2020\n\nHyundai was $651, down from $1,171 in 2020\n\nStellantis NV was $630, up from $576 in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Toyota fell from $423 to $401 in its fiscal year that ended March 31, 2022, and Honda plummeted by more than half from $782 to $347 during the same period, reported June 23. The other companies have a fiscal year that ends Dec. 31.\n\nFord has budgeted more for these repairs since 2017, when it was just $342 per vehicle.\n\nIn fact, Ford’s $1,041 accrual rate per vehicle sold in 2021 was its highest level ever, or at least since warranty expense reports went public in 2002, Arnum said. Second place was 2020 when Ford was at $940 and third is $591 in 2019.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nIn his investor note, Levy said he flew to Ford World Headquarters in Dearborn to meet with Stuart Rowley, chief transformation and quality officer, Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford Blue, Lawler, chief financial officer and Lisa Drake, vice president of EV industrialization/Ford Model e.\n\n\"We await further color from (management) on the root causes of the quality challenges, and how much work is required to bring quality to more appropriate levels, as we had been under the impression that warranty/quality challenges at Ford began to improve in 2021, but seem to have taken a clear step back,\" Levy wrote.\n\nMore:Ford workers break their silence on faulty transmissions: 'Everybody knew'\n\nMore:Ford pays $49K to couple for 2014 Fiesta, settles defective transmission cases\n\nMore:Ford Motor Company loses a top digital executive, company liaison to 'nervous' car dealers\n\nJd Marhevko, an award-winning quality management expert based in Saline who has worked for global companies including Delphi Technologies, BorgWarner and Accuride Corp., said warranty and recall situations can indicate that a company's \"checks and balances are not as robust as the company wants them to be.\"\n\nShe said, \"Leveraging lessons learned is also key. It's kind of textbook.\"\n\nBut manufacturing pressures to not fall behind schedule are intense.\n\n\"Our industry is not patient,\" Marhevko said. \"If several folks are bidding on the same job, the one that can deliver first is likely going to win the bid. There is a saying that, 'He who gets to market first, wins.' \"\n\n'Let's just pray'\n\nJoe McCabe, CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, said speed is the new reality and Ford happens to be first out of the gate with a new lineup of hot products.\n\n\"Ford is on the radar because so many of their (recall) announcements are coming together at the same time,\" he said. \"But it's not a unicorn situation. It's the new nature of the beast. Ford's trying to go heavy into the electrification space with Mach-E and Lightning while trying to take on Jeep with the Bronco. They're trying to get vehicles out that are somewhat untested.”\n\n\"I truly believe it's a 'get to market now and fix it later' mentality that nearly every vehicle manufacturer follows,\" McCabe said. \"It's 'let's just pray any issues are minor at best.' Companies cross their fingers. Everyone is trying to reinvent themselves at a very fast pace. The next 20 years is going to be off-the-charts insanity.\"\n\nCar buyers are watching\n\nWhat warranty and recall alerts do is identify potential reliability problems for consumers, and that's a big deal because word of mouth can strengthen or weaken brands, said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports.\n\n\"Vehicle reliability and fuel economy are the most important when people are purchasing a new car\" based on industry data, he said. “You'll think twice about coming back to a brand that gives you problems.\"\n\n\"From our data, we generally see Ford and Lincoln having reliability problems, especially with new and redesigned vehicles,\" Fisher said. \"Ford and Lincoln tend to make large changes when they redesign their vehicles, a lot of changes quickly.\"\n\nBy contrast, Lexus and Toyota tend to be more methodical, and it builds a loyal customer base, he said. \"They’re very, very conservative when they launch new technology because they know people are coming to them not to be the most exciting but the most reliable. Ford is trying to do things to attract people, excite people. And they do have exciting products. Bronco has people buzzing. But they're already having recall and reliability problems.\"\n\nTiny details can make a huge difference on automotive quality — as illustrated consistently by Toyota, industry analysts often say.\n\nMore:Ford makes come-from-behind push with Mach-E as industry enters new era\n\nMore:Ford team had to plead with Bill Ford to give back not-yet-released Mustang\n\nMechanic Bob Elert, of Milford, a retired auto shop owner for 25 years in Pontiac and a former consultant to the General Motors Technical Assistance Center and car dealers, said automakers play a role in problems often blamed on suppliers.\n\n\"It’s because they put all the components out for bid and buy from the lowest bidder,\" he said, noting that his 1996 Toyota 4Runner SUV never had to recharge its air conditioning because it never developed a leak because the company used silicon rubber rings instead of neoprene rubber rings that degrade.\n\n\"Little touches like that,\" Elert said. \"Toyota doesn't have recall problems on the scale of other companies.\"\n\n'Faster, faster, faster'\n\nNew costs associated with problems can redirect company cash flow at the worst time.\n\nFord announced in March restructuring its business to create Ford Blue and Model e in March, so one team can build successful gasoline-powered vehicles while the other team can focus on electric vehicles. Key to the strategy, Ford executives said at the time, was slashing warranty costs and redirecting revenue for future technology.\n\nAs part of an electric revolution in the auto industry, female engineers play an important role, according to Glamour magazine in mid-June. Its article began with a quote from a top Ford engineer that unfortunately coincided with the recall events.\n\n“We want to run at a different rhythm,” Lisa Drake, vice president of electric vehicle industrialization at Ford, told Glamour. “Faster, faster, faster.”\n\nWhen asked how the comments may be misunderstood in the context of quality control, Ford told the Free Press that Drake was referring to the speed with which Ford needs to move to establish our electric vehicle business.\n\nTrying to do better\n\nFord has a lot at stake with quality control and risks alienating potential car buyers.\n\n\"People would likely lose confidence in the brand,\" said Marcus Collins, a business professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nFord is not making excuses or denying the problems.\n\n\"Whether a gas or electric, all of us are focused on providing our customers high-quality vehicles,\" Halliburton said.\n\n\"We are promoting a culture that is obsessed with quality,\" he said. \"This starts with how we prioritize our time and encourage a quality-first dialogue in the company.

The automaker is required to pay $70 million of that amount within 60 days. It can also apply $20 million towards its obligations in the consent order and will be able to avoid $15 million of the penalties if it meets certain performance targets.\n\n\"FCA US does not expect that the net cost of providing these additional alternatives will be material to its financial position, liquidity or results of operations,\" the automaker said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe buy back program involves three of the 23 recalls NHTSA investigated. It covers Ram pickups and Dodge SUVs because they can lose power steering while in motion or have axle problems.\n\nThe agreement also compels the automaker to offer cash incentives to the owners of 1 million Jeep Grand Cherokees that are already under recall to bring in their vehicles for repair. NHTSA says the rear-mounted fuel tanks on the Jeeps can explode during rear collisions.\n\nThe outcome was a stunning turnaround for an automaker that has challenged NHTSA's authority on several occasions. Two years ago, Marchionne, FCA's CEO, pushed back against the agency when it asked the automaker to recall 2.7 million Jeep SUVs. The tussle, which played out in the press, soured the relationship. FCA later agreed to recall 1.56 million Jeeps.\n\nEarlier this year, when NHTSA announced it was looking into FCA's track record on the completion of 23 recalls affecting 11 million vehicles, the automaker said it didn't think a hearing was necessary.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Marchionne acknowledged that the automaker has been slow to adapt to a new regulatory era.\n\nOn Friday Marchionne and two other top executives signed a 37-page consent order that subjects the automaker to $105 million in civil penalties and a buyback involving hundreds of thousands of Ram pickups and Dodge SUVs. The order also requires FCA to offer incentives encouraging the owners of 1 million Jeep Grand Cherokees to take their vehicles to a dealer. The company also must pay for an independent monitor for three years.\n\nKelley Blue Book estimates that the buyback program could cost the automaker more than $900 million, taking the potential cost to more than $1 billion.\n\nIt's the largest fine and vehicle buyback program the agency has ever imposed and the most comprehensive monitoring program the agency has ever put in place.\n\nNHTSA has been moving swiftly under Rosekind, who was appointed in December, to crack down on the industry in the wake of high profile recalls by General Motors for faulty ignition switches and the recall of millions of airbags by Takata.\n\n\"If automakers weren’t convinced before, NHTSA made clear with the record $105-million fine ... that it is serious and will be aggressive about going after automakers who don’t quickly recall vehicles with defects,\" said Autotrader Senior Analyst Michelle Krebs.\n\nNHTSA said its investigation revealed that FCA, in a variety of recalls, failed adequately to inform NHTSA about vehicle safety issues, failed to develop an adequate way to fix the vehicles or produce the parts necessary to repair them and failed to adequately inform dealers about safety recalls.\n\nThe automaker acknowledged its shortcomings and pledged to comply with all of the agency's new requirements.\n\n\"We also accept the resulting consequences with renewed resolve to improve our handling of recalls and re-establish the trust our customers place in us,\" the company said in a news release Sunday. \"We are intent on rebuilding our relationship with NHTSA, and we embrace the role of public safety advocate.\"\n\nFor the next three years, Fiat Chrysler must deal with an \"independent monitor\" with broad oversight involving safety issues. The consent order calls for FCA to submit a list of three names within 60 days. NHTSA gets to choose from among the three.\n\nOnce in place, the monitor will see whether Fiat Chrysler lives up to its responsibilities under the consent order to improve safety in its vehicles. If the monitor determines Fiat Chrysler isn't complying, NHTSA will be notified and sanctions or penalties could follow. The monitor is also supposed to prepare a report 60 days before the order ends.\n\n\"From our vantage point, punishment is one aspect of what we do, but rehabilitation is what we hope lives on,\" Foxx said. \"One of the best ways … to ensure that they get it right is to have some type of ongoing dialogue or oversight.\"\n\nRosekind said the agency forced the automaker to agree to the buyback program because FCA failed to come up with an adequate remedy to fix nearly 200,000 pickup trucks and SUVs it recalled in 2013.\n\nThe buyback program applies mostly to Ram trucks and Dodge SUVs made between 2008 and 2012 that were part of three separate recalls announced in 2013.\n\nThere was confusion Monday over the number of buybacks the automaker would be forced to offer. FCA issued recalled notices for nearly 580,000 Ram pickups and Ram SUVs in 2013. NHTSA initially said the automaker must offer to buy back more than 500,000 vehicles.\n\nLater, Rosekind said the automaker must only offer buybacks to vehicles that have not yet been fixed. The automaker said it has fixed more than 280,000.\n\nGlenn Bradley, of Weatherford, Texas, said he called his dealer Monday to ask about his 2012 Ram 2500 and the dealer had no idea what he was talking about.\n\nFCA has not said how much the buyback program could cost the automaker. However, the automaker said Monday that the scope of the buyback program is less than the number suggested by NHTSA.\n\n\"As of this date, repairs have been completed on well over 60% of the subject vehicles, leaving less than two hundred thousand eligible vehicles,\" the automaker said in a news release.\n\nNevertheless, the automaker said it will offer to repurchase the trucks and SUVs that have not yet been fixed for a price equal to the original purchase price minus a reasonable allowance for depreciation plus 10%. FCA also emphasized that it is allowed to resell the vehicles it repurchases after they are repaired.\n\nRosekind said the agency decided against requiring a buyback program for the Jeep Grand Cherokees that are part of a recall for 1.54 million Jeep SUVs because, in that case, there is an available remedy.\n\nJeep Grand Cherokees from model-years 1993 to 1998 and Jeep Libertys from 2002 to 2007 have rear-mounted fuel tanks that NHTSA says are more prone too fiery rear-end collisions than SUVs made by other automakers. NHTSA has approved the installation of a trailer hitch to provide additional protection in rear end crashes for those vehicles.\n\n\"There is a very clear line where the buybacks were focused on the vehicles where there was no option,\" Rosekind said. \"There was not an available remedy.\"\n\nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

These range from perceptions about the severity of the recall to a lack of available parts — some dealers also sell used cars with open recalls — but often vehicle owners may simply not know that their vehicle is under recall.\n\n\"The greatest challenge is making contact with the current owner of the vehicle. Vehicles may change hands many times over their lifecycle,\" said Mark Chernoby, chief technical compliance officer for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which is involved in two different programs to notify vehicle owners about recalls.\n\nFCA recently announced it is working with repair estimate company CCC Information Services to notify owners of FCA vehicles involved in the Takata recall when they bring the vehicles in to collision repair shops. So far, 56,000 have been identified. CCC Information Services says it also is working with Honda on a similar program. The Takata recall involves 19 automakers and affects 42 million vehicles.\n\nMore:Honda owners to get up to $500, rental cars in Takata air bag settlement\n\nWith notification being such a key roadblock in the recall process, a logical starting point for resolving the issue would seem to be the agency with the most information about what people drive, namely each state's department of motor vehicles.\n\nOnly one state — Maryland — applied for a U.S. Department of Transportation grant to notify consumers of open recalls when they register their vehicles. Starting in April, the Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration, with assistance from Cox Automotive, will launch its two-year pilot program, thanks to a $222,300 federal grant announced last month.\n\nFor Chrissy Nizer, administrator of Maryland's Motor Vehicle Administration, providing recall information is a natural extension of her agency's mission to promote safety. Drivers, including those with young children, probably would appreciate getting recall information through their registration renewal paperwork.\n\nMaryland's program is simply a notification. It will not prevent someone from renewing a registration.\n\nMore:Recalled Takata air bags showing up in used cars, lawsuit alleges\n\n\"We felt like it was a good way to be able to provide information to the customer (so they can) hopefully be able to act on it quickly and get it resolved,\" said Nizer.\n\nMaryland's philosophy on recall information, however, is markedly different from that of Michigan, where Fred Woodhams, a spokesman for the Secretary of State's Office, focused on who is ultimately responsible.\n\n“We view it as a manufacturer’s responsibility to notify owners of a recall and also, at least in the short term, it would be ... burdensomely costly to the department to participate,\" Woodhams said, acknowledging that the department was aware of the grant program, but saying it has no plans to participate in the near future. “(Automakers are) the ones that made the car in the first place.\"\n\nIn Maryland, Nizer said the federal grant will pay for the data collection that will be needed. She said there would be no additional costs for notification because the forms that are sent out already exist.\n\nMore:Mazda recalls 80,000 cars, SUVs due to Takata air bags\n\nNizer said the program will not absolve anyone of potential responsibility.\n\n“Certainly, the manufacturers have a role to play in recall information and that will continue.\" Nizer said. \"We are not taking responsibility from the manufacturer.\"\n\nAll state motor vehicle administrators are concerned about the safety impact of vehicle recalls, even the ones that are not currently taking active roles such as in the case of the Maryland effort, said Ian Grossman, vice president of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, noting also that some states may want to see the results of the Maryland program before starting their own.\n\nMore:Mazda recalls 80,000 cars, SUVs due to Takata air bags\n\nAlex Epstein, senior director of digital strategy and content for the non-profit National Safety Council, said two additional states, Kentucky and Florida, are developing their own campaigns related to recall notification, although details have not been released.\n\nThe National Safety Council is working with FCA and the National Automobile Dealers Association on a national outreach campaign to notify owners if their vehicles are under recall. The group has set up a website that redirects to the NHTSA web page where owners can check for recalls by entering their vehicle identification number.\n\nThe campaign is focused on drivers of vehicles that are at least 5 years old or those who drive used cars. The website notes that the \"recall compliance rate is only 44% for these vehicles compared to 83% for newer vehicles.\"\n\nThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry advocacy group, provided a copy of the results of a national online survey in 2015 of 1,500 vehicle owners. The survey asked respondents about factors that influence recalls and noted what types of owners have their vehicles fixed.\n\nMore:Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler issues huge recall as diesel emissions questions linger\n\nThe survey found that 64% of owners who had received a recall notice in the previous one to two years had repaired their vehicles. Of the others who had received a notice, 31% planned to have their vehicle repaired, but 5% did not intend to do so.\n\nThe survey also found that the more severe the issue prompting the recall, the more likely owners would be to have their vehicle fixed. Owners of new vehicles were more likely than owners of used vehicles to have their vehicles repaired.\n\nConsumer advocate John Simpson, director of Consumer Watchdog's Privacy Project, said he believes the efforts to notify drivers of recalls have improved in recent years, noting the unprecedented scale of the Takata airbag recall, which has its own update area on NHTSA's webpage. The company's airbags, which could explode, may have been responsible for 16 deaths.\n\nMore:Inadvertent air bag deployment triggers Fiat Chrysler minivan recall\n\nSimpson said that traditionally, getting the word from manufacturers to consumers about recalls could be problematic.

Potential cracks in the vehicles’ fuel line could cause fires to break out under the hood of some cars, according to Ford and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA total of 634,000 of the SUVs are being recalled for the problem worldwide, the company said.\n\nSpecifically, fuel injector can crack in some Escapes from model year 2022 through 2023 and 2021 through 2023 Bronco Sports that are equipped with the 3-cylinder 1.5-liter turbrocharged engine. This could allow fuel, or fuel vapor, to leak over hot parts of the vehicle and start a fire.\n\nFord is not suggesting that owners stop driving their vehicle.

The company said it is aware of 20 fires that seem to be related to this new issue.\n\nSome of these same SUVs were involved in an earlier recall that also involved a possibility of fire.

Baby alligators have been reported in parking lots on the causeway that crosses Mobile Bay and along heavily traveled U.S. 98 in Daphne, WKRG-TV reports, so the city posted notes on social media asking residents to be careful, particularly with pets. Charles Epler of Wildlife Solutions, an animal removal services, said the sightings likely were linked to the weather. “They get pushed out. That heavy, torrential rain washes them out of where they’re at, and then they’re going to try and find somewhere else to set up shop,” Epler said. Daphne, a city of about 26,000, is located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. “About 83% of their diet in the wild is turtles. I think that’s why there’s so many over here in Daphne,” Epler said.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A bus that people sometimes embarked on deadly pilgrimages to visit can now safely be viewed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks while it undergoes preservation work. The bus was moved to the school’s engineering facility last week while it’s being prepared for outdoor display at the Museum of the North, television station KTVF reports. The abandoned Fairbanks city bus became a shelter for hunters and others using the backcountry near Denali National Park and Preserve, but it was a beacon for those wishing to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless, who hiked to the bus in 1992. The 24-year-old Virginia man died from starvation when he couldn’t hike back out because of the swollen Teklanika River. During his last days he kept a journal that was discovered when his body was found. McCandless’ ordeal was chronicled in Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book “Into the Wild,” followed later by director Sean Penn’s movie of the same name. People from all over the world made the bus a focal point and tried to retrace his steps. The state removed the bus located about 25 miles from the town of Healy after two women from Europe drowned on homages to the bus. There were 15 other search-and-rescue missions since 2009, the state Department of Natural Resources said in August 2020 when the bus was flown out of the wilderness.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Documents and training materials from the Arizona Department of Corrections’ servers contain images of a skull with a sword through it that experts liken to gang and white supremacist symbols. Corrections experts say the designs may offer a window into the mindset of the department’s Special Operations teams, reflecting an us-against-them mentality and members acting out militaristic fantasies, rather than rehabilitating prisoners. PowerPoint presentations featuring the skull and sword emblem also define the imagery. “Skull = Death before dishonor,” a slide says, while the shotguns are “tools of the trade,” and the eyes of the skull, embellished with gun sights, indicate: “We are always watching you.” Set to Guns N’ Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle,” a training video depicts special operations teams responding to riots at the Yuma and Kingman prisons. The video contains graphic images of the aftermath, including zip-tied prisoners, officers using dogs to intimidate prisoners, blood-stained walls and floors, and nonlethal weapons used on inmates. Prisoners alleged special operations officers committed civil rights abuses in the aftermath of the deadly riot at the Yuma prison in March 2018. Thirty-seven people were injured, one prisoner died, and six officers were fired and criminally charged for destroying prisoner property.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday effectively approved a new law that will allow employees to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements, a move by fellow Republicans to challenge federal vaccine mandates. Hutchinson allowed the measure to become law without his signature despite his concerns about the impact it will have on businesses in the state. The new law won’t take effect until early next year. In Arkansas, a bill becomes law after it sits on the governor’s desk for five days without any action. Governors have traditionally used that approach to express opposition to legislation without prompting a veto fight with the Legislature. Hutchinson said the amount of time before the opt-out law takes effect gives the state more time to weigh its impact on businesses and for any court challenges to be filed. But he also called the proposal unnecessary and counterproductive. “The debate on these bills has been harmful to our goal of increasing vaccination rates in Arkansas,” he told reporters. The measure requires employers to allow workers to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements if they’re tested weekly for the coronavirus or can prove they have antibodies. Health officials have said antibody tests should not be used to assess immunity, those who’ve recovered should still get vaccinated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: A wildfire raging through Southern California coastal mountains threatened ranches and rural homes and kept a major highway shut down Wednesday as the fire-scarred state faced a new round of dry winds that raise risk of flames. The Alisal Fire covered more than 22 square miles in the Santa Ynez Mountains west of Santa Barbara, and the number of firefighters was nearly doubled to 1,300, with more on the way. Containment remained at 5%. While the scenic region along the Pacific shoreline is lightly populated, the blaze was a threat to more than 100 homes, ranches and other buildings, fire officials said. Fire crews were protecting Rancho del Cielo, which was once owned by Ronald and Nancy Reagan and was known as the Western White House during his presidency. The 688-acre ranch where Reagan hosted world leaders sits atop the mountain range, above the flames feeding on dense chaparral and grasses. The area hadn’t burned since 1955, according to the conservative youth organization Young America’s Foundation, which now operates the ranch. Crews also protected an Exxon/Mobil gas processing facility in a canyon surrounded by flames. The fire erupted Monday near the Alisal Reservoir and swept down through the mountains, forcing the closure of U.S. 101. At one point, the fire jumped the highway and reached a beach.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado will include gender confirmation care in its individual and small-group health insurance plans, state and federal officials announced Tuesday. The state’s plan under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will include jaw, cheek and eye modifications, face tightening, facial bone remodeling for facial feminization, breast or chest construction and reductions, and laser hair removal. Additional health benefits for Colorado’s plan include an annual mental health exam and expanded coverage of opioid alternatives for pain management, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said. The new plan adds 15 drugs as alternatives and will cover up to six acupuncture visits per year, according to the Colorado Division of Insurance. The changes will go into effect Jan. 1, 2023. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Colorado’s request to provide gender-confirming care as part of the state’s “essential health benefits,” which are requirements for individual and small-employer plans set forth under former the Affordable Care Act. Christy Mallory, legal director at the Williams Institute, a research institute based in the University of California Los Angeles’ School of Law, said without insurance, much of gender-confirming care is “prohibitively expensive,” so Colorado’s move increases access to medically necessary care for trans people.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: President Joe Biden plans to visit the University of Connecticut on Friday for the dedication of a human rights center named after former U.S. Sens. Thomas and Christopher Dodd. The Dodd Center for Human Rights serves as an umbrella home for the school’s human rights programs and archives. Those include the Human Rights Institute, which houses the largest undergraduate and graduate human rights program at a public university in the U.S., and Dodd Impact, which focuses on community-based human rights initiatives. It had been known as the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center since its opening in 1995, named for the late senator who also was a lead prosecutor for the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany, after World War II. UConn’s Board of Trustees voted in August to change the name to the Dodd Center for Human Rights to recognize the work of both Democratic senators and their family. “I’m deeply grateful to UConn for recognizing me and my family by dedicating the Dodd Center for Human Rights, and I’m honored that my good friend President Biden is joining us to mark this occasion,” said former Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, who is Thomas Dodd’s son. He served as a senator from 1981 to 2011, gaining a reputation as a human rights advocate for his work to end abuses in Central America.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Auditor Kathy McGuiness turned herself in to authorities and pleaded not guilty to corruption charges Tuesday morning. Accompanied by her attorney, McGuiness entered the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center just before 10 a.m. to turn herself in to Delaware Capitol Police. Steve Wood, her attorney, told the court in a brief hearing that she pleaded not guilty to the charges, including felony theft and intimidation, as well as public service misdemeanors like official misconduct. The basis of the charges is that she violated conflict-of-interest laws by arranging a job for her daughter and her daughter’s friend in the auditor’s office, that she rigged public payments to a campaign consultant to avoid regulatory scrutiny, and that she sought to spy on and intimidate those who questioned her conduct. McGuiness and Wood opposed prosecutors’ request that she be barred from speaking about the case to her daughter. Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney argued that Elizabeth McGuiness is an “unindicted co-conspirator” and a witness. But “to say to a mother that you may not talk to your young daughter about probably the most traumatic event that has occurred for either of them in their lives is unnecessary and inhumane,” Wood argued to the court. The judge sided with McGuiness’ attorney and denied the request.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Washington National Cathedral formally dedicated a new stone carving of Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in a ceremony Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The carving, completed in April, shows Wiesel’s likeness inside the cathedral’s Human Rights Porch, which features carvings of leading human rights defenders throughout history, including Rosa Parks, Mother Teresa, Jonathan Daniels and Eleanor Roosevelt. The dedication was a collaboration among the cathedral, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. “From surviving the Holocaust to becoming one of the world’s leading lights in preserving the memory of that unspeakable tragedy forevermore, we owe a great debt of gratitude to Elie Wiesel,” Cathedral Dean Randy Hollerith said. “It is an honor to have his memory and his legacy included in our Human Rights Porch so he can serve as a reminder of the consequences of hate, as well as the resiliency and indomitability of the human spirit.” Wednesday’s ceremony featured remarks from former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and author John Meacham, who is canon historian of the cathedral. A survivor of the Auschwitz and Buchenwald camps, Wiesel told his story to millions through his autobiographical novel “Night.”\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: A statue of Black educator Mary McLeod Bethune will be on display for two months in the city before heading to its permanent home in the U.S. Capitol, where it’s replacing a sculpture of a Confederate soldier as one of two statues from the Sunshine State in the building’s National Statuary Hall. The 11-foot marble statue of Bethune, a civil rights leader and adviser to President Franklin Roosevelt, was unveiled Monday at the News-Journal Center in Daytona Beach. The statue depicts Bethune, a founder of Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, wearing a graduation cap and gown and holding a black rose. Early next year, Bethune will become the first Black woman represented in the National Statuary Hall, where each state has two likenesses of prominent native sons and daughters. “The sculpture is a gleaming representation of what is possible with unyielding tenacity and dogged determination,” Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry said. The statue of Bethune replaces one of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. Confederate monuments across the country have fallen in recent years amid contentious debate over whether they are proud monuments to Southern heritage or hated symbols of racism and past slavery.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit alleging fraud in the state’s most populous county during the 2020 election. The suit sought a review of some 147,000 absentee ballots to see if any were illegitimate. Originally filed in December, the lawsuit that alleged evidence of fraudulent ballots and improper ballot counting in Fulton County was filed by nine Georgia voters and spearheaded by Garland Favorito, a longtime critic of the state’s election systems. Henry County Superior Court Chief Judge Brian Amero’s order dismissing the case said the voters who brought the suit “failed to allege a particularized injury” and therefore lacked the standing to claim their state constitutional rights to equal protection and due process had been violated. Amero also noted that Georgia’s Secretary of State’s Office had provided a “substantive and detailed response” to his request for an update on any investigations into allegations of fraudulent or counterfeit ballots in Fulton County. Favorito expressed frustration after the ruling, saying his team had “prepared diligently to show the evidence of our allegations” at a hearing the judge had previously scheduled for Nov. 15. Angered by his narrow loss in a traditionally red state, former President Donald Trump had focused his fury on Georgia and particularly on Fulton County.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state has not experienced a large spike in evictions despite the expiration of state and federal moratoriums meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect renters during the pandemic’s economic downturn. Tracey Wiltgen, executive director of the Mediation Center of the Pacific, said her organization has handled more cases in recent months but not as many as she anticipated, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Between Aug. 7 and Oct. 2, the center opened 565 eviction cases for mediation – fewer than the 1,000-1,500 cases it had expected. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Wiltgen said, the center mediated about 200 eviction cases per month. A state-level moratorium ended Aug. 6. A few weeks later, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal moratorium that was announced by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. David Chee, an attorney who mostly represents landlords, said some cases are being kept out of court because tenants are choosing to leave their units without fighting the eviction. “A lot of tenants have just run away,” Chee said. “So once the moratoriums were done, a lot of tenants, as soon as they figured out their landlords were going to evict them, just simply left.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Tuesday that he wants to use federal coronavirus relief money to increase day care capacity to help alleviate the state’s worker shortage. The Republican governor, in a speech about the future of work that was followed by several questions, said expanding day care could help get more workers back in the workforce. Idaho’s current unemployment rate of 2.9% puts the state back at pre-pandemic levels last seen in early 2020, a span that includes a period of double-digit unemployment as COVID-19 spread and jobs evaporated. But now, many employers can’t find enough workers. “We know part of that is parents who are staying home,” Little said. “We think we can take some one-time money and build some (day care) capacity.” The U.S. Department of Labor has said the national unemployment rate last month dropped from 5.2% to 4.8%. Officials said 194,000 people found work, a tepid number and evidence that the pandemic remained a problem, with many companies struggling to fill millions of open jobs. Idaho has had problems with the coronavirus’ highly contagious delta variant, with the state currently on crisis standards of care due to so many unvaccinated patients filling hospitals. Crisis care standards mean scarce resources such as intensive care beds will be allotted to the patients most likely to survive.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The head of a police union has called on its members to defy the city’s requirement to report their COVID-19 vaccination status by Friday or be placed on unpaid leave. In the video posted online Tuesday and first reported on by the Chicago Sun-Times, Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara vowed to take Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration to court if it tries to enforce the mandate, which requires city workers to report their vaccine status by the end of the workweek. After Friday, unvaccinated workers who won’t submit to semiweekly coronavirus testing will be placed on unpaid leave. Catanzara suggested that if the city does enforce its requirement, and many union members refuse to comply with it, “it’s safe to say that the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50% or less for this weekend coming up.” In the video, Catanzara instructs officers to file for exemptions to receiving the vaccine but not to enter that information into the city’s vaccine portal. He said that although he has made clear his vaccine status, “I do not believe the city has the authority to mandate that to anybody, let alone that information about your medical history.” During a news conference Wednesday, Lightfoot accused Cantazara of spreading false information and dismissed most of his statements as “untrue or patently false.”\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Monroe County officials are buying part of a site dotted with old limestone quarries for a possible tourist destination despite chemical contamination found in the area. The Monroe County Council this past week approve the $370,000 purchase of nearly 30 acres near Bloomington just northwest of the Interstate 69 and Indiana 46 interchange. County leaders have discussed over the past couple years buying about 100 acres of wooded former quarry property with the idea of building trails, exhibits about the limestone industry and an outdoor concert venue. Tests by an Indiana University researcher have found low contamination levels of polychlorinated biphenyls in sections of the quarry site not yet purchased by the county. Several sites around Bloomington contaminated with the toxic industrial chemicals have faced multimillion-dollar cleanups since the 1980s. County Council member Kate Wiltz said the proposed park project could acknowledge the negative impact of industrial pollution on the community while being a tribute to the area’s limestone heritage. “I think that’s a side of parks and public lands that we don’t often promote, but that’s every bit as important reason to purchase and steward the property,” Wiltz said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: With the threat of a United Auto Workers strike looming, Deere & Co. managers told employees at factories across the state not to come in Wednesday. Workers said managers ordered third-shift employees in Waterloo not to report to work at their usual 11 p.m. start time. Employees at the company’s Ankeny and Ottumwa plants said Deere also canceled their second shifts. Employees are working under a contract that expires Friday, but the UAW told Deere that its 10,100 members will go on strike Thursday morning if the two sides cannot reach a tentative agreement. Workers have not gone on strike against Deere since 1986. UAW International spokesperson Brian Rothenberg said Wednesday that his team was looking into reports of temporary layoffs. “We’ve gotten no formal notification about anything,” he said. In addition to plants in Ankeny, Ottumwa and Waterloo, the UAW represents Deere workers in Davenport and Dubuque, as well as in Illinois and Kansas. The Waterloo plant, with about 3,000 members, is Deere’s largest. On Sunday, UAW members overwhelmingly rejected a proposed six-year contract with Deere that would have raised wages and bolstered current employees’ retirement payments while ending traditional pensions for new hires, who would participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has passed an ordinance aimed at banning discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. After four months of delays, the council voted 6-1 to approve the measure Tuesday, the Wichita Eagle reports. Council member Jeff Blubaugh cast the lone dissenting vote. Council members rejected a proposed exemption that would have allowed religious groups to fire or refuse to hire LGBTQ individuals, an amendment proposed by council member Jared Cerullo, the first openly gay man to serve on the council. Cerullo said the proposed amendment would help bridge the divide between religious groups who opposed it and those who wanted it. But council members Becky Tuttle and Cindy Claycomb said it would “dilute” the ordinance. The measure seeks to prohibit discrimination based on age, color, disability, familial status, gender identity, genetic information, national origin or ancestry, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, citizenship, veteran status or any other factor protected by law. The city will begin accepting complaints under the ordinance Jan. 1.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, the influential chairman of the House Budget Committee who has played a key role in pushing for President Joe Biden’s agenda to expand the nation’s social safety net, announced Tuesday that he will not seek another term in next year’s election. At age 74, Yarmuth – first elected to Congress in 2006, when he unseated a Republican incumbent in his Louisville-area district – said he wanted to spend more time with his family. The congressman is the 10th Democrat to announce plans to retire ahead of the 2022 election. Although the district he represents has become increasingly blue, the retirement of a Democrat in a senior leadership position sends yet another ominous sign about the party’s chances heading into next year’s midterms, when its thin majority in both U.S. chambers will be at stake. The party that wins control of the White House typically loses congressional seats in subsequent elections. Yarmuth is the only Democrat in Kentucky’s six-member U.S. House delegation. State Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top-ranking Democrat in the GOP-controlled state Senate, quickly announced he’d run for the seat. State Rep. Attica Scott was already waging a primary challenge against Yarmuth, and his son, Aaron Yarmuth, said he is weighing throwing his hat in the ring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billionaire Richard Branson said it was an honor and a once-in-a-lifetime experience to don a drum major’s uniform and march ahead of a New Orleans high school band. But some of the Catholic school’s fans apparently were less enthusiastic about Branson’s appearance last week with the St. Augustine High School Marching 100 – the band that integrated an exclusive Mardi Gras parade. The band and Branson paraded to a new Virgin Hotel in New Orleans as part of opening ceremonies Thursday. “I’ve had quite a few exciting experiences in my time, but I’ve never got (a) chance to lead a marching band before – let alone the best marching band in the world,” Branson wrote on his blog Friday. “What an honour to join the legendary St. Augustine High School band for a performance through the streets of New Orleans.” Aulston G. Taylor, president and CEO of the school, tweeted a letter late Sunday acknowledging that many people had told him only students who have earned it should be allowed to wear the purple and gold uniform. Others felt that “Sir Branson adorning our drum major uniform with honor across his millions of followers was great for the school and sets us apart as a global brand,” he wrote. He said both viewpoints are valid.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Republicans in the state Senate want to return to taxpayers a portion of the surplus that accumulated during the pandemic, thanks in part to historic federal assistance. The “Give It Back” plan is seen as a major piece of the GOP’s messaging push ahead of the 2022 legislative session and comes as former Republican Gov. Paul LePage seeks to unseat current Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, the Bangor Daily News reports. The plan calls for splitting unused monthly revenue, sending half to the state’s rainy day fund and half to taxpaying residents. The proposal is in line with LePage’s campaign promise of eliminating Maine’s income tax if he wins in 2022. Mills has overseen a healthy state budget during her time as governor despite higher spending. A spokesperson for her administration called the GOP proposal a tacit acknowledgement of the state’s good fiscal situation under Mills’ leadership, according to the newspaper. Maine Republican legislators have fought with Mills over the $1 billion in federal relief that was used to bail state government out during the pandemic. Party leaders have called the aid excessive.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city’s public schools are using software that alerts officials when a student using one of the system’s laptops might be considering suicide. Since March, GoGuardian’s Beacon software has identified nine students as having a severe mental health crisis. All were taken to an emergency room, Stacey Davis, the city schools’ coordinator of media and instructional technology, told The Baltimore Sun. But the practice, which came about as the system loaned out laptops for students’ home use during the pandemic, is raising questions about privacy and equity. Two recent reports warn that such technology could be used for disciplinary purposes, unintentionally out LGBTQ students or squash student expression. They also note that economically disadvantaged students may be tracked more frequently because school-owned laptops may be their only devices. “Privacy and equity was not being considered as much as it needs to be,” said Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington and co-author of one of the reports. “Student activity monitoring is quite widespread.” Baltimore schools have gotten 786 alerts from Beacon since March. Of those, clinicians responded 401 times, and school police went to homes 12 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBarnstable: A rare two-headed diamondback terrapin turtle is alive and kicking – with all six of its legs – at the Birdsey Cape Wildlife Center after hatching a little over two weeks ago. A threatened species in the state, this turtle is feeding well on bloodworms and food pellets, staff at the center said. The two heads operate independently, coming up for air at different times, and inside its shell are two gastrointestinal systems to feed both sides of its body. The turtle originally came from a nest in West Barnstable that researchers determined was in a hazardous location and needed to be moved. After hatching, turtles in these so-called head start nests are sent to different care centers to be monitored before their release in the spring. Center veterinarian Pria Patel and other staff members will continue to monitor the turtle, which they nicknamed Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen after the twins who rose to prominence as child actors, beginning with “Full House” in 1987 when they were babies, and now are the famously elusive designers behind fashion label The Row. The staff is hoping to perform a CT scan to learn more about the turtle’s circulatory system.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Backers of former President Donald Trump will launch a ballot drive to require a “full forensic audit” of the 2020 presidential election, rallygoers were told Tuesday. Jon Rocha, of Portage, a Republican who is running against U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, said he expects paperwork for the legislative initiative to be filed with the Board of State Canvassers next week. “This is how a revolution begins,” Rocha told several hundred people gathered on the state Capitol lawn. If about 340,000 valid signatures are collected, and the measure is approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature, “it is absolutely veto-proof,” Rocha said. “That’s the best part about it.” Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer “cannot stop this bill.” Should lawmakers fail to act on the measure, it would go to voters at the November 2022 election, he said. Though ill-defined, a “forensic audit” is the phrase that has been embraced by large numbers of people unhappy with the result of the 2020 presidential election, in which President Joe Biden, a Democrat, defeated Trump, a Republican. Biden won 306 to 232 in the Electoral College and by more than 7 million popular votes. Biden prevailed in Michigan by more than 150,000 votes. Several private donors have agreed to help fund the effort, Rocha said. He would not name them.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Moccasin maker Minnetonka is publicly apologizing for making money off Native American culture and promised to do more to support Indigenous communities in the future after 75 years in business. In a statement posted Monday on Minnetonka’s website, CEO David Miller said the company is not a Native-owned business. He noted the Minneapolis-based firm acknowledged its appropriation in summer 2020 but said this public apology was long overdue. “We deeply and meaningfully apologize for having benefited from selling Native-inspired designs without directly honoring Native culture or communities,” Miller said. The company timed the apology to coincide with Indigenous Peoples Day. To better address the needs of the Native American community, Minnetonka said it has hired Adrienne Benjamin – a Minnesotan, Anishinaabe, and a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe – as a reconciliation advisor. The company said it’s also making a concerted effort to improve diversity, equity and inclusion of underrepresented groups and will seek out more partnerships with Native-owned businesses as vendors and suppliers. In the past year, it has done business with two different Native-owned companies, the company said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Students who left college at least two years ago without a degree can apply for a grant to help them return to and finish school. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation recently awarded the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning $1.3 million to fund the state’s Complete 2 Compete tuition assistance grants through 2023. The Complete 2 Compete program provides one-on-one support for adult learners who have earned college credits – but not a degree – and works with them to complete their education. Qualifying returning students can receive a $1,000 grant that can be renewed every semester. The award helps pay for any coursework needed to graduate and can help repay prior debt. Funds can be used at any Mississippi public universities or community colleges. A total of 2,400 students have graduated since the program launched in 2017. More than 200,000 prior students qualify for the Complete 2 Compete program, according to a press release from the Mississippi Community College Board. Since May, the program has reached out to former students through postcards as well as internet and social media ads. More than 2,700 former students’ applications were processed over the summer, with 620 returning to enroll in one of 15 community colleges, eight universities and a medical center.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A federal judge has struck down the state’s requirement that a majority of the owners of companies that dispense, grow or manufacture marijuana must be Missouri residents. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey last week issued a permanent injunction against the residency requirement, The Kansas City Star reports. She had issued a temporary injunction in June. Missouri voters approved creation of a medical marijuana industry in the state in 2018. One of the regulations required that state-licensed marijuana cultivation plants, dispensaries and manufacturing facilities must be at least 51% owned by people who had lived in Missouri for at least one year. Mark Toigo, a Pennsylvania-based investor, filed a lawsuit last December challenging the requirement, arguing that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause. Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said in a statement that the agency is “happy to have clarity on how we should handle the ownership residency requirement in the Missouri Constitution and will comply with the court’s decision.” The health department oversees the medical marijuana program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A lawsuit filed Tuesday is challenging a new state law banning voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts in certain areas of college campuses. The lawsuit filed by the Montana Democratic Party, Montanans for Tester and University of Montana student Macee Patritti is one of several challenging the law passed by the Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year. The plaintiffs argue the law is suppressing the vote of young people, who typically favor Democratic candidates. The law prohibits political committees including student organizations from conducting voter registration drives and other political activities inside certain high-traffic public university spaces including residence halls, dining facilities and athletic facilities. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Missoula argues the law “imposes arbitrary, vague, and onerous restrictions on the rights of college students” to participate fully in the political process. Patritti, a 19-year-old freshman, registered students to vote at the Montana Technological University in Butte as an intern with the Montana Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 election, according to the court filing. The plaintiffs argue that her First Amendment rights to political expression would be curtailed under the new law, which would prohibit such activities.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has announced a five-year ban on Phi Gamma Delta fraternity for student conduct code violations following a report of a sexual assault at the fraternity’s house in August. The report led to a protest of about 1,000 people outside the fraternity house Aug. 25 and sparked similar protests on college campuses around the country. The UNL chapter of Phi Gamma Delta – better known as Fiji – was temporarily suspended in late August while the university investigated possible violations of a previous probation. The university said Tuesday in a news release that an investigation by the University Conduct Board showed violations had occurred and that Fiji is no longer recognized by the university. The fraternity is suspended from the Lincoln campus at least through 2026, the release said. Fiji was already on probation for previous violations of university policy when the assault was reported. That report is still being actively investigated by the University Police Department, according to the university.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state’s top election official is challenging the status of two ballot measures that Nevada’s largest teachers union promised to withdraw after successfully using them as bargaining chips and pressuring legislators to boost education funding. In a Sept. 7 letter first published by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske wrote that state law required she include measures that propose raising taxes on sales and gambling on the 2022 ballot. Neither Democrats nor Nevada’s powerful resort industry want the tax measures to appear before voters next year, both have said. Democrats worry their inclusion could allow Republicans to frame the election around taxes. And resorts and casinos do not want to risk a hike that could deter tourists from visiting Las Vegas. The initiatives originated almost a year ago, when the Clark County Education Association submitted the tens of thousands of signatures necessary to qualify the two proposals for the 2022 ballot. John Vellardita, the teachers union’s executive director, said in March that the measures were designed to “start a conversation” about education funding and said they’d remain on the ballot unless lawmakers increased education funding before adjourning in June, which they did.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Executive Council on Wednesday rejected $27 million in federal funds for vaccination outreach, thrilling outspoken activists who previously derailed a public meeting and delayed the vote. Several were arrested Wednesday after audience members repeatedly interrupted the debate. Among other things, the money would have allowed the state to hire a public health manager and a dozen workers to promote the COVID-19 vaccines and address public concerns about them. Opponents argued the grant language would have required the state to comply with any “future directives” issued by the Biden administration regarding COVID-19, such as vaccine mandates. The same language has appeared in other grants accepted by the council, a five-member body that approves state contracts. And it does not in any way impede the state’s sovereignty, said both Attorney General John Formella and Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. “I appreciate that you have concerns, but they’re based on fantasy,” Sununu told Councilor Joe Kenney. All four of the Republican councilors voted against the grants. “You want the government to tell private businesses who to hire and fire?” the governor said. “That is completely un-American.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: The state has awarded a contract to replace a century-old rail bridge that has been the source of regular delays for years, officials announced Tuesday. The $1.56 billion contract is the largest in NJ Transit’s history, CEO Kevin Corbett said in a statement. The board of directors approved a joint venture by Sweden-based Skanska and Traylor Brothers, a civil construction company based in Evansville, Indiana. Construction is expected to take about five years. The Portal North Bridge is to replace a 111-year-old swing bridge over the Hackensack River that occasionally becomes stuck after it opens to allow boats to pass and must be manually hammered back into place. The new bridge will allow marine traffic to pass underneath without interrupting rail traffic. The project completed its design phase and received environmental approvals several years ago but languished while New York and New Jersey officials squabbled with the Trump administration over dividing up the costs between the states and the federal government. “Few infrastructure projects are as critical to the nation as replacing the aging Portal Bridge,” Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: After seven years of mining, federal officials say work to carve out the eighth disposal area at the U.S. government’s underground nuclear waste repository is complete. Managers at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant are planning to use the space beginning next year. Workers still need to run power to the excavated area known as Panel 8 and install air monitors and chain link to protect the walls. Constructed in a deep layer of salt in southern New Mexico, the repository entombs the radioactive remnants of decades of nuclear research and bomb-making. That includes special boxes and barrels packed with lab coats, rubber gloves, tools and debris contaminated with plutonium and other radioactive elements. Having enough space for the waste became more of an issue in 2014, when a radiation release contaminated parts of the underground facility and forced an expensive, nearly three-year closure. Some parts of the repository became off-limits. State regulators currently are weighing a permit change that some critics say could open the door to expanded operations at the repository. A decision is expected this year. In operation for more than two decades, the repository has received nearly 13,000 shipments. The idea is that the shifting salt will eventually encapsulate the waste after the underground vaults are filled and sealed.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A $2 billion project to build a rail link to LaGuardia Airport was officially put on hold Tuesday, after weeks of criticism from public officials and a lawsuit from neighborhood and environmental groups. In a news release, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it is pausing the project to consider alternatives. In recent weeks, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul had criticized the project, championed by her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo. Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who represents part of the area through which the link would pass, also has spoken out against it, as has outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio. The Federal Aviation Administration issued environmental approval in July but recently had asked the Port Authority to reconsider in light of a lawsuit filed by neighborhood and environmental groups. Preliminary construction on the roughly $2 billion, 1.5-mile elevated link was to begin this year. Public transit officials have sought for years to build a rail link to LaGuardia, one of the few major U.S. airports without rail service. Critics had opposed the plan, saying it would negatively impact Queens neighborhoods and wouldn’t be appreciably faster than driving, as it would involve taking a train or subway from points east or west to a stop serving CitiField, home of the New York Mets, then switching to the rail link.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A jail violated regulations requiring guards to observe inmates at least twice an hour, according to a state agency probing the deaths of two inmates last spring. On May 22, John Devin Haley, 41, of Charlotte, was found hanging below his cell window at the Mecklenburg County jail with a strip of blanket tied around his neck, The Charlotte Observer reports. Haley had a history of addiction and mental health problems when he entered the jail April 3 and was temporarily placed on suicide watch, according to jail records. Karon Golightly of Gastonia died at the jail May 14. Five months later, the cause of his death has not been made public, the newspaper reports. In North Carolina, jailers are required to observe each inmate “at least twice an hour on an irregular basis, with no more than 40 minutes between rounds,” according to state regulations. That standard was repeatedly violated in the hours leading up to the two deaths, according to investigators with the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. A DHHS report obtained by the newspaper says 52 minutes elapsed between the time Golightly was seen healthy and being discovered in distress in another inmate’s cell. The state also pointed to a camera near where Golightly collapsed that apparently was malfunctioning.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Budget writers in the Legislature began mulling proposals Tuesday on how to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in federal coronavirus aid the state received this year. House and Senate appropriations committees met separately in all-day meetings at the Capitol, listening to pitches from fellow lawmakers and others on a wish list that totaled $9.2 billion – significantly more than the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief funds transferred to the state-owned Bank of North Dakota in June. The meetings, attended heavily by lobbyists, were the first in a series being held this month to prioritize projects ahead of a Nov. 8 special session, when the full GOP-led Legislature will debate the proposals. The $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus funds represents the single-largest deposit into state coffers in history. The money currently is parked in short-term CDs, earning less than 1% interest. Senate Appropriations Chairman Ray Holmberg and his counterpart in the House, Jeff Delzer, said priority for the funding will be given to water, sewer and infrastructure projects, for which there is an immediate need, and those that won’t require a commitment of funds from taxpayers in the future.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Recreational marijuana would be legalized for adults 21 and older under Republican legislation coming in the state House that would levy a 10% sales tax on the product, a lawmaker announced Tuesday. Ohio facilities currently producing and processing medical marijuana would be grandfathered into the program, with new producers to be added to meet the expected demand, said Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Lake County. He said he’s currently looking for co-sponsors for the legislation, which has been in the works for months. The bill “is the responsible approach for adult use,” Callender said. A quarter of the sales tax revenue would go to police departments to purchase equipment used in detecting impaired drivers and another quarter toward addiction and recovery programs. The remaining 50% would not be earmarked, which could help the state during a precarious economic time, Callender said. In addition to the legislation being announced Tuesday, a separate ballot issue to legalize marijuana use and sales in Ohio is underway. A spokesperson for the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, which proposed that statute, said Tuesday that the group applauded Callender’s plan and said it continues to welcome the chance to work with the Legislature on passing a recreational marijuana bill.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A retired New York attorney is suing the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, saying its claim to have no records pertaining to the drugs it plans to use in upcoming executions “defies belief.” Fred Hodara, who filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Oklahoma County District Court, is asking the court to compel the corrections department to comply with his open records requests for documentation of its execution plans. He said in his lawsuit that in response to his requests for the records, including some the department is legally required to keep, the department told him none exist, the Tulsa World reports. “In light of the scope and nature of the requests, the assertation defies belief,” the lawsuit said, arguing that the agency has a history of refusing to search for and produce records that are subject to the state’s Open Records Act. A department spokesman told the newspaper that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation. Oklahoma is preparing to execute John Marion Grant on Oct. 28. It would be the state’s first execution since 2015, when then-Gov. Mary Fallin put a moratorium on capital punishment following the execution of Charles Warner with a drug that wasn’t authorized to be used that way.\n\nOregon\n\nKeizer: Republican state lawmaker Bill Post has announced his resignation from the Legislature after saying he misunderstood the residency requirements for being in office when he moved out of Oregon. His resignation announced Tuesday will be effective Nov. 30. Post previously said he wouldn’t seek reelection in 2022 but said Tuesday that he would resign after “discussions with an elections attorney.” Post, a former talk radio host, has served in the Oregon House of Representatives since 2015. He and his wife moved to Fallon, Nevada, which is east of Reno. In a Sept. 27 Facebook message, Post said his wife accepted a job, and they had sold their Keizer house and bought one in Fallon. He said he’d be in the district “at least once per month.” “My intent was to be open with my constituents about my move out of state and the steps I’d be taking to continue to fulfill my duties for the rest of my term to the best of my knowledge and ability,” Post said in a statement. Republican precinct committee members from House District 25 will select three to five candidates to replace Post. County commissioners from Marion and Yamhill counties will then choose a candidate to serve out the remainder of Post’s term. A Republican has held the seat since 2003.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Love was unexpectedly on the court docket when a man accused of murder made an unusual request of the judge who will preside over his trial. Kashawn Flowers’ lawyer on Tuesday asked York County Judge Harry Ness whether he’d consider marrying Flowers and his girlfriend. Attorney Brian Perry acknowledged it was the first time he had ever made such a request. Flowers is accused of gunning down a man in York in August 2014. His girlfriend would not be a witness at the trial, his attorney said. Prosecutors did not object, and neither did the judge. But the marriage is on hold until after the trial. “We’ll take care of it next week,” the judge said. Flowers remains held in the county jail without bail.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A series of controversial murals at a school have been painted over following criticism that they depicted children of color in a disparaging light. Among the four painted panels at Robert F. Kennedy Elementary School, only one shows children with different skin tones together, while the others show varying races separated. Two white children are shown playing on a beach in one scene, while two Black children build a snowman in another. Meanwhile, in a separate image, other children of color tidy up the school and collect trash. City Councilman David Salvatore said he received complaints about the murals, focusing in part on their apparent themes of inequality and segregation, and held community meetings on the issue. Initially, Salvatore explored the idea of removing the murals, preserving them and putting them on display, though he said it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. Eventually, the murals were painted over just before the school year began. Considerations for a new mural will be made. The city’s decision generated backlash from state Rep. Anastasia Williams, who said the paintings represented desegregation and anti-racism to her. Officials have been unable to find any mention of the murals in city archives; it’s only known that they were painted decades ago.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two civil rights groups are suing the state, saying lawmakers are taking too long to draw new maps for U.S. and state House districts. Candidates are required to file to run for the 2022 races by the end of March, but time is running out for potential candidates to research the new districts and settle any lawsuits asking judges to decide if the new maps are fair, according to the suit. It was filed Tuesday by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups are asking a panel of three federal judges to set a specific timeline for maps to be drawn and approved and not allow any elections until the new districts get judicial approval. The suit said lawmakers should have kept to suggestions when they adjourned in June that there would be a special session in September or October to approve maps. Those plans became less firm as lawmakers dealt with the aftermath of a budget provision that prevented districts from passing mask requirements this school year. South Carolina Senate President Harvey Peeler called for an Oct. 12 special session last month but canceled it about a week later, saying a committee working on the school district issues wouldn’t be finished in time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Zoo officials say COVID-19 may have killed a snow leopard. The animal, named Baya, died at the Great Plains Zoo on Thursday of a respiratory illness that might have been COVID-19. Coronavirus test results are pending. The snow leopard began coughing Oct. 3. By Oct. 4 she was acting lethargic and wouldn’t eat. Zoo veterinarians gave Baya antibiotics Thursday, but she was in critical condition later in the day. Baya was 21/ 2 years old and had been at the zoo since early 2021. Officials had hoped she would mate with another snow leopard named Strut. Zoo officials said Monday that an Amur tiger at the zoo tested positive for the virus Oct. 6, the day before Baya died. Five other big cats at the zoo have shown COVID-19 symptoms, including Strut. Most of the animals have been on antibiotics and are improving, said Matt Eschenbrenner, the zoo’s director of animal care and conservation. He said the zoo hopes to bring in another snow leopard to replace Baya, but it’s unclear when that animal might arrive. “We can’t even think about bringing in another animal until we know everything has passed and our animals are healthy, 100%,” Eschenbrenner said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Three U.S. Postal Service workers died in a shooting spree at a sorting facility Tuesday, including a supervisor, a manager and a letter carrier temporarily assigned to the postal annex, relatives and co-workers said. Two workers were fatally shot by a third who died from a self-inflicted gunshot, authorities said. The FBI and U.S. Postal Service didn’t immediately name those involved. The postal facility reopened Wednesday. Laquita Benjamin, president of the local branch of the National Association of Postal Supervisors, said those killed were a carrier, a supervisor and a manager. “You can’t just relate it to the Postal Service because you have school shootings, store shootings – you have shootings all over,” Benjamin said. A family member identified one of the dead as James Wilson, a manager at the East Lamar Carrier Annex in Orange Mound, a historic Memphis neighborhood. “He was a humble soul, one of the nicest supervising managers you could ever wish there was,” Roxanne Rogers said of Wilson, her cousin. Rogers, herself a postal worker, said Wilson had just returned to the annex after filling in at a different location. Melvin Richardson, president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 96, said the annex is only used by employees.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday launched an investigation into allegations of widespread mistreatment at the state’s embattled youth lockups, where at least 11 staffers have been arrested on sexual abuse charges in recent years. The move by the Biden administration is the latest sign of trouble for the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, which for more than a decade has been beset by scandal, staff shake-ups and investigations into allegations of abuse. Just last week, a former coach at a West Texas facility was arrested on charges alleging that he touched the breast of an 18-year-old in custody. The announcement comes a year after advocates in Texas filed a complaint with federal investigators that outlined “grave problems” at the state’s five youth lockups. Texas put more than 800 youths in state juvenile detention in 2019 – more than any other state – according to an agency report published in September. “Being subjected to harmful conditions does not rehabilitate children; it only leads to worse life outcomes,” said Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Spokespeople for the state agency and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In July, Abbott ordered a new investigation into the agency.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Apple CEO Tim Cook and NBA All-Star Dwayne Wade joined Utah leaders Wednesday to announce the completion of a local advocacy group’s campaign to build new homes that provide services for LGBTQ youth in the West. Encircle, a nonprofit providing mental health services for LGBTQ youth, has surpassed its goal of raising $8 million to build eight new homes with locations in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Utah aimed at providing safe spaces and preventing teen suicide. “Encircle’s mission is very personal to me because I see myself in so many of these young people,” Cook told reporters at a press briefing Wednesday. “It’s not easy when you’re made to feel different or less than because of who you are or who you love. It’s a feeling that so many LGBTQ people know far too well.” Wade, who joined the Utah Jazz ownership group in April, shared his experience as the parent of a transgender child and voiced his support for Encircle’s mission. “I stand here as a proud parent of a beautiful daughter that’s a part of the LGBT+ community,” Wade said. “I don’t have all the answers. I don’t know everything, but I’m willing to listen.”\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A dam built at the end of the 18th century has been fully removed after it was abandoned and contributed to flooding that threatened nearby homes in central Vermont. The removal of the Dunklee Pond dam started in 2019 and was completed in the past month, WCAX-TV reports. In the decades after it was built, the dam powered industries including a linseed oil mill, a wood planing mill, a metal mill, a slate pencil mill and a tannery, the broadcaster reports. More recently, it was used as a skating rink and swimming hole. “In the ’50s, ’60s, there were photos of the people diving, jumping off the dam, off the wall up here, swimming, fishing,” said Todd Menees of the Vermont Rivers Program. But the dam deteriorated, and Rutland City Fire Chief Bill Lovett said if it failed, it would have threatened dozens of homes downstream, and a bridge over a busy roadway could have been destroyed. The Vermont Natural Resources Council and the city of Rutland coordinated the project, using about $500,000 of state and federal funding. The project removed sediment that accumulated behind the dam, which the city of Rutland will use for road repairs.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: The family of a slain journalist is asking the Federal Trade Commission to take action against Facebook for failing to remove online footage of her shooting death. Andy Parker said the company is violating its own terms of service in hosting videos on Facebook and its sibling service, Instagram, that glorify violence. His daughter, TV news reporter Alison Parker, and cameraman Adam Ward were killed by a former co-worker while reporting for Roanoke’s WDBJ-TV in August 2015. Video footage of the shooting – some of which was taken by the gunman – repeatedly resurfaces on Facebook and Instagram despite assurances from top executives that it will be removed, according to a complaint filed Tuesday by Parker and attorneys with the Georgetown Law Civil Rights Clinic. “The reality is that Facebook and Instagram put the onus on victims and their families to do the policing of graphic content – requiring them to relive their worst moments over and over to curb the proliferation of these videos,” the complaint said. It said Facebook is engaging in deceptive trade practices by violating its own terms of service and misrepresenting the safety of the platform and how hard it is for users to get harmful and traumatic content removed.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The pace of the 20-acre Rattlesnake Ridge landslide in central Washington near Union Gap is continuing to slow, officials said. Yakima County emergency services director Tony Miller said measurements taken in August show the slab is moving less than 2 inches each week, The Yakima Herald-Republic reports. In 2020, the slab was sliding 2 to 3 inches each week. The slab is expected to continue sliding south, with debris depositing in a nearby quarry. “It’s moving a little bit, crumbling and falling right into the pit,” Miller said. State and county officials, as well as scientists, have been monitoring the slide since a crack was spotted on the ridge in 2017. Initially, officials said the slide could pose an immediate danger, and 60 people living nearby were evacuated. Some residents returned after an assessment firm hired by the state confirmed the landslide was not likely to rapidly slip. Stephen Reidel, a research faculty member at Washington State University, said the slab is sliding on a sedimentary layer between basalt flows. As the basalt slides into the quarry, it will stack up and eventually build up enough to act as a barrier, stopping the landslide. “It’ll just stabilize itself and then stop moving,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Employers would be limited in their ability to require workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 under a bill introduced by Gov. Jim Justice on Wednesday. The proposal, which would allow certain medical and religious exemptions to company vaccine mandates, comes as the state approaches 4,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Employers would be barred under the bill from penalizing or discriminating against current or prospective employees for pursuing the exemptions. The bill, which covers businesses and state government agencies, was advanced in the state Senate on first reading Wednesday. In the House of Delegates, it was referred to a committee. Justice, a Republican, lifted an earlier indoor mask mandate in June and opposes any new mask or vaccine mandates. Businesses can mandate the COVID-19 vaccine, “but at the same time they need to allow for these exemptions,” Justice said at a news conference. Under the bill, a doctor or nurse can provide signed documentation that the employee has a physical condition preventing them from safely receiving the COVID-19 vaccine or that the worker has recovered from COVID-19 and can show they have antibodies for the coronavirus. The worker also can present a notarized certification for a religious exemption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans brought in rocker and avid hunter Ted Nugent on Wednesday to publicize a package of bills that would declare open hunting season on sandhill cranes and allow anyone 18 or older to carry concealed firearms without a permit. Nugent appeared with more than 20 Republican lawmakers, including state Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, inside the Assembly chamber. The musician and conservative activist said that “hunting is essential, and any regulation that doesn’t deal with safety or science-based wildlife management is an obstacle to participation.” The package of 13 bills is making its way through the Republican-controlled Legislature. Even if they passed, to become law they would need the approval of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who would likely veto many of them. Nugent, who lives in neighboring Michigan, is the national spokesman for Hunter Nation, a group that outraged conservationists when it won a court order forcing an unprecedented late-winter wolf hunt in Wisconsin during the animal’s breeding season. The proposal to create a sandhill crane hunting season mirrors another that died in 2012 in home state of the International Crane Foundation. Nugent said in addition to population control, sandhills are tasty. “Are you familiar with the term ribeye?” he said. “They’re ribeyes in the sky.”\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Trustees at the University of Wyoming say they’ll continue a policy requiring masks in indoor campus spaces where social distance can’t be maintained, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Only about 40% of students have confirmed COVID-19 vaccinations, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/25/eagle-cam-lynching-memorial-midwest-wildfires-news-around-states/50871577/", "title": "Eagle cam, lynching memorial, Midwest wildfires: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: After the company that opened a high-tech recycling center in the city went belly-up, and a second company needed steep government subsidies to keep it running, Mayor Steven Reed said the city has decided to cut its losses, end its public recycling service and sell the building. People in Montgomery throw all their trash into one container, and it’s separated and sorted into re-sellable goods at the $37 million facility. RePower South has handled operations there since 2019, when the company poured $10 million into upgrades to produce alternative fuel. But the price of commodities crashed the following year when China changed its import policies, and the facility couldn’t claw back into the black. Since then, Montgomery has paid RePower South about $2 million in subsidies to keep plant operations afloat. Reed said the company may continue to provide service temporarily, but the subsidies are over. RePower South issued a statement Friday afternoon saying it “will soon be announcing a new partnership to bring an advanced plastics recycling capability to Montgomery to build a sustainable, circular economy.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Republican gubernatorial candidate faces accusations he sexually harassed a former assistant while he was a borough mayor. The lawsuit filed Friday accuses Charlie Pierce of “constant unwanted physical touching, sexual remarks, and sexual advances,” the Anchorage Daily News reports. The woman’s Anchorage-based attorney, Caitlin Shortell, said in an email to the Associated Press that it was filed in the Kenai Superior Court, and she expected a judge to be assigned Monday. “When an elected official abuses their power and position to sexually harass public servants, they must be held accountable,” Shortell said. The AP does not normally identify alleged victims in sexual harassment cases. Pierce is one of four candidates running for governor in Alaska, and all appeared at a forum Saturday morning in Anchorage. “I have no comments on future litigation,” Pierce told the AP following the debate. He said he also had no plans to end his campaign just a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election. “I’ll be in the race,” he said. The lawsuit also names the Kenai Peninsula Borough south of Anchorage as a defendant in the case, claiming the local government failed to protect the woman. She claims the borough provided no way to report harassment or discrimination without fear of reprisal.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A man who runs a veterans charity lied about serving in the Army and duped Arizonans – including a retired veteran with cancer and a disabled Iraq War combat medic – out of tens of thousands of dollars, according to family and former supporters. Matt Augee of RecFX Foundation gained trust within military and church communities by touting himself as a warrior and his nonprofit as a Christian cause. He used humor, generosity and encouragement of people’s dreams to suck both the wealthy and the struggling into his schemes, people who know him said. In some cases, Augee’s actions derailed lives, depriving veterans of their nest eggs and leaving at least one military mother homeless, an investigation found. Augee denies wrongdoing. Former supporters, including Augee’s own parents, have tried to stop him by attempting to dissolve the organization and notifying local and federal authorities of their concerns. The Arizona Attorney General’s Office has closed at least two investigations without charges, while other agencies did not take action on complaints. Augee continues to operate his foundation, although the IRS website indicates it revoked its status as a nonprofit organization in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to dismiss wire fraud and bribery charges against a former state senator who was set to face trial next month for a second time after a jury deadlocked last year. Gilbert Baker, who also served as a former chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas, was accused of conspiring with a former state judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The judge, Mike Maggio, pleaded guilty to bribery in 2015 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In August 2021, a federal jury acquitted Baker of bribery conspiracy and deadlocked on another bribery charge and seven wire fraud charges. He was set to go on trial again Nov. 8, but prosecutors filed a motion Thursday seeking to dismiss the indictment against Baker. The motion did not give a reason for the dismissal, and a judge must still approve it. Baker’s attorney, Blake Hendrix, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he was preparing to go to trial up until he received the motion. He declined to comment until the indictment is dismissed. Baker’s case was among several corruption cases filed against lawmakers and lobbyists in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday vowed he would serve a full four-year term if reelected in November, trying again to knock down speculation that he wants to replace Democrat Joe Biden on the ballot should he not seek a second term. Newsom made the promise during an hourlong debate with his Republican challenger, state Sen. Brian Dahle – the only time the two candidates will meet face to face before voting ends Nov. 8. Newsom is expected to easily win reelection in November more than one year after beating back a recall attempt fueled by anger at his pandemic policies, which included the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order. He has barely campaigned in California this year, instead spending money on ads in challenging Republican leaders Florida and Texas – potential opponents in a presidential election. “Everyday Californians understand what is happening here in California, and the governor is focused on running for president,” Dahle said during a debate that was broadcast live on the radio by KQED News. Asked directly by co-moderator Marisa Lagos if he would commit to serving all four years if he’s reelected, Newsom said “yes.” He defended his national campaigning, saying he “barely” left the state to take on national Republican leaders, who he said are banning books and “demeaning” the LGBT community.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still incompetent to stand trial, a judge ruled Friday, keeping his prosecution on hold. Court proceedings against Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 23, have been paused since December, when a judge first found him to be mentally incompetent. The rulings mean he is unable to understand legal proceedings or work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa remains at the state mental hospital, where he is receiving treatment, and was not in the Boulder courtroom Friday. Relatives of those killed sat in the courtroom for the brief hearing while others watched online. District Court Judge Ingrid Bakke said Alissa’s latest evaluation Oct. 10 showed he that there was a substantial probability that he could be treated to be made competent in the “forseeable future,” echoing an outlook she first shared in March. When District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the victims’ families were frustrated with the state hospital and the doctors there, Bakke expressed sympathy, noting that there was not much either the defense or prosecution could do as Alissa underwent treatment. “It understandably is a very frustrating process,” said Bakke, who set another hearing to review Alissa’s condition for Jan. 27.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked a judge to throw out a nearly $1 billion verdict against him and order a new trial in a lawsuit by Sandy Hook families, who say they were subjected to harassment and threats from Jones’ lies about the 2012 Newtown school shooting. Jones filed the requests Friday, saying Judge Barbara Bellis’ pretrial rulings resulted in an unfair trial and “a substantial miscarriage of justice.” “Additionally, the amount of the compensatory damages award exceeds any rational relationship to the evidence offered at trial,” Jones’ lawyers, Norm Pattis and Kevin Smith, wrote in the motion. Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the 15 plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Jones, declined to comment on the filing Saturday but said he and other attorneys for the Sandy Hook families will be filing a brief opposing Jones’ request. Twenty first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School died in the attack on Dec. 14, 2012. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting and relatives of eight children and adults killed in the massacre sued Jones for defamation and infliction of emotional distress over his pushing the bogus narrative that the shooting was a hoax staged by “crisis actors” to impose more gun control.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A project decades in the making that promises to alleviate flooding issues in the low-income, low-lying neighborhood of Southbridge was unveiled Wednesday. The $26 million Southbridge Wilmington Wetlands Park was completed earlier this year, 16 years after initial work began and nearly a year after its expected completion because of delays in installing the gates that control the tidal flow within the wetlands. The project was funded through a mix of federal, state and local sources to restore a freshwater wetland and create a flood basin and open park space on contaminated, drained wetland bordered by A Street, Walnut Street and Garasches Lane in Wilmington. The park serves as recreation space as well as a stormwater management facility. Community leaders and elected officials said Wednesday that the project is a perfect example of environmental justice for a community of color surrounded by contaminated industrial sites and devastated by floods for decades. “It stores over 2 million gallons of stormwater that previously caused flooding in these homes back here,” said Wilmington Public Works Commissioner Kelly Williams, gesturing to homes along B Street in Southbridge. “It improves our water quality. As the stormwater traverses over a mile of wetland, it restores the tidal wetland with 62 different planted species.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University wrapped up its homecoming weekend celebration with a visit from Vice President Kamala Harris, a Howard alum, WUSA-TV reports. The nation’s first female and first Black vice president showed up at Sunday’s call to chapel, where she reflected on her time at Howard. “It’s a very special experience to be a student at the mecca,” she said. Howard University’s homecoming celebrations were back in person this year following two years of virtual celebrations due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: The most devastating storm in the city’s history wiped out the main nesting location for Harriet and M15, the famous North Fort Myers eagle couple whose lives are streamed across the globe during nesting season. “Their nest was completely demolished during Ian – not a stick left, and many of their foundational branches broke off,” said Virginia Pritchett McSpadden, whose family owns the land where the eagle nest is located. “After the storm passed, I remember having this gutted feeling that they were harmed, the trees had fallen, and they wouldn’t return to the area, but to my surprise … both eagles were spotted safe and already attempting to bring in new sticks. It brought tears to my eyes and I know to many others as well.” Losing the nest during September is actually good timing for the birds because there’s still time to rebuild and lay eggs this season. October is typically when bald eagles build and repair nests in South Florida. It’s also the time of year when the Pritchett family turns on the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam. There are actually multiple cameras that show different angles of the nest and branches on which the birds rest. The footage is streamed online to millions of viewers each year. But the camera system was damaged by Hurricane Ian as well, so it may be some time before their daily lives are streamed again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A trial to determine whether the state can continue to ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy began Monday in an Atlanta courtroom with testimony from an abortion provider who criticized the restriction and said it has created confusion. Carrie Cwiak, a gynecology professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and a plaintiff in the case, shared how women have reacted when she has explained that their pregnancy was past the time period when abortion is allowed under state law. “It’s upsetting,” she said. “It’s emotional.” Women have wondered aloud what they will do next, she said. Georgia’s law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many people know they are pregnant. The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable. Cwiak said the law, however, does not provide clear guidance about when doctors can intervene. The potential criminal penalty for an error is also chilling, she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Visitors fed pumpkins to elephants Sunday for the Honolulu Zoo’s “Ele-Fun” day, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: Officials with an Australian company’s newly opened cobalt mine in east-central Idaho say it could soon produce enough of the key ingredient in lithium batteries to build 400,000 electric vehicles annually. Officials with Jervois Global Limited held an opening ceremony this month at the remote, underground mine located in the Salmon River Mountains on federal land managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Officials said the mine will likely start operating at full capacity early in 2023, producing about 2,000 tons of cobalt. On its website, the company said it wants to “become the leading global supplier of responsibly sourced cobalt and nickel materials to serve both the battery and chemicals markets, and to provide a secure, reliable supply to customers in the face of geopolitical and other risks.” President Joe Biden in March directed the Defense Department to consider at least five metals – lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel and manganese – as essential to national security and authorized steps to bolster domestic supplies. U.S. officials want to reduce reliance on China and other countries for metals needed for electric vehicles and clean-energy storage systems. Gov. Brad Little said he toured the cobalt mine as part of the opening.\n\nIllinois\n\nStonington: A man killed last week in a central Illinois train accident has been identified as a worker who had been with a local grain cooperative for nearly a half-century, authorities said. Christian County coroner Amy Calvert Winans said Stephen “Steve” J. Jordan, 69, died Friday of multiple traumatic injuries, according to preliminary results of an autopsy performed Saturday. Legacy Grain Cooperative said in a post on its website that Jordan, who was from Moweaqua, had worked the co-op for 49 years. Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said Jordan was driving a rail car mover owned by the co-op when about noon Friday he crossed into the path of a Norfolk Southern engine pulling four empty cars. Jordan was pronounced dead at the accident scene. No one else was hurt in the incident, which occurred near Stonington, a village located about 20 miles southeast of Springfield.\n\nIndiana\n\nMount Vernon: More than 100 people gathered outside the city’s old courthouse on a breezy autumn Sunday to memorialize the deadliest recorded lynching of Black Hoosiers in state history. The somber ceremony capped off a months­long effort led by 17-year-old Sophie Kloppenburg, a Mount Vernon High School senior, to see a memorial honoring the slain men built on the courthouse lawn. It’s been a long time coming. One hundred and forty four years ago, in October 1878, a mob of white Posey County residents unleashed a torrent of racial violence after eight Black men were accused of raping three white women. The accused never received a trial. The mob ultimately shot, stabbed, hanged and burned to death seven men. Kloppenburg made it her mission to commemorate the lives lost when she learned of the lynchings from a family friend last year. After months of discussions with city and county leaders, and with the help of teachers, University of Southern Indiana historians and community members, Kloppenburg succeeded in securing the memorial’s place at the old courthouse. She spoke to a packed Hovey House on Sunday about the lynchings. “A mob watching African Americans hang has been replaced by a crowd watching us speak and lead,” Kloppenburg said as she recounted the events of October 1878.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A rural lawmaker wants to allow raccoons to be hunted year-round, saying their populations have grown too large, making them a nuisance. Republican state Rep. Dean Fisher plans to introduce legislation next year creating an open season on hunting for raccoons, opossums, skunks and groundhogs. Open season hunting already exists for coyotes, and a bill Fisher introduced during the last legislative session would have allowed hunting of those animals without prior state approval as well. It passed the Iowa House but stalled in the Senate. “There’s just no end of the problems with these critters. It’s just gotten out of control,” said Fisher, a retired engineer and farmer who lives in Montour. But unrestricted hunting is controversial. An open season “would cause more of these animals to die unnecessarily,” said Preston Moore, state director for the Humane Society of the United States, which opposed Fisher’s bill. “They’re native wildlife species and play an important role in a healthy and balanced ecosystem.” Wildlife in Iowa is held in the public trust, Moore said, and hunting should not be removed from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ oversight. “They should be managed for the benefit of all Iowans,” the Cedar Rapids resident said.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: An undersheriff in rural Kansas is facing a manslaughter trial for fatally shooting an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun, a case that comes amid a national reckoning on police violence. Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Virgil Brewer, who was with the Barber County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the deadly encounter with Steven Myers in October 2017 outside a shed in Sun City, about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A civil lawsuit brought by Myers’ family against Brewer and then-Barber County Sheriff Lonnie Small was settled in 2020 after county officials agreed to pay $3.5 million. Brewer’s criminal trial is expected to focus on whether his lack of knowledge and training with the less-lethal munitions amounted to reckless involuntary manslaughter. Defense attorney David Harger did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case. Brewer has been on unpaid leave since his 2018 arrest. He has been free pending trial. “The fact of the matter is that it is not going to be a good outcome for anybody, no matter whether or not he gets convicted,” Steven Myers’ widow, Kristina Myers, told the Associated Press on Thursday. “Yes, it will be over in that sense, but this one bad decision has ruined the lives of so many people.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky public school districts and private schools that own school buses can apply for funding through a program designed to reduce diesel emissions, Gov. Andy Beshear announced. The 2022 Kentucky Clean Diesel Grant Program will reimburse up to 25% of the cost of a replacement bus, the state Energy and Environment Cabinet said in a news release Wednesday. Grant recipients have to cover the remainder. The program will provide $310,643 toward replacing aging school buses. Diesel exhaust contains pollutants that negatively affect health, especially in children, the release said. Applicants in areas that don’t meet air quality standards, proposals that achieve the most cost-effective emission reductions and applications that demonstrate the greatest reductions in emissions will be given priority. The deadline to apply is Nov. 4, and projects must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023. Apply by visiting the Division for Air Quality’s website at https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Air/Pages/Clean-Diesel-Grant-Program.aspx.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state Supreme Court has suspended a Baton Rouge judge without pay for 180 days for abusing her power to hold people in contempt. East Baton Rouge Parish Family Court Judge Charlene Charet Day, who has held the seat since 2011, violated the law when she issued a bench warrant that resulted in a teacher being arrested at the school where she works, the high court ruled Friday. The Louisiana Judiciary Commission, which investigates complaints of judicial conduct, recommended the six-month suspension in July, finding that Day violated rules of conduct and committed “willful misconduct” when she locked up litigants for contempt of court. Day was directed to pay the commission a $6,260 fine. The justices unanimously agreed that a suspension was warranted, though one thought a less-severe penalty was required, The Advocate reports. “Judge Day’s conduct harmed the integrity of and respect for the judiciary,” Justice William Crain wrote in the prevailing opinion. “When a judge abuses the immense power to deprive a person of their liberty, it has a profound effect on public confidence in the judiciary.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A judge declined a request by developers of a $1 billion power line to resume construction, keeping the project on hold until a judge’s decision next year on the constitutionality of a referendum that halted the project. The judge on Friday rejected an injunction by the New England Clean Energy Connect and said the case is on a “fast track” for a trial in April. Developers suggested the project is at a “tipping point” where delays could cause Massachusetts, which is funding the project, to walk away. The project, which would supply enough Canadian hydropower for 1 million homes in New England, received regulatory approvals, but Maine voters rejected the project in a referendum after construction had begun. The proposal calls for a 145-mile power line from Canada into Maine, where it could connect to the regional power grid. Most if it would follow existing utility corridors, but new section had to be cut through 53 miles of woods to reach the Canadian border. Supporters say the project is a bold step in reducing carbon in the atmosphere and would moderate electric rates in the region. Critics say those benefits are overstated and must be weighed against destruction of woodland habitat.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A federal judge has postponed the trial of Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff. The Baltimore Sun reports that Roy McGrath asked the judge through his lawyer to postpone the trial because federal prosecutors had handed over more than 8,800 pages of evidence in recent weeks. McGrath briefly served as Hogan’s top adviser before resigning after a report in the newspaper detailed a severance payment he received from the government-owned nonprofit Maryland Environmental Service. McGrath also wants the opportunity to review the evidence in his case personally, his defense attorney, Joseph Murtha, said in court Thursday. But because he lives in Florida, he cannot look at discovery documents in the case while out of state, per an agreement with the prosecution. McGrath faces an eight-count federal indictment. Charges include wire fraud, including securing a $233,648 severance payment equal to one year of salary. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman did not immediately set a new trial date but said she would do so in the near future once all the parties were able to look at their calendars. The trial had been scheduled to begin this week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Canadian man has been arrested in connection with a series of bomb threats last month targeting several prominent locations in Boston, police said Monday. Joshua Kimble, 42, of Peterborough, Ontario, faces multiple charges in Canada, Boston police said in a statement. A series of threats were transmitted to Boston Children’s Hospital on Sept. 9, police said. Over the next four days, the Prudential Center shopping mall, the Orpheum Theater, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston Public Library all received threats, police said. All shared similar details and all appeared to have originated in Canada, police said. They did not disclose a motive. Boston police, working with the FBI and the Suffolk district attorney’s office, notified the Peterborough Police Service in Canada, which was granted an arrest warrant for the suspect and a search warrant for his home. Kimble is currently being held pending trial in Canada on 12 counts of public mischief and 12 counts of false information, police said. It could not immediately be determined if the suspect had an attorney. It was not clear when or if he would face charges in the U.S. No other details were provided.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors urged a jury Monday to convict three men for assisting the leaders of a plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor, saying they provided land, paramilitary training and inspiration for domestic terrorism in the months ahead of the 2020 U.S. election. Joe Morrison, Pete Musico and Paul Bellar were not charged with trying to abduct Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But their role was critical, according to authorities, who said the trio aligned themselves with key players and repeatedly endorsed the “boogaloo,” a term that became a code word for U.S. civil war. “The plan was hatched, nurtured here in Jackson County,” said state Assistant Attorney General Sunita Doddamani. “It’s really unmistakable what these men in this case did. They promoted terrorism. They sought out terrorists, and they found them and trained them.” The trial in state court in Jackson was an offshoot of the main case handled in federal court, where Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy. Two other men pleaded guilty, and two more were acquitted. The main charge is providing material support for a terrorist act, especially gun drills and ambush training with Fox at a rural property controlled by Morrison. Musico, Morrison’s father-in-law, also lived there.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Legislature should mandate that the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office proofread every county’s ballots before they’re mailed out, Republican challenger Kim Crockett said Thursday as she decried ballot printing errors in four counties. Crockett acknowledged that state law does not require the office to review the ballots of each precinct across the state for accuracy – that’s long been the responsibility of Minnesota’s counties. But she suggested that Democratic incumbent Steve Simon should have caught the errors anyway, since counties are required to mail copies to his office. “I think it’s a joint responsibility, certainly, between the secretary’s office and the counties, and this is something that I think the Legislature needs to step in and fix right away,” Crockett said at a news conference. Crockett has been a harsh critic in the campaign of how Simon stresses ease-of-voting. She repeated her earlier statement that the 2020 election was “rigged” against Donald Trump and called Simon’s moves to facilitate voting amid the pandemic “lawless and partisan.” She and other Republicans were especially upset with consent decrees that Simon entered into with groups seeking temporary changes, which courts approved.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: In a state where health officials expect 5,000 more births each year as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upending abortion rights, children are more likely to die before their first birthday than in any other state. Mississippi has the nation’s highest fetal mortality rate, highest infant mortality rate and highest pre-term birth rate and is among the worst states for maternal mortality. Black women are nearly three times more likely to die due to childbirth than white women in Mississippi. As the state’s Republican leaders led the legal fight against abortion, Gov. Tate Reeves said he would do everything in his power to make Mississippi the “safest state in the nation for an unborn child.” But access to prenatal and postnatal care has dwindled in Mississippi since the June ruling, making childbirth even more dangerous for poor women and children. The only neonatal intensive care unit in the state’s impoverished Delta region closed in July under financial pressures, moving lifesaving care for ill or premature newborn babies about two hours away by car. And now the publicly owned Greenwood Leflore Hospital has announced the permanent closure of its labor and delivery unit, saying it can’t pay competitive wages and retain experienced nurses. The area’s women will need to travel about 45 minutes to give birth at a hospital.\n\nMissouri\n\nWooldridge: Roughly half of a small town burned Saturday after a wildfire spread quickly from a farm field and destroyed or heavily damaged 23 buildings, officials said. No one died, and only one person was taken to a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, but the entire town of Wooldridge had to be evacuated Saturday because of the fire. The blaze was sparked in a field by a combine that was harvesting crops. A nearby stretch of Interstate 70 had to be closed for nearly two hours Saturday evening because of heavy smoke. Cooper County Fire District spokesman Jim Gann said Sunday that between 4.6 and 5.4 square miles burned before the fire was brought under control. Firefighters were working Sunday to keep hot spots under control with strong winds forecast in the afternoon. Wooldridge is a town of less than 100 people about 20 miles west of Columbia along the Missouri River. Stephen Derendinger, an engineer with the Jamestown Rural Fire Protection District, said half the town is burnt. “It’s devastated,” Derendinger said. Firefighters saved the Wooldridge Baptist Church, Wooldridge Community Club and post office as they pumped water from swimming pools to help battle the blaze.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Following extensive bargaining, Gov. Greg Gianforte and public employee unions last week reached an agreement for the state pay plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Covering the 2024-2025 biennium, the agreement includes wage increases, health benefit cost freezes, one-time payments and other contractual changes, according to the news release. It characterized the agreement as significant, the Daily Montanan reports. “This negotiated pay plan addresses challenges faced by state and higher education employees and will keep them doing important work for Montana,” said the news release. The governor and union leaders praised the agreement in statements from the governor’s office. “This agreement reflects our commitment to our hardworking state employees for all they do for Montanans,” Gianforte said in a statement. “As Montanans and all Americans face higher prices and historic inflation, this package will help ensure we retain and recruit qualified, dedicated public employees to serve Montanans.” The Montana Federation of Public Employees also lauded the negotiations, according to the news release. “This pay plan agreement is a testament to our bargaining team’s tireless commitment to their fellow MFPE members,” MFPE President Amanda Curtis said in a statement.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prairie fires pushed by tinder-dry conditions and winds topping 60 mph led to evacuations in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and destroyed homes and injured two firefighters south of Nebraska’s capital city, officials said. At least two grassland fires were first reported Sunday afternoon south of Lincoln and spread quickly as winds began to pick up and push the fires north, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office reported. The nearly 300 residents of Hallam, about 20 miles south of Lincoln, were ordered to evacuate their homes, and rural residents of southern Lancaster County and northern Gage County were urged to evacuate because of the fires. Officials also asked farmers to turn on irrigation pivots or other water sources to help combat the fires, which were contained by Sunday evening, with the help of rain showers that moved into the area. Officials said three homes and several outbuildings were destroyed in Lancaster County. Two firefighters also were injured, one seriously. Officials had not released their names or updated their medical conditions by early Monday morning. In southwestern Lancaster County, residents made plans to move cattle and other valuables to Christopher Smith’s farm south of the fires. “Everybody’s just trying to help out,” Smith said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A former Las Vegas-area politician has been indicted on a murder charge – which carries the possibility of the death penalty – in the killing of a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. Robert “Rob” Telles, 45, was indicted Thursday and scheduled for arraignment this Wednesday in Clark County District Court, according to court records. One of Telles’ court-appointed lawyers, Edward Kane, declined to comment about the indictment, a move by prosecutors that means Telles will not face a preliminary hearing of evidence that had been set for this week. Telles, 45, a Democrat, lost his party primary in June and has been stripped by court order of his position as Clark County Administrator, heading the office that handles assets of people who die without a will or family contacts. The state Supreme Court has suspended Telles’ law license pending a State Bar of Nevada investigation of allegations that he misappropriated client funds. He was arrested Sept. 7, several days after the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German outside German’s home. Telles is being held without bail at the Clark County jail. District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said he’ll make a decision in coming weeks whether Telles will face the death penalty.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The father of Harmony Montgomery, a girl who disappeared in 2019 at age 5 but was not reported missing until late last year, has been arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, authorities said Monday. He is accused of repeatedly striking her in the head with a closed fist that December. Other counts against Adam Montgomery, 32, include falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse between December 2019 and March 2020. Authorities did not say whether the girl’s body had been found. Montgomery, also is charged with tampering with a witness by attempting to cause his wife and Harmony’s stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, to provide false testimony. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Manchester. An attorney for Adam Montgomery did not immediately comment. “I do want to again express my deepest sympathies to Harmony’s family, friends and loved ones,” state Attorney General John Formella said at the news conference in Manchester. “We understand that today’s news, while significant for purposes of this investigation, is yet another difficult moment for those who loved Harmony and those who have followed this case.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNeptune: Nurses at Jersey Shore University Medical Center ratified a three-year contract that is expected to increase wages, keep veteran nurses on board and enhance security at the hospital, union officials said Sunday. The contract, approved three months before the current agreement was set to expire, could increase pay for many nurses by 8% to 11%, said Debbie White, president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union. “These workers have been adamant that working conditions must improve, and we are now on the right path,” White said. Jersey Shore University Medical Center, owned by Edison-based Hackensack Meridian Health, is the region’s biggest hospital, with 691 beds. Like its competitors, it has faced a series of challenges in recent years, including pressure from insurers to lower costs; a labor shortage; and COVID-19. In mid-September, the union released a survey of its members and found 79% said hospital management doesn’t take adequate steps to keep them safe; 58% didn’t feel safe working in the hospital; and 54% said they wouldn’t feel safe being treated there. Hackensack Meridian said the survey wasn’t scientific. It countered with a letter from Dr. Angelo Chinnici, who said he has worked with Jersey Shore University Medical Center for 40 years and entrusts his family’s care to Hackensack Meridian.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTaos: A judge has ruled five defendants are competent to stand trial more than four years after they were found in a squalid New Mexico compound with 11 malnourished children and the body of a young boy. But multiple motions filed by defense lawyers last week may slow the proceedings again. Taos County sheriff’s officials raided the compound in remote northern New Mexico in August 2018, saying they also discovered a firing range and firearms. In a second search days later, authorities reported recovering the decomposing remains of a 3-year-old boy from an underground tunnel. Authorities said the child was the son of one of the five adult suspects and had been reported missing by his mother in Georgia. All five members of the extended family are charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and providing material support to terrorists. Their attorneys said the defendants would not be facing terrorism-related charges if they were not Muslim. Albuquerque TV station KOB reports that defense lawyers filed motions last week trying to get the judge to drop all kidnapping charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City and state officials on Saturday announced new efforts to curb violence and other crimes on the city’s subway system, including increased police patrols, cameras and mental health help for those in need. Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, and other officials disclosed the new measures in the wake of more disturbing attacks in the system, including the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy on an A train in Queens earlier this month and the death of a man pushed in front of another Queens train during a dispute last Monday. Adams said that while crime in the city is down 4% since 2019 and down 17% from 10 years ago, many in the public don’t feel safer. He said the new efforts complement the subway safety plan he announced at the beginning of the year. “We can give you stats all day,” he said. “The question is, how do New Yorkers feel? We must match the actual impacts with how New Yorkers feel on the streets and in the subway system.” Adams and Hochul said police with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be taking primary responsibility for patrolling subway stations adjacent and linked to the four major commuter rail hubs – Penn Station and Grand Central Station in Manhattan, Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and Sutphin-Archer Station in Queens.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWhiteville: A suspended sheriff has resigned in the aftermath of a leaked audio recording in which he called Black employees by derogatory names and said they should be fired, his attorney announced Monday. Attorney Michael Mills made the announcement during a hearing on whether Jody Greene, who was elected Columbus County sheriff in 2018, should be removed from office, according to news outlets. “Jody Greene loves Columbus County and does not want to put the people he has served through this ordeal,” Mills told Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Douglas Sasser. The announcement prompted applause from some in the courtroom, The News & Observer reports. District Attorney Jon David had sought Greene’s removal alleging that he had engaged in racial profiling of employees both personally and through those under his command, WECT-TV reports. Sasser suspended Greene earlier this month until Monday’s hearing on the petition for removal. The rest of the hearing was called off and David, the district attorney for Bladen, Brunswick and Columbus counties, said it was no longer necessary due to Greene’s resignation. David has said that he asked the State Bureau of Investigation to probe allegations of obstruction of justice within the sheriff’s office. That investigation is ongoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Unless oil prices increase dramatically in the remaining days of October, North Dakota’s treasury won’t be banking the benefits of a tax increase on drillers that has bumped state tax collections by $120 million since June, the state tax commissioner said Monday. The increase in state oil tax collections was possible because of a state law that adjusts North Dakota’s oil extraction tax when the three-month average price of a barrel of oil went above a specified “trigger” price of $94.69. Oil prices have fallen well below the benchmark in recent weeks, and will almost certainly wipe the increased tax off the books Nov. 1, North Dakota Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. “Unless there is a significant geopolitical event or supply disruption of some sort, it will revert back,” Kroshus said. The monthly averages are figured using West Texas Intermediate prices, the U.S. benchmark set at Cushing, Oklahoma. WTI crude was fetching below $85 a barrel Monday morning, and the average has been below the price trigger since August. Oil prices would have average above $110 a barrel for the remainder of October to keep the trigger in place, Kroshus said. North Dakota has two primary taxes on oil production – a production tax and an extraction tax, the latter of which was part of an initiated measure voters approved in 1980.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Franklin County commissioners are accusing the state’s top election official of making them spend hundreds of thousands of county taxpayer dollars for election security. A directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office requires county boards of elections to implement new security standards as it continues to investigate claims of voter fraud from the 2020 presidential election, claims that it has acknowledged are largely unfounded. In Franklin County, officials say the directive requires swapping out physical security locks and keys with keycard access, electronic monitoring systems and new security cameras for areas that house voting machines, poll pads and other election equipment. The commissioners, all Democrats, reluctantly approved a request from the county elections office for $375,000 to complete the state-mandated upgrades – but not without expressing their frustration with LaRose, a Republican, who has been endorsed by and has rallied with ex-President Donald Trump, who continues to publicly deny the results of the 2020 elections while privately acknowledging that he lost. “The security measures are important and critical,” Commissioner Kevin Boyce said. “It’s just frustrating to get such a strong mandate, such a costly mandate, when we’ve been asking for so many things to help ensure voter access and engagement and just not getting any cooperation from them on that.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: As the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma works to help people hurt by rising costs of food and other necessities, the organization itself is confronting the effects of high inflation. Supply chain issues driven by labor shortages and equipment availability have reduced the variety of food products and lengthened the lead time on deliveries. Before the pandemic, food orders would be delivered within two to three weeks; it is now eight to 10 weeks. The organization is experiencing persistent hikes of 15% to 25% in costs of food plus freight. “Inflation is touching everything, and the supply chain issues are only compounding that impact both in costs and in food availability,” said Caleb Dixon, chief operations officer for the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. According to a new poll, inflation has forced 60% of Oklahoma voters to cut spending on essentials like groceries and on discretionary items like travel. The poll, by Amber Integrated, of Oklahoma City, shows only 17% of the 500 voters surveyed haven’t cut back. A majority in most age groups have cut back on groceries, travel, entertainment and dining out. The biggest percentages by age of people cutting back were those between 40 and 49 and those 70 and older.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A U.S. Forest Service employee was arrested last week by a county sheriff after a planned burn in a national forest spread onto private land. It was the latest episode that underscores simmering tensions over management of federal lands in rural, conservative eastern Oregon. That tension exploded into the 2016 takeover by armed right-wing extremists of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland. One of the extremist leaders was killed by law enforcement officers at a roadblock. Rick Snodgrass, the U.S. Forest Service “burn boss,” was arrested Wednesday and transported to the Grant County Jail, where he was conditionally released, District Attorney Jim Carpenter said in a statement. Carpenter warned that Snodgrass’ federal employment “will not protect him if it is determined that he acted recklessly.” “That the USFS was engaging in a prescribed burn may actually raise, rather than lower the standard to which Snodgrass will be held,” the prosecutor said. Prescribed burns are set intentionally and under carefully controlled conditions to clear underbrush, pine needle beds and other surface fuels that make forests more prone to wildfires.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city is asking a judge to force the state’s Department of Human Services to take custody of more than 70 juveniles sentenced in court to state rehabilitation programs, hoping to alleviate what it says is dangerous overcrowding at the city’s holding facility. In the lawsuit filed Friday, city attorneys said the state has refused to prioritize transferring juveniles from the overcrowded juvenile justice center. The city is asking a judge to mandate that the state take the sentenced juveniles within 20 days and either contract with a private or public facility or open a state-run facility to handle the increase in youths being sentenced to state centers. Workers from Philadelphia’s juvenile facility spoke last week at a City Council hearing about worsening conditions at the center that’s designed to temporarily hold up to 184 youths between the ages of 10 and 17 who are awaiting court proceedings. But as of last Friday, the lawsuit said the center had reached 223 juveniles – 74 of whom had been sentenced to state facilities and were awaiting transfer. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services declined to comment on the litigation Monday. In a statement issued after the City Council hearing last week, department officials said the state’s facilities are also at capacity.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: For the first time, authorities have detected a highly contagious form of avian flu in domestic birds in the state. The state Department of Environmental Management on Friday euthanized a small, backyard flock of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys on a farm in Newport County after confirming that some had been infected with a strain of influenza that has spread throughout much of the country in recent months and led to the deaths of millions of birds. It’s not the first case of the strain of flu in Rhode Island. That occurred in July when a great black-backed gull found seriously ill on a South Kingstown beach tested positive for the virus. But the Newport County case is the first confirmation of the virus in a domestic flock. Environmental authorities have been warning of the virus since last winter, when the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread from Europe and Central Asia to North America. Since then, more than 47 million domestic birds in 43 states have died from the virus or had to be killed after being exposed to infection. While there have been other waves of bird flu in the past, this is the largest outbreak in the nation of a variant of the virus. And the number of fatalities is soon expected to exceed the total in the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015-16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s first-ever round of early voting for the general election started Monday with no problems at the polls, but a state website where people go to check voting locations or get a sample ballot crashed. Technicians were working to fix the South Carolina Election Commission’s website at scvotes.org, agency spokesman Chris Whitmire said. In the meantime, voters can look at their ballot choices before heading to the polls at a different site. The agency’s website is not linked to the state’s voting system, Whitmire said. This is the first year South Carolina is allowing voters to cast ballots in person early without having an excuse as to why they can’t vote on Election Day. Polls are open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Nov. 5. There were a smaller number of polling places opened for early voting during the June primaries, and only a few minor problems were reported. Over the past several elections, South Carolina has allowed people to cast absentee ballots in person, but they had to include an excuse for why they could not be at the polls on Election Day. The law passed this year has South Carolina returning to mail-in absentee ballots.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Fernson Brewing Company and South Dakota State University have collaborated to create a premium beer called Ears Up. The beer will hit the shelves in the Brookings market Tuesday. On Saturday, when South Dakota State hosts Indiana State for Hobo Day, the beer will be available inside the stadium. That’s thanks to a new change in the policy of the state’s Board of Regents, which allows state schools to sell beer to the general public. “As a 2008 graduate of South Dakota State, it’s a bit surreal and deeply humbling to be able to create something for my alma mater,” Fernson co-founder Derek Fernholz said in a press release. “We are so proud of the beer we have crafted, together with SDSU, to be enjoyed by Jackrabbits everywhere. This has been one of our largest undertakings to date, and working with the amazing people at South Dakota State University has truly been (an) honor and a great collaborative effort. We cannot wait to see how this project grows and evolves for years to come.” The beer is billed as an “easy-drinking and smooth premium beer with 5% alcohol by volume.” After beers hit the shelves in Brookings, Ears Up will become available in Sioux Falls and distributors who serve across the state including Rapid City, Mitchell, Watertown, Huron, Aberdeen and Pierre.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis and Memphis International Airport are co-hosting an exhibit depicting the civil rights movement in Fayette County through the photographs of freelance photographer Art Shay. The photographs will be displayed in the airport’s terminal for departing flights, across from the TSA office, through next October. The public will be able to view the exhibit without purchasing a ticket or going through the TSA security checkpoints. Established in 1996 by civil rights activist and former NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks, the Hooks Institute seeks to promote civil rights and social change through multiple avenues, including education, research and community engagement. Shay worked as a photographer and writer after serving in World War II. His work has appeared in Life, Time and Sports Illustrated magazines. For more than five decades, Shay photographed some of the 20th century’s most intriguing figures, from Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to President John F. Kennedy. The photographer was also fascinated with the happenings of everyday life, leading him to take an interest in photographing the efforts of the civil rights movement, including in Fayette County in the 1960s.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge has dismissed illegal voting charges against a Houston man who stood in line six hours to cast a ballot in the 2020 presidential primary and became a figure over Republican efforts to tighten election laws. The decision last week followed a wider ruling in Texas that limits the state’s power to prosecute voting fraud cases, which has drawn backlash from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders. Hervis Rogers, who in March 2020 did not leave a polling center at a historically Black college until about 1:30 a.m., had faced charges that carried a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. He had voted while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Rogers said he did not know he was ineligible to cast a ballot when he got in line at Texas Southern University, where reporters had interviewed him and other voters who expressed anger and frustration over the long wait. The charges against Rogers were brought by the office of Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has promoted baseless claims of widespread election fraud and challenged the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, entirely comprised of elected Republicans judges, upheld last month that the state cannot unilaterally prosecute election fraud cases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democratic state Sen. Gene Davis resigned Wednesday, hours after legislators from both parties demanded he step aside and leadership stripped him of committee assignments. Davis’ resignation ends a saga that began in August after a former intern posted on Instagram claims that Davis, 77, had inappropriately touched her, including her toes and waist, in multiple instances in their workplace. In his resignation letter, posted on Twitter by the state Senate, Davis said he would resign effective Nov. 19, following the election and scheduled date of interim committee meetings. Davis, who has served six terms in office, is not on the ballot after he was defeated in the Democratic Party’s June primary. His resignation follows public demands from Senate President Stuart Adams and Davis’ colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus that Davis resign. An independent investigation commissioned by legislative leaders determined that it was “more likely than not” that Davis invaded former intern Sonia Weglinski’s personal space, likely violating the Legislature’s Workplace Discrimination and Harassment policy. It found her allegations to be more credible than Davis’ recollections and accused him of not being forthcoming or completely honest.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: Organizers of the Champlain Valley Fair have announced the first grandstand concert for the 2023 fair, more than 10 months before the summer show will take place. Country star Riley Green, known for hits including “There Was This Girl” and “I Wish Grandpas Never Died,” will play the Champlain Valley Exposition grounds Sunday, Sept. 3. Tickets for Green’s concert go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday. The Champlain Valley Fair, an annual 10-day event in Essex Junction, draws thousands of visitors a year for animals on display as well as rides, games and food on the midway, but the grandstand concerts are a perennial attraction. This year’s performances included rapper Nelly, Celtic rockers The Dropkick Murphys, ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and country performer Scotty McCreery.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin continued to raise funds at a quick clip over the past three months, outpacing his recent predecessors, while also traveling the country building his national profile and boosting midterm candidates. The Republican’s Spirit of Virginia political action committee raised nearly $1.8 million in cash over the July-to-September quarter, spent about $1.1 million and ended the quarter with about $2.3 million on hand, according to campaign finance disclosures filed this month. The governor, increasingly viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, far outraised any other Virginia official’s leadership committee during that timeframe, and the strong receipts are a continuation of a trend: the political newcomer’s combination of fundraising and loans to his campaign during his race last year against Democrat Terry McAuliffe shattered records set in the 2017 gubernatorial campaign. Youngkin also brought in big bucks post-election and for his inauguration. In his first two full quarters in office, he raised more than twice as much as his three most recent predecessors in donations of $10,000 of more, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project, which tracks money in politics.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The payroll premiums on workers’ wages to pay for the state’s paid family and medical leave program will increase Jan. 1. The state’s Employment Security Department announced Thursday that the rate will increase from 0.6% to 0.8% of wages to keep pace with the number of people using the program, with most of the share continuing to be paid by employees. The premium increase comes just weeks after an analysis of the financial health of Washington state’s paid family leave program estimated the fund would hit an $8.7 million deficit by the end of the year. The actuarial analysis by the consulting firm Milliman that was recently presented to a legislative task force showed that the current premium rate is not keeping up with demand for the state benefit that launched in 2020 and it recommended increasing the rate. When premiums first were enacted, 0.4% of workers’ wages funded the program, with 63% paid by employees and 37% paid by employers. An increase to 0.6% had already gone into effect earlier this year, and employees’ share increased to about 73%, with the remainder paid by employers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMartinsburg: Clorox has opened a new cat litter plant that is expected to create more than 100 new jobs. The company said the Martinsburg facility officially opened Friday, with plans to bring $190 million into the local economy. The facility is in a West Virginia Eastern Panhandle community that includes suburbs of Washington. The plant is expected to reach full capacity by early next year. The project includes a 97,000-square-foot main building and 450,000 square feet offsite at a warehouse. The facility will produce Fresh Step and Scoop Away litter. Gov. Jim Justice, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and staff for U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin joined company officials for Friday’s opening ceremony. Clorox now has three facilities in West Virginia, including Kingsford brand charcoal plants in Mineral and Tucker counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: In a trial marked by persistent disruptions, what was expected to be the final day of testimony Monday was marred by more outbursts and interruptions from Darrell Brooks Jr., which once again resulted in his removal from the courtroom. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow ruled Brooks, who is acting as his own attorney, forfeited his rights to call any more witnesses or testify as a result of his behavior after attempting multiple times to determine whether he intended to testify on his own behalf. Closing arguments are tentatively scheduled for Tuesday. Brooks, 40, of Milwaukee, is charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide, 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety, six counts of hit-and-run causing death, two counts of bail jumping, all felonies in connection to the 2021 Waukesha Christmas Parade tragedy, and one count of misdemeanor battery.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Three school districts around the state have been selected for a pilot program aimed at addressing teacher shortages through paid apprenticeships, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Districts in Laramie, Teton and Fremont counties will be the first to try the program to recruit and train educators, and other schools may be able to join the effort in 2024, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/16/casa-bonita-mypillow-poke-banksy-exhibit-news-around-states/118354866/", "title": "Casa Bonita, MyPillow poke: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The Rocket City has overtaken the Magic City as Alabama’s largest, according to new census numbers. Huntsville, with a population of 215,006, is now slightly more populous than Birmingham, according to U.S. census numbers released Thursday. Birmingham, which had long been Alabama’s largest city, has a population of 200,733. And the capital, Montgomery, is biting at its heels in third, with 200,603 residents. However, the Birmingham metro area remains the largest in the state. The Birmingham-Hoover metro statistical area has 1.1 million people, while the Huntsville metro area has just 491,723. Huntsville, with historical ties to the space industry, has seen rapid growth over the past ten years, partly fueled by the tech and manufacturing sectors. The city’s population has jumped by 19% since 2010. “I’m proud that the great things we have going on in Huntsville have grown our city,” Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle wrote in a tweet. “To tell the truth, we’re more focused on being the best than the biggest.” Birmingham got the nickname the Magic City for its rapid growth and had long been Alabama’s largest city. Much of the recent growth around Birmingham has been concentrated in the surrounding suburban areas, rather than in the city itself.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is spending two days in the state traveling with Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski to showcase what Granholm’s office calls Alaska’s status as “America’s living laboratory.” The visit coincides with the recent passage of the bipartisan infrastructure deal and is intended to show how investments and research and development funding “will bring jobs and help build the state’s clean, secure energy future,” Granholm’s office said. The visit started Sunday in Fairbanks with a tour of the National Renewable Energy Lab’s Cold Climate Housing Research Center, highlighting its training of a local workforce to build and rapidly deploy shelter for climate-threatened communities in an effort to reduce the need for relocation. Also on Sunday’s agenda was a tour of the Permafrost Tunnel Research Facility and the Chena Hot Springs Renewable Energy Fair. On Monday, plans call for visiting the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, where researchers are developing ways to achieve 100% renewable power for rural villages. In Anchorage, Granholm and Murkowski will speak with Malcolm Woolf, president of the National Hydropower Association. The visit is set to conclude with a meeting with Alaska Native engineering students and alumni.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A coalition of educators, parents and advocates for children is asking a judge to overturn several new state laws that restrict the power of local governments and school districts to impose COVID-19 requirements, arguing the statutes violate constitutional rules and pointing out the state is seeing a growing number of coronavirus cases among children. A new lawsuit filed Thursday against the state by the Arizona School Boards Association, a teacher’s union and others challenges a law that prohibits cities, counties and public school districts from imposing mask requirements on students and teachers. At least 11 districts accounting for 140,000 students and more than 200 schools have defied the law by imposing their own mask rules. The coalition also is seeking to overturn a law prohibiting colleges and universities from requiring COVID-19 shots for students and making them reveal their vaccination status, as well as another statute that forbids communities from establishing vaccine passports for people to show they were inoculated. The lawsuit argues elements of the legislative proposals with limits on local government had violated constitutional rules requiring laws to focus on only one subject and have their contents reflected in the title of the bills.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Most public school students in the state will be required to wear masks when classes begin this week, following moves by dozens of districts in response to a judge blocking Arkansas’ mask mandate ban. At least 60 public school districts and charter schools have approved the requirements in the past week. The pace at which districts have approved the mandates surprised even public health experts who say masks are needed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, especially as the ultra-contagious delta variant fuels a surge in cases and hospitalizations. “I think those actions are going to prevent some superspreader events that would have occurred,” said Dr. Joe Thompson, president and CEO of the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. Some form of mask mandate has been approved in the state’s 10 largest school districts. The biggest, Springdale, approved a requirement but only for students in kindergarten through seventh grade. The Little Rock School Board, which sued over the state’s mandate ban, voted Thursday to require masks be worn indoors by students and staff. Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge announced Friday that she’s appealing Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox’s Aug. 6 preliminary injunction against the mandate ban. Fox ruled the ban violated the Arkansas Constitution.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: A McDonald’s franchise has settled a lawsuit by employees who said the owner gave them masks made from dog diapers and coffee filters to guard against the coronavirus. Thursday’s settlement requires the owner to provide masks and gloves to all workers and provide other health and safety measures required by a judge last year, such as regular temperature checks. The franchise owner didn’t acknowledge any wrongdoing in the settlement. The measures will remain in place for a year unless government health agencies no longer recommend them. The Telegraph Avenue outlet shut down for a month beginning in May 2020 after 20 workers refused to show up, contending that 25 workers and their families, including a baby, had come down with the coronavirus. After the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020, employees asked for masks but received dog diapers and coffee filters as a stopgap measure, and when they eventually received masks intended for one-time use, they had to wear them for several days, the employees alleged. Three of the employees who sued also alleged that they were required to work despite having COVID-19 symptoms, and all later tested positive for the virus.\n\nColorado\n\nLakewood: The creators of the irreverent animated television series “South Park” are buying Casa Bonita, a quirky restaurant in suburban Denver that was featured on the show. Matt Stone and Trey Parker said in an interview with Gov. Jared Polis on Friday that they had come to an agreement with the current owners of the restaurant, which closed to diners in March 2020 as the pandemic took hold. It declared bankruptcy in the spring. “We’re excited to work with everybody and make it the place we all want to make it,” Parker said. The Lakewood restaurant has been in business since 1974 but gained wider recognition when it was featured on a 2003 “South Park” episode and when the Denver Broncos announced some of their draft picks there in 2018. The Mexican restaurant is known for its decor, which includes a pink facade and large indoor waterfall, as well as its cliff divers and skits that feature an excitable actor in a gorilla costume. But some have noted there is room for improvement. “The one area that we would all love to see an upgrade – and I think I speak on behalf of everybody who patronizes Casa Bonita – is the food could be a little better,” Polis said. “I think it could be a little more than a little better,” Stone added.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Shoppers are getting a one-week tax break. The state’s annual Sales Tax Free Week, which began Sunday and runs through Aug. 21, exempts retail purchases of most clothing and footwear priced under $100 from Connecticut’s 6.35% sales and use tax. The exemption applies to each eligible item costing less than $100, regardless of how many of those items a customer purchases. The sales tax holiday, which costs the state about $5 million in lost tax revenue, applied to clothing and footwear costing less than $300 per item in past years and was ultimately scaled back. However, many retailers are expected to offer additional discounts during the week, which is a popular time for back-to-school shopping. Connecticut Retail Merchants Association President Timothy G. Phelan said the week gives residents an opportunity to save money and also “reconnect with local retail businesses that have endured the business challenges of the past year and a half,” referring to the pandemic. “The COVID-19 economy this year has put retail businesses, particularly smaller independent retailers, under increasing pressure just to stay in business and to stay in business here in Connecticut,” Phelan told state lawmakers earlier this year during a public hearing.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: To enter Firefly Music Festival, guests will have to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours, the festival’s owner announced late last week. The policy will be in place for all events and venues operated by AEG Presents, which purchased Firefly in 2018. “We have come to the conclusion that, as a market leader, it was up to us to take a real stand on vaccination status,” AEG Presents CEO Jay Marciano said in a statement, citing the virus’s delta variant and vaccine hesitancy that have pushed statistics “in the wrong direction again” in recent weeks. In the past month, COVID-19 cases have quintupled in Delaware. “We realize that some people might look at this as a dramatic step, but it’s the right one,” Marciano said. “We also are aware that there might be some initial pushback, but I’m confident and hopeful that, at the end of the day, we will be on the right side of history and doing what’s best for artists, fans, and live event workers.” Firefly officials previously said the festival will be limited to 50,000 people for each day of its four days, Sept. 23-26. According to AEG’s website, its festivals will accept a physical copy of a COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card or a digital copy of the card for proof of vaccination. Masks are strongly encouraged, the website says.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A military base in the nation’s capital was locked down for about two hours Friday, causing a brief panic, after an armed man ran onto the grounds during a local police investigation of gunshots on the surrounding streets. A statement from Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling said the man’s firearm was discovered after the intrusion, and the intruder himself was detained about 2:45 p.m. during “a thorough sweep of the installation.” The individual, who was not named, was transferred to Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department. The naval support facility at the north end of the base is used by Marine Helicopter Squadron One, the fleet of green helicopters that carry the president and vice president. Col. Mike Zuhlsdorf, the base commander, credited the “thorough and coordinated response” among multiple agencies, including MPD and the Secret Service, with helping to swiftly control the situation. “I remain confident in our security posture,” Zuhlsdorf said in a statement. The 905-acre base in southeast Washington houses Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard units, along with the Washington field office of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the headquarters of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: The University of Florida will open its upcoming semester with in-person classes, reversing itself within hours of telling students the term might begin online because of the state’s renewed COVID-19 outbreak. UF administrators sent an email to students Friday afternoon telling them that after consulting with university epidemiologists, plans were being made to put the first three weeks of school online. But then a few hours later, a second email went out announcing that classes would be conducted in person. No reason was given for the reversal, but UF said in a statement that no schools in the state university system would be conducting classes online. The university is not requiring vaccines or mask-wearing but is recommending both. In an email to students last week, administrators wrote that they “cannot modify the operation of the entire university for a minority of people who may choose not to be vaccinated.” Gov. Ron DeSantis is strongly opposed to vaccine and mask mandates, saying those decisions should be left to each person. He has encouraged vaccination but has stopped wearing masks in public. The state averaged almost 22,000 newly confirmed cases per day last week, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, up from about 1,500 per day in mid-June and blowing past last year’s highs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service is pushing back after a U.S. government report recommended approval of a launch pad for commercial rockets on the Georgia coast, saying a chance of explosive misfires over a federally protected island popular with tourists and campers poses an “unacceptable risk.” Camden County in Georgia’s coastal, southeast corner has spent nine years and $10 million seeking permission to build what would be the nation’s 13th licensed commercial spaceport. The proposed Spaceport Camden took a big step forward in June, when the Federal Aviation Administration issued a final environmental impact study that concluded building the spaceport would be its “preferred alternative.” Now the Park Service and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of the Interior, are disputing the FAA’s conclusion that the spaceport poses minimal risks or adverse impacts to Cumberland Island, a federally protected wilderness. The island, known for wild horses and nesting sea turtles, is managed by the Park Service and draws about 60,000 visitors each year. In a July 22 letter to the FAA, the Interior Department said the final study on the spaceport’s impacts noted that a failed launch could result in “fires, explosions, or releases of propellants or other hazardous materials.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Two visitors from the U.S. mainland were arrested for allegedly using fake vaccine cards to travel into the state. Officials with the Hawaii Attorney General’s office arrested the visitors at Honolulu’s international airport, a spokesman for the agency said in a statement. Investigators said the two were in violation of the state’s travel rules, which require travelers to produce either a negative coronavirus test or proof of COVID-19 vaccination to avoid quarantine when entering the state. Violating the state’s COVID-19 mandates, including falsifying a vaccination card, is a misdemeanor that can result in a fine of up to $5,000, up to a year in prison or both. The visitors were arraigned Wednesday after being arrested over the prior weekend. Authorities responded to a tip from a community member. “Attorney General investigators are committed to ensuring all such leads are investigated and thank the community for their assistance and support,” the AG’s office said. The agency said that while there may be other cases pending with other Hawaii law enforcement divisions, this was the first arrest by the Department of the Attorney General for allegedly falsifying vaccination cards.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s budget surplus is up to $1.4 billion, officials said Friday. The Idaho Division of Financial Management said it based the increase on a revised general fund revenue forecast it does every August for the current fiscal year to account for economic conditions and law changes. The agency said the surplus comes from a nearly $900 million ending balance for fiscal year 2021, which ended June 30, combined with another $513 million more than the forecast used by lawmakers to set the state’s budget last May for the current fiscal year, 2022, which ends next summer. The agency also said revenue collections were nearly $40 million more than anticipated in July, the first month of the current fiscal year. State officials said the $1.4 billion surplus could change based on monthly revenue collections. Budget setting for fiscal year 2021 occurred before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and state officials feared a big deficit. But the state received billions of dollars in coronavirus rescue money, and many Idaho residents and businesses received pandemic aid. Federal money was also used to boost unemployment benefits. In addition, Idaho has been one of the fastest-growing states, with new residents bringing in additional money.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An exhibit of more than 80 works by the graffiti artist known publicly only as Banksy has come to the Windy City. “The Art of Banksy” opened Saturday and runs through Oct. 31 in a shuttered, 45,000-square-foot broadcast communications museum. The pieces – which include canvases, prints and sculptures – are from private collections. Stencils by the street artist have appeared on the walls of buildings – even a British prison, bridges and streets across the globe. Some of his most recognizable stencils and murals include “Flower Thrower,” “Rude Copper,” “Girl with Balloon” and “I Remember When All This Was Trees.” Earlier this year, a Banksy painting honoring health workers in the pandemic sold at auction for more than $23 million. Titled “Game Changer,” the work first appeared on a wall at Southampton General Hospital in southern England in May 2020. The black-and-white picture depicts a young boy sitting on the floor playing with a nurse superhero toy, as Batman and Spiderman toy figures lie in a wastepaper basket next to him. At the time it went up, the hospital said Banksy left a note for workers there saying: “Thanks for all you’re doing. I hope this brightens the place up a bit, even if it’s only black and white.”\n\nIndiana\n\nChesterton: The National Park Service wants to charge entrance fees for the first time at the Indiana Dunes National Park, citing a dramatic increase in visitors in recent years and the need for more revenue for park maintenance. The federal agency will hold an online public meeting on the proposed fees via Zoom on Wednesday, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. CDT. If approved, the fees would begin March 31, 2022. The northwest Indiana park has seen a surge in visitors during the past two years, and the new fees would help finance park maintenance, public safety and programming, officials said. “The value of public open spaces has been underscored during the COVID pandemic,” Park Superintendent Paul Labovitz said in a statement. The proposed entrance fees include $15 per person for people walking, bicycling or boating into the park, or $20 for motorcyclists. A commercial motor coach fee would be $100. The other fees would be a $25 seven-day pass for vehicles and a $45 annual pass. Among the other new entrance fees, the Park Service proposes adding six backcountry campsites that would cost $25 per night, with a limit of eight campers. The 15,000-acre park along Lake Michigan’s southern shore, about 50 miles east of Chicago, became Indiana’s first national park in February 2019.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Iowa’s Ethics Board has found that Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds didn’t violate any laws when she appeared in a series of taxpayer-funded ads last fall promoting coronavirus public safety measures. The Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board voted unanimously Thursday to find Reynolds did not violate a 2018 state law that prohibits statewide elected officials from using public funds for self-promotion. Iowa State Auditor Rob Sand had accused Reynolds of the ethical violation, saying the ad campaign she launched in November was used to promote her own image when she appeared in several of the ads encouraging mask-wearing. Sand, a Democrat, had said the ad campaign was funded with money intended to pay for expanded testing capacity for the coronavirus and improve collection and reporting of data about the pandemic. He also said Reynolds’ office didn’t seek federal approval to spend the money on an ad campaign until after it was announced and well after his office requested invoices for the spending. On Thursday, the Ethics Board found that the law includes an exception for when a governor proclaims a disaster emergency, which Reynolds had done for the pandemic. Sand said the ruling declared “open season” on using taxpayer money for politicians’ self-promotion.\n\nKansas\n\nLeavenworth: The CoreCivic Leavenworth Detention Center has been on lockdown for more than a week and a half after an inmate died from injuries he suffered in a fight, officials said Friday. Scott W. Wilson, 39, was kicked, punched and struck with a tray Aug. 2. He suffered a broken rib and punctured lung and died two days later, said Maj. Dan Nicodemus, deputy chief of the Leavenworth Police Department. Another inmate, a 28-year-old man, has been identified as a suspect, but no charges were filed as of Friday afternoon. The Leavenworth Detention Center houses pretrial detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service. Ryan Gustin, spokesman for CoreCivic, said in an email that the detention center was placed on lockdown Aug. 3, and the lockdown was still in place Friday. Detention center officials are working with U.S. Marshals to determine when normal operations will resume, he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State tourism officials are offering a new incentive for residents to get vaccinated. The initiative called Vax and Visit launched Thursday and allows permanent Kentucky residents who have received at least one COVID-19 vaccination to enter drawings for travel incentives at state parks, said Tourism, Arts and Heritage Secretary Mike Berry. There will be 30 drawings for gift certificates that will include golf rounds, overnight lodging and campground stays, he said. The drawings also raise awareness of how Kentucky residents can get vaccinated, officials said. “Offering vaccine incentives to Kentucky state parks will not only boost travel revenue in local communities but also ensure that Kentucky continues to be seen as a safe travel destination post-pandemic,” Berry said. Winners will be selected beginning Sept. 9, and the final drawing will take place Oct. 7.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The French Quarter Festival, in which thousands crowd the streets of the historic New Orleans neighborhood to listen to brass bands, zydeco and other music, has become the latest victim of the state’s fourth coronavirus surge. Festival organizers announced Friday that they were canceling the festival, which had been slated for Sept. 30-Oct. 2. Other events such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival have already canceled events slated for this summer and fall. The event will return to the French Quarter on April 21-24 of next year, organizers said Friday. The Festivals Acadiens et Creoles, which takes place in Lafayette, is also being canceled for this fall, organizers announced. That festival had been slated for Oct. 8-10 and instead will take place March 18-20 of next year. Louisiana has set new daily records for the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 for two weeks. Ninety-one percent of those hospitalized are unvaccinated, according to state health department data. Only 38% of Louisiana’s population is inoculated, putting it among the bottom five states in the nation, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the number of people seeking their first shot has increased dramatically over the past month.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s congressional delegation wants the Federal Communications Commission to keep Maine a one-area-code state. All of the Pine Tree State is served by the 207 area code. The four members of the delegation said 207 phone numbers are projected to run out by 2024 if the FCC doesn’t take action, and that would necessitate the creation of a second area code in the state. The delegation told the FCC on Thursday that the 207 area code is “both a cultural touchstone and a matter of efficiency.” It also said adding another area code could be a problem for businesses because so many leave the 207 area code out when posting a phone number or relaying a message. The Maine Public Utilities Commission recently asked the FCC to let Maine try a method that allocates numbers one at a time to phone providers rather than allocating them in large blocks. The congressional delegation said it strongly supports that request, which it said could help maintain the solo area code.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Police officials have told all employees they cannot collect overtime pay while on paid vacation, a practice the department says costs the city an average of $300,000 per year. Shallah Graham, the department’s chief financial officer, told City Council members last week that the agency won’t let employees file for overtime pay in addition to vacation pay, The Baltimore Sun reports. A previous payroll system allowed this practice of “double dipping” without a way to identify when it happened, but Graham said a new system has greater transparency. Before an investigation by the newspaper, the department spent nearly $50 million a year in overtime, according to department budget records. The investigation showed many officers made tens of thousands of dollars in paid overtime, including five who logged more than 2,000 hours of overtime each in a single year. While the practice didn’t violate any city policy, the Inspector General’s Office reported last month that “it could be perceived as wasteful.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nQuincy: Turtles are being temporarily relocated so the city can start a $1.4million pond restoration project. Starting this week, volunteers from the New England Herpetological Society will trap the turtles and take them to the New England Wildlife Center in Weymouth. The trapping process, which involves sardine-baited “hoop traps,” will take four days, according to a news release. Turtles will be taken from the traps each day to the wildlife center. The contractors are scheduled to begin restoration work Aug. 27. The plan is to dredge sediment from the pond and create a gravel stormwater treatment wetland on the north side, the city said. Julie Sullivan, the city’s environmental scientist, said sediment that has settled at the bottom of the pond has become so thick that it interferes with plant life and harms the ecosystem. The idea to move the turtles was sparked after Quincy residents expressed concerns that the restoration of the pond would disrupt wildlife.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state has passed the grim milestone of 20,000 deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a top health official warning that people must continue taking precautions. State health officials reported Friday that Michigan had totaled 20,011 confirmed deaths since recording its first one in March 2020. “We’ve seen real devastation and tragedy as a result of COVID-19, and it remains as important now as it (was) a year ago to mitigate the transmission of this virus,” said Elizabeth Hertel, director of Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services. “Because it is deadly.” Health officials are preparing for a new wave of coronavirus infections caused by the highly transmissible delta variant that is sweeping the country. On Friday, Michigan identified delta variant infections in more than 50 counties and the city of Detroit. Michigan’s COVID-19 deaths have been highest among the elderly and African Americans. Those 70 years and older have accounted for 69% of the total deaths. Confirmed deaths among African Americans have accounted for about about 22% of deaths, whereas Black residents comprise only about 14% of Michigan’s population.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The city’s police will no longer stop motorists for minor traffic violations, such as expired tags or an air freshener hanging from their rearview mirror, according to a new policy change. Police Chief Medaria Arrandondo, in an internal memo Thursday, said the move comes after examining how officers can better use time and resources. “MPD will no longer be conducting traffic stops solely for these offenses: expired tabs, an item dangling from a mirror, or not having a working license plate light,” Arradondo wrote in the memo obtained by the Star Tribune. Critics have long argued that low-level traffic stops in which officers use a minor traffic or equipment violation as a justification for pulling over someone they want to investigate contribute to racial disparities in the criminal justice system. The memo also said the city attorney will stop prosecuting tickets for driving after suspension if there was no accident “or other egregious driving behavior that would impact public safety.” Mayor Jacob Frey said Friday that police will continue to stop motorists for offenses that are a threat to public safety, such as reckless driving or speeding.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A rural community is overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases, two weeks after hosting the Neshoba County Fair that drew thousands who lived in cabins, attended shoulder-to-shoulder outdoor concerts and listened to stump speeches – including one by the Republican governor, who decried federal masking guidance as “foolish.” Frustrated by rising COVID-19 infections, the chief executive officer of the 25-bed Neshoba General Hospital posted a message on social media challenging Gov. Tate Reeves to step up and show leadership. “@tatereeves hospitals and healthcare workers need you to help us. Where are you?” Lee McCall wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “We are overwhelmed with the surge of Covid and understaffed to safely care for our patients. Our incredible staff are holding it together but we are all at our breaking point.” Last week alone, Mississippi broke its single-day records of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalized patients multiple times. The previous records were in January, before vaccinations were widely available. Until recent days, Reeves had made few public statements about the coronavirus the past few weeks. In a July 29 speech to a conservative crowd at the Neshoba County Fair, he called federal advice for the fully vaccinated to resume wearing masks indoors “foolish” and “harmful.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSedalia: Mostly unmasked crowds packed into the Missouri State Fair shoulder-to-shoulder last week as it opened amid soaring numbers of new COVID-19 infections. Fair officials decided in the spring to bring back the full fair after replacing it with a much smaller youth livestock show last year because of safety concerns, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “We’re not seeing any kind of slowdown in attendance and are expecting an average to good year,” said State Fair Director Mark Wolfe, adding that his staff estimated up to 340,000 people will attend the event before it closes Aug. 22. Among the unmasked was Brian Eggers, a 55-year-old farmer who lives outside Chillicothe. He lost a close neighbor as well as aunts and uncles to COVID-19 and said he hasn’t gotten around to getting a shot. “I’m not anti-vaccine, but I haven’t gotten it myself yet,” he said as he watched a youth livestock show, adding: “If God wants to take me, that’s his choice.” Jessica Miller, who manned the fair’s vaccination station, said five patients had come in for COVID-19 shots in the event’s first 2.5 hours of operation. Some told Miller that their jobs were going to require the vaccine or that they would be allowed to eschew a mask if they got inoculated.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Police on Friday released the name of a 21-year-old man who was shot and killed by a police officer after authorities say he fled a traffic stop. Brendon T. Galbreath, a member of the Blackfeet Nation who lived in Missoula, died in a hospital Thursday. Galbreath’s brother, Terrance LaFromboise, said Friday that the family had received statements from law enforcement officials following his death that did not match up with information publicly released by Missoula police following the incident. In a recording of communications between police officers during the chase and shooting, a police officer can be heard saying the victim shot himself. “Did he shoot or did we?” an officer asks. “Both,” another officer responds. LaFromboise said people who knew his brother find it hard to believe he had a gun or knew how to use one. “He has a strong stance against guns,” he said. Galbreath was the salutatorian of his class in high school and had met former first lady Michelle Obama during a trip to Washington, D.C., through a pre-college program. He moved to Missoula during the coronavirus pandemic, after several relatives contracted COVID-19 and died. He was planning to apply to study at the University of Montana to study medicine or engineering, his brother said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska Board of Regents has rejected an anti-critical race theory resolution. The 5-3 vote Friday followed about three hours of public comment from students, faculty and others, the Lincoln Journal-Star reports. Regent Jim Pillen, a Republican candidate for governor, introduced the resolution objecting to “any imposition of critical race theory” in academic curriculum in July, after another candidate for governor criticized him for not taking action on the issue. Critical race theory, a framework for examining the effects race and racism have on institutions, both historically and today, has become a flashpoint in the culture wars. Several legislatures have enacted bills preventing it from being taught. Pillen said most Nebraskans believe critical race theory to be “discriminatory, divisive” and antithetical to the values held by many. But the proposal ran into a buzz saw of opposition from students, faculty, administrators and others, who said it abridged academic freedom and would hurt recruiting and retention, particularly of students and faculty of color. The ACLU of Nebraska, Anti-Defamation League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People bused students from Omaha to Lincoln and handed out T-shirts emblazoned with “Protect Academic Freedom.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The owner of a hotel that was fined a year ago for defying state coronavirus pandemic restrictions and hosting a beauty pageant and a faith-based Donald Trump campaign rally has lost a court challenge of the governor’s directives that limited meeting sizes. State Attorney General Aaron Ford said Friday’s ruling against Ahern Hotel and Convention Center amounted to a finding by a court that emergency orders issued by Gov. Steve Sisolak after COVID-19 emerged in March 2020 balance the rights and safety of residents. “Today, the court recognized what we already knew – the state has a responsibility to protect the lives of Nevadans,” Ford said. In a verbal ruling, Clark County District Court Judge Nancy Allf decided the lawsuit filed in August 2020 was moot because there are no more occupancy limits imposed by the state, Ford said. The city of Las Vegas and its planning director also were named as defendants. The property was fined nearly $11,000 after holding an “Evangelicals for Trump” event at which a city employee tallied more than 1,100 attendees – far more than the 50-person limit Sisolak had ordered for public and private events at the time. Organizers of the Mrs. Nevada America pageant held days later removed spectators to comply with crowd limits.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has a new goal of reducing waste sent to landfills by 25% by 2030. The goal is included in a bill signed into law last week. Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat who co-sponsored the bill, said it reframes and updates the state’s waste reduction goals and requires more innovation to reduce how much trash is generated and to increase the diversion of trash from landfills through reuse, recycling and composting. The law requires the Department of Environmental Services to update the state’s solid waste plan and make it available to the public.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state has retained its slot as the country’s densest, and Newark kept its crown as New Jersey’s biggest city, according to newly released U.S. census figures. The state’s population per square mile climbed 5.6% over the past decade to 1,263 people up from 1,195.5 – higher than every other state, though behind the District of Columbia. Newark also saw its population climb above 300,000, edging out a growing Jersey City that some expected would overtake Newark. Jersey City will remain the Garden State’s second-biggest, after growing 18% to just shy of 300,000 residents. The new figures also show the state became less white and more Black, Hispanic and Asian. The white population fell from 5.21 million a decade ago to 4.82 million in 2020, while the Hispanic and Asian populations both climbed by nearly 30%. People identifying as Hispanic climbed from 1.55 million in 2010 to 2 million in 2020, while the Asian population went from about 720,000 to roughly 942,000. The Black population grew from 1.13 million to 1.15 million. People under age 18 in New Jersey have declined from 2.07 million in 2010 to 2.01 million. Overall, the state’s population climbed from 8.8 million to 9.3 million. It will keep the 12 House seats it currently has.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State health officials say an increase in hospitalizations has prompted them to put out an urgent call for volunteer nurses to help boost the state’s medical workforce. The New Mexico Department of Health late Friday called on nurses or anyone with a medical license to volunteer to help because officials believe hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with patients. They want recently retired health workers or anyone qualified to sign up for the state’s Medical Reserve Corps. Hospitals are seeing increased hospitalizations because of long-postponed surgeries and a surge in COVID-19 patients. The delta variant of the coronavirus is much more contagious than previous strains. “We ask our nurses, and anyone with a medical license, to once again volunteer with the Medical Reserve Corps,” Dr. David R. Scrase, the acting director of the state health department, said in a statement. “To get through this together, we need everyone who can provide patient care to work side by side with us during this critical time.” The state’s Reserve Medical Corps has filled more than 139 requests during the pandemic, deploying 2,750 volunteers. To sign up, go to the Corps website at nmmrcserves.org.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State Sens. Jamaal Bailey and Brian Benjamin are emerging as top contenders in the search for the next lieutenant governor, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press. Bailey and Benjamin, both from New York City, are among several candidates being vetted by Kathy Hochul and her team and have emerged as the leading contenders, the person said. Last week Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced he would resign after increasing calls for his impeachment following an investigation that found he sexually harassed 11 women. He is set to leave office Aug. 24, when Hochul, who has been lieutenant governor since 2015, will take over. The state Assembly will suspend its investigation of Cuomo once he steps down after its leader concluded the Legislature didn’t have the clear authority to impeach a departed official, the chamber’s top Democrat said Friday. In an interview Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Hochul, who hails from the Buffalo area, said she had narrowed her search to focus on candidates from New York City. “Even though I’ve spent thousands of hours in New York City, and I’m well familiar with the challenges, I want someone who lives there,” she said. “I want someone who understands the challenges firsthand.” The position of lieutenant governor has largely been a ceremonial role.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Those who visit indoor spaces within the capital city will now need to wear a face mask to limit the spread of COVID-19, the mayor said Friday. Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin also said city employees who are already fully vaccinated or get to that point by Sept. 17 will receive a $250 reward and two days of bonus leave. “The number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in our community and across the state at an alarming rate,” Baldwin said in a statement. “The idea that we can hope COVID-19 will just go away on its own is not a reality. It’s time to take responsible action and today we are taking an important step to make sure the people of this community, and those who visit us, remain healthy and safe.” The move to reimpose the mask mandate will only be within Raleigh city limits, not Wake County. But the requirement does apply to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. The largest city in the state may also soon decide to compel masking indoors for residents and visitors, as Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles backtracked comments she made last week that she lacked the authority to compel people to wear masks indoors. Renewed mask requirements and rewards for vaccinations are coming as the more contagious delta variant sweeps across the state, giving North Carolina its worst coronavirus metrics in months.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials say production of oil and gas is holding steady. The latest figures released Friday show the state’s oil production from May to June has plateaued at about 1.1 million barrels per day for both months. “I would have to characterize the Bakken at this point as a sleeping giant,” State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said. “The COVID pandemic kind of put the industry to sleep, and it’s struggling somewhat to wake up.” The state’s oil production has recovered somewhat from last summer’s lows amid the coronavirus crisis, but it’s far from the record 1.5 million barrels per day produced in late 2019, the Bismarck Tribune reports. North Dakota’s natural gas production is also steady at about 2.9 billion cubic feet of gas per day in June. Officials say that if gas production grows, the state will need more pipelines and processing facilities within the next two years if it’s to continue to keep flaring down. “It’s not going to be an easy feat,” North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad said. “Things will have to get moving relatively briskly to meet those time frames.” Helms said he expects oil production will likely increase next year as companies slowly add back rigs in North Dakota, as well as crews needed to frack newly drilled wells so they can start producing oil.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A concealed weapons permit would become optional, and the requirement that individuals “promptly” notify police officers that they are carrying a concealed weapon would be eliminated, under legislation proposed in the state Senate. The bill is similar to a measure pending in the Ohio House and is one of several GOP-backed proposals in recent years seeking to expand gun rights in the state. The new concealed weapons bill, dubbed “Constitutional Carry” by its backers, was introduced Aug. 5 by state Sen. Terry Johnson, a Republican from southern Ohio’s Scioto County. Keeping the permit optional – as opposed to eliminating it altogether – would allow gunowners who obtain it to carry a concealed weapon in states with reciprocity agreements recognizing such permits. Earlier this year, Rep. Tom Brinkman, R-Cincinnati, noted it’s already legal to openly carry a firearm in Ohio without a license or training. “In order to avoid unnecessary hassle from the public or law enforcement, one may decide to put a coat or jacket over their firearm,” Brinkman, sponsor of the House legislation, told the House Government Oversight Committee in April. “Sadly, that individual instantly turns into a felon if they have not gone through some … government-mandated rigmarole first.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An emergency rule by Gov. Kevin Stitt allows hospitals to renovate conference rooms and other areas to care for COVID-19 patients, the state’s health commissioner said Friday. The rule is not an emergency declaration, which would allow state schools to implement mask mandates, said Dr. Lance Frye, adding that he is not convinced one is needed. “We strictly looked at what do we need to respond (to the virus surge) and is there anything that was … accomplished before in our emergency declaration that we can’t do now,” Frye said. “We are good where we are right now as far as our ability to respond” to the surge that Frye said would be slowed with vaccinations. Unvaccinated patients make up 98% of new cases and 93% of hospitalizations in the state, Frye said. The state health department reported 2,814 new coronavirus cases Friday and a seven-day average of 2,122 new cases daily, up from 1,268 on July 28, along with 1,326 virus-related hospitalizations. Oklahoma’s vaccination rate reached 50% of residents with one dose, according to deputy health commissioner Keith Reed, and 41.1% fully inoculated, compared to national rates of 58.2% with one dose and 49.9% fully vaccinated.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A new state law that suspends a requirement for a basic-skills test in math, reading and writing to graduate high school is being praised by advocates as a way to rethink education standards and sharply criticized by others as a misguided effort that will hurt children’s learning in the long run. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown signed Senate Bill 744 last month without much attention. The measure temporarily eliminates essential-skills testing through the 2022-23 school year. That requirement had been put on a hold amid the pandemic, which forced the closure of many schools and remote learning for students. The Oregon Department of Education has said the new law will allow the state to develop more equitable graduation requirements. Officials have been told to compare diploma requirements in various states and find ways to reduce disparities and ensure graduation requirements are fair. “Senate Bill 744 does not remove Oregon’s graduation requirements, and it certainly does not remove any requirements that Oregon students learn essential skills,” department spokesman Marc Siegel told KATU. Rashelle Chase, founder of Mxm Bloc, an advocacy group led by Black women and focused on education and other social justice issues, said certain children struggle with exams and had been hurt by the testing requirements.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Health care workers, college students and higher education employees will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by mid-October under new mandates announced by the city’s Public Health Department on Friday. The mandates were passed Thursday night by the Board of Health, which provides guidance to the city’s health department, said acting Public Health Commissioner Cheryl Bettigole. She said both categories of people will be required to be vaccinated by Oct. 15, but exemptions will be allowed for religious or medical reasons, with added precautions or accommodations for those people. Health care workers with an exemption will be required to wear masks and undergo a coronavirus test twice a week. At colleges, those with exemptions will have to get a PCR test or two antigen tests weekly. Once a college reaches a 90% vaccination rate, Bettigole said those people with exemptions can double-mask and social distance in indoor spaces, or colleges can offer virtual options as an accommodation. City public health officials also made adjustments to mask mandates announced last week in an effort to accommodate parents with young children not yet eligible for the vaccines.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: West Nile virus has been found in a mosquito sample collected in the state for the first time this summer, environmental officials said. A mosquito trapped July 29 in Cranston tested positive for the virus, the state Department of Environmental Management said in a statement Thursday. No mosquito samples this year have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis, another mosquito-borne disease. The finding was not unexpected, given that West Nile has been found in multiple samples collected in neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts, indicating that the virus has “established seasonal activity in our area,” the department said. Because the virus is expected to become more prevalent as the season progresses, state environmental and health officials urged residents to limit their exposure to mosquitoes until the first hard frost. That includes eliminating mosquito breedings areas; ensuring windows and doors have screens; avoiding outdoor activities at sunrise and sundown, when mosquitoes are most active; and wearing shirts with long sleeves and long pants and using insect repellant when outdoors.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: A new genealogy research project could help preserve vulnerable coastal land belonging to Gullah Geechee families. The Heirs’ Property Family Research Project in Hilton Head Island will assist families with research that could help them obtain valid deeds for land that has been passed down to multiple family members without a will. Organized by the town’s Gullah Geechee Culture and Land Preservation Task Force, the Heritage Library of Hilton Head Island, and the University of South Carolina Beaufort, the project aims to help Black Americans known as Gullah or Geechee. These slave descendants retained much of their African heritage passed down from ancestors who grew up isolated on coastal islands off North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Some of the Gullah Geechee land is particularly vulnerable, project organizers said in a statement, because of the way it was passed down without a formal will. Volunteers with the free program will tap into census records and other documents to create family trees. Sheryse DuBose of the task force said the project could aid several Gullah Geechee families to secure titles for their land.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell said he was aggressively poked by someone seeking a selfie, which led him to say he was attacked. Lindell, who hosted an election fraud symposium in the city last week, told the conservative talk show FlashPoint that he was approached by a man who wanted a photo Wednesday night. “He put his arm around and stuck his finger, it was so much pressure, I just knew if I did anything something more was coming,” Lindell said, gesturing to his side. “He jammed it in where it was just piercing pain.” Lindell had told the crowd Thursday at the election fraud symposium that he was still in pain and wanted everyone to know about the evil in the world. The Sioux Falls Police Department said it is investigating a report of an assault at a hotel near the symposium. Police spokesman Sam Clemens has declined to identify the victim, citing Marsy’s Law, a state constitutional amendment that protects crime victims. Lindell announced the symposium in July, saying he hoped hundreds of “cyber-forensics experts” would attend and back up his claims that voting machines were hacked to flip votes for former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The governor’s office is pushing back on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation that goes as far as claiming cows are being vaccinated to inoculate unwitting people who eat meat. The confusion over an assortment of outlandish claims illustrates the hurdles that face a state in the bottom 10 for vaccination rates amid a coronavirus resurgence stretching hospitals thin. In an email Thursday to lawmakers, a top deputy of Republican Gov. Bill Lee debunked “several conspiracy theories” about a recent executive order. The email says some components that are being most frequently misinterpreted were included in previous executive orders during the pandemic. Lee’s office said lawmakers seeking information for constituents and constituents themselves have reached out about the claims. The rumors deemed “FALSE” in the governor’s office email are that his executive order creates “quarantine camps”; that the National Guard will round up unvaccinated people and take them to locations to be quarantined or vaccinated, or forcibly vaccinate them in their homes; that the executive order lays the groundwork for permanent lockdowns; and that COVID-19 vaccines are being given to livestock to vaccinate people through meat consumption.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A man who was scheduled for trial on murder charges last week has instead been granted release on bond after Dallas police revealed that material in his case might be among troves of data lost from its computer system. A Dallas County judge granted Jonathan Pitts bond Thursday after prosecutors asked the judge to delay his trial as they worked with police to determine whether case material was part of the information lost while the Dallas Police Department was moving data from a computer network drive. It was not immediately clear when Pitts would be freed from jail. The release of Pitts, who is charged in the 2019 shooting of Shun Handy, was ordered as authorities race to determine how many cases may have had evidence vanish in the 8-terabyte data loss. Prosecutors told Judge Ernie White on Thursday that they needed more time to work with police to audit the materials in Pitts’ case to determine whether anything was lost. On Friday evening, Dallas Police Sgt. Warren Mitchell said that “all the evidentiary items and data are available for prosecution on this murder case.” White granted Pitts release without paying bail because state law requires a person be freed if prosecutors aren’t ready at the time trial, his defense attorney, George Ashford III, told The Dallas Morning News.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Zion National Park may soon require reservations to hike one of its most famous trails. The Angel’s Landing hike is a narrow trail perched on the edge of a red-rock cliff in southern Utah. The number of people visiting Zion has been growing at a breakneck pace in recent years, and Angel’s Landing is one of the most sought-after destinations. More than 300,000 people made the trek in 2019, according to park officials. The crowding is worrisome on the trail where people regularly fall and die from the trail edged by a sheer cliff, park officials said. The system would start in 2022 and require people to pay $6 to enter an online lottery to get a permit and a $3 per person usage fee if they are chosen. It would apply specifically to the narrowest section of the trail, called the chain section after the metal handholds driven into the rock. Park officials are taking online public comment on the proposal through Sept. 12.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Supreme Court has authorized a one-year pilot project for remote civil jury trials. The move comes after a committee studied how to utilize remote hearing technology to increase access to justice and address civil case backlogs. The issue is especially important as the judiciary continues to navigate challenges associated with COVID-19. “The judiciary has been using remote technology to facilitate operations in order to ensure access to justice and continuity of operations and to promote the health and safety of judges, staff, and court users during the pandemic,” said state court administrator Patricia Gabel. “Considering the ways available technology can assist us in managing our civil docket is an important step in our ongoing effort to leverage technology and adapt our operations to changing conditions,” she said. The pilot project will not affect criminal trials.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: A federal judge declined to block the blasting of bedrock on a mountain where a natural gas pipeline is supposed to be laid, saying she lacks authority to do so. The decision by U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon comes after the property owner on Bent Mountain in Roanoke County sought an injunction to halt the work involving the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Dillon said Friday that her court was not the proper jurisdiction to resolve the dispute, noting that landowner John Coles Terry III had already sought action from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, The Roanoke Times reports. An attorney for Terry’s family asked last week for a temporary injunction on the drilling and blasting. Construction crews had started boring holes to prepare for explosives that would clear a trench for burying the 42-inch-diameter pipe. Terry’s motion said the blasting could contaminate his well water and that of others downstream. But the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and pipeline officials have said they’ve not seen evidence of the potential harm described in the motion. Terry said after Friday’s hearing that crews had yet to reach the portion of his land where construction would most likely impact his water.\n\nWashington\n\nGeorge: More than 160 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed so far among people who attended the Watershed Music Festival at the Gorge Amphitheatre in central Washington. More than 20,000 fans packed the Gorge, in George, for the three-day outdoor country music festival in late July, The Seattle Times reports. The Grant County Health District said Friday that the cases are tied to residents in counties including King, Grant, Pierce, Skagit, Kittitas, Okanogan, Whatcom, Kitsap, San Juan, Lincoln and Stevens. There’s also one case tied to an Oregon resident. Officials expect more cases associated with the festival to be confirmed in the coming days, and investigators are working with those who have tested positive to identify other cases. Public Health officials urge people who attended the festival to self-quarantine and get tested for the coronavirus. On average, symptoms of the virus develop five to six days after exposure, but the incubation period can be as long as 14 days, officials said. In eastern Oregon, Umatilla County Public Health officials have tied at least 66 COVID-19 cases to the outdoor Pendleton Whiskey Music Fest on July 10. Sixty-one of the people who tested positive were unvaccinated, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Policies that allow state officials to refuse to change a transgender person’s gender on their birth certificates should be declared unconstitutional, according to a new federal lawsuit. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Harvard Law School LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic on Thursday sued the Department of Health and Human Resources on behalf of two transgender men born in West Virginia, The Exponent Telegram reports. The suit stems from a ruling by the West Virginia Supreme Court last year that said circuit judges could no longer issue court orders telling health officials to change birth certificate gender markers. The lawsuit says the ruling led to health officials refusing to change gender markers and prior legal names on birth certificates of transgender individuals. The Department of Health and Human Resources has the authority under state law to make requested changes without a court order, according to ACLU of West Virginia Legal Director Loree Stark. Denying such requests violates transgender individuals’ constitutional rights to free speech, due process and equal protection, Stark said. West Virginia is “one of the last remaining states in the nation” where the gender marker on birth certificates can’t be changed, Harvard Law School LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic Director Alexander Chen said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nKenosha: A woman accidentally shot a friend while using the laser sight on a handgun to play with a cat, authorities said. A criminal complaint charging the 19-year-old woman with negligent use of a weapon said she was visiting a Kenosha apartment Tuesday afternoon where a 21-year-old man had brought a handgun. The woman, who a witness said had been drinking, picked up the handgun, “turned on the laser sight and was pointing it at the floor to get the cat to chase it” when the gun went off, the complaint filed Thursday said. The man, who was standing in a doorway, was shot in the thigh, authorities said. He left and went into another apartment, where police found him after responding to a 911 call, the Kenosha News reports. A tourniquet was applied to his leg to stop the bleeding before he was taken to a hospital. There’s no word on his condition, but authorities said he was facing charges for violating bond conditions that prevented him from having a weapon. The woman told police she thought the magazine had been taken out of the gun and said it “accidentally went off,” according to the complaint.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A new memorial honors the military service of Native Americans who long went unrecognized. The Path of Honor opened Thursday at the Frank B. Wise Business Center in Fort Washakie, where stones along a winding red path symbolize courage and commitment to living a purposeful life, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Lyle Wadda of American Legion Post 81 spearheaded the project that began in 2008 after the Wind River Development Fund and Post 81 partnered to create the business center. Still, even after the building and memorial’s completion, Wadda found himself in disbelief when it was finally dedicated to the public in a ceremony attended by dignitaries including Gov. Mark Gordon. “We accept anyone in this post,” he said at the dedication ceremony. “You don’t have to be Native American or part of another tribe. Business is open to everyone.” John St. Clair, chairman of the Eastern Shoshone Business Council and a Vietnam veteran, pointed to the dedication and bravery of Native Americans who served as volunteers in the Spanish American War and in World War I, before Native Americans were granted U.S. citizenship. At the Wind River Reservation alone, close to 900 tribal members have served in conflicts ranging from World War I to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/16"}]}

How will Jewish communities come together this week? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is Purim?\n\nPurim is a holiday centered around the biblical Book of Esther, in which Queen Esther stops a plot devised by Haman, the king's counselor, to massacre Jews.\n\n“Jews have celebrated the holiday of Purim as a day when they triumphed over one of their most fearsome enemies named Haman,” Pamela Nadell, a professor of history at American University, told USA TODAY.\n\nBerger said Jewish people continue to “celebrate this day where the tables were turned, where what we thought was going to be the destruction ended up being the salvation of the Jewish people.”\n\nWhat is Tu BiShvat? Everything to know about the Jewish holiday that celebrates nature\n\nWhat is Rosh Hashanah? Here's what you need to know about the Jewish New Year\n\nHow is Purim celebrated?\n\nThere are four main acts that Jewish people do on the day of Purim, Berger said. The first is to read the story of Esther, called the Megillah.\n\nIt is a tradition for groups of Jewish people to read from the Book of Esther aloud, together as a community.\n\n“During the reading, every time the wicked Haman’s name is mentioned, they make a lot of noise,” Nadell said, explaining that people will stomp their feet, shout and use a grogger, a kind of noisemaker.\n\nOther traditions include having festive meals, bringing food to loved ones and giving charitable gifts.\n\n“It's also very important on the holiday to also make donations, to give charity,” Nadell said. “You have this wonderful, raucous celebration, and then you also have remembering those who are less fortunate.”\n\nBerger added that the tradition of giving charitable gifts “is a recognition that we can't sit here in joy and in the levity of the moment if we're not also taking care of those who are in need.”\n\nHe also pointed to commemorations that individual groups organize for Purim. For example, this year, \"Hillel International is urging Jewish students and the global Jewish community to abstain from food and donate what they would have spent on meals” to relief efforts in Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country, according to a news release from the organization. The show of support comes from an ancient tradition to fast ahead of Purim.\n\nSome groups of Jewish people will also bake and eat hamantaschen, a cookie named after the villain Haman, among other Purim celebrations.\n\nIs Purim like Halloween?\n\nThough experts told USA TODAY some Jews don’t embrace comparing the holiday to Halloween, Purim is often likened to modern Halloween celebrations because both involve dressing up in costumes and going to carnivals and other festivities.\n\n“You can think of Purim as the Jewish Halloween,” Nadell said. “Jews wear all sorts of fanciful costumes, and they dress up. Little girls will dress up as Queen Esther, and boys will dress up as one of the male heroes of the story, he was Esther's uncle, his name was Mordechai.”\n\nBut she added that children – and some adults – will “dress up in all sorts of things.”\n\n“Honestly, I've even seen people dress their pets up in costumes, just like they do on Halloween,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/asia/seoul-itaewon-halloween-crush-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Itaewon: What we know about the deadly Halloween disaster in ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nMost weekends, the narrow alleys of Itaewon, the neon-lit nightlife district in South Korea’s capital Seoul, are busy with partygoers and tourists. Now it’s the site of one of the country’s worst disasters.\n\nOn Saturday night, tens of thousands of people flooded into the area in central Seoul to celebrate Halloween – but panic erupted as the crowds swelled, with some witnesses saying it became hard to breathe and impossible to move.\n\nThrough Sunday, the number of dead climbed to 154, with dozens more injured. Authorities have now launched an urgent investigation to find out how what was supposed to be a night of celebration went so horribly wrong, as families across the country mourn and search for missing loved ones.\n\nHere’s what we know so far.\n\nRescue teams work at the scene in Seoul, South Korea, where people were injured in a crowd surge during a Halloween festival.

Some even fly into Seoul from other countries in the region for the festivities.\n\nBut for the past two years, celebrations were muted by pandemic restrictions on crowd sizes and mask mandates.\n\nSaturday night marked the first Halloween since the country lifted these restrictions – lending it particular significance for many eager participants in Seoul, as well as international visitors including foreign residents and tourists.\n\nHotels and ticketed events in the neighborhood had been booked solid in advance, and large crowds were expected.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWitnesses told CNN there was very little – if any – crowd control before the mass of people turned deadly.\n\nVideos and photos posted to social media show people crammed together, standing shoulder to shoulder in the narrow street.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter returns to Itaewon's narrow alley one day after the Halloween disaster. See what's it like 01:39 - Source: CNN\n\nCrowds are not unusual for that area, or for Seoul residents, who are used to jam-packed subways and streets in a city of almost 10 million.\n\nOne eyewitness said it took some time for people to realize something was wrong, with people’s panicked screams competing with music blaring from the surrounding clubs and bars.\n\nOnlookers, police and paramedics gather in the popular nightlife district of Itaewon in Seoul on October 30, 2022. Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter the first emergency calls came in around 10:24 p.m., authorities rushed to the scene – but the sheer volume of people made it difficult to reach those who needed help.\n\nVideo posted to social media showed people performing compressions on other partygoers lying on the ground as they waited for medical assistance.\n\nThe thousands of people in Halloween costumes contributed to the widespread sense of confusion and chaos. One witness described seeing a police officer shouting during the disaster – but some revelers mistook him for another partygoer.\n\nThe cause of the crush is still under investigation, though officials said there were no gas leaks or fires on site.\n\nWho were the victims?\n\nThe casualties were young, mostly in their teens and early 20s, authorities said. Known for its nightlife and trendy restaurants, Itaewon is popular among backpackers and international students.\n\nAmong the 154 dead were at least 26 foreign nationals, according to authorities, with victims from countries including the United States, China, Iran, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Japan, Australia, Norway, France, Russia, Austria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.\n\nAll but one of the victims have been identified, South Korea’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said in a briefing on Monday. The toll included 56 men and 97 women, South Korea’s Interior and Safety Ministry reported.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Survivors recount horror of Halloween disaster in Seoul 02:07 - Source: CNN\n\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Education said Monday that six school students were among the dead, including one in middle school. Three teachers also died.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. local time Sunday (4 a.m. ET), the number of injured had risen to 133, of whom 37 were seriously injured, the ministry said.\n\nThe Seoul city government said more than 4,000 missing people reports had been received. That number could include multiple reports for the same person, or reports filed Saturday night for people who have since been found.\n\nPolice said there is no active search for those reported missing as they believe no one went missing from the scene; rather, they said the missing person reports have been used to help identify those who died.\n\nEmergency services treat injured people in Seoul on October 30. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nWhat was the official response?\n\nLee Sang-min, Minister of the Interior and Safety, said on Sunday that “a considerable number” of police and security forces had been sent to another part of Seoul on Saturday in response to expected protests there.\n\nMeanwhile in Itaewon, the crowd had not been unusually large, he said, so only a “normal” level of security forces had been deployed there.\n\nAs the disaster unfolded Saturday night, more than 1,700 emergency response forces were dispatched, including more than 500 firefighters, 1,100 police officials, and about 70 government workers.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol called an emergency meeting and urged officials to identify the dead as soon as possible.\n\nBut even hours later, families were still waiting to find out if their loved ones survived.\n\nRelatives of missing people weep at a community service center on October 30 in Seoul, South Korea. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many people were transferred to nearby facilities, while bodies were taken to multiple hospital mortuaries. Families gathered at sites near the scene, where officials were compiling the names of the missing and deceased.\n\nYoon promised to implement new measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again, saying the government would “conduct emergency inspections not only for Halloween events but also for local festivals and thoroughly manage them so they are conducted in an orderly and safe manner.”\n\nThe government will also provide psychological treatment and a fund for families of the deceased and injured. Authorities have declared a national mourning period until November 5, and designated the district of Yongsan-gu, where Itaewon is located, a special disaster area.\n\nFlowers are seen at the scene of a deadly accident in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022. Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\nQuestions being asked\n\nAs a stunned and grieving nation grapples with the tragedy, questions are also emerging about how such a disaster could have unfolded in a popular area where people are known to gather.\n\nIt’s hard to pinpoint what might have triggered the crush – but authorities “would have anticipated high numbers … before Saturday night,” said Juliette Kayyem, a disaster management expert and national security analyst for CNN.\n\n“There is a responsibility on the part of the authorities to be monitoring crowd volume in real time, so they can sense the need to get people out,” she added.\n\nSuah Cho, 23, was caught up in the crowd but managed to escape into a building along the alley. When asked whether she had seen any officials trying to limit the number of people entering the alley, she replied: “Before the incident, not at all.”\n\nAnother eyewitness described the situation getting “worse and worse,” saying they could hear “people asking for help for other people, because there were not enough rescuers that can just handle all that.”", "authors": ["Sophie Jeong Gawon Bae Paula Hancocks Hilary Whiteman Jessie Yeung", "Sophie Jeong", "Gawon Bae", "Paula Hancocks", "Hilary Whiteman", "Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2022/10/30/disney-world-disneyland-christmas-holidays-2022/10540533002/", "title": "Disney World, Disneyland holidays 2022: What to know before you go", "text": "The holidays have arrived at Walt Disney World and Disneyland.\n\nFor the first time since the pandemic, Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party is back at Magic Kingdom and World of Color - Season of Light is back at Disney California Adventure, but those aren't the only things returning for the 2022 holiday season.\n\nYear after year, Disney lovers are drawn to the elaborate decorations, seasonal food and beloved entertainment at the Florida and California resorts, making the holidays among the busiest times to visit the parks.\n\nHere's what travelers should know about spending this holiday season at Disneyland and Disney World.\n\nUSA TODAY Gift Guide: No matter how you holiday, make it iconic.

Religious concerns\n\nSome parents have long condemned Halloween as a holiday celebrating devil worship, a concern that appeared in a 1996 Register story.\n\nWhile these complaints also sparked pushback — \"People try to read too much into some things,\" one parent said at the time — it prompted schools to stop the celebrations.\n\n\"If you're doing a whole school thing, and some people don't want to do it, how do you do something that honors everybody's wishes?\" said Iowa State professor Greg Robinson, a former elementary school principal and superintendent in Urbandale.\n\nIt's been at least 18 years since Beaver Creek Elementary in Johnston celebrated Halloween, for example, in part because of religious sensitivity.\n\n“We have a lot of families that have different traditions and different religious beliefs,” Principal Eric Toot said. \"Some people don't like the connotations around Halloween, which is why the decision was made.\"\n\nSchools have that flexibility, but the ACLU of Iowa said educators shouldn't be worried about legal consequences if they do celebrate the holiday.\n\n\"Unless they are using Halloween as a means to engage in religious indoctrination of the kids in some way, like telling all the kids they have to dress up as specific religious figures, they are not crossing the line or getting into any scary territory,\" said Legal Director Rita Bettis.\n\n2. Scarier costumes\n\nChildren kept coming to school with more realistic — and more disturbing — costumes.\n\nRobinson still remembers a first-grader who wore a realistic-looking mask with an ax cutting into his head.\n\n\"It had blood and things like that,\" he said. At the time, he recalls thinking: \"Is this something we really want to have?\"\n\nAround the country, some schools responded by setting strict dress-up rules or requiring costumes to be a storybook character, which gave the celebration an academic focus.\n\nBut Robinson was among those who switched to a \"fall party,\" which is a more general celebration of autumn — usually a scaled-back version without costumes.\n\nAmid the \"creepy clown\" threats this year, that may come as a relief to some parents.\n\nUnlike schools in Colorado, New Jersey and other states, many Iowa districts haven't taken the added step of banning clown costumes.\n\nMost popular Halloween costumes of 2016\n\n3. Academics\n\nThe change also came during a time of increasing pressure to raise the academic bar, pressure that schools still feel.\n\nEducators complained that Halloween hoopla was overshadowing learning.\n\n\"It got to the point where people were spending a lot of time worrying about 45 minutes,\" Robinson said. \"It's not why kids are coming to school.\"\n\nFor example, while classrooms at Dallas Center Elementary have \"fall parties\" with crafts and treats, and some children change into costume, it's a very limited celebration.\n\n“We want to focus on learning, and that’s a distraction,” said Principal Diann Williamson.\n\n4. Party concerns\n\nAlthough not the primary reason, schools had growing concerns about food allergies.\n\nSchools were adapting how they approached classroom treats, making parties more difficult to coordinate.\n\n“If we weren’t providing the treats, we had to look at what was coming in and what wasn’t,” Robinson said.\n\nLongtime educators said the shift also came amid changing social norms. More parents were working, and fewer parents were available to help coordinate and supervise parties.\n\n\"We used to have homeroom parents and volunteers that would bring in cookies or treats,\" he said.\n\n5. Economic concerns\n\nAs costumes became more elaborate, schools worried about the pressure Halloween celebrations put on family budgets.\n\nSome students arrived in costumes that \"cost a fortune,\" Robinson said. Other families chose not to participate at all.\n\nThat's one of the reasons Johnston schools stopped celebrating — educators worried about the celebration dividing students.\n\n“There's a lot of differences in the type of costumes that can be worn, and what some could afford and not afford,” said Ann Thelen, district spokeswoman. “It put parents in a competitive position.”\n\nKnowing how much fun students enjoy dress-up days, Toot said his school incorporates the activity in simpler ways, such as during Johnston's homecoming celebration.\n\n\"It's a fun day,\" he said.\n\nMost popular pet Halloween costumes of 2016", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/10/09/franklin-square-philadelphia-fountain-dancing-light-show-summer-2019/1579372002/", "title": "Franklin Square fountain: Addition to historic Philadelphia attraction", "text": "PHILADELPHIA - Next summer, you can take a trip to see a spectacular fountain show featuring dancing water, lights and music.\n\nYou just have to go into Philadelphia.\n\nFranklin Square will renovate its 180-year-old fountain — the oldest one still working in the United States — to create a choreographed spectacle, said Historic Philadelphia Inc., the nonprofit group that runs the park.\n\n\"Fountain jets will dance magically with lighting and music that celebrates the rich diversity of Philadelphia,\" according to a news release.\n\nFranklin Square has steadily expanded its offerings since reopening as an outdoor recreational site more than a decade ago.

At least as official as it can get.\n\nAccording to the National Day Calendar website, there is an application process for \"brands, nonprofits, and corporations to register an official National Day that aligns with their product or service.\"\n\nFor reference, the site also lists in November a National Deviled Egg Day, National Chicken Lady Day and National Pizza with the Works Except Anchovies Day.\n\nStill, the Halloween & Costume Association has good intentions – to increase safety for children and help parents navigate a late-night holiday that often lands on a school night.\n\nHere's what parents need to know about the new holiday, with some help from Aneisha McMillan, who does marketing for the HCA.\n\nWhat is National Trick or Treat Day?\n\nNational Trick or Treat Day (NTTD) is a day for families and communities to come together by \"throwing block parties, community events, costume contests, parades, walks and runs, trunk-or-treating and daytime trick-or-treating as well,\" McMillan tells USA TODAY.\n\n\"NTTD is just an additional day to celebrate Halloween.\" The group is also referring to it as \"ALLoween.\"\n\nWhen is National Trick or Treat Day?\n\nThe last Saturday of October. For Halloween 2019, that is Oct. 26.\n\nHow would Saturdays and daytime trick-or-treating improve Halloween?\n\nHCA has a list of scary statistics on its petition concerning children's safety on Halloween.\n\nIt notes that, on average, children are more than twice as likely to be hit by a car and killed on Halloween than on any other day of the year, according to Safe Kids Worldwide.\n\nThe HCA also claims that many parents fail to use \"high visibility aids\" on costumes, flashlights or other measures to help prevent nighttime accidents.\n\nParents signing the petition also voiced concerns about the challenge to celebrate the event during a weekday when parents are working.\n\n\"It makes more sense to have it always on a Saturday so that we don't have to worry about getting the kids home and in bed early for school the next day. Also, for most people, they wouldn't have to worry about working that day or the day following,\" one wrote as their reason for signing the petition.\n\nMORE HALLOWEEN:\n\nDoes this mean we should be prepared to pass out candy on two days?\n\nNot necessarily. McMillan says there \"are no rules\" to NTTD and they are leaving celebrations up to neighborhoods, cities and communities. Just as city officials set trick-or-treating hours for Halloween night, cities have the ability to decide what's best. In fact, some cities have changed trick-or-treating times due to inclement weather. This is the same concept.\n\nHow do I know if my community is participating?\n\nMcMillan expects NTTD to evolve over time through \"grassroots\" efforts and through local organizations and communities hosting NTTD events and activities. Parents and caregivers should check with area officials for any changes to trick-or-treating hours in their area.\n\nCould the actual date of Halloween ever change?\n\nProbably not. Halloween is not a federally-recognized holiday. The spooky tradition originated with the \"ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, where people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts,\" according to a History.com post detailing the history and evolution of Halloween.\n\nIf a U.S. president was so moved to change the date of Halloween, it would require the government passing a bill to make Halloween a federal holiday, then, of course, setting the date to be the last Saturday of October.\n\nBottom line: It's unlikely to happen, but that doesn't mean you can't celebrate the tradition whenever you want – though your neighbors might be confused when you show up at their door in costume asking for candy in July.\n\nHappy Hallo-trick-or-treat-o-ween!\n\nFollow the latest from USA TODAY Parenting at usatoday.com/life/parenting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2022/10/17/pensacola-things-do-fall-festivals-holiday-celebrations-more/10478921002/", "title": "Pensacola things to do this fall: Festivals, holiday celebrations, more", "text": "Fall in Pensacola is truly a special time.

However, there is one Jewish holiday that can be observed during a pandemic with surprisingly little adjustment.\n\nSukkot, the week-long fall harvest festival which started Friday evening, has been honored outside for thousands of years. The primary way to celebrate: To build and dwell in a man-made hut called a “sukkah.”\n\nAlthough the holiday has long been overshadowed by the Jewish high holidays Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the “symbolism of the sukkah this year feels particularly rife,” says Rabbi Andrea London of Beth Emet synagogue in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nSo what is Sukkot and what makes it special this year? Let’s take a look:\n\nWhat is Sukkot all about?\n\nThe holiday commemorates the Israelites' nomadic life in the desert after escaping slavery in Egypt.\n\n“We were wandering for 40 years, we were in temporary shelters and we built temporary huts,” says Becky Sobelman-Stern, the chief program officer at the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.\n\nIt is also an agricultural holiday connected to the fall harvest.\n\n“This is really the Jewish Thanksgiving,” adds London. She says it's a time to be thankful for our food and and pray for rain to bring a good harvest next year.\n\nAlready dining outdoors? On Sukkot, you're supposed to eat in a sukkah (hut)\n\nObservant Jews make sukkot (that's the plural of sukkah and also the holiday name) out of materials found in nature — Sobelman-Stern uses palms found in her yard — and sometimes with the help of sukkah kits that can have steel tubing and wooden panels. The sukkah is supposed to have three walls and a roof that provides shade but also allows guests to see through it to the stars.\n\nThe sukkah is meant to be a place for outdoor dining. It is also customary to sleep in the sukkah all week, though “not everyone does the sleeping part, especially here in Chicago,” London says.\n\nPeople who don’t have the space or ability to erect a temporary hut outside can use porticos and overhangs to get into the spirit of the holiday. The holiday “is outside. It’s about decorating. It’s about being creative,” Sobelman-Stern says.\n\nWhy Sukkot feels more meaningful this year\n\nWith the holiday encouraging Jewish people to eat and socialize in open outdoor structures, “in some ways, Sukkot seems made for COVID world,” says Rabbi Sarah Krinsky of Adas Israel Congregation in Washington, D.C.\n\n“It does go deeper than that, too, though: Sukkot is about recognizing the places of fragility in our lives. It reminds us of what is temporary,\" she says.\n\nThe holiday also serves as a reminder of what’s important in life, London adds. “And how do we pursue those things? How do we be people who live with compassion and justice? How can our faith in God support us in times of trials and tribulations in crisis?”\n\nSukkot is meant to inspire thought and discussion around those questions, and also this one: “Who else, deceased or alive, would you like to have in the sukkah this year?”\n\nOn Sobelman-Stern’s list is the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died at the start of Rosh Hashanah.\n\nIt's a Jewish holiday that requires joy\n\nSukkot is the only Jewish holiday in which there is a commanded emotion, Krinsky explains. “In this case, profound joy,” she says.\n\nStepping outside, enjoying nature, decorating a sukkah and sharing food with friends (though likely fewer this year than on any other year, because of the threat of COVID-19) is meant to \"lead us to a deeper sense of presence, gratitude and even joy,\" says Krinsky. Finding joy on the holiday feels particularly important this year, she says, when doing so can be feel like a \"profound challenge and opportunity.\"\n\nAnd if the aforementioned activities don’t put a smile on your face, one specific tradition should: The shaking of the lulav and etrog.\n\nThe lulav, which is meant to symbolize the body, is made from binding the frond of a palm tree to myrtle and willow branches. The etrog, which is meant to symbolize the heart, is a citron fruit that looks like a large lemon. Both are shaken in all directions as a way to recognize God’s presence. It’s OK to treat the ritual as a dance.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/10/30/no-dia-de-los-muertos-isnt-mexican-halloween/762225001/", "title": "Día de los Muertos isn't 'Mexican Halloween'", "text": "Although dwindling in number, there are still many Americans who have never heard of Día de los Muertos (or Day of the Dead). Those who have heard of it, but don't really know much about it, sometimes refer to it as \"Mexican Halloween.\"\n\nWhile Halloween and Day of the Dead do share common roots, they are totally different holidays.\n\nOne major distinction is that Halloween is only one night, whereas the Day of the Dead is actually a three-day event that is just getting starting on Oct. 31. Halloween is short for All Hallows Eve, the night before All Saints' Day, a Catholic celebration commemorating saints and martyrs. All Souls Day, honoring all the Christian departed, follows on Nov. 2. Taken together, the three events are sometimes referred to as Allhallowtide and all of them are part of the Day of the Dead celebrations.\n\nMore:Day of the Dead history: Ritual dates back 3,000 years and is still evolving\n\nHalloween's connection to the afterlife has largely been stripped from the holiday. The aspects of the holiday that do touch on death — such as the prevalence of ghosts, ghouls and other spirits in costumes and decorations — tend to focus on our fear of mortality and the spookiness of the unknown.\n\nThe Day of the Dead, on the other hand, focuses squarely on death (it's in the name after all). But rather than treating it as something dark and frightening, the Day of the Dead is largely about laughing in the face of death, as represented by the ubiquitous skulls and skeletons known as calaveras and Catrinas, which are often depicted dancing or playing music. And though it is about remembering lost loved ones, the holiday is more a time to celebrate their memories than to mourn their loss.\n\n\"The Day of the Dead is a day of connection, remembrance and love — for and with — those who have died (‘the ancestors’),\" said Kristin Norget, author of Days of Death, Days of Life: Ritual in the Popular Culture of Oaxaca. \"Halloween is completely lacking this important dimension.\"\n\nThe Day of the Dead is believed to be a time when the spirits of dead ancestors and relatives return to the world of the living for a visit.\n\n\"Halloween has nothing to do with ancestors,\" said Stanley Brandes, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Day of the Dead has everything to do with deceased relatives. That's the basis of it.\"\n\nThere is wide variation in the way the Day of the Dead is celebrated across Mexico and the holiday is constantly evolving. For example, Halloween costumes are becoming more common in parts of Mexico on Oct. 31, and large parades have become part of the holiday, especially in Mexico City.\n\nFrom Oct. 31 to Nov 2. people across Mexico clean relatives' graves and decorate them with bright flowers (typically marigolds) candles and things the deceased loved in life (food, coffee, alcohol and tobacco are common). They stay overnight in the cemetery and hold a vigil at their loved one's grave.\n\nIt is also very common, especially for the people unable to make an overnight gravesite visit, to build an elaborately decorated altar in their home, known as an ofrendas, that incorporates reminders of the dead person, including photographs and the things the person loved.\n\n\"Come the end of October, a multitude of foreign visitors descends upon Mexico to witness colorful — some would say carnivalesque — ritual performances and artistic displays. Decorated breads, paper cutouts, and plastic toys, most of them playing humorously on the death theme are evident everywhere,\" Brandes wrote in an article for the American Folklore Society. \"Sculpted sugar candies in the form of skulls, skeletons, and caskets suggest an almost irreverent, macabre confrontation with mortality.\"\n\nAll Saints Day and All Soul's Day are observed across the Catholic world, as well as by some Protestant faiths. Many of the elements that make up the Day of the Dead, including the gravesite vigils and sweets are not unique to Mexico. But Mexico stands out for the rich, joyful flavor of the celebration.\n\n\"What seems to me unique to Mexico are three features of the celebration: first, the name Day of the Dead; second, the abundance of variety and whimsical sweet breads and candies; and third, the humor and gaiety that pervade the holiday,\" wrote Brandes.\n\nIn Of Corpse: Death and Humor in Folklore and Popular Culture, Kristin Congdon said part of that humor comes from to a reversal of social norms that is tied to Day of the Dead.\n\n\"While in some company it might be rude or inappropriate to flaunt or laugh at death, or to conspire with the dead, an aesthetic reversal, especially in a ritual space, can make the unacceptable acceptable,\" Congdon said. \"Additionally, those who might be set aside or forgotten, like the dead, are remade, enjoyed, and visible.\"\n\nIn North American culture, particularly Anglo-Protestant U.S. culture, death is a subject people largely try to bury. \"Death has been something to avoid,\" Norget said. \"It is ugly, associated with negative emotions; it's something to be feared.\"\n\nNorget also said, generally speaking, U.S. culture tries to shield people from the reality of death and move \"the ritualization of death from the home\" to funeral homes and hospitals.\n\nThe contrast in the attitudes toward death in Mexico in the United States was summed up in a famous passage about the Day of the Dead by Mexican author, and Nobel Laureate, Octavio Paz in his 1950 work, The Labyrinth of Solitude.\n\nThe word death is not pronounced in New York, in Paris, in London, because it burns the lips. The Mexican, in contrast, is familiar with death, jokes about it, caresses it, sleeps with it, celebrates it; it is one of his favorite toys and his most steadfast love. It is natural, even desirable, to die, and the sooner the better. We kill because life —our own or another's — is of no value. Life and death are inseparable, and when the former lacks meaning, the latter becomes equally meaningless. Mexican death is the mirror of Mexican life.\n\nBrandes believes the idea that Mexicans have a different attitude toward death is greatly overstated, however.\n\n\"I see the same reaction that people have to the death of a relative in Mexico as in the United States,\" Brandes said. 'There’s the same kind of grief and dismay and the horrible sense of loss.\"\n\nBut, Brandes does see a difference between a funeral in Mexico, \"with its terrible grief and mourning\" and the Day of the Dead with \"the sort of joyous flavor you get with music and humor.\"\n\nMore:Día de los Muertos event disrespects Arizona cemetery, farmworker families say\n\nMore:Salinas Day of the Dead celebration honors lost loved ones, continues tradition\n\nReaders debate:Is America ruining Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead?\n\nDay of the Dead celebrations in Mexico are growing and they are becoming bigger in the U.S. as well. Brandes believes much of its popularity is due to its promotion by the Mexican government. In part, the promotion is driven by a desire to increase tourism, but it is also powered by a need to establish a unique, Mexican identity Brandes said.\n\n\"For Mexicans, foreigners, and peoples of Mexican descent, the holiday has come to symbolize Mexico and Mexicaness,\" Brandes said. \"It is a key symbol of national identity.\"\n\n\"As death has become less frequent, and people are living longer, the celebration of death has gotten bigger and bigger, and more expensive, and it's due to a lot to hype,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/10/23/halloween/17769591/", "title": "Your guide to Halloween happenings in Central Jersey", "text": "Angela Wyatt and Bradley W.

Beer production began last month and one of the new owners, J. Burke Morrison said he hoped to have the beer in area restaurants within the next two weeks. Canned beer should be in Delaware liquor stores by late September.\n\nTwin Lakes beers were unveiled to the public at Buckley’s 10 years ago. And Greenville Pale Ale was once the Kennett Pike restaurant’s top selling brew.\n\n“It out sold every beer we sold by 2-to-1,” Lewis said. But the water used to make the beer now comes from southern Chester County, rather than Greenville. Lewis said he wasn’t sure if the different water source has changed the beer’s flavor. He hasn’t had any Twin Lakes brews at the restaurant for more than a year.\n\nMorrison brought some of the new Twin Lakes Pale Ale beer to Lewis to sample. And he liked what he tasted.\n\n“It’s good and we are going to get a delivery,” Lewis said. It should be served at Buckley’s sometime this week.\n\nAddress correction for new Chipotle’s\n\nJust an FYI, the folks at Chipotle Mexican Grill told us they gave us the wrong address for their new location in the Milltown area on Kirkwood Highway. It’s at the site of a former 7-Eleven convenience store.\n\n“It looks like we got the address wrong,” a spokeswoman wrote in an email. “It’s 3700 Kirkwood Highway rather than 2699 Kirkwood Highway.”\n\nBut, eagle eye News Journal reader David McCorquodale, who said he is a retired clerk, who sorted mail for decades, had already spotted the error.\n\n“I immediately knew that the address you gave for the new Chipotle’s, being located at the old 7-Eleven on Kirkwood Highway and Duncan Road, was wrong,” he wrote. “2699 Kirkwood Highway’s nearest location is LabCorp, which is at 2701. The old 7-Eleven location is 3702 Kirkwood Highway, the other side of the street and the equivalent of 10 blocks up the road.”\n\nThanks for the catch, David.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 orptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter@pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columns/nick-in-the-morning/2021/02/16/mission-bbq-open-peoria-across-chipotle-and-northwoods-mall/6752471002/", "title": "Mission BBQ to open in Peoria across from Chipotle and ...", "text": "PEORIA — Coming soon to Peoria: barbecue with a heaping side of salutes to the military, police officers, firefighters and first responders.\n\nThat's the mission of Mission BBQ.

And I don't want to be in that position of working until 65 or 67 and you don't have time to travel or chase your dream,\" he said. \"I loved my job, but I wanted the chance at the American dream of owning my own business.\"\n\nMartinez said he was both scared and excited to launch his barbecue business. But steady customers for about a year and a recent nod by Texas Monthly's barbecue reviewer have proven he made the right move from retail auto parts to the BBQ pit.\n\n\"Barbecue is big in Texas, so when Daniel Vaughn writes about your business — it's a pretty big deal,\" Martinez said. \"And I wasn't expecting it because I'm so new to the business, but we work really hard to make good barbecue.\"\n\nIndeed, Smokin' Joe's and Blake Barrow's Hallelujah BBQ were the El Paso restaurants Texas Monthly barbecue editor Vaughn selected as part of Top 25 New BBQ Joints. The other two restaurants from West Texas included The Half Acre in Midland and Brantley Creek Barbecue in Odessa.\n\nDesert Oak BBQ has previously made it to Texas Monthly's Top 50 BBQ Joints list.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Vaughn said El Paso has recently started to create a barbecue community with places like Desert Oak BBQ, Skinny's BBQ, moving where Desert Oak formally used to be on Zaragoza Road, and the addition of Smokin' Joe's and Hallelujah BBQ.\n\nHallelujah BBQ is part of the Rescue Mission and is under the leadership of chief executive officer and pit master Blake Barrow. The restaurant opened in April at 130-A N. Cotton St.\n\n\"It just seems like you're going to any normal restaurant with a wait staff and table service. It's not until you see some of the table tents and talk to Blake Barrow that you fully understand the mission they have. The fact that it is a truly unique experience — that it's exclusively staffed by people being served by the mission — that was pretty incredible,\" he said.\n\nMore:Latest on Dave's Hot Chicken coming to El Paso; Cupbop opening 2 locations on East Side\n\nVaughn said the 13-habanero sausage really stood out to him.\n\n\"They hand make the sausage at the mission. They make a 30-pound batch every time and they use 13 habanero peppers, which is how it gets its name. I also loved the baby back ribs and brisket and I loved the sides, especially the ones with green chile and cheese,\" he said. \"So much of the rest of Texas you get jalapeños in everything.\"\n\nVaughn said Desert Oak owner Richard Funk recommended he stop by Smokin' Joe's when he was in El Paso.\n\n\"It was so good,\" Vaughn raved. \"I don't know if it's an El Paso thing to have chili with beans, but I love the fact that he put that on the menu. So many Texans are like if it's true chile con carne, it's just meat and the chilies.\"\n\nVaughn said he tried various barbecued meats and the brisket was the best in El Paso.\n\nMartinez said the key to his barbecue is Central Texas style.\n\nMore:New Just Cheesecake Outlet to fill niche in El Paso\n\n\"Central Texas style traditionally is a very pepper-forward seasoning on all the meats. And then it's smoked low and slow. Our brisket we smoke it for 14 hours. Barbecue is not something we can rush,\" he said. The second element that makes it Central Texas style is the use of post-oak wood purchased from East Texas.\n\nMartinez said the food is served on a platter to give that family-style feeling, where people can share several meats and sides. The meat falls right off the ribs and the brisket, pork loin and sausage all compete for top billing.\n\nThe pit master also distinguishes himself in the type of sauce he provides on the side. It's not thick like ketchup but thin, almost like an aioli.\n\n\"I am not a fan of barbecue sauce; the sauces that are out on the market are really thick like ketchup. I wanted to develop a flavorful sauce that had a little bit of sweetness to it and I also wanted it thin. I ruined a lot of batches of barbecue sauces before I came up with this,\" he said. \"A lot of people say it's a got a raspberry flavor to it but the main ingredients in the barbecue sauce are brown sugar and I thin it down with an apple cider vinegar.\"\n\nMartinez said he still has bigger dreams. He is looking into a brick-and-mortar spot on the East Side and would like to transition later this year.\n\nMaría Cortés González may be reached at 915-546-6150, mcortes@elpasotimes.com and @EPTMaria on Twitter.\n\nWhat Texas Monthly said about top El Paso BBQ restaurants\n\nHallelujah BBQ\n\nOpened: 2023Pitmaster: Blake BarrowPro tip: Ask about their pet leopard.\n\nThe Rescue Mission of El Paso has provided services for the homeless since it opened, in 1952. Director Blake Barrow started a catering operation from the mission in 2015, and this year he opened his long-awaited Hallelujah BBQ in a renovated historic building nearby. The restaurant is staffed exclusively by people who have benefited from the mission's outreach. The barbecue options include tender brisket, peppery baby back ribs, and a sausage called 13 Habaneros, which is reminiscent of a spicy Italian link with plenty of caraway seed. As for sides, you're in luck if you're a fan of carbs, because you have your choice of tater tot casserole, au gratin potatoes, and mac and cheese. The green beans are cooked down with barbecue spices, green apple, and mushrooms—an unexpected combination that works. 130A N. Cotton, 915-307-7500. Open Wed–Sun 10:30–3.\n\nSmokin' Joe's Pit BBQ\n\nOpened: 2022Pitmasters: Joe and Martin MartinezPro tip: The banana pudding is better once the chill has faded, so let it bask a bit in the El Paso sun.\n\nJoe Martinez had a reputation for barbecue long before he opened his food truck. At the same time the El Paso native was planning his retirement from a corporate job, his instructional barbecue videos on YouTube were collecting millions of views. He and his brother Martin smoke a black-barked brisket that could hold its own anywhere. Peppery spareribs get a brush of sweet barbecue sauce, and the meat comes off the bone with just a tug. There's also a juicy cheeseburger on brioche, dressed with grilled red onions. Joe uses his sausage to bring some El Paso flavor, adding Hatch chiles and Muenster cheese. The Martinezes grew up with beans in their chili, so you'll eat beans in your chili (and I bet you'll like it). 10150 Montana Ave, 602-796-2211.

While Robbie handles the administrative work and Jonny handles the kitchen, their mother, Edith, hosts the customers and father, Pompeyo, delivers the food and manages the inventory.\n\nThis close-knit team serves up antibiotic-free and hormone-free meats, which are barbecued with natural hardwood charcoal. They have lots of community support, serving about 180 to 250 customers per week with a $9.50 to $19 menu — including Woodbridge Mayor John McCormac’s “Mayor’s Menu Choice,” a healthy grilled rotisserie chicken dish with steamed vegetables ($9.50) as a part of the Mayor’s Wellness Campaign. With about 25 seats in the restaurant, many come for the combo, which is a combination of barbecue chicken and pork ribs served with Portuguese rice and French fries for $18.\n\nGo: 461 New Brunswick Ave., Fords section of Woodbridge; 732-225-3701; fordsbbqnj.com/#/Home/CustomPage/3\n\nGrub Hut Unique BBQ & Mexican Grill, Manville\n\nMike and Melanie Johnston have been behind local staples such as JJ Bitting’s Brew Pub in Woodbridge and Mike’s Giant Subs in Hillsborough, but it wasn’t until they opened Grub Hut Unique BBQ & Mexican Grill in Manville that their expertise could really shine with their slow-cooked barbecue and taqueria-style Mexican food.\n\nHoused in a hole-in-the-wall space yet outfitted with lively colors and even livelier dishes, Grub Hut is known for their array of barbecue dishes, including those with larger-than-life portions such as the Pit Head with brisket, chicken, ribs and pork; the beef ribs with a three pound full-rack of Texas style beef ribs; and the Big Time for two with four ribs, brisket, two pieces of chicken, two burritos, two tacos and a quesadilla.\n\nGo: 307 N Main St., Manville; 908-203-8003; grubhutbbq.com\n\nMore:8 places to enjoy the burger of your dreams in South Jersey\n\nMore:NJ restaurants: 10 new restaurants at the Jersey Shore\n\nMore:Wine dinner coming to A Toute Heure on May 23\n\nBobcat’s Texas BBQ, Ramsey\n\nWant authentic Texas barbecue? Might as well have it made by someone who’s actually from Texas. Bobcat’s Texas BBQ owner Lisa Johnson hails from Sealy, Texas, and so does her family recipes for brisket, sausage, ribs and more. She opened Bobcat’s Texas BBQ in Ramsey in September of 2016, and later expanded to Edgewater, though that location has now closed. The name is a nod to her father’s nickname – Bobcat – whose recipes and smoking techniques she uses in her cooking.\n\nJohnson also sells her own barbecue sauce that she bottles up for purchase ($10.95 a bottle).\n\n“We all know that love and passion is the secret ingredient to anything ... So when I come in in the morning I’m always taking my time with the tomato paste and my paprika and all my ingredients that go into the sauce,” Johnson said.\n\nThat sauce comes slathered on sausage sandwiches ($10.95), pulled pork ($11.50 for half-pound, $21.95 for pound), baby back ribs ($15.95 for half rack, $25.95 for full rack) and more. Add on a peach cobbler or cup of Blue Bell ice cream, and you’ll really feel like you’re in Texas.\n\nGo: 112 E Main St., Ramsey; 201-962-9755; bobcatstxbbq.com\n\nJersey Shore BBQ, Belmar\n\nFirst came a decade of studying the art of smoking meat in Texas. Then Doug Walsh was ready to open his own restaurant back home in New Jersey.\n\nAt Jersey Shore BBQ, now 10 years old, Walsh serves baby-back and St. Louis pork ribs, chopped burnt-end brisket, pulled pork, and pork and beef kielbasa that are smoked for 10 to 15 hours in a pit fueled by local hardwoods. He makes chili, smoked wings, a pulled pork and collard greens sandwich, brisket-topped mac and cheese, bacon-studded potato salad, and hand-cut fries.\n\nGo: 811 Belmar Plaza; 732-894-9009, jerseyshorebbq.com.

All together, they hold more than 100 competition awards.\n\nAt Local Smoke, specialties are St. Louis-cut pork spare ribs, which are coated with dry rub and smoked for four to six hours; Carolina-style pulled pork, which is dry-rubbed, smoked then coated in a vinegar-based barbecue sauce; and Texas-style brisket, which dry-rubbed and slow-smoked, with sauce added at the end.\n\nGo: 719 Route 35, Neptune City; 732-455-8888; 244 W.

While some BBQ joints offer the same menu every time you visit, Macona is full of surprises. And, customer be warned, once Ruess and his wife Natalie, also an industry vet, post daily specials to Instagram, they are likely to sell out.\n\nExpect house-made sausage, brisket, pulled meats and burgers, but also but hope for poutine, mac 'n' cheese, Mexican street wings, \"Dirty Jersey'' cheesesteaks with long hots and so much more. Try a three-meat platter with barrocho beans and your choice of vinegar or mayo-based slaw.

He opened the restaurant with his friend, Sarah Marsh, in November.\n\nThink brisket, shrimp, fish and veggie tacos with housemade tortillas, as well as quesadillas, burritos, burrito bowls and salads (vegetarian, brisket, shrimp, chicken or fish).

The eatery may only have 49 seats, but it can churn out pulled beef, brisket, pork and ribs for up 200 people on a busy night, not including the crowds that line up for take-out orders.\n\nOn its menu, which ranges from $12 per pound sausage to $20 per pound brisket, pit beef is the No. 1 pick for customers, due to its rarity — most restaurants don’t offer this extremely versatile staff favorite. However, that’s not the only reason More Than Q has garnered a “wonderful base that is like family,” Martin said. “I think the long lines are partially due to ‘catching up’ with most of our customers. The staff in both locations is the absolute best and they take great care in getting to know, and care, for our customers.”\n\nGo: 13 Klines Court, Lambertville, 609-773-0072; 325 Northampton St., Easton, Pennsylvannia, 610-829-2777; morethanq.com.\n\nMission BBQ, Deptford\n\nAmerica has a love affair with barbecue, so it’s understandable a restaurant chain whose mission is to celebrate first responders, veterans and active service members would offer a menu replete with pulled pork or chicken, ribs, brisket, jalapeno and cheese sausage, roast turkey and more.\n\nThe Deptford restaurant, one of more than two dozen across the country, opened last spring, offering a big side helping of patriotism and many ways to support local heroes. (A second New Jersey location is coming to Voorhees this summer).\n\nThe eatery’s mission includes regular sponsorship and partnership with the USO, as well as additional fundraisers and service projects.\n\nThe first location of Mission BBQ opened on the 10th anniversary and all service grinds to a halt once each day so staff and customers can stand at attention for the national anthem. “Every day at noon, we play the national anthem and we step away from serving our guests,’’ Chris Blythe, regional director of operations, has said. “It’s a great reset for us. We do it because we can, and if people want to be involved, that’s great.’’\n\nGo: 1901 Deptford Center Road, Deptford. 856-352-5158; mission-bbq.com/\n\nOink & Moo, Voorhees\n\nBoth of these casual spots (the Camden County location is in the Ritz Shopping Center in Voorhees, the other is in Union Township, Hunterdon County, in what for years was the Perryville Inn), began as a food truck.

The Hunterdon location, which is a full-service restaurant, has more menu items, including appetizers, as well as a full bar and outdoor seating. Oink & Moo is suited for a quick, casual lunch or dinner. Don't miss their selection of homemade barbecue sauces using seasonal fruit!

Like its tender brisket that’s rubbed with a hefty amount of spice and blackened on the outside ($5.25 to $21); its Carolina-style pulled pork ($4.75 to $19); and its jalapeno cheddar sausage links ($6 per link). Sides include house-made pickles ($4), jalapeno cheese cornbread ($2) and collard greens with ham hock ($3 to $10).\n\nOwner Dan Misuraca is dedicated to supporting active and veteran members of the military, and has instituted a “Buy a Veteran a Meal” program, where customers can buy “Vet Meal” gift cards that get donated to local veterans so they can eat for free. So, when you dine there you can chow down on a macho, meaty meal, and share the love buy buying one for a veteran.\n\nGo: 266 Davis Ave., Kearny; 201-998-2771; redwhiteandquesmokehouse.com\n\nSmoke, Audubon\n\nAaron Clark shares his version of slow-smoked beef brisket, ribs, sausages, chicken, and turkey at his first restaurant. He takes no shortcuts and the result is tender and juicy barbecue that you can sauce yourself.\n\nThe restaurant offers a sunny atmosphere and friendly service, making it a great place to dine with the whole family, as well as for take-out. There are also tacos, a kid's menu and plenty of sides including slaw, potato salad, mac 'n' cheese and Brussels with bacon — and corn bread, of course.\n\nGet there early though, because the hands-on barbecue process means that when they sell out for the day they’re sold out until tomorrow.\n\nGo: 34 West Merchant St., Audubon. 856-672-0007; smokebbqnj.com\n\nSouth Side Sandwich Shop & Smokehouse, Lakewood\n\nYosef Mutterperl's barbecue restaurant started off as a sandwich shop — to this day, one of his favorite menu items is The Dagwood, a tower of chicken cutlet, pastrami, onion rings, Russian dressing and coleslaw.\n\nIt is a tasty sandwich, without a doubt. But barbecue is where he really shines.\n\nIn the back of his blink-if-you-miss-it kosher shop on busy Cedar Bridge Avenue, Mutterperl slow-smokes brisket, pastrami, chicken, ribs, lamb and burnt ends for anywhere from four to 24 hours. He piles the meat into sandwiches and onto platters with coleslaw on the side.\n\n\"It's a lot of work, but you really gotta love what you're doing,\" said Mutterperl, who also tops beef hot dogs with chili and makes a Baltimore-style pit beef sandwich with smoked beef shoulder, horseradish and white onions.\n\nTake note: South Side Sandwich Shop & Smokehouse, a kosher restaurant, is closed Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nGo: 315 Cedar Bridge Ave.; 732-961-6126; facebook.com/pg/SouthSideSandwichShop\n\nSugarpuddin', Lindenwold\n\nWhen you say you have the best barbecue ribs this side of the Missouri, you have to come out swinging.\n\nOwned by Carla McGruder, a dentist from Charleston, Missouri, who learned barbecue recipes from her mom, this Lindenwold eatery lures you with that promise of St. Louis Ribs and gets you to linger with its memorable homemade desserts.\n\nStart your meal with BBQ Nachos, Crispy Pickle Chips or Shrimp in a Box.

Watch for updates on the Norwich Events website.\n\nNORWICH — Norwich's annual Winterfest parade Saturday will, for the first time, be a lighted display, with more than a dozen illuminated floats rolling through downtown after sundown.\n\nThe light parade, featuring vehicles, marchers and dancers, will set off at 6 p.m. from the Chelsea Groton Bank on Main Street Saturday, Dec. 3, one day after Norwich holds Light Up City Hall on Friday.\n\nCastle Church will show National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation - the movie is also the theme of this year's parade - afterward, around 7 p.m. said Norwich Events Organization Treasurer Miria Gray. The parade has wound through Norwich streets in December for at least 20 years.\n\nThe organization took over the parade not too long before the pandemic, and members were considering making it a lighted affair shortly before COVID-19 broke out, which put the idea on hold. Now felt like the right time, Gray said.\n\nShop small for the holidaysWant to support local business for the holidays? Eight Eastern CT places to get your gifts\n\nMore than a parade - children's activities, free hot chocolate, crafts\n\nFor those who arrive early, downtown activities, including children’s crafts, family photo opportunities, and a children’s play area at Castle Church, will start at 4 p.m. There will also be free hot chocolate for attendees, Gray said.\n\nA variety of local businesses and organizations have sponsored floats. One of them is from Blooming into Greatness, a performing arts group for youth in and near Norwich. Along with the float, the group will perform a dance choreographed to a rap remix of a Christmas song, Program Director LaShawn Cunningham said.\n\n“We’re all excited,” she said. “It’s new; I’ve never done a light parade nor have I been to one.”\n\nBill’s Auto Inc. of Preston is another float sponsor for the parade, collaborating with Mystic River Tile LLC on a float to look like a scene National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation, which is this year’s parade theme. However, the light parade aspect makes people rethink their designs and “gives it a new twist,” Bill’s Auto Co-Owner Heather Smith said.\n\nDrug overdoses in Norwich, CTNorwich has the most opioid-related deaths in New London County. What's being done?\n\nParade grand marshal is former Bulletin photographer John Shishmanian\n\nThe parade’s grand marshal this year is former Norwich Bulletin photographer John Shishmanian, who retired in early November. He’ll be riding in the main parade car with his wife, dressed in lights and a Santa hat, behind the color guard.\n\n“I’m really looking forward to saying goodbye to thousands of people I’ve taken pictures of over the last 43 years,” he said.\n\nShishmanian has been a fixture in the Norwich community for decades, Gray said.\n\nA legacy in photographsJohn Shishmanian retires from The Bulletin after 43 years\n\n“He’s been with the community for so many years, with the good times and the bad times,” she said. “We would like to celebrate him as much as he’s been able to celebrate, through photos, everyone else in the community.”\n\nShishmanian said it feels “bizarre” being the center of attention instead of getting in front of the floats with a camera. That said, he'll still take a few pictures of the parade for The Bulletin.\n\n\"It's in my blood; I've got to take pictures,\" he said.\n\nLight parade route for Norwich Winterfest 2022\n\nThe route hasn't changed. Starting at Chelsea Groton Bank, the parade goes down Main Street, turns down Franklin Street, then takes a left on Willow Street, then a left down Broadway, and back to the starting point. Streets that aren’t normally lit will have lights from Norwich Public Utilities to prevent dark spaces, Gray said.\n\nAttendees are expected to park at the Main Street Garage on 70 Main St., the Market Street Garage on Market Street, City Hall Garage at 101 Broadway, the ArtSpace Lot at 113 Franklin St., or the Intermodal Transportation Center on Falls Avenue. It’s expected that thousands of people will come downtown for the event, Gray said.\n\nJobs in CTWho's hiring? Our 2023 jobs outlook, from manufacturing to retail to education\n\nThe Winterfest is important for Norwich because it’s an inclusive activity in the city, Gray said.\n\n“(The theme) is National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation this year, but you can run with that to do lights, or snow or anything,” she said. “That movie encompasses a lot of the things that you do in the wintertime.”\n\nWhile the Norwich Events Organization also holds a St. Patrick’s Day Parade, Winterfest is important because it’s more popular with families, Cunningham said.\n\nNorwich is also a hub for many of the rural towns in New London County, and it shows that the city has plenty of great businesses now, Smith said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/11/19/schell-brothers-schellville-holiday-festival-rehoboth-beach/6373977001/", "title": "This winter festival is popping up behind the outlets at Rehoboth ...", "text": "A new winter festival is coming to town and it’s promising to bring all the holiday spirit – from snow machines to roller skating under twinkling lights to a beer garden and local holiday shopping.\n\nWhile Schellville was once synonymous with a Christmas village of elf-sized houses featured at Winter WonderFest – a drive-thru holiday lights experience – this year, its creators have transformed it into a full-blown holiday experience behind the Tanger Outlets in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe first-ever Schellville festival, hosted by the homebuilding company Schell Brothers, will open on Saturday, Nov. 20.\n\nHere’s what you need to know before you go.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLet's start with the best news: The overall experience is free.

The event is open and free for the public to enjoy.\n\nUpdate: The Winterfest of Lights tent and train ride will not open Thursday, Nov. 15 due to strong winds. The opening ceremony will still happen inside the Northside Park Community Center.\n\nDuring the festival ceremony on Thursday, the Ocean City Elementary School's \"OC Stars\" will be performing holiday songs and dance. Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan will also \"flip the switch\" to light the 50-foot Christmas tree, officially commencing the Winterfest celebrations.\n\nThis lights on this year's Christmas tree have been choreographed to holiday music to make a more complete experience for Winterfest attendees, said Frank Miller, special events director for Ocean City.\n\nThe Christmas tree playlist includes a blend of Bing Crosby's classic holiday songs, a modern rendition of \"Little Drummer Boy\" by Toby Mac and a classic song with a contemporary twist by violinist Jenny Oaks Baker. The songs will play on a loop as patrons watch the lights dance on the tree, Miller said.\n\n\"In the past we've always had a 50-foot tree, but with static lights,\" Miller said. \"This year's tree is innovative. It has a lot of technology built into it. I guess you could call it a smart tree.\"\n\nThe town's parks and recreation department decked out the Christmas tree with both white and RGB lights — even the garland has lights, Miller said. In total, there are about 7,000-8,000 lights on the tree.\n\nThe opening ceremony will also feature a visit from Santa Claus and free rides on the Winterfest Express train until 9:30 p.m. when the festival ends for the day.\n\nThe Winterfest Express will take passengers through a mile-long ride through more than a million sparkling lights. Sing along to the holiday music as you ride past 12 Days of Christmas, Santa's Workshop and The Wizard of Oz displays.\n\nThe visual experience people get when going to Winterfest is what's most important to Miller, he said.\n\n\"I want people to come in and have a sense of awe,\" Miller said. \"This is an experience you wouldn't see elsewhere. I want to really solidify that holiday feeling into our patrons so when they leave here, they are in the holiday spirit.\"\n\nWhen to go, what to bring to Winterfest?\n\nAfter Nov. 15, the Winterfest of Lights festivities will run until Dec. 31. On Sunday through Thursday, the hours of operation will be 5:30-9:30 p.m. and on Fridays and Saturdays the festival will be open from 5:30-10:30 p.m.\n\nAdmission to Winterfest cost $5 for those 12 years and older and anyone 11 years or younger gets in for free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at the Ocean City Community Center and the Roland E. Powell Convention Center.\n\n\"If you want to avoid long lines, come during the week and come a little later,\" Miller said.\n\nMiller's advice is to have dinner first and then arrive at Winterfest at about 7:30 p.m. when there will be less of a line to get on the tram.\n\nFor those who can't go during the week, don't worry. Although patrons may have to wait for a few minutes, the line moves relatively quickly as the tram can seat up to 75 people at a time, Miller said.\n\nIt's important for people to plan ahead before coming to Winterfest, Miller said. Since the ride is outside, patrons should check the weather beforehand in case it calls for rain.\n\n\"Bring blankets, hats and gloves,\" Miller said. \"It'll be a fun experience no matter what, but we don't want you to shiver through it.\"\n\nHot cocoa, Santa, presents and more\n\nAfter you ride along the Winterfest Express, warm up with some hot cocoa inside the Winterfest Pavillion in Northside Park.\n\nThe inside of the tent is heated so patrons can escape the outside cold, Miller said.\n\nWhile warming up in the Pavillion, you can also take photos with Santa Claus and browse the gift shop. Santa will be available for photos every night through Dec. 23. Santa photos and other items are at an additional cost.\n\nThere is also a glow hut where kids can play with glow sticks and other fun, light-up toys, Miller said.\n\nInstagram-worthy spots\n\nGet your cameras ready for these magical photo opportunities during Winterfest of Lights. Whether you're taking a selfie or getting the whole family together, the millions of twinkling lights are sure to make your photos bright and cheerful.\n\nSeveral local businesses have also set up displays as \"Instagram hot spots\" so Winterfest attendees can take the perfect holiday photo.

Here's what you need to ...", "text": "OCEAN CITY, Md. — Ocean City is making changes to Winterfest this year to accommodate COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nRather than cancel Winterfest, the Ocean City Town Council approved changes Tuesday that will allow the winter tradition to continue into its 28th year.\n\nWinterfest will still feature upwards of one million Christmas lights, but some of the event's key attractions will look different this year, said Special Events Director Frank Miller.\n\n\"The Winterfest pavilion with the items that we have inside of there, our cue line, our Santa experience, our gift shop and all the Instagram hotspots that we do, that crowd really does lack the opportunity for physical distancing,\" Miller said.\n\nThis year Winterfest will feature a condensed layout, Miller said. Visitors to the event this year will be able to walk around the half mile attraction of lights and holiday-themed decorations rather than ride on an Ocean City tram.\n\nMore:H2Oi 'disrespected our community,' but Ocean City officials say their plan worked\n\nMore:Ocean City to hire more police officers citing H2Oi, decline in seasonal officers\n\nWinterfest will also feature no closed tent structures, a new admission process, a modified Santa experience and a change to when the attraction is open.\n\nThe changes will also affect how much the event will cost the town, Miller said. The reduced layout and event changes will save the town about $250,000, but officials predict revenue will also be down this year because of COVID-19 and possibly the weather.\n\nHere are some of the key changes you should know about for the 2020 Winterfest:\n\nEvent hours are going to change\n\nWinterfest traditionally opens around Thanksgiving and runs through Christmas Day. Ocean City isn't changing that aspect of the attraction, but is reducing the number of days the event will be open this year, Miller said.\n\nWinterfest will open on Nov. 19 and close on Jan. 2, 2021, Miller said. Rather than open seven days a week like in the past, Winterfest will run from Wednesdays to Sundays.\n\n\"We will also have consistent hours across those five days, which is 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.,\" Miller said. \"Instead of having the extra hour of extended time on Fridays and Saturdays like we have traditionally.\"\n\nNo tram rides this year\n\nIn previous years, guests could enjoy a 12-minute ride around Northside Park to view the Christmas decorations and lights, Miller said. This year because of COVID-19 restrictions, the trams won't be used.\n\n\"I don't even see it as functionally possible to be able to to limit the number of people on a tram and then try to create a positive experience for everybody without them waiting at three-hour lines,\" Miller said.\n\nThe trams presented the town with some challenges because of how tightly packed the seating is, Miller said.\n\nMore:Rescued turtles go back home to the ocean\n\nMore:Meet the candidates running for Berlin mayor, town council\n\nThe Worcester County Health Department also expressed some concerns about the use of trams, Miller said. Health officials worried different groups wouldn't be able to properly social distance while on the tram.\n\nEven if groups could social distance, the trams couldn't transport many people at a single time, which would make the entire idea impractical, Miller said.\n\n\"We did have a comment during the Recreation and Parks Committee about the possibility of the driving experience and it was something that we looked at,\" Miller said. \"The route has some areas that are potentially dangerous for drivers who are not paying attention, like crossing the spillway or driving along the south end of the lagoon.\"\n\nWinterfest layout getting condensed\n\nThe footprint of Winterfest is changing this year as well.\n\nIn past years, the attraction sprawled out over much of Northside Park, with the tram ride taking guests on a one-mile ride, Miller said. This year the event will feature about a half mile walking loop around the lagoons on the south end of the park.\n\n\"They can go around this loop as many times as they want,\" Miller said. \"They can sit on the benches, they can sit on the picnic tables that we're going to provide and in rest areas, so the experience actually is enhanced for 2020 in this condensed variation.\"\n\nSome of the larger displays at Winterfest also won't be around this year, Miller said. In their place Ocean City plans to light up nearly 200 trees in different colors and plans to illuminate the bridge over the lagoon in blue lights.\n\n\"Our gift shop and our Santa area, which do require to be indoors to a degree, they will reside inside the community room in the Recreation and Parks Complex,\" Miller said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/30"}]}

You want to have a statue that is commemorating relegating black people to being property and slaves,” Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin told reporters. Birmingham faces a $25,000 fine for erecting a wooden box obscuring the inscriptions on a 52-foot obelisk honoring Confederate veterans. The mayor made the comments in Birmingham on the same day lawmakers in Montgomery debated a proposal to increase the fines for violating the law.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A veteran long-distance musher has won the 2020 Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race. Brent Sass crossed the finish line Tuesday afternoon in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, to win the 1,000-mile race, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Sass, 40, also won in 2015 and 2019. “This was a slog, there’s no doubt,” he said at the finish line. “I’ve run 13 Yukon Quests and broke trail 10 times more (in this one) than in any of the other races put together.” Michelle Phillips of Tagish Lake, Yukon, finished second four hours after Sass. Sass got down on the ground and rolled in the snow with one of his wheel dogs before standing up and working his way down the line, petting each dog. He fed them all steak chunks, starting with leaders Morello and Woody, the latter of whom had never been a leader before, Sass said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that a 2016 state law barring anyone but a family member or caregiver from returning another person’s early ballot will remain in effect while the state appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. The order from the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals means the law banning so-called ballot harvesting will remain in force through the March 17 presidential preference election. Only Democrats are voting in that election after the Republican Party chose to forego a primary. The appeals court last month found the law and a separate practice of throwing out ballots if a voter went to the wrong precinct have discriminatory effects on minority voters. The ruling also said the ballot harvesting ban was enacted with discriminatory intent. State Attorney General Mark Brnovich plans to ask the high court to overturn the decision.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A black state lawmaker plans to introduce legislation next year aimed at changing police tactics after officers drew guns on her and another black politician who had called 911 to report they were being harrassed. At a news conference Monday, Democratic state Rep. Vivian Flowers, from Pine Bluff, recalled the Feb. 3 incident outside a Little Rock fundraiser for state House candidate Ryan Davis, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Flowers and Davis said they were talking to each other on the sidewalk when two white residents questioned why the two politicians were in the neighborhood. They and one of the residents told police they then heard a gunshot. The resident also confirmed she had yelled at the pair to leave and subsequently told them to “drop dead.” Officers arrived with their guns drawn on Davis and Flowers, according to a police report.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: It’s a girl. The Los Angeles Zoo announced this week that its staff have determined the sex of a Western lowland gorilla that was born Jan. 18. The baby had spent three weeks “bonding and clinging tightly to her mother,” a zoo statement said. The baby, who doesn’t yet have a name, is the first gorilla born at the zoo in more than 20 years. She’s the first child for 25-year-old N’djia, who came to the zoo in 2018 from the San Diego Zoo as part of a breeding project. The father is a 32-year-old named Kelly. Western lowland gorillas are considered critically endangered because of poaching, diseases and habitat loss. “Every birth is a celebration, both in zoos and in the wild,” said Candace Sclimenti, curator of mammals at the L.A. Zoo. “We are thrilled about this baby because she will provide additional attention to this critically endangered species.” Mom, dad, baby and two other gorillas can be viewed at the park’s Campo Gorilla Reserve.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. immigration officials are asking a federal judge to force the city to turn over information about three men accused of crimes who are subject to deportation after Denver refused to comply with its order to do so. In a continued escalation of the conflict between federal officials and so-called sanctuary cities, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed a complaint in Denver federal court Thursday asking that a judge enforce administrative subpoenas it issued to the Denver’s sheriff department last month for information such as addresses, identification and arrest reports on the two Mexican nationals and a Honduran. Accusing ICE of seeking the information for “political reasons,” Denver said it would not comply with the subpoenas unless a judge determined they were appropriate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Police will soon begin distributing clean syringes and glass pipes in what are being called “harm reduction kits” to residents who use drugs. The kits, to be offered to those discharged from the New Haven police lockup, are also expected to include information about care and treatment options, Brillo pads to use as filters for smoking crack cocaine, sterilizing pads, cotton, condoms and a tourniquet, among other items, city officials said, according to The New Haven Register. “While many think that the primary responsibility of police is to protect and enforce the laws, for us in New Haven, the primary responsibility is the protection and the preservation of life,” police Chief Otoniel Reyes said. Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, commissioner of the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, said New Haven is the first department in the state to distribute such kits.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Federal authorities have filed a lawsuit seeking judgment against an Italian shipping line for damage allegedly caused by one of its ships to a jetty along the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. The lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Delaware said the costs of repairing damage to the jetty could exceed $3 million. Defendants in the lawsuit include the Grimaldi Group SpA and its Atlantic Container Line shipping company. Also named in the lawsuit were Capt. Colleen Moran and the vessel Atlantic Conveyor. Federal officials said the Reedy Point North Jetty was damaged in February 2017 when it was hit by the ship as it was being piloted by Moran. The jetty is a navigation structure at the confluence of the canal with the Delaware River.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform passed Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton’s bill on D.C. statehood Tuesday, sending H.R. 51 to the House floor for the first time since 1993, WUSA-TV reports. The vote was split down party lines, 21-16. The passage of the D.C. Democrat’s bill marks the first time in 27 years that members of Congress will vote on the possibility of the district becoming the 51st state, giving D.C. one House member and two senators. “We emphasized today what supporters of statehood already knew coming in: D.C. statehood is constitutional, we have a plan in place to make it happen, and it is the only way to fix the injustice of denying more than 700,000 Washingtonians a vote in Congress,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “It is fitting that this historic vote happened in the midst of Black History Month, for I dare say – achieving D.C. statehood would be black history.”\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Two dolphins have been found with gruesome, life-ending injuries along the Gulf Coast in recent weeks, and federal authorities are offering a reward of up to $20,000 to help solve the case. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one dolphin was discovered dead in waters off Naples late last week. Officials said the animal had received bullet or stab wounds – possibly both. Also last week, the Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge found a dolphin with a bullet in its left side along Pensacola Beach in the Panhandle. Experts believe the two deaths might have stemmed from humans feeding the animals. When dolphins learn to associate people and boats with food, they can expose themselves to dangerous situations. NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information that leads to those responsible. Anonymous tipsters can call 1-800-853-1964.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A firefighter is set to be suspended next week for actions he took while trying to save a 95-year-old woman from a blaze. Atlanta Fire Department Capt. Daniel Dwyer was among the firefighters responding to a house engulfed in flames last June when he entered the home by himself, located resident Sally Skrine on the ground and pulled her to safety, video from the scene showed. Skrine later died from her injuries, news outlets reported. But a “notice of final adverse action” prepared last week by the department ordered Dwyer to be suspended without pay for four days, citing his decision to enter the home alone as a breach in the safety policy of “no freelancing,” according to the complaint obtained by WXIA-TV on Monday. An official for the firefighters’ union told WAGA-TV that Dwyer made a “split-second” decision to go in and save Skrine without waiting for reinforcement because of the intensity of the fire.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The city has requested proposals from private organizations interested in providing managed, fee-based access to its famed Haiku Stairs. The city announced Tuesday that any interested party would need to restore, maintain and operate the Oahu staircase that attracts 4,000 people annually. “Haiku Stairs is a significant asset to the people of Oahu and it should be better managed, with a safe and controlled entry point that doesn’t intrude on the surrounding neighborhood,” Mayor Kirk Caldwell said in a statement. The stairs are part of a World War II-era military installation that has been officially closed to the public for decades. The attraction is still visited daily by hiking enthusiasts, and area residents have complained that some hikers trespass and vandalize their properties. The staircase has also caused injuries and costly rescues of hikers who ignore security guards and trespassing signs to climb it, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two men who combined spent nearly 40 years in prisons for crimes they didn’t commit testified Tuesday in favor of state legislation that would compensate the wrongly convicted. Christopher Tapp and Charles Fain told lawmakers on the House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee that they left prison with no resources after DNA evidence proved their innocence. Both had been convicted of murder. “Being in prison is as horrible as you can imagine, and being there when you are innocent is that much worse,” Tapp, who spent 20 years in prison, told lawmakers. Fain spent more than 17 years incarcerated, mostly on death row, where he spent 23 hours a day in a small cell. The legislation brought forward by Republican Rep. Doug Ricks would pay $60,000 a year for wrongful incarceration and $75,000 per year on death row. The committee won’t vote on whether to send the legislation to the full House until Thursday.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois Education Association on Tuesday released a report that shows Illinoisans do not have high regard for public schools outside their own communities. The association indicates in its State of Education report that 1,000 Illinois residents taking part in a poll gave a grade of “C-” to public schools, although they gave their local public schools an “A” or “B” grade. The report indicates more than half of those polled believe teachers are paid too little. Many also said they wouldn’t advise family members to become teachers. There are about 2,560 teacher positions open in Illinois. “The State of Education Report tells us we have a long way to go when it comes to fixing the teacher shortage,” IEA President Kathi Griffin said. “The people of Illinois have spoken. We need to invest in our public schools, give our educators a louder voice at the table and truly put our students first.”\n\nIndiana\n\nBristol: A traveling Smithsonian Institution exhibit on life in rural America will be on display at northern Indiana’s Elkhart County Historical Museum until mid-March. The exhibit, “Crossroads: Change Comes to Rural America,” includes photos depicting farms, forests, small towns and rivers from Alaska to New Hampshire. Visitors can also hear residents talk on video about their experiences. Museum officials have added local touches for display alongside the exhibit, including information about a family that settled in Elkhart County in 1858 and changes in agriculture, according to the South Bend Tribune. The display runs until March 15. Admission is free. Museum director Julie Parke said museum officials are excited to “spark conversations we think are important to have about the intersection of urban and rural, the tensions between agricultural and manufacturing.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Students in the Hawkeye State could soon be singing and dancing their way to meet their physical education requirements. A bipartisan bill advanced by a Senate subcommittee Tuesday would add “show choir” to the list of extracurricular activities that could excuse high school students from physical education class, just as athletics does. “This is a sport unto itself,” said Sen. Liz Mathis, D-Hiawatha, among the bill’s sponsors. “The physical exertion – no doubt about it, it should be exempt.” Currently, Iowa law requires students to participate in physical education classes each semester they are in school. But students involved in athletics can get exemptions. If the bill became law, high school principals could excuse students from the PE requirement if they’re participating in show choir for the time equivalent to PE classes and if the student needs to enroll in classes that wouldn’t otherwise be available to them.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A study reveals that universities in the state pay their instructors less compared to schools of the same size with similar programs in other states. The latest figures from the Kansas Board of Regents show state university instructors who are full-time and spend at least half their time teaching made on average $13,796 less than instructors at comparable universities in the 2019 fiscal year. In other words, instructors made 86 cents for each dollar their out-of-state peers earned. The previous year, Kansas faculty made 84 cents for every dollar paid to their peers, KCUR-FM reports. Educators say state funding for universities has fallen behind rising education costs, and they say smaller paychecks make it harder to recruit and retain talented professors. Wichita State’s provost, Rick Muma, blamed the pay gap on state funding.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Knox: The Army has selected Fort Knox for a new corps headquarters, which will bring 635 additional soldiers to the central Kentucky post, federal officials announced. The Army plans to activate V Corps Headquarters by October 2020, officials said. “Fort Knox was chosen based on time required to facilitate activation of the headquarters, cost, the ability to facilitate future expansion if required and minimizing disruption to other, current missions at the installation,” according to a letter of notification from the Pentagon, The News-Enterprise reports. The move came at the request U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Rand Paul and U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, according to a joint statement from the three Tuesday that said the headquarters is needed for national defense and to support U.S. forces and operations in Europe. In addition to boosting the post, the headquarters is expected to have a positive effect on nearby towns.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A lawsuit seeking to return federal protection to the real bears that inspired teddy bears has been thrown out by a federal judge. The people and environmental groups who sued in 2018 didn’t provide any evidence to back up their claims that they would be hurt by the decision to remove Louisiana black bears from the “threatened” list, wrote District Judge John Bates of Washington, D.C. Bates didn’t rule on the merits of the case itself, only on whether the plaintiffs had legal standing to sue, attorney Paula Dinerstein of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said Tuesday. That group, the Sierra Club, the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper organization, Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West and individual plaintiffs are considering their next step, Dinerstein said. Louisiana black bears are the largest and rarest of 16 American black bear subspecies. President Teddy Roosevelt’s refusal to shoot one in 1902 inspired the first “teddy’s bears.” The subspecies once roamed Texas and Mississippi but now is found only in a few areas in Louisiana. It was put on the “threatened” list in 1992 and removed from it in 2016.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Federal regulators don’t believe a state plan to reduce risk to endangered whales goes far enough, and that means fishermen could face more restrictions. Maine officials submitted a plan to the federal government designed to meet a requirement to better protect rare North Atlantic right whales from entanglement in lobster fishing gear. The whales number only about 400 and can die if ensnared in the gear, which is used to trap one of Maine’s best known and most valuable natural resources. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified the state in a Jan. 10 letter that its proposed package of measures would result in no more than a 52% reduction in risk to the whales. The required goal is 60%, said the letter, which was written by Michael Pentony, regional administrator for NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service’s Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Police have recovered a statue taken from the Salisbury Zoo, with the help of an accidental hero canine. The pooch who found the statue, Ghost, was honored by Mayor Jake Day and the Salisbury City Council for his valiant deed. Ghost was near the Salisbury City Dog Park with his owner when he found the missing statue. Ghost then alerted his owner, who notified police of its discovery. The statue of a great blue heron was announced stolen last week in a tweet from the Salisbury Police Department. Capt. Rich Kaiser, a spokesperson for Salisbury Police Department, said the statue was returned to the zoo with “some damage.” For his superb detective skills, Ghost is being honored with the “Goodest Boy Award.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A ballot question that would let convenience stores and other food stores in the state sell beer and wine is drawing criticism from some researchers and substance abuse coordinators who say it could result in more crime and alcohol consumption. The question would let local authorities issue licenses allowing food stores to sell wine and malt beverages to be consumed off the premises. The new licenses would be in addition to existing licenses issued for the sale of alcoholic beverages and would not include the sale of hard liquor. David Jernigan, a professor of health law and policy at the Boston University School of Public Health, said there is a close tie between the easy availability of alcohol and crime. He said because Massachusetts – and Boston by extension – has limits on the number of alcohol outlets, the relationship between alcohol outlets and violent crime is weaker than in many other cities.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A white woman who used racial slurs as she attacked a black car salesman at a dealership has avoided a jail sentence despite a tearful appeal from the victim for time behind bars. Shelly Hueckel of Nashville, Michigan, was sentenced Tuesday to two years of probation by Judge Paul Sullivan. Hueckel was convicted in December of misdemeanor assault but cleared of ethnic intimidation, a felony. Before the Kent County judge handed down Hueckel’s punishment, Terrence Smith tearfully asked that the maximum sentence be imposed. The misdemeanor conviction is punishable by up to 93 days in jail. “I was … assaulted for no reason and called a (N-word) over and over again at that point. I took every ounce of strength in me to restrain myself from defending myself, and I did it: I stood tall through an incredibly hard moment,” Smith recalled. Hueckel allegedly struck Smith repeatedly, knocking off his glasses while shouting racial slurs.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCollegeville: The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency is launching a new program to encourage anglers to switch to lead-free fishing equipment as a way to save the state bird, the loon. The campaign was created with money from the federal government’s settlement with BP over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service awarded Minnesota agencies more than $6 million from the settlement to help support its loon population after researchers found traces of oil and the chemicals used to disperse the spill in the feathers, eggs and blood of birds in Minnesota. About $1.2 million will go toward the public awareness campaign called “Get the Lead Out” over the next three years. While some states have total or partial bans on the use of lead sinkers and jigs, Minnesota’s lead-free campaign is voluntary.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State senators clashed Tuesday before passing a bill to let the state auditor see tax returns to verify the income of people enrolled in Medicaid or other public assistance programs. Supporters said the plan is designed to ensure people are not receiving benefits if they earn too much money. But critics questioned the timing and said Mississippi is looking for waste in the wrong place. The debate happened days after Auditor Shad White announced that the former director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services and five other people had been indicted on charges tied to misspending of millions of public dollars that should have been spent to help poor people. White, a Republican, called it the largest public embezzlement case in Mississippi in at least 20 years. “The timing is awful,” said Republican Sen. Josh Harkins of Flowood, sponsor of the bill that passed Tuesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson: State legislators debated a measure Tuesday that would ban public colleges and universities from offering in-state tuition to students living in the U.S. illegally. Schools in the state now risk losing state funding if they offer students with “an unlawful immigration status” anything less than the tuition rate charged to international students. That’s because of restrictions that lawmakers have placed on state funding in recent years through the budget process. Suburban St. Louis Republican Sen. Bob Onder’s bill would enshrine that budget policy in law. Democratic Sen. Lauren Arthur, who worked as a Kansas City teacher before joining the Legislature, said she previously taught students brought to the U.S. illegally as children who call Missouri home and questioned the public benefit of discouraging those students from staying in the state amid a labor shortage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and several religious groups, including the Missouri Catholic Conference, also spoke out against the proposal Tuesday.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The state has revoked 85 specialty license plates that have not been chosen or renewed by at least 400 drivers in the previous year, the state Motor Vehicles Division said. The license plates discontinued in January include some whose extra fees raise money for high school booster clubs, several high schools, animal shelters, youth sports leagues, environmental groups and other nonprofit groups. The Bitter Root Humane Association has 377 plates on the road, said treasurer Linda Williams. So for being 23 plates short, the association will lose the approximately $7,000 the license plates brought in, Williams told ABC Fox Montana. The Humane Society of Western Montana faces the loss of about $10,000 in annual funding, said development manager Katie Hofschield. A law passed last year allows people with discontinued plates to keep them until it’s time to renew their registration.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Lincoln-Lancaster County Genealogical Society needs a new home for its 8,000-piece collection. The collection has been housed at the Union College library for the past 30 years. But the college has decided to turn the collection space into a student tutoring center, said Michael George, the genealogical society president. The society has until mid-March to find a new place, or the collection will go into storage. “If all of our stuff is in boxes, it takes away from one of our core missions,” society board member Prudence Sadler told the Lincoln Journal Star. The collection includes items such as a 1924 Tobias telephone directory, the book “Abie to Yutan: Nebraska’s pictorial history” and an index to the marriage records of Lancaster County from 1866 to 1893. Sadler said the society wants to keep the collection local but has looked at locations outside of Lincoln and Lancaster County.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Nevada Air National Guard Base has proposed replacing its 25-year-old fleet of big turboprop planes that can carry troops or cargo with newer aircraft that are better for their firefighting capabilities. The base in Reno has proposed replacing its eight C-130H aircraft with the newer C-130J model, KTVN-TV reports. “They have a lot of hours on them, and we have a difficult time coming up with maintenance parts at times in the supply chain,” said 152nd Airlift Wing Commander Col. Jacob L. Hammons. Multiple senators have sent a letter to Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett requesting the planes to help firefighting efforts throughout the western U.S. The newer aircraft model provides crews with better performance and safety, Hammons said. “You’re low to the ground, you’re at heavy weight, and you’re at slow air speeds, all in a constrained environment where there is fire present,” Hammons said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nClaremont: A deer stranded on a chunk of ice on a river that caused bystanders a lot of anxiety made it across the water, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said Tuesday. Col. Kevin Jordan said an officer saw deer tracks coming out of the Sugar River onto the bank in Claremont early Tuesday. “I don’t think people are aware that deer are pretty good swimmers,” Jordan said. For hours Monday, passers-by watched the deer sitting on the ice and wondered if she could be rescued. Jordan said a rescue attempt was risky, as it could stress out the deer, and an attempt to tranquilize the animal might startle her. “She’ll jump in the water, and we’ll lose her,” he said. Officers decided to wait the situation out, hoping that with the cover of night and fewer people around, the deer would feel safe enough to swim out on her own. As for how the deer got on the ice, Jordan said she likely was pursued, probably by coyotes.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFort Lee: The state’s political scene needs, among other things, better sexual misconduct prevention training to stop widespread misogyny, according to nearly a dozen witnesses who spoke Tuesday at the first public meeting of a roving panel addressing the mistreatment of women. The Workgroup on Harassment, Sexual Assault and Misogyny in New Jersey Politics session held Tuesday in Fort Lee was the first of what are expected to be at least three public meetings. The panel is chaired by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg and included Democratic Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver, and 11 other women from across New Jersey politics. Weinberg set the panel up after a December report on NJ.com that cited dozens of instances of misconduct, including groping, unwanted advances and even assault. Tuesday’s hearing lasted over two hours and heard from nine women and one man.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A plan to spend $100 million to fix dams throughout New Mexico – the state with the highest percentage of high-hazard dams in the country – passed its first test Tuesday amid an urgent call to upgrade the facilities over worries about the loss of life. The New Mexico Senate Conservation Committee voted 9-0 to move along a measure that would add funding to address the state’s dam infrastructure that advocates say is in dire need of repairs. Sen. Pete Campos, D-Las Vegas, said the state had no choice but to get started soon on fixing dams or risk a tragedy in the future. He said the $100 million request would only cover about a third of the cost of fixing the state’s dams. Sen. Bill Soules, D-Las Cruces, said the state should spend the money to fix its dams while it has revenue from an oil and gas windfall. “We may not have the money later,” Soules said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: As jail populations continue to plummet across the state, New York’s governor is proposing to allow counties to opt into regional lockups instead of solely operating their own facility. The legislation from Gov. Andrew Cuomo is one in a long list of policy proposals included within his state budget proposal, on which lawmakers continue to hold hearings this week. The governor’s office says the legislation will allow counties to lower costs by not maintaining their own separate facility. Newly released data from the state shows that New York’s total jail population plunged by 30% from January 2019 to last month. Most of that decline has come in the past few months, something reform advocates say is tied to the rollout of a state law that eliminates cash bail for the wide majority of misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The fate of a Confederate statue torn down by protesters was thrown back into uncertainty Wednesday when a judge overturned a settlement by the University of North Carolina’s governing board that gave the monument to a Confederate heritage group along with money to preserve it. Judge Allen Baddour ruled in Orange County court that the Sons of Confederate Veterans didn’t have standing to bring the lawsuit that led to the hastily arranged deal that gave them possession of the statue known as Silent Sam, along with $2.5 million to maintain it. He vacated the settlement and dismissed the underlying lawsuit brought by the SCV. Critics had questioned how the deal was quietly struck between the Confederate group and the UNC Board of Governors in a way that allowed the lawsuit and settlement to be filed in quick succession and then approved by Baddour just before Thanksgiving.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The U.S. Commercial Service says that excluding oil, the state exported more than $2.2 billion worth of products last year, which is nearly an 11% decrease from 2018. The state’s export decline was led by soybeans and machinery, including farm implements. Soybean exports decreased 55% between 2018 and 2019. Data shows North Dakota exported about $30 million worth of soybeans in 2019, down from $66.9 million the year before. The value of machinery dropped from $652 million to $488 million, a 25% decrease. Some exports of crops saw an increase, including the state’s durum, wheat and corn. Crude oil, the state’s largest export, made up about 67% of North Dakota’s in total exports in 2019, down slightly from 2018.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A fiscal analyst has warned lawmakers that a proposal to make it harder to raise the state income tax could harm Ohio’s bond rating. At issue is a proposed constitutional amendment that would impose a supermajority requirement in both chambers for the General Assembly to raise such taxes. States with similar supermajority requirements have seen their credit ratings lowered, Zach Schiller, research director at the nonpartisan organization Ohio Policy Matters, told the Senate Ways and Means Committee Tuesday, according to Gongwer News Service. “It would constrain the state’s ability to fund critical programs, limit policymakers’ options during recessions and undermine the democratic process,” Schiller said. Lower bond ratings can affect the rates at which governments can borrow money, among other things.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt and Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell unveiled the state’s new brand Wednesday after a months­long creative process that started last summer. The colorful new logo and tagline that implores people to imagine all of the state’s possibilities will appear on state agency websites, tourism efforts and new “Welcome to Oklahoma” signs. In future years, the logo also may appear on license plates. A handful of new welcome signs at various entry points to the state will be installed starting Thursday. The colorful elements of the logo, inspired by nature, form a circle intended to highlight Oklahoma as a hub at the center of America. The tagline “Imagine that,” which also will be used on promotional materials, attempts to convey what makes Oklahoma unique as a state that defies expectations, provides opportunities and lets people dream about their potential, Pinnell said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: People seeking winter vistas of the north Oregon coast will need to find them elsewhere as Ecola State Park near Cannon Beach has been closed indefinitely. The park is closed south of the Indian Beach day-use area, after a large section of the Crescent Beach trail slid over the cliff, damaged the entrance road and disconnected the park’s main waterline over the weekend, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department said. The affected section of road is an old repair made of compacted gravel, damaged as the hillside beneath the road gave way. That same landslide also cut off all running water in the park. Visitors at Ecola on Sunday were all escorted out safely, officials said. The state parks department said visitors can still access the park’s Indian Beach day-use area via the Tillamook Head Trail but can’t travel farther south into the park.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A court this week will consider a legal challenge by three transgender women to a two-decade-old state law that prohibits people who have committed serious felonies from ever changing their names. Commonwealth Court will hear oral arguments Thursday in the lawsuit brought by plaintiffs who live as women but are unable to change their masculine first names because of a 1998 state law designed to prevent fraud. Pennsylvania law requires anyone convicted of a felony to wait at least two years after completion of their sentence to apply for a name change, and those convicted of certain more serious felonies are permanently barred from changing their names. People have a fundamental right to control their own names, and that can’t be overridden by a legal presumption that felons are engaging in fraud when they seek a name change, the women’s lawyers wrote in a court filing in May.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Most of the state’s municipalities have websites that do not use the domain name for government entities, according to a WJAR-TV report. The television station reviewed websites for Rhode Island’s 39 municipalities and found that 29 of them use a domain name that does not end in .gov. Cybersecurity experts recommend using .gov for security and so that residents know they are on a legitimate government website. Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, when told of the findings, said she would contact the 29 municipalities and offer federal funding that has been allocated to Rhode Island to make the switch. She said it’s a good investment because of the risk of cyberattacks. The Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns said municipalities would welcome the opportunity to make their websites and networks more secure, especially if the program helps defer costs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster tapped a retired U.S. Army major general Tuesday to be his second choice to run the state’s new Department of Veteran’s Affairs. Maj. Gen. William Grimsley of Beaufort came highly recommended before McMaster chose state Rep. Bobby Cox to lead the agency in December. So after Cox was found ineligible under a state law preventing a lawmaker to run an agency created during his term, the governor said Grimsley was an easy second choice. Grimsley, 62, served in the Army for 33 years, finishing his military career as senior commander at Fort Hood, Texas, and chief of staff of the United States Strategic Command. Grimsley is currently president of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Foundation and a coach and trainer at strategic planning firm Broomfield Creek.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Native American groups opposed to the Keystone XL oil pipeline told state lawmakers Wednesday that Gov. Kristi Noem’s plan to restore criminal penalties for encouraging riots would result in peaceful protesters being silenced. The Republican governor proposed updates to the so-called riot-boosting laws after a judge struck down efforts last year to allow the state and counties to prosecute disruptive demonstrations against the pipeline. Several Indian tribes in the state opposed the bill, putting a strain on the governor’s relationship with the tribes. The new proposal sailed through a House committee on Wednesday, as Native American groups testified, prayed and protested at the Capitol. Lester Thompson, chairman of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, said the First Amendment already protects a person’s to protest, and the law would put protesters in a defensive position, vulnerable to laws that do not make it clear what constitutes violence during a riot. “It could be me raising my fist,” said Derrick Marks, a committee member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe. “Is that considered riot boosting? Is that considered violence?”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A proposal to include feminine hygiene products during the state’s annual sales-tax holiday faced resistance Tuesday from lawmakers concerned about the lack of limit on such purchases. The legislation is the latest evolution of a push to eliminate the so-called tampon tax on items such as tampons and menstrual pads. The bill would allow these products to be tax-free during Tennessee’s three day weekend when certain goods – ranging from $1,500 computers to $100 clothing items – can be purchased tax-free. The weekend is held the last Friday in July, when most families are preparing for the new school year. Republicans inside the GOP-dominant Statehouse have pushed back against proposals to remove the “tampon tax.” “I would think since it’s a sales tax holiday, there’s really no limit on the number of items anybody can purchase,” said Sen. Joey Hensley, a Republican from Hohenwald. “I don’t know how you would limit the number of items someone could purchase.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: Lawyers for the suspect in a shooting at a Walmart that left 22 people dead waived a federal bond hearing and the reading of the indictment Wednesday, as survivors of the attack teared up and consoled one another. Patrick Crusius, of Allen, Texas, is already being held without bond on state charges. His attorneys waived a reading of his 90-count federal indictment in which he was charged with hate crimes in the shooting, which targeted Latinos in the border city of El Paso. He has also been charged with capital murder under Texas state law. Attorney David Lane asked a federal judge to waive a bond hearing for Crusius, 21, who is already being held without bond on the state charges under tight security at the El Paso County jail. Crusius stood silently by Lane and showed no emotion as his attorney took questions from a federal judge.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State lawmakers say they won’t consider proposals that could censure or recall U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney following his vote to convict in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson said the GOP caucus decided not to advance either proposal following a “robust debate” behind closed doors. Instead, Wilson will be presenting a citation thanking the president for his administration’s work on issues “critical to Utah.” The citation will also urge Congress to put the contentious process behind them. Utah Senate leaders have already signaled support for that ide, but little appetite for publicly rebuking Romney. Romney returned to Utah the day after his vote, which set off a wave of national GOP anger, to explain his decision to legislative leaders. That seemed to mollify some concerns from lawmakers, one of him had introduced a resolution to publicly rebuke him.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott has vetoed a bill that would have increased the state’s minimum wage. In a message sent to lawmakers, the Republican governor said raising the minimum wage to $12.55 an hour by 2022 from the current $10.96 could end up decreasing employee hours and increasing the costs of goods and services. “I believe this legislation would end up hurting the very people it aims to help,” Scott said in a statement issued by his office. When the minimum wage bill passed the House, it did not have enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto. State Sen. Tim Ashe, a Democrat and progressive who supported the increase, said the governor’s decision “wiped out nearly $5,000 in income” for Vermonters struggling to get by. “Make no mistake, this is a battle between the Governor and the tens of thousands of Vermonters who don’t seem to fit into his hollow affordability slogan,” Ashe said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state House and Senate passed sweeping energy legislation Tuesday that would overhaul how utilities generate electricity and, supporters say, move the state from the back of the pack to the forefront of renewable energy policy in the United States. Critics, though, warned that the legislation, drafted privately by a group that included industry representatives and environmental advocates, strips state regulators of some oversight and leaves ratepayers on the hook for what could be excessive costs. The measure, called the Clean Economy Act, lays out a plan to get Virginia to 100% renewable generation. The House version would demand that goal be met by 2045, and the Senate’s version sets a deadline of 2050, in line with a goal Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam set in an executive order in September.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state House has passed a measure that would ban race-based discrimination against hair texture and hairstyles. The measure passed on a bipartisan 87-10 vote Wednesday and heads to the Senate for consideration. If passed by the Senate and signed by Gov. Jay Inslee, Washington would join three other states with such a ban: California, New York and New Jersey. The bill amends the Washington Law Against Discrimination so that the term “race” includes traits historically associated or perceived to be associated with race, including hairstyles like afros, braids, locks and twists. Under the measure, people could file claims with the state’s Human Rights Commission if they believe they were discriminated against because of their hair.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Educators would have to teach students about suicide prevention under a bill passed Wednesday by the state Senate. Lawmakers voted 33-0 to approve the bill, which would require that teachers, students and other school officials get training on suicide prevention and awareness. Sen. Ryan Weld, a Brooke County Republican, sponsored the measure and described a “grim” set of statistics on the rising rates of youth suicide. Figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show suicide was the eighth leading cause of death in West Virginia in 2017, the most recently available data. Nationally, suicide was the second leading cause of death among people between the ages of 10 and 24. The proposal now moves to the House of Delegates for consideration.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly approved a bill Tuesday that would make bestiality a felony. Having sex with an animal is a misdemeanor under current law. The bill would create a new crime punishable by up to 121/ 2 years in prison. Sentences would vary depending on the circumstances, such as whether the animal dies and whether a child is present or coerced into sex with an animal. Convicts would have to register as sex offenders. The measure’s author, Republican Sen. Andre Jacque, introduced the same bill last legislative session after a Town of Eaton man was convicted of molesting a horse. The Assembly passed the bill, but it died in the Senate. This time around, the Senate approved the bill on a voice vote in October with no debate. The Assembly passed it on a voice vote late Tuesday evening, also with no debate. The measure goes next to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ desk.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State officials plan a series of public meetings to help them determine how to protect the last bighorn sheep in the Teton Range. They’re seeking recommendations from the public on an issue that could lead to closing off more areas in western Wyoming to backcountry skiing. Research suggests backcountry skiing displaces sheep from some of their best habitat, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Bighorn sheep used to be abundant in the Tetons but now number only about 100. They’re divided into two subpopulations that don’t mingle. Wyoming Game and Fish Department wildlife biologist Aly Courtemanch says the agency seeks specific recommendations from the public on how to help the sheep. The public meetings will be held in February, March and April.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/13"}]}

After all, it's strange to think of Laviolette, a man who is considered a little gruff around the edges, being so fond of such a tranquil animal.\n\nBut a look closer into Laviolette's past reveals that such a pet is perfect for the man tasked with guiding the Predators into a new era.\n\n\"It may be descriptively accurate,\" said former Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Aaron Ward, who played for Laviolette. \"First, the fact that he is a coach and what may have prevented him from having an extended career was his skating — I've never seen him at top speed.\n\n\"Also, turtles seem very calculated about making decisions, and that's something I would say was very accurate about him. He's a man that thinks long and hard about how he goes about things.\"\n\nTalk to his former players, and it's clear they respect Laviolette. Wherever he has gone, he has initially breathed new life into the organization. He has boosted offense and brought innovation, motivation and postseason success. Those are big reasons the Predators hired him after missing the playoffs the past two seasons under Barry Trotz.\n\n\"He gets it,\" Ward said. \"It's simple. He gets the player. He's not only tactically sound, but he thinks outside the box. And that's what you need.\"\n\nThe early years\n\nLaviolette fits the norm for most NHL coaches. They may not have been the most skilled players, but they were shaped by their experiences to \"think the game\" at a higher level.\n\nLaviolette's NHL playing career spanned just 12 contests with the New York Rangers as a defenseman during the 1988-89 season.\n\nHe didn't go to a top hockey-producing school such as Boston College, Boston University or the University of Minnesota. Instead, he went to Westfield State in Massachusetts, and when he started reaching the higher levels of the sport, he had learned that he would have to work for his chances.\n\n\"Once he got the opportunity he kept showing he belonged there, regardless of where he played or where he came from,\" said Jim Johannson, who played with Laviolette on the 1988 U.S. Olympic team. \"Quickly he became a good teammate and clearly was a student of the game at that stage, growing into a new experience and adapting quickly and being around some talented players and fitting in.\"\n\nWhether it was with Team USA or the Rangers, Laviolette played with some top defensemen, such as Brian Leetch, Eric Weinrich and James Patrick. In order to keep up, Laviolette had to take a more cerebral approach to hockey.\n\n\"I think in Peter's case, he realized what he needed to be to fit into the groups that we had, and that's hockey sense, that's awareness, that's perception of where you are as a player,\" said Johannson, who now works with as USA Hockey's assistant executive director of hockey operations.\n\nRight coach at the right time\n\nWhen Laviolette was hired as the coach of the Carolina Hurricanes during the 2003-04 season, it wasn't ceremonial. In his 52 games, he went 20-26-6-0 and missed the playoffs.\n\nBut during the NHL's locked out 2004-05 season, Laviolette began to look into ways to systematically improve the Hurricanes.\n\nHe had a sense the rules were going to change — such as the elimination of the red line and harsher penalties for clutching and grabbing — and he prepared his schemes accordingly. The Hurricanes had a group of youthful, fleet-footed forwards. The only issue was getting the most out of them.\n\nLaviolette figured out a way.\n\nWhen the NHL came back for the 2005-06 season, Carolina became an aggressive, attacking bunch that utilized young speedsters Eric Staal (100 points), Justin Williams (76) and Erik Cole (59 points in 60 games). Even players north of age 30, such as captain Rod Brind'Amour and Cory Stillman, finished with more than 70 points.\n\nThat team would go on to win the Stanley Cup with a 52-22-8 record and the No. 3 offense in the league.\n\n\"I couldn't believe how fast we were,\" Hurricanes equipment manager Wally Tatomir said. \"Even the first game we played in Tampa. I could not believe how fast we were. I knew we were fast, but I didn't believe we were that fast.\"\n\nPart of it was Laviolette's system, but part of it was his ability to get the most out of players through motivational techniques. For Laviolette, that was speeches. He is known as one of the most inspirational coaches in the NHL from a speaking perspective, a reputation that was burnished in Carolina.\n\nEarly in the season, Ward was confused as to why Laviolette put the lifelong defenseman at forward for a game. So he walked into Laviolette's office and asked him.\n\nThe coach listened to Ward's issues and said, \"I'm trying to get you to realize that you're not what you think you are, and there's more to you than what you think you are, and you have not shown that to me.\"\n\nWard accepted the challenge and enjoyed playing for Laviolette so much that when his contract was expiring he almost took less money to stay with the Hurricanes.\n\n\"He finds a way to get through to them on an individual level, and on a team basis he finds that way too, and he does a great job of managing it,\" Ward said.\n\nWith his Philadelphia Flyers team that made a surprise run to a Stanley Cup Final in 2010 as a seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, Laviolette took the foundation of what he was given as a midseason coaching hire, and molded it to its strengths.\n\nHe added an offensive flair to the team that already had a strong group of defensemen led by Chris Pronger and Kimmo Timonen.\n\n\"I think Peter changed a lot of things that made us a more offensively dangerous team while sticking with our defensive system that was already in place,\" said former Flyers general manager Paul Holmgren. \"It ended up being good timing for our organization with the change in style.\"\n\nLaviolette's methods aren't just used behind closed doors. He seems to know the right time to utilize in-game timeouts to switch momentum. This happened during Philadelphia's run, in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Final against Boston, with the Flyers down 3-0 in the first period. The Flyers quickly scored afterward and came back to win the game.\n\nSaid Flyers forward and former Predators Scott Hartnell: \"Lavy is going to bring some intensity into that dressing room, and passion onto the ice.\"\n\nThe right man for Nashville?\n\nPredators general manager David Poile said he saw Laviolette as the perfect fit. He wanted an offensive-minded coach who knew how to win in a non-traditional market and had a Stanley Cup pedigree.\n\nLaviolette fit all of Poile's criteria.\n\n\"The norm in Nashville is one or two players who are your offensive output and the rest fall into place,\" Ward said. \"This is a guy who will be like, 'No, no. it's a five-man unit.' And it makes for a heck of a lot more exciting hockey.\"\n\nBut for a market that is so used to consistency -- Trotz had his job for 15 seasons -- there is one red flag with Laviolette. Why was he fired in Carolina and in Philadelphia?\n\nBoth situations are far more political, with a one owner setup (Peter Karmanos in Carolina, Ed Snider in Philadelphia) that can lead to a more meddlesome routine.\n\nWhile Nashville's multi-owner group has its own issues, such a structure may make things easier in some ways for Laviolette. He can just coach, and not worry about any off-ice problems.\n\nHe can focus on trying to make underachievers like Colin Wilson and Viktor Stalberg reach their potential. And he can put his imprint on an offense that finished 19th in the NHL last year and revitalize a defense core that includes Shea Weber, Roman Josi and Seth Jones.\n\n\"You compare Nashville to where Carolina was in 2006, this could be another situation,\" Ward said. \"Not that they're going to go on a run to the Stanley Cup Final, but I think this guy can help them find the success and consistency that have escaped them for a while.\"\n\nReach Josh Cooper at 615-726-8917 and on Twitter @joshuacooper.\n\nPETER LAVIOLETTE\n\n• Hometown: Franklin, Mass.\n\n• Hired:As head coach of the Nashville Predators on May 13, 2014.

They also ended an 18-game home losing streak, which was one shy of another NBA record.\n\nBeaten badly a number of times during their skid, the 76ers got to experience life on the other side, ringing up a season-high 70 points in the first half.\n\nTheir 26 straight losses equaled the 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers and also the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who dropped 26 straight from Sept. 12, 1976-Dec. 4, 1977.\n\n\"We were just happy to get a win,\" Young said. \"I don't think it was for the streak or anything like that, we just wanted to go out there and win a basketball game and continue to just play.\"\n\nHenry Sims added 16 points for the Sixers, who hadn't won before their home crowd since beating Charlotte on Jan. 15. Fans in the crowd of 17,438 were into it from the start and grew louder throughout, standing and cheering in the final seconds of the third and then getting up again to deliver a standing ovation for the final 45 seconds of the game.\n\nGreg Monroe had 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Pistons, who lost for the 11th time in 13 games. Blown out a night earlier by Miami, they made the 76ers look as good as the Heat with a sloppy effort that included 18 turnovers, many after starting point guard Brandon Jennings was ejected in the first quarter.\n\n\"They came out and competed tonight. They wanted it more than we did,\" Pistons guard Rodney Stuckey said.\n\nThe Sixers were expected to be among the NBA's worst teams, though they briefly fooled everyone when they opened the season by beating Miami and Chicago during a 3-0 start. But they look nothing like that team now, having traded three of their top players before February's trade deadline and replacing them with what coach Brett Brown said is the youngest team in league history, one that has been unprepared or perhaps just unqualified to win NBA games.\n\nThere is young talent on the roster, with Carter-Williams the possible Rookie of the Year and Nerlens Noel, still out recovering from a torn ACL, also a lottery pick in last year's draft. Brown doesn't question the Sixers' plans or his decision to leave San Antonio to come coach here, insisting the team was headed in the right direction and that all this losing \"will be a distant memory in September.\"\n\n\"Our judgment day isn't today and it won't be tomorrow,\" Brown said before the game. \"We're on a three to five-year plan.\"\n\nThe present was finally fun on Saturday.\n\nThe 76ers opened a 10-point lead after one, capitalizing on some free throws when Jennings picked up two technical fouls arguing a call that wasn't even against him and was ejected with 1:18 left. A 9-0 run made it 55-38 with about 5½ minutes left in the half, and when Detroit crept within 10 with 1:32 remaining, Philadelphia closed with another 9-0 spurt to open a 70-51 cushion at the break.\n\nThe 76ers extended it to 32 late in the third, and Brown pulled his five starters together with 5:13 left and a 30-point bulge. There was no visible celebration, though there was surely some relief.\n\n\"There was some emotion,\" Carter-Williams said. \"Of course we were happy to win again, it's a great thing to be on the winning side.\"\n\nNotes: The Dallas Mavericks lost 19 straight home games during the 1993-94 season. … Monroe played in his 300th NBA game. … Philadelphia's previous high was 68 points in the first half of a 114-102 victory at Denver on New Year's Day.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2023/09/28/bucks-fans-hustle-to-buy-tickets-as-prices-jump-up-after-lillard-trade/70994042007/", "title": "Bucks tickets in high demand after Lillard trade; new jerseys printed", "text": "Damian Lillard hasn't played one second as a Milwaukee Buck, but the franchise is already feeling the \"Dame\" effect.\n\nTicket prices for the Bucks' home opener against the Philadelphia 76ers on Oct. 26 have shot up to more than $120 per ticket on the resale market and season-ticket packages are in high demand.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2023/10/17/bucks-brewers-still-on-bally-sports-wisconsin-but-futures-in-flux-this-timeline-explains-why/71214985007/", "title": "Bucks, Brewers still on Bally Sports Wisconsin but future's in flux", "text": "Heading into the Milwaukee Bucks season, it'll be status quo for fans who want to catch the broadcasts on television, with Bally Sports Wisconsin airing games that aren't already nestled on national airwaves.\n\nThat'll include the Bucks' second home game against the Atlanta Hawks Oct. 29, three days after the season opener at Fiserv Forum against the Philadelphia 76ers, which will air on TNT.\n\nBut anyone who's followed the saga of Bally Sports Wisconsin, and particularly its operator, Diamond Sports Group, knows that the situation is fluid. Diamond remains in the process of bankruptcy and the restructuring that comes with it, and it's unclear how that resolves.\n\nHere's a timeline of how the situation unfolded, including the latest news that the Milwaukee Brewers are among teams now pressuring Diamond to come up with a viable plan or liquidate.\n\nOctober 2023: MLB tells Diamond to hurry up\n\nMajor League Baseball told a Houston bankruptcy court that Diamond Sports Group should not be granted another extension to arrive at a Chapter 11 reorganization plan, noting that Diamond's cash has dwindled by nearly 90% since seeking bankruptcy protection in March.\n\nThe Brewers were one of five clubs participating in the joint filing, along with Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit and Texas.\n\nDiamond is asking for a Nov. 29 deadline to submit a plan, which would give creditors until Jan. 29 to approve it.\n\nThe current deal between Sinclair/Diamond and Charter, which operates Spectrum (servicing Milwaukee), expires Feb. 29 before the end of the NBA season and before the start of the 2024 baseball season. Renewal is no sure thing, especially after Disney networks disappeared from Charter airwaves for 10 days during a carriage dispute earlier this year.\n\nOctober 2023: Wes Edens says no Bucks games will be missing from television\n\nRegardless of what happens, Bucks co-owner Wes Edens indicated that behind-the-scenes machinations have guaranteed that, if Diamond loses the rights to the Bucks broadcasts, the games will be available for broadcast somewhere.\n\nSeptember 2023: NBA teams begin offering own broadcasts\n\nThe Utah Jazz announce that they would launch a direct-to-consumer service for game broadcasts, circumventing the need for any other broadcast partner. The Phoenix Suns announced something similar shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers announced their own intent in October to launch alternate feeds for most of their games in a new offering called \"ClipperVision.\"\n\nAugust 2023: Sinclair wants an accelerated divorce from Diamond\n\nSinclair Broadcast Group told a court it wanted a faster breakup from its bankrupt sports broadcasting unit. Diamond and Sinclair have been going through a contentious separation complicated by Diamond's bankruptcy.\n\nElsewhere, Warner Brothers Discovery (with presence in Houston, Seattle, Portland, Pittsburgh and Denver) also announces it intends to get out of the regional sports network (RSN) business.\n\nJuly 2023: Arizona Diamondbacks disappear from Diamond\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks became the second team to reclaim its broadcasting rights after Diamond was unable to make payments. As with the Padres previously, MLB swooped in and began broadcasting games.\n\nJuly 2023: Diamond Sports sues its parent company, Sinclair\n\nDiamond, accusing Sinclair of fraudulently withdrawing funds from the regional sports business, sues Sinclair. Sinclair acquired Diamond as a subsidiary in the $10 billion deal to obtain the RSNs from Disney.\n\nMay 2023: San Diego Padres games disappear\n\nThe San Diego Padres became the first team to reclaim its broadcasting rights after Diamond Sports Group was unable to make payments. Major League Baseball immediately entered the picture and arranged for local airing of the games, a transition that appears seamless.\n\nApril 2023: Adam Silver says NBA needs to 'reimagine' partnership\n\nCiting a large number of young fans who'd classify as \"cord-cutters,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said that the league needs to reimagine its partnership with RSNs, specifically referring to Diamond.\n\nJanuary 2023: Diamond files for bankruptcy\n\nUnable to make all of its payments to teams for broadcasting rights, Diamond officially begins the bankruptcy process.\n\nDecember 2022: Scripps announces a sports division\n\nOne potential carrier for games if the current RSN model falls apart is Scripps, which began a sports division and, less than a year later, appears to be one player to take over the rights if Diamond Sports Group loses them.\n\nScripps, which already has deals with the Las Vegas Golden Knights and Arizona Coyotes by the start of the 2023 hockey season, has seven channels in the Milwaukee area. That includes WTMJ-TV (Channel 4), BounceTV, Grit, Laff, ION Mystery, QVC2 and ShopLC, all available over the air (channels 4.1 through 4.7).\n\nSeptember 2022: Bankruptcy talk has begun\n\nThe maligned deal by Sinclair to acquire regional sports networks has reached the point where bankruptcy appears as a likely destination. That's despite Diamond Sports Group's ability to launch a direct-to-consumer option midway through the baseball season.\n\nJune 2022: Bally Sports app gets up and running\n\nFans in Milwaukee and four other markets now have a \"direct-to-consumer\" option to watch Brewers and Bucks games with the offering of a Bally Sports Wisconsin app that offers games without a cable or satellite subscription.\n\nOctober 2021: The RSN purchase was pretty clearly a bad move\n\nWith Sinclair unable to strike a deal with a streaming company to pay for RSNs and a shaky business model to make sports programming profitable, Sinclair appears to be in bad shape two years after acquiring the regional sports networks from Disney.\n\nMarch 2021: Fox Sports Wisconsin (and other networks) rebrand as Bally Sports\n\nIt might be a bit confusing since Fox Sports Wisconsin was no longer a Fox asset, operated by Sinclair for a season, but Diamond officially rebranded those channels to Bally Sports Wisconsin, reflecting a new partnership that would theoretically bring in gaming money.\n\nFebruary 2021: Brewers re-up with Fox Sports Wisconsin\n\nThe Brewers and Sinclair reached a multiyear deal to continue broadcasting games. Streaming television expert Jason Gurwin noted the team didn't have a ton of other options.\n\n\"For now, either the option was either re-up with Sinclair or they could have theoretically tried to do a direct-to-consumer business where the Brewers partner with the Bucks and maybe get the rights to the (Minnesota) Wild and do their own thing, but the economics to that are challenging as well,\" Gurwin said.\n\nDecember 2020: Cord-cutters lose access to Fox Sports Wisconsin\n\nWith fan attendance limited by the constraints of the pandemic, it became distressing news to cord-cutters that streaming services such as YouTubeTV or Hulu+Live TV had dropped the Sinclair channels in recent months, and the only way to watch Bucks (and eventually Brewers) games would be via cable or satellite.\n\nIn 2022, fans indicated a lack of connection to the Brewers, perhaps related to dwindling access of broadcasts, contributed to fan-attendnace decline.\n\nAugust 2019: Sinclair acquires RSNs from Disney\n\nOn Aug. 23, Sinclair and the Walt Disney Company announced the completion of Sinclair's RSN acquisition. The maneuver was a required step for Disney, ordered by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds, to complete its acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets in a landscape-shaking merger first announced in late 2017.

The D-League draft. Robert Covington simply took a roster spot that once belonged to a former All Star. Malcolm Thomas, a D-League All Star.\n\nThe 76ers have sold fans on the \"Together We Build\" slogan. But all they've built is a D-League team at NBA prices.\n\nAround Philly, rebuilding has a different nickname: Tankadelphia.\n\nLarry Brown, the vagabond coach who led the Sixers to the 2001 NBA finals, said the last two seasons have \"made me sick to my stomach.\"\n\n\"Can you imagine telling Allen Iverson that this is a rebuilding season so we're going to be bad on purpose?\" he said last month.\n\nBledsoe, the Phoenix Suns guard and former Kentucky standout, said Wednesday that the top-ranked Wildcats could defeat the 76ers.\n\nThat's certainly in doubt. But not Wednesday's result at the Wells Fargo Center: Boston Celtics 101, 76ers 90.\n\n\"We have to keep the locker room together,\" Brown said. \"We have to keep our guys believing that if they don't cheat days, if they really come in and invest in what we're selling, then we believe we have a chance of finding some wins.\"\n\nBut when?\n\nThe Sixers play Friday against Bledsoe and the Suns, then hit the road Saturday against the 3-10 New York Knicks. Maybe the Knicks are the tonic for what ails the Sixers. It can't be worse than last week when the Sixers were thumped 100-75 against San Antonio and 123-70 against Dallas.\n\nCarter, who played on that 1972-73 Sixers team and would coach the team in the 1990s, said this year's team is worse because of how open the franchise has been about the plan to hit bottom for a few seasons before potentially climbing back into contention with great draft picks.\n\n\"There was no intentional dumping. There was no plan to lose games to get better because people didn't think that way,\" Carter said. \"Dump a whole season like what's being done now? It's really sickening to the stomach to hear and see that.\"\n\nThe 76ers hope a nucleus of Michael Carter-Williams, Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel and Dario Saric can become winners in three or four seasons.\n\nIn a column for Derek Jeter's new sports website, The Players' Tribune, Carter-Williams wrote that he escaped from the grind by watching \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" with his stepfather.\n\nDeGeneres read the column, thanked MCW for watching, and said, \"I'm sorry you're having a tough season.\" She said everyone on the Ellen team was rooting for him — and brought out characters like Giggles the Clown, Nick the Gardener, and Dave the Stagehand.\n\nSomewhere, Hinkie had to wonder if he could sign them to 10-day contracts.\n\n\"Allen Iverson was figuratively castrated for saying, 'practice, practice, practice,'\" Carter said. \"What the organization is doing is intentionally losing.

Arriving Sept. 1 in a stunning trade from the Utah Jazz, Mitchell was plagued by bad luck for much of the night.\n\nAt the very least, perhaps he enjoyed the flaming swords during pregame, which he mentioned in his introductory press conference and sat and watched from the end of the bench.\n\nMitchell went scoreless in nearly 10 first-quarter minutes, committing three turnovers and two personal fouls. In that span, he contributed three defensive rebounds, an assist and a steal. He was 0-for-3 from the field, 0-for-2 from long range.\n\nBut Mitchell showed his competitiveness the rest of the way. He finished with 11 points (3-for-9, 2-for-5), five rebounds, three assists and a steal in 27 minutes before leaving the game for good with 1:32 remaining in the third quarter.\n\nCenter Jarrett Allen led the way for the Cavs with 19 points, 12 rebounds and a blocked shot.

How do we do more for Darius and Caris and all those guys? So this is a great opportunity for us to just see it from other opponents, and what teams are going to try to do and what they're going to try to take away, and then we make our adjustments to help. \"\n\nMitchell was encouraged by shouts of \"Let's go, Donovan\" before he finally broke into the scoring column, that with a free throw after a 76ers' lane violation with 4:58 left in the second quarter. That was quickly followed by a dunk on an assist by Garland.\n\nOne shot showed just how dangerous Mitchell can be when he's in rhythm. With 5:59 left in the third quarter, Garland hit Mitchell in the perfect pocket and Mitchell drained a seemingly effortless 3-pointer. With 1:46 left in the third quarter, Mitchell bombed in a 35-footer, this one off a pass from rookie forward Isaiah Mobley.\n\nBickerstaff continued to experiment with his rotations without one of his cogs, 7-foot center/forward Evan Mobley, who will miss the preseason with a sprained right ankle.

Joel Embiid conceded he should not have played. With Philadelphia's All-Star cornerstones absent or injured, Kevin Durant and Brooklyn had the opening they needed to spoil the 76ers' opener with a rally down the stretch.\n\nDurant had 29 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists, James Harden scored 20 points and the Nets closed with a 16-1 run to beat the 76ers 114-109 on Friday night as each team played without a much-discussed star guard.\n\n“My role tonight, I felt, was getting into the paint, making plays,” Durant said. “We've got to keep building on this and see where we can go.”\n\nThe Nets were missing Kyrie Irving, who isn’t with the team due to his refusal to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Ben Simmons sat out the home opener for personal reasons and the Sixers do not know when the three-time All-Star will return.\n\nThey could have used Simmons' defense to shut down the Nets late.\n\nThe Sixers tossed up airballs on consecutive possessions early in Brooklyn's run. The Nets had never led or tied until LaMarcus Aldridge’s dunk with 48 seconds left made it 108-108. He sank the free throw for the one-point lead.\n\nDurant made two free throws to seal Brooklyn's comeback from 14 points down.\n\n“Sure, we made a lot of plays down the stretch, but that was more because of our willingness to keep going,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. “Their willingness to compete and believe is the reason they won the game.”\n\nEmbiid scored 19 points on a sore right knee suffered against New Orleans in the opener. He left for the locker room in the final moments of the first half on Friday and warmed up at halftime with a wrap on his knee but started the third quarter. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry each scored 23 points for the Sixers.\n\n“I probably shouldn't have played but it's good to be out there with the guys,” Embiid said.\n\nSimmons has not played since his offseason trade demand.

The parking lots found bootleg T-shirt sales of Simmons on a “MISSING” poster.\n\nHarris said the Sixers and fans need to rally around Simmons.\n\n“In this space, you’re depicted as superhuman, not really supposed to have feelings or go through anything,” Harris said. “I think we have to really understand he’s human first. And you know, if he’s going through something at this time, we have to respect that.”\n\nDurant and Harden were a two-player show until the fourth, and the Nets had no answers when Tyrese Maxey, Simmons’ replacement, scored five straight points early in the quarter that pushed the lead to double digits.\n\nHarris hit Matisse Thybulle on an alley-oop that made it 108-98 and even made Embiid rise off the bench in celebration. The Sixers would not score again until Curry made 1 of 2 free throws with 15.2 seconds left to make it 111-109 and the collapse was complete.\n\nPLEASE BE NICE\n\nThe Sixers did their best to defuse potential anti-Simmons chants — a Flyers game in the same building this week got profanely loud toward Simmons — by sending Embiid out to address the crowd.\n\nEmbiid thanked the fans for coming after having to stay home most of last season amid the pandemic and asked they support Simmons because “he’s still our brother.” The crowd listened and no sustained chants of any substance ever developed.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNets: Durant sank all 10 free throws. ... Harden had seven rebounds and eight assists.\n\n76ers: Simmons was suspended for the first game of the season for conduct detrimental to the team after Rivers threw him out of practice for refusing to participate in a drill. Rivers said he didn’t want to predict when Simmons might rejoin the Sixers — if the guard returns at all. .. Embiid was hit with a technical in the first half. ... Danny Green shot three airballs in the fourth quarter.\n\nNO IRVING\n\nThe Nets decided Irving wouldn’t play or practice with the team at all until he could be a full participant. He can't play home games because of a New York City vaccination mandate.\n\n“We lost a big piece,” Nash said. “It's not just the new pieces. It's the void we're used to playing with. It's a lot for us to take on in this moment in time and hopefully in the weeks coming, we'll start to clear some of the debris, so to speak, and figure out how to best play together.\"\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n“If they have a top 575, maybe I have a chance.” — Rivers, a former NBA All-Star guard, on not making the NBA’s 75th anniversary team.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNets: Brooklyn heads home Sunday to face Charlotte in the start of a season-long six-game homestand. Washington, Miami, Indiana, Detroit and Atlanta are on the schedule.\n\n76ers: Simmons’ next two chances to return are both on the road, Sunday at Oklahoma City and Tuesday at New York.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/22"}]}

But under new owners, the once-beleaguered brand now plans a comeback. Buybuy Baby recently announced that it will reopen 11 closed locations this fall across five states in the Northeast.\n\n“The future of buybuy Baby is bright,” CEO Pete Daleiden wrote in a statement last week, promising that the baby store would again be a “trusted fourth-trimester partner.”\n\nWhy did Buybuy Baby close in 2023?\n\nThe future looked a lot less bright for Buybuy Baby at the beginning of 2023.\n\nThe popular baby retailer, founded in 1996 by children of Bed Bath & Beyond founder Leonard Feinstein, boasted 137 baby-centric stores at its peak. But by this summer, all of those stores were closed, wrapped up in the tumultuous collapse of parent company Bed Bath & Beyond.\n\nNew Jersey-based Bed Bath & Beyond signaled in January that it was doubtful it would last the year. By April, it had already filed for bankruptcy protections, beginning the long and dismal process of “winding down” its hundreds of stores across the country.\n\nBuybuy Baby, which purported to be the most popular baby retail brand in America as of last year, was folded up alongside its parent. All of the remaining 115 stores were due to be liquidated and shuttered.\n\nWhy is Buybuy Baby reopening its online and retail stores?\n\nParamus-based Dream On Me, a crib and mattress retailer that sold its products at buybuy Baby stores, inked a $1.17 million deal in July to buy out the leases at 11 buybuy Baby locations, according to CNBC at the time.\n\nThe company had already shelled out $15.5 million the previous month to snap up the brand’s intellectual property, including its name.\n\nWhen will the Buybuy Baby stores reopen in 2023?\n\nAs part of what the store is calling the “initial phase” of its re-opening, 11 buybuy Baby locations are set to reopen on Nov. 18, say company spokespeople.\n\nIn a statement, the store promised “brands customers have come to know and love, such as in gear and furniture categories,” and “a curated assortment of the most beloved and coveted baby and maternal wellness brands.”\n\nWhen will Buybuy Baby’s website launch?\n\nThe website will launch on a similar timeline at buybuybaby.com, alongside a “fully ownable registry experience where customers directly add and purchase items off the dedicated app.”\n\nWill the new Buybuy Baby honor old gift cards, or allow returns of items bought before the sale?\n\nNot according to the company website, which says gift card balances from preexisting digital and physical gift cards expired under previous ownership.\n\nWhere are the 11 Buybuy Baby locations that will reopen?\n\nConnecticut\n\n1433 New Britain Ave., West Hartford\n\nDelaware\n\n501 W.

The sale to the New Jersey-based company, which had once been a supplier of Buy Buy Baby’s, was approved by a judge on Tuesday and did not include the brand’s physical locations, reported CNBC. Like the stores belonging to its parent company, Buy Buy Baby’s in-person shops will soon cease to exist.\n\nBed Bath and Beyond’s death rattles were heard loud and clear in August of last year when it announced plans to close 150 stores and lay of 20% of corporate staff and again in January of 2023 when it announced an additional $80 million to $100 million in spending cuts. Sales featuring deep discounts have also run periodically at locations across the country since April. Ultimately, however, attempts to trim spending and secure enough funding to stay afloat could not outpace rapidly declining sales.\n\nCurrently, the home page of the Buy Buy Baby website features a note to customers thanking them for their loyalty and declaring its “difficult decision to begin winding down operations.” It assures customers that both Bed Bath & Beyond and Buy Buy Baby locations remain open for the time being and below that, an add touting 50% - 70% off all products accompany a store locator. It is unclear when the final locations will shut down or what is in store for thousands of employees who still work for the company. For now, interested parties can revel in shopping at one final blow-out sale.\n\nChristmas Tree Shops closing:Christmas Tree Shops closing all 73 stores across 20 states after worsening finances", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/02/09/bed-bath-beyond-2023-store-closures-list/11219546002/", "title": "Bed Bath & Beyond store closing list by state: 150 more stores close", "text": "Bed Bath & Beyond announced Wednesday it would close 150 more stores in a last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nThe move comes a little over a week after the home goods chain announced the closure of 87 stores, including all of its Harmon beauty stores and several buybuy Baby locations in thirty states. It also closed 62 Bed Bath & Beyond and six buybuyBaby stores in early January.\n\nOn top of its third and largest wave of store closures this year, the retailer said it also hoped to raise $1 billion in funding in a public stock offering.\n\nOne year ago, Bed Bath & Beyond operated 950 stores worldwide.

The retailer defaulted on some of its loans, prompting lenders to withdraw credit.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond then pursued last-resort deals to stay afloat, such as selling more shares, requesting rent breaks from landlords, and having another company pay for its merchandise.

The retailer said it secured a commitment of roughly $240 million in financing from Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. to allow it to keep operating during the bankruptcy process.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond stock price\n\nBed Bath & Beyond’s shares, which were trading at distressed levels, have also been on a turbulent run. It made a monstrous run from $5.77 to $23.08 in a little more than two weeks in August. The trading was reminiscent of last year’s meme-stock craze, when out-of-favor companies suddenly became darlings of smaller-pocketed investors.\n\nBut the stock fell back to Earth after Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder of online pet-products retailer Chewy Inc. who purchased a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond last March, sold off all his shares.\n\nShares were hovering close to 30 cents in the past few days. A year ago, shares were trading at around $17.\n\nThe company had 32,000 employees as of Feb. 26, 2022, but that number has come down since then as the retailer has slashed jobs.\n\nWhy is Bed Bath & Beyond filing for bankruptcy?\n\nBed Bath & Beyond joins a growing list of retailers that have filed for bankruptcy so far this year including party supplies chain Party City and David’s Bridal.\n\nDuring the depths of the pandemic, a number of retailers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy including Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney. But in 2022, there was a respite in retail bankruptcy filings as shoppers, flush with government stimulus money and a pile of savings, spent with abandon, helping to lift all types of retailers. But as credit tightens and inflation remains stubborn, shoppers have been tightening their purse strings in recent months, leaving struggling retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond more vulnerable.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond had been trying to turn around its business and slash costs after previous management’s new strategies worsened a sales slump. The company announced last August it would close about 150 of its namesake stores and slash its workforce by 20%. It also lined up more than $500 million of new financing.\n\nFounded in 1971, Bed Bath & Beyond had for years enjoyed its status as a big box retailer that offered a vast selection of sheets, towels and gadgets unmatched by department store rivals. It was among the first to introduce shoppers to many of today’s household items like the air fryer or single-serve coffee maker, and its 15% to 20% coupons were ubiquitous.\n\nBut for the last decade or so, Bed Bath & Beyond struggled with weak sales, largely because of its messy assortments and lagging online strategy that made it hard to compete with the likes of Target and Walmart, both of which have spruced up their home departments with higher quality sheets and beddings. Meanwhile, online players like Wayfair have lured customers with affordable and trendy furniture and home décor.\n\nEx-Bed Bath & Beyond CFO was a P&G executive in Cincinnati\n\nGustavo Arnal, who served as Bed Bath & Beyond's CFO from 2020 until his death in 2022, served in executive roles at Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble Co. from 1993 to 2017.\n\nIn his 24-year tenure, Arnal oversaw operations in more than 50 countries and served as chief financial officer of the company’s Indian, Middle East and Africa businesses, CFO for its fabric care and personal beauty care divisions and in executive finance roles in Brazil and Mexico. He owned a home in Cincinnati's Indian Hill neighborhood.\n\nAfter leaving P&G, Arnal was CFO at the Walgreens Boots Alliance from 2017-18, then CFO at Avon from 2019-20.\n\nHe died by suicide in September 2022 in New York City, less than a month after a federal class-action lawsuit accused him and others of inflating Bed Bath & Beyond stock. In a statement at the time, Bed Bath & Beyond said it was “profoundly saddened by this shocking loss.”\n\nArnal was not named in the company's Chapter 11 filing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2023/01/12/bed-bath-beyond-closing-arizona-stores/69802381007/", "title": "Bed Bath & Beyond to close 8 stores in Arizona.

This adds to the already planned 200 Bed Bath & Beyond store closures and 50 standalone harmon stores that will be shuttered in the U.S.\n\nThis brings the total number of closed stores to a staggering 400, nearly half of its total physical locations in just the past year or so.
