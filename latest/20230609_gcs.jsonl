There will be more charges. We anticipate dozens of more charges.''\n\nPolice said Crimo fired more than 70 shots from a rooftop Monday, killing seven people and wounding nearly 40 more with a legally purchased assault rifle before fleeing. He was captured that evening after an intense manhunt.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►Investigators have interrogated the suspect and reviewed his social media posts but provided no motive for the attack, describing it only as \"random.\"\n\n►Lake County Deputy Chief Christopher Covelli said the gun – “similar to an AR-15” – was legally purchased by Crimo in the Chicago area.\n\nHundreds gather for vigil the day after shooting\n\nHundreds of people congregated in downtown Highland Park Tuesday evening, blocks from the scene of the shooting. Families, neighbors and friends held hands, hugged and cried. Others laughed and smiled as they unexpectedly bumped into loved ones.\n\n“It’s good to face your fear and come back to the scene. There’s something about coming back,” said Elise Dayan, 54, a 21-year resident of Highland Park.\n\nSome exchanged stories of where they were during the parade. Some hung orange ribbons—for gun safety—in the trees. Others placed flowers, prayed and lit candles. Many kids wore Highland Park High School shirts and sweatshirts.\n\n“It feels good to be with other people going through the same thing,” said Highland Park native Lucy Melinger, 19, who lives a block from the scene of the shooting.\n\nMelinger said the gunshots could be heard from her house during Monday's shooting, and that her family at the parade ran back to the house amid the panic.\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\nSuspect was visited by police twice in 2019 — had knives confiscated\n\nThe man accused of killing seven people and wounding dozens at a Fourth of July parade was the subject of two police visits in 2019, one after he threatened \"to kill everyone'' in the house, police said Tuesday.\n\nCovelli said Crimo III had 16 knives, a dagger and a sword confiscated during that incident in September 2019. Five months earlier, police had responded to a reported suicide attempt by Crimo, according to Covelli.\n\nCrimo, 21, planned the attack for weeks, police said, and was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder. After firing more than 70 shots from a rooftop, Crimo abandoned an assault rifle he had bought legally, blended into the crowd by wearing women's clothes and walked to his mother's home, said Covelli, who revealed a seventh victim died Tuesday.\n\nAnother rifle and three other weapons, also purchased legally, were found in the car Crimo was driving Monday evening when he returned to Illinois after driving to Wisconsin and was spotted by a neighbor who called 911. He was arrested after an intensive manhunt.\n\nSix of seven victims identified, ages 35-88\n\nThe Lake County Coroner's office identified the six people killed Monday in the shooting rampage at Highland Park. A seventh victim died Tuesday, authorities said, but they have not revealed the person's name.\n\nFive of the six identified victims lived in Highland Park. The exception was Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78, who hailed from Morelos, Mexico.\n\nThe other five who died Monday were:\n\nKatherine Goldstein, 64; Irina McCarthy, 35; Kevin McCarthy, 37; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; and Stephen Straus, 88.\n\nThe victims included a dedicated synagogue worker, a grandfather watching Fourth of July festivities from his wheelchair, and the parents of a two-year-old son.\n\nHere's what we know about the victims.\n\nVice President Harris visits Highland Park\n\nVice President Kamala Harris paid an unannounced visit late Tuesday to the site of the violence.\n\nHarris’ motorcade arrived at the shooting site at 7:05 p.m. local time. Children’s bikes, a baby stroller, water coolers, toys and lawn chairs were scattered along the brick sidewalks. Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, who were invited to visit by Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, spoke for several minutes to local officials. Nearby residents shouted \"Thank you for coming.\"\n\n\"We have to take this stuff seriously,\" Harris said. \"The whole nation should understand and have a level of empathy to understand that this can happen anywhere, in any peace-loving community. And we should stand together.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Harris called the shooting “a senseless act of gun violence” during remarks to a meeting of the National Education Association in Chicago.\n\n“We need to end this horror,” she said. “We need to stop this violence. And we must protect our communities from the terror of gun violence.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nGrieving at vigil: 'There’s no five-step plan for this'\n\nPearson Lau, a lead pastor at Trinity Grace Church in Highland Park, stood outside his congregation with a 10-foot cross high in the background and spoke to reporters choked up with emotion. He was leading a vigil service one day after a mass shooting killed seven and injured dozens in the affluent Chicago suburb.\n\n“As a Christian, I don’t think we have all the answers in scripture for something like this,” Lau said. “God doesn’t say, ‘Here’s why people do evil things.’ I wish we did. I read in my devotion this morning. It said, ‘God bottles our tears and he recounts our loss.’ The hope that we have is that he’ll bring justice and righteousness to this world one day.''\n\nLau spoke to grieving parishioners for an hour, many of them teary-eyed entering and leaving the church — some processing stories of personal heartache and others still in shock from the trauma endured by a close-knit community.\n\nCharlotte Bank was one attendee filled with mixed emotions in her mourning. Bank told reporters she had seen the shooter, Robert Crimo III, attend services at that church. “(I’m) here to reconcile my own feelings,” she said.\n\nLau said the Fourth of July tragedy illustrates the need for more awareness about the impact of shootings regardless of the community where they take place.\n\n\"I’ve heard a lot of people say this is not the type of thing to happen in Highland Park,'' Lau said. \"But our brothers and sisters on the south side of Chicago, they see this almost every single day. We grow callous to that. Numbers just become numbers.\n\n“The way that I’ve been thinking about it (at the vigil) is to do God’s work and just get out of the way. There’s no five-step plan for (grieving) this.”\n\n– Scott Gleeson\n\nTeenage resident recalls Crimo as someone 'up to no good'\n\nHighland Park resident Martin Brubaker, 18, said he recalls Bobby Crimo coming into the local Jewel Osco supermarket several times with a group of friends, \"high'' and wearing hoodies in the middle of summer.\n\n“When I saw him, I was like, that guy is up to no good,'' Brubaker said. \"It’s not that I thought he was gonna do this. It’s more like I don’t want to talk to that guy.”\n\nCrimo can be seen in a widely circulated Chicago Tribune photo of a Trump rally. The man standing to Crimo’s right in the photo is Peter Christos, 18, according to Deerfield resident Natalie Reed, 18, who attended school with Christos at Glenbrook North.\n\n“He’s very anti-mask, anti-vaccine,” Reed said of Christos. “He would kind of harass other students for wearing masks. He rallied up a bunch of people and did a lot of Trump rallies. He’s the one who got people together for most of them in Northbrook.”\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\n'Legally obtained guns' a big issue, mayor says\n\nHighland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering signed a city ordinance banning assault weapons almost a decade ago, after the Sandy Hook massacre, so the rifle allegedly used in Monday's attack couldn't be legally purchased in the Chicago suburb.\n\n\"At some point this nation needs to have a conversation about these weekly events involving the murder of dozens of people with legally obtained guns,\" she said in an interview on NBC's \"Today\" show. \"If that's what our laws stand for, then I think we have to examine the laws.\"\n\nRotering said that \"somebody clearly had a mental breakdown\" but that the focus should be on access to guns, not mental health.\n\n\"I want us to talk about the fact that there are weapons of war on our streets that people can legally obtain – and then take out dozens of people,\" she said. \"Our community is never going to recover from its wound.\"\n\nA SYNAGOGUE WORKER, A LOVING GRANDFATHER: What we know about the victims of Highland Park shooting\n\nSuspect was turned away at synagogue in April, rabbi says\n\n﻿Crimo apparently tried to enter a synagogue near the shooting site in April and was turned away, according to Rabbi Yosef Schanowitz, co-director of the North Suburban Lubavitch Chabad – Central Avenue Synagogue.\n\nSchanowitz told USA TODAY on Tuesday that authorities have asked him not to speak about the specifics, but confirmed Crimo was asked to leave his synagogue shortly after entering during Passover services. Like many synagogues, the Central Avenue one is guarded by armed security during services, Schanowitz said.\n\nThe synagogue is located along the parade route, and Schanowitz said he rushed outside after the shooting to help protect four Chicago-area teens who were staffing a Jewish information table.\n\n\"The first thing I told them was to call their parents,\" said Schanowitz, who comforted victims and residents after the attack.\n\n\"You hear people who are in disbelief, there are people who are angry, and there are people who are sad and in shock,\" he said.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nThe day after: Residents reeling with shock, pain\n\nFBI agents and other law enforcement officers peered into trash cans, looked under picnic blankets and scoured Central Avenue at the site of the shooting searching for evidence. Tori Merel, her husband, Brian, and their 2-year-old son, Miles, placed flowers by the crime scene. Several bouquets lay outside the caution tape and street blocked off by police. Merel, a longtime resident, has lots of friends and family in Highland Park but said none were wounded.\n\n“This is heartbreaking to see this happening here,” said Merel, 38. “We live close by. My son loves firetrucks. I was thinking to myself we should take him to the parade because he loves firetrucks.\"\n\nThat's when they started hearing sirens. Word quickly spread that there was a mass shooter.\n\n“If this can happen here, I promise it can happen anywhere,\" she said. \"This is the last place I would ever imagine something like this happening.”\n\nROBERT CRIMO TAKEN INTO CUSTODY: Highland Park shooting: What we know\n\n'Now Highland Park is in the list of those towns' hit by mass shootings\n\nJustin Dickman, 15, and his siblings made a family tradition of attending the parade each year but skipped Monday's event. If they had attended, sitting in their usual spot outside a T-shirt shop, they’d have been half a block away from the shooter.\n\nHe used to bike around Highland Park without worrying about his safety. Now, Dickman's not sure if anywhere is truly safe.\n\n“Where I grew up is a crime scene now. Knowing that people died where I frequent often, it’s hard to believe,” he said.\n\nA sense of disbelief among residents was paired with the realization that a mass shooting could happen anywhere, even their affluent, quiet suburb.\n\nHighland Park will be listed among Buffalo, Uvalde, Texas, and other cities known for their mass tragedies, said Debbie Winick, who was walking her dog with her daughter.\n\n“I just woke up with that sinking feeling,'' Winick said. \"Like, here we are. Now Highland Park is in the list of those towns.”\n\n– Sophie Carson, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nStrong gun laws could face Supreme Court rebuke\n\nThe drumbeat for tighter gun regulations is growing louder, but it might be too late for legislation that could make a difference, warns Dr. Jonathan Metzl, professor of sociology and director of the Center for Medicine, Health and Society at Vanderbilt University.\n\n“We are seeing politicians powerfully speaking out about changes to gun laws to make communities like Highland Park safer from gunfire,\" Metlz told USA TODAY. \"However, practically every intervention proposed, such as limiting assault rifles in public and instituting red flag laws, is likely unconstitutional under the recent Supreme Court gun legislation ruling.”\n\nWitness: 'It just devolved. It was chaos.'\n\nAdam Sherman, 30, of Deerfield, was at the parade with his parents and was planning to meet up with his sister and her three children, but he ran into his first-grade teacher and stopped to chat. Soon after, Sherman’s father heard about eight pops and remarked, “They shouldn’t be making those kinds of sounds, given the times we live in.”\n\nAbout 30 seconds later, more shots rang out, and Sherman saw a flood of people running in his direction. Sherman’s father started searching for his daughter and children, but he couldn’t find them. They all began running too.\n\n“One second, it was the parade, and then it just devolved. It was chaos,” Sherman said. “One of those moments, visually, that unfortunately I don’t think I’ll ever forget.”\n\nSherman learned that his sister and her children got home safely. But he worries about how the children, all under 7 years old, will be able to live with what happened.\n\nAs Sherman spoke on a sidewalk near the shooting scene, a loud noise came from a cement truck nearby, startling him and the others around him.\n\n“We shouldn’t have to live in fear,” he said in response.\n\n– Sophie Carson, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nGovernor pushes for stricter gun regulations\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, speaking at a news conference hours after the rampage, said the nation's founding fathers carried muskets, not assault weapons, and would not have agreed to a constitutional right to an assault weapon with a high-capacity magazine.\n\n\"Grief will not bring the victims back, and prayers alone will not put a stop to the terror of rampant gun violence in our country,\" Pritzker, a Democrat, said on Twitter. \"I will stand firm with Illinoisans and Americans: we must – and we will – end this plague of gun violence.\"\n\nIllinois Republican gubernatorial candidate Darren Bailey apologized for suggesting people \"move on\" during a Facebook live stream from Skokie, where the Fourth of July parade was canceled after the shooting here.\n\n\"The shooter is still at large,\" Bailey said. \"So let's pray for justice to prevail, and then let's move on and let's celebrate the independence of this nation.\"\n\nPanic at fireworks displays in other cities\n\nThe impact of Monday's shooting rampage was felt across the nation. In Orlando, the fireworks celebration at Lake Eola was abruptly ended amid reports of a shooting that caused a chaotic scramble as the crowd fled the area.\n\n\"To our community members now in Downtown Orlando, please know that there is NO evidence of a shooting in the area,\" Orlando Police tweeted. \"Our officers are now working to secure the area. There is NO public safety hazard at this time.\"\n\nIn Harrisburg, Pa., fears of a shooting sent hundreds of people running moments before the city’s fireworks display started. Police said the panic may have been prompted when kids threw firecrackers at the ground.\n\nPolice later reported that a fight had broken out but that \"contrary to some reports, there were no shots fired.\"\n\nIn Washington, D.C., two loud noises near 11th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW prompted people nearby to flee toward the National Mall, The Washington Post reported. Authorities on the scene confirmed the sounds were fireworks and said the noises probably sparked the alarm.\n\nHoliday shootings in Philadelphia, Minneapolis\n\nEight people were wounded, some critically, in a shooting in a Minneapolis park during an unofficial Fourth of July celebration. Police said the assault took place about 11:30 p.m. Monday at Boom Island Park.\n\n“We were just watching fireworks and we just heard a whole bunch of shots,” Kaayla Laanaee told WCCO-TV. “I just heard them going over my head to the trees.”\n\nIn Philadelphia, two police officers were shot during the city's Welcome America Party Monday night. Both were treated at a hospital and released early Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm waiting for something bad to happen all the time.\" Mayor Jim Kenney said. \"I'll be happy when I'm not mayor and I can enjoy some stuff.\"\n\nMass shootings 'an American tradition'?\n\nThere have been 15 shootings in which four or more people have been killed, including the Highland Park attack, across the nation so far in 2022, according to The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University mass killing database.\n\nPritzker said that \"while we celebrate the Fourth of July just once a year, mass shootings have become a weekly – yes, weekly – American tradition.”\n\nBAND MEMBERS EYEWITNESSES TO TRAGEDY:The band struck up a joyous tune as they traveled in the parade. Then the shooting started.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/us/inside-texas-synagogue-hostage-standoff/index.html", "title": "What it was like inside the Colleyville, Texas, synagogue during the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt started like most any Saturday for members of Congregation Beth Israel.\n\nFamilies of the Reform Jewish synagogue just outside Dallas-Fort Worth had gathered – in person and online – to participate in the Sabbath service, even amid the twin perils of a fresh pandemic wave and a swelling tide of attacks on Jewish people in the United States.\n\nBy day’s end, the community of faith in Colleyville, Texas, would be at the center of a global drama involving a livestreamed hostage-taking, an imprisoned terrorist icon, an elite FBI rescue team, a rabbi’s quick thinking and a final, frantic sprint to freedom.\n\nMore details may yet offer a deeper understanding of why it happened. But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nPolice speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/us/safeway-shooting-bend-oregon/index.html", "title": "Bend, Oregon shooting: Victim fought to disarm gunman during ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne of the victims fought to disarm the suspected gunman during Sunday’s fatal shooting at a Safeway grocery store in Bend, Oregon, according to police spokeswoman Sheila Miller.\n\nTwo people were killed, police said. They were identified as Glenn Edward Bennett, 84, a customer who was shot in front of the store, and Safeway employee Donald Ray Surrett Jr., 66, who fought the shooter in the produce section, Miller said.\n\n“This is the Safeway employee who engaged with the shooter, which is to say he attempted to disarm the shooter and attacked this person, and we believe he prevented further deaths in addition to the quick police response,” Miller said. “Mr. Surrett acted heroically during this terrible incident.”\n\nGov. Kate Brown released a statement on Facebook Monday honoring Surrett.\n\n“While we are still gathering the facts about last night’s shooting, it’s clear that far more people could have been killed if not for the heroism of Donald Ray Surrett, Jr., who intervened to help stop the shooter, and the officers who entered while shots were still being fired,” Brown’s statement said. “In the face of senseless violence, they acted with selfless bravery. Their courage saved lives.”\n\nThe gunman – identified by police as Ethan Blair Miller, 20 – was found dead at the scene and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police spokeswoman said.\n\nPolice found an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun close to Miller’s body, according to Bend Police Chief Mike Krantz.\n\nThe shooting unfolded shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday at a shopping center, Krantz said. Police initially received reports there may have been more than one shooter, Sheila Miller said, but there is no evidence of a second shooter. There were reports of at least two other people who had injuries that were not life threatening, as well, she said.\n\nThe motive remains unclear, but police are aware of online posts that might be relevant, Sheila Miller said.\n\n“We are aware that the shooter may have posted information online regarding his plan. We are investigating this. We have no evidence of previous threats or prior knowledge of the shooter. We received information about the shooter’s writings after the incident had taken place and the shooter has no criminal history in the area,” Miller said.\n\nSafeway said in a statement the company was saddened by the “senseless violence.”\n\n“Our thoughts and actions now are directed toward supporting our associates, customers, and the community affected by this tragedy. We thank the officers at the Bend Police Department for their response and will continue to support the department’s investigation over the coming days,” the company’s statement said.\n\nSunday’s shooting follows a spate of other grocery store shootings across the country in the past year and amid an overall surge in “active shooter” incidents, according to an FBI report.\n\nIn May, 10 people were killed in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack in Buffalo, New York. A “hero” security guard and a beloved teacher were among those gunned down.\n\nIn March, another 10 people were gunned down at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. A veteran police officer with seven children was among those killed.\n\nLast September, a gunman shot 15 people – including one fatally – at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee. Some people hid in freezers to survive.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nMiller said police received multiple calls of shots fired around 7 p.m. at the Forum shopping center in northeast Bend.\n\nThe gunman entered from an apartment complex behind the shopping center, Miller said. He moved through the parking lot while firing rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before entering the Safeway.\n\nOnce inside, he shot a customer – Glenn Edward Bennett – who died while being taken to the hospital, Miller said.\n\nEmergency personnel respond to a shooting at the Forum shopping center in east Bend, Oregon, Sunday, August 28, 2022. Ryan Brennecke/The Bulletin/AP\n\nThe gunman continued to make his way through the store before having an altercation with and fatally shooting Donald Ray Surrett Jr., Miller said.\n\n“As our officers responded, they entered Safeway while shots were still being fired. They found the apparent shooter dead inside Safeway,” Miller said.\n\nAn AR-15 and shotgun were found near the gunman’s body, Miller said. Bend police did not fire any shots, she said.\n\nHow the gunman obtained firearms is under investigation. Because of online postings, Bend police also contacted the Oregon State Police Bomb Squad, who cleared the grocery store and the apartment complex, Miller said.\n\nPolice said it’s unclear how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting.\n\nOfficers were on scene within three minutes of the first 911 call, Miller said. It took four minutes from the time officers were dispatched to the time the shooter’s body was found, police said.\n\nPlans appeared to be posted online\n\nA search warrant was served on the gunman’s vehicle and home, Miller said. Investigators found three Molotov cocktails in his car along with a sawed-off shotgun. Police are working with the ATF to learn if the firearms were legal.\n\nIn his apartment, authorities found additional ammunition and digital devices that are currently being reviewed.\n\nCNN has identified several blog entries appearing to belong to Ethan Miller which were published on the blogging site “Wattpad” detailing a plan and reasons for the shooting. The posts were made public on the evening of August 28 by an anonymous account and viewable for 12 hours, according to Wattpad. The posts have since been removed.\n\nThe first blog entry was headlined June 29 and signed with the name Ethan. The writer of the post blamed Covid-19 and quarantine for worsening their mental health.\n\nInitially, this person planned a shooting inside a high school on September 8, according to the posts.\n\nMore than 35 posts were made by this same account on the blogging site. Most of the posts indicated a desire to commit violence.\n\nOne post referenced being “partially inspired” by the Columbine High School shooting.\n\nIn other posts signed with the name Ethan, several reasons were cited for the writer turning into a “ticking time bomb,” which included their family and their love life, which was detailed in a post headlined July 8.\n\nThe writer mentioned buying a shotgun and an AR-15 for the shooting, and said they hoped to kill over 40 people.\n\nThroughout the posts, other mass shootings were also referenced.\n\n“I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’”\n\nCustomers and employees described a chaotic scene at Safeway, saying they scrambled for safety as bullets flew.\n\nJosh Caba told CNN affiliate KTVZ he and his four children were shopping in the store when the shots broke out.\n\n“We started heading to the front. Then we heard I don’t know how many shots out front – six or seven. I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’ People were screaming. … it was a horrifying experience,” Caba told KTVZ.\n\nCaba said he was worried about his wife, who stayed in the car because she wasn’t feeling well. But as he and three of his children fled through exit doors by the produce department, he found that his wife had driven to the back of the store and was “sitting in the car, saying ‘Get in the car! Get in the car!’” KTVZ reported.\n\nThe father was able to rush back into the store and find their fourth child, he told KTVZ.\n\nAn employee who identified himself only as Robert told the Central Oregon Daily News that he and other employees were working a closing shift in the deli when they heard loud gunfire.\n\n“Me and three other employees ran into a walk-in refrigerator and closed the door and stayed there and stayed hidden until authorities arrived,” he said.\n\nA third person was struck and was in good condition at St. Charles Medical Center, spokesperson Lisa Goodman said.\n\nResidents in the central Oregon city were stunned by the shooting.\n\n“I heard anywhere from five to eight shots. I thought it sounded like backfire,” Heather Thompson, who lives across the street, told Central Oregon Daily News.\n\n“Less than a minute later, there were 10 to 20 shots, and then another 10 to 20 shots,” she said. “And by that time, I went inside and told my dad to get away from the window. And people were running out of Safeway.”\n\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify when the Wattpad posts were made public.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Tina Burnside Caroll Alvarado Hannah Sarisohn", "Amir Vera", "Tina Burnside", "Caroll Alvarado", "Hannah Sarisohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/30/homes/us-home-prices-remote-work/index.html", "title": "Remote work played a key role in fueling the pandemic surge in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe pandemic changed the way people lived and, for many, where they lived. Working from home was a significant driver of this “Great Reshuffling” and accounted for more than half of the steep increases in home prices seen during the pandemic, new research has found.\n\nRemote work allowed some people to move to places farther away from their office and prompted others to buy larger homes to accommodate their new lifestyles. The demand for more house and the ability to move to warmer climates played a sizable role in pushing home prices higher, according to a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the University of California, San Diego.\n\nHome prices grew by 23.8% during the pandemic, according to the researchers’ population-weighted analysis of Zillow’s home price index between December 2019 and November 2021. And the study found that remote work accounted for 15.1% of that growth.\n\nThe findings suggest there was more than just speculation behind the turbo-charged growth in home prices during the pandemic, said Johannes Wieland, an associate professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, and co-author of the study. He added that the evolution of remote work is likely to have a large impact on the future path of home prices and inflation.\n\n“We were pretty shocked remote work had this impact, once we saw the estimates,” Wieland said. “We thought about how people moving to different locations would be important. And it is. But it is the people who are remaining in a metro area – the people who need more space at home if they work at home – that is really pushing up prices. That is the majority of the story.”\n\nThe findings support what economists at Zillow have been seeing throughout the pandemic.\n\n“We’ve seen what we called the ‘Great Reshuffling’ that has contributed to the demand for housing nationwide,” said Chris Glynn, senior managing economist at Zillow. “It has accelerated trends that existed before the pandemic. Migration to places like Austin [Texas] and Raleigh [North Carolina] has been happening for a while, but the pandemic accelerated it because of the un-tethering between an office and home that has allowed people to make choices about where they want to live.”\n\nWhat makes a hot remote work spot\n\nThe Sun Belt attracted remote workers looking for a warm weather lifestyle even before the pandemic. But the researchers found that the trend gained further momentum during the pandemic, pushing up home prices in those areas at a much faster rate than before the pandemic.\n\nBy the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the median single-family, existing-home price in Austin had grown by 26% from the year before, according to the National Association of Realtors. Prices in Phoenix were also up by 26% and in Boise, Idaho, by 24.3%.\n\nThe researchers found that cities that already had a large share of remote workers before the pandemic tended to attract even more after the pandemic shutdowns pushed a whole wave of people to work remotely.\n\n“Where more people are working remotely, that’s where the home prices grow,” said Wieland, who noted that cities like Austin, Boise, Phoenix and San Diego saw some of the biggest home prices increases in the country as a result.\n\nThese remote-work-friendly cities share three main features, he said. The first is a predominant industry that allows for remote work. Tech jobs, for example, are easily done remotely because they mostly involve work on a computer, he noted.\n\nThe second aspect is a lower population density, where there is more space and more affordable housing than in the biggest cities in the country.\n\n“It is hard to work at home in New York City, for example,” he said, explaining the cost of living there means that having extra space for an office comes at a premium. “Lower-density areas are more attractive for remote work.”\n\nThe third feature is a warmer climate or appealing lifestyle. “There is more remote work where the weather is nice,” he said. “When you’re not tied to a location because of your job, you can choose where you want to be. Many of these places…are attractive to people who can move to a place for lifestyle and not for work.”\n\nThat is why many of the cities in the Sun Belt saw such huge increases in home prices during the pandemic, he explained.\n\nA fast impact on home prices\n\nThe pandemic spurred us to change the way we work very quickly, said Wieland.\n\n“There hasn’t been a peacetime period where we have changed the way we do work in such a quick fashion,” he said. “Suddenly, we are moving further away from where our work is located. We don’t need the office space. We now need this home space for work.”\n\nIn a perfect world, you’d want to see the economy adapt to this change in preferences and opportunities, he said. “But it is hard to do with housing in a year or two, especially at a time when supply is not very high to begin with,” he said. “That is one of the reasons why home prices are going up at such a rapid rate.”\n\nIn their research, Wieland and his co-author John A. Mondragon, an economic research adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, looked at a housing market impacted by many variables, including the low supply of homes for sale, a demographic bulge of Millennials reaching typical home buying age and the Fed’s slashing of interest rates during the pandemic, which resulted in ultra-low mortgage rates for more than a year.\n\nThe researchers measured the amount home prices in an area went up as it related to the amount of remote workers living in the area.\n\nNBER working papers are circulated for discussion and comment purposes, but they have not been peer-reviewed or reviewed by the NBER Board of Directors that accompanies official NBER publications.", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/sarasota/2021/09/10/herald-tribune-readers-share-their-stories-sept-11-2001-9-11-where-were-you-on-9-11/5713637001/", "title": "Sarasota Herald-Tribune readers share their stories from 9/11 attacks", "text": "Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nWe asked our readers to share their Sept. 11 memories.

Some have been edited for length.\n\nMarvin Crepea\n\nLakewood Ranch\n\nI worked in downtown Manhattan for more than 15 years, by the World Trade Center, lunching in the WTC Plaza, shopping in the WTC underground mall, and never would have imagined that anything could cause it to fall. With the sound of the tower collapsing all pandemonium broke out.\n\nI don't know why, but just seconds before, in the back of my mind I had looked over my shoulder to see if there was a safe place to go -- when I noticed a doorway just off the corner. Instinctively, as the tower crumbled, everyone around the area believed that it had no place to fall but where I was standing -- I dived into the doorway and knelt down with my head between my knees, covered-up and prayed. The sound of the crashing tower was not to be believed when simultaneously a black cloud of smoke and soot and debris came rushing out like a black wall of death at 100 mph.\n\nWithin seconds day turned to night and the air was excruciating thick with black smoke and soot. Now the people around me were screaming to get into the building as we couldn't breathe -- I held my breath and crouched down low. The door was closed and we yelled for the people inside to open up. Eventually, one of the young guys jimmied the door open and the small group of around 15 to 30 rushed in. I was knocked down by the crowd since I had been crouching down and visibility was zero. People walked over me, practically trampling me as I slowly crawled on all fours in to the building. I made it in and tumbled down a basement stairwell where the air was clearer. Everyone was silent. Outside was pitch black with smoke and we had no idea the extent of the damage. As the initial shock subsided we looked at each other and saw that we were covered totally with soot and debris! I had even lost my shoes.\n\nWe waited for about 20 minutes for the outside air to settle enough so that we could see at least 5-10 feet. At that point we filed out one by one on to the street, Broadway/Maiden Lane, which now looked like a ghostly, surreal alien landscape. Where minutes before Broadway was packed with emergency vehicles, people, police firemen -- it was now totally silent, barren except for about a foot of debris. The sight of dozens of empty shoes littering the street was not to be believed. Either the force of the falling tower or the reaction of the body to sudden disaster caused people’s feet to literally leave their shoes.\n\nCeremonies:Sarasota, Manatee remembrance services to mark the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11 terrorist attacks\n\nBrig. Gen. Robert V Taylor, Ret.\n\nSarasota\n\nI was in the Pentagon as a member of the Secretary of the Army‘s Reserve Forces Policy Committee, representing the Army National Guard. That morning our meeting was being held in the Deputy Chief of Staff/G3 conference room, the first time we had ever met in that location. We had always conducted our meeting in the Deputy Chief of Staff/G1 conference room. Both rooms are on the outside E Ring just two corridors apart.\n\nThe plane flew into the G1 Conference room. LTG Tim Maude, Army G1 and many of his staff were killed. He was a member of our committee. The force of the impact was significant – felt like a missile hit the building. Exiting the Pentagon was a challenge with smoke and fear of massing into the south parking lot which posed another potential target of opportunity. Not knowing what had hit the building, my experience told me to not mass and become a large target of opportunity. I chose to find an exit away from parking lots.\n\nMy hotel was across from the Pentagon. They brought in large fans to suck out fumes from the burning jet fuel that evening.\n\nMy return to duty station in Michigan on 9/12 was a story in itself. No rentals cars and obviously no commercial air. The Chief National Guard Bureau coordinated a flight from Andrews AFB. I traveled with two other GO’s on a military KC 135 on 9/12. First stop was Detroit Metropolitan Airport where I was met by a military C-12, which flew me to Lansing. The KC 135 then flew to Idaho and then Oregon to drop off the other two GO’s. Eerie….flying into Detroit. The only aircraft flying were Air Force and Air National Guard fighters providing Combat Air Patrol.\n\nMore:The 9/11 classroom: Booker Elementary students, now 27, recall President Bush's visit in CNN special\n\nJackie Becher\n\nSarasota\n\nI was awakened by the phone ringing, it was my brother telling me to turn on the television. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Then the second plane tore into the tower and reality set in. As the day progressed the losses were devastating.\n\nThere was no transportation, people had to walk home. We live on East 57th Street, close to the 59th Street bridge. Second Avenue is a wide street, hoards of people were marching up Second Avenue to the bridge but you couldn’t see the ground through the thousands of marchers.\n\nBut I was gladdened by the sight of people helping people. A pregnant woman sitting on the curb was taken into a neighbor’s apartment to rest, along with others, we brought bottles of water to these marchers.\n\nI walked my dog watching police/sheriff cars speed down Second Avenue. They came to help from all over the country, cars from Iowa, Georgia, Wisconsin, Montana, Virginia, almost every state.\n\nI choke up now writing this remembering how the country came together and wonder how we ever drifted so far apart.\n\n20 years later:Looking back at Sarasota's chilling, unusual connections to 9/11\n\nMichael Litz\n\nArizona\n\nI am a born and raised Sarasota native. On September 11, 2001 I was a Winn-Dixie truck driver. I had driven from our warehouse at Clark and McIntosh to the Apollo Beach Winn-Dixie. I was getting out of the truck and heard on the radio that a plane had struck a World Trade Center. I assumed it was a small plane that had made an error. I hadn’t even left the parking lot when I heard a second plane had hit and instantly knew what that meant.\n\nIn subsequent days I was looking for ways to contribute to the cause. I applied for a federal law enforcement position and went to work for the U.S government in a counterterrorism role. This has encompassed many things, from flying armed to chasing smugglers sneaking into the country to surveillance operations. I am still in that role on the Arizona border with seven years to go before mandatory retirement. September 11, 2001 altered the course of my life….but it didn’t end it as it did for so many.\n\nSubsequent wars are winding to a close now with many more thousands dead, trillions spent, and we are in the same position. Terrorists are in control of those targeted hot beds and America is still in their crosshairs.\n\nWe’re still out here doing what we can.\n\nGuy Kulman\n\nNew York City, grew up in Sarasota\n\nSept. 11, 2001, was my second day at Lehman Brothers. I lived in Manhattan and took the subway from Columbus Circle to the World Trade Center. As the train approached downtown, the conductor announced: “This train is going express.” I wasn’t sure if it would stop at WTC, so I got off at Chambers. As I climbed up the steps, I heard a boom.\n\nA woman started screaming, “A helicopter hit the World Trade Center.” I looked at the tower and thought the damage seemed containable. I dialed my mom in Sarasota. “Mom, a helicopter hit the World Trade Center,” I told her. “Don’t worry, I don’t work there. I’m heading to work.”\n\nWhen I finally got to 3 WFC, I realized how close it was to the World Trade Center. Then, I heard another explosion. I took off. Some guy was running next to me. He said, “A plane hit the World Trade Center.” I said, “It was a helicopter.” He said, “No, a plane, two planes hit the towers.” It was then that I turned around and saw both towers on fire.\n\nI called my mom: “Mom, President Bush is in Sarasota. Stay away from him. We are under attack.”\n\nBonnie Silvestri\n\nSarasota\n\nOn September 11, I was aboard the express train when the planes hit. At the Chambers Street station, I could barely climb the stairs because people had congregated to look at the unfathomable sight in front of us, the World Trade Center towers on fire. I quickly realized the gravity of the circumstances and walked 4 1/2 miles back to my apartment on the Upper West Side.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I worked as part of a core group of attorneys at the Family Assistance Center on the city’s death certificate program. Although I was concerned about my emotional preparedness for this task, it was the best thing I could have done to channel my worries and fears into helping people who were experiencing the darkest moment of their lives. I met with families who had to prove that their loved one was in one of the buildings in cases where remains could not be found. Families shared the final moments with their loved ones with me, and I was honored to listen as they recounted their deepest despair. It was wearying work but also one of the most gratifying things I have done in my career.\n\nBill Guernier\n\nSarasota\n\nI had started a new job a week or two before with a consulting firm. That day was my first day in temporary shared office space. I was going out the door to go buy some office supplies and walked through the office lobby just after the first plane hit. Several people were watching the replay and told me what had happened. I had so much on my mind, it didn’t really register and I continued to the elevator to run my errand. By the time I got outside, I realized what had happened and I went back upstairs and saw the second plane hit.\n\nI got my briefcase and headed to Grand Central Terminal to try to get a train home to Chappaqua, N.Y. Outside I could see the smoke. At Grand Central most trains were canceled, but there was a train running on my line, the Harlem Line. It was packed and everyone was silent. After a few minutes there was an announcement to evacuate Grand Central immediately, the fear being that it could be attacked next. People didn’t panic but everyone moved quickly. I headed out and ran into a friend from town. We went to his office. He got through on his cell phone to his wife, who then called mine to tell her we were safe.\n\nWe left that building and started walking north, collecting two more friends from town along the way. We were up in the 90s, planning to walk to 125th Street to see if the trains were running from there. A limo driver heading into Midtown saw us and offered to take us home at the very premium price of $500. I think we surprised him by quickly accepting his offer without negotiation and jumped in. On the way we realized we barely had enough cash among us, but we scraped it together. He dropped us off at the Chappaqua train station. As I walked the short walk to my house, halfway there I sat down on the sidewalk for 10 minutes to process what had happened. I walked the rest of the way home, hugged my family and burst into tears. It all seems like yesterday.\n\nCapt. Mike Collette, Ret.\n\nNokomis\n\nOn 9/11 I was an active fire captain with the North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue Department in North Jersey. I remember speaking on my phone with a fellow firefighter watching the north tower burning and thinking \"Wow these guys in New York are going to bust their butts going up the stairs.\" Then the second plane hit the south tower. I'm thinking now something is not right here.\n\nThe next day we were deployed (all volunteers). My job was to keep my guys together and safe. I remember going through the empty Lincoln Tunnel and then being cheered on by everyone on Westside Hwy.\n\nAt Ground Zero we went to \"the well\" with buckets to help remove the debris. There were people from all over the United States including construction workers (the unsung heroes). They were so respectful to all the firefighters and police. As it turned out there were just too many people and it started getting to dangerous, steel beams flying around, cranes moving back and forth and myself ducking from the moving beams, the debris was over 100 feet high. I know of all of the firefighters that were there, it wasn't because they had to be, it was because they wanted to be. We will never forget the 343 firefighters, 37 Port Authority and New York policemen, plus the 2,000 civilians that that lost their lives that day.\n\nI will always remember thinking, “What a great country we have with everyone coming together.”\n\nWhat happened?\n\nEllen McKeefe\n\nSarasota\n\nA small group of freelance television news camera operators, audio techs and I, an experienced television news producer, huddled together at the old Broadway restaurant in Sarasota making plans to drive to Washington or New York for work. Clearly, after the terrorist attacks that morning we would have no work here for a very long time. No planes were flying anywhere so we decided to share vans and hit the road the next day.\n\nA few hours later, around 4 a.m. on September 12 my landline rang and ABC News in New York asked how far I was from Venice. I told them I could be there in a half hour or so. I was given a residential address and the name Mohammed Atta. I was instructed to meet a St. Petersburg freelance camera crew that I knew well, park with lights off a few doors away and look for FBI guys at that address. Minutes after we parked, several vehicles pulled up and there they were. About a dozen FBI guys in the navy blue jackets with yellow lettering. Camera rolling we approached. The FBI operatives were not amused but knew we had every right to tape the action from a perimeter they quickly established. We were the only news people there. It was quickly determined that no one named Atta lived there. I learned later that morning that Atta was the leader of the terrorist pilots. Atta had piloted the first passenger jet into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.\n\nThe crew and I were in the midst of the most important story we would ever cover and we knew it instantly. I spent the following two weeks at Huffmann Aviation at the Venice Airport where Atta and Marwan al Shehhi trained; al Shehhi was the pilot who flew into the South Tower of the World Trade Center. I organized and managed an instant field production operation at Huffman Aviation which became a major component of a major and historic worldwide news story. I did interviews with people who knew both men. Some had trained them to fly. I managed satellite truck live shots into Good Morning America, World News Tonight, Nightline and 20-20. During subsequent weeks, I was an investigative reporter, no camera crew, just a dogged journalist tracing Atta and al Shehhi’s steps as they lived among us in 2000-01.\n\nOver four decades, my television news career took me all over the world covering major stories. Nothing approaches my small part covering the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. It remains my most significant professional accomplishment. And, yes, I would do it all over again.\n\nRobert Bourlier\n\nLakewood Ranch\n\nAt 9 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001 I was on the flight deck of a United B-757 in Providence, R.I. requesting a clearance to O’Hare in Chicago when I was informed that all airplanes on the east coast were grounded. On the previous Saturday, Sept. 8, I had piloted a flight to Phoenix returning on that Sunday. My first class flight attendant had been CeeCee Lyles. I learned that day that she was on United flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, PA. I will never forget!\n\nEleanor Schmidt\n\nSarasota\n\nI emerged from the subway a little before 9 a.m. on that day and saw a ring of fire around the first tower, stood in disbelief and then heard a loud crash, the second tower was hit. Everyone ran east and north to escape any fallout. I lost 84 coworkers at Fiduciary Trust Company and my husband thought I was dead until I found a public phone at 9:30 a.m. I walked home to East 76th Street, a neighborhood where doctors in white who came into the city to help in the hospitals found no bodies were being delivered. There were no bodies. Days were spent by employees of Fiduciary attending so many funerals, and finally a special Mass was held at the famous cathedral on the Upper West Side. It was a sobering time. Two years later I retired and moved to Sarasota for happier days.\n\nZoe Marshall\n\nNokomis\n\nThis is the partial text of an email sent to friends on 9/11/01:\n\nI cannot begin to tell you my story. I too am in such shock over all this. But I feel I became a part of history that day. Bush was at one of our schools at the time all this happened. I had volunteered to man the front office while all the staff and a few students gathered in the media center to see him. We were incredibly excited and preparations began the Friday before. Much security had taken place before his arrival. Bush’s limo stopped right in front of my office, so I got to see him greet our Superintendent and several other big wigs. The plan was he was to observe a classroom teaching lesson, then on to the media center to promote his new reading initiative. Right after he entered the classroom, I got a call from a parent telling me we better turn on the TV as a plane had hit the World Trade Center.\n\nAt this point, I was in the front office with about 10 Secret Service, the sheriff, and head of the fire department. We all turned to the TV and were amazed to watch what we thought was a horrible accident. Then as we were watching, the second plane hit the other tower. At that point, the Secret Service went into action/panic mode that was unbelievable. All of the sudden, they were EVERYwhere. Then Bush came on the TV live (remember, he is the building right behind me) stating that he had just been advised we were under terrorist attack and would have to leave right away.\n\nAbout five minutes later, he came walking through the passageway, sort of alone, as the Secret Service were following about 2-3 feet behind. His shoulders were slumped and he had this incredible sad look on his face. I was at the window and all of the sudden he looked up and saw me, and gave a small wave. I swear he looked right in my eyes, and I sadly gave a small wave back. Later that night, I realized I was probably the last civilian to see him before he was whisked away into hiding. I will never forget it. His eyes were SO sad.\n\nLynn Nemser\n\nVenice\n\nI was on my way back home to Pittsburgh from London when our flight was diverted to a small airport in Stephenville, Newfoundland. Gander was already full. After 18 hours on the plane, we deplaned and registered with Canadian Red Cross in the small airport lobby. They were the first to welcome us as we realized we were registering as refugees. As an American, that was something I never thought I would be.\n\nSince the town had run out of places for us to stay, we were bused about an hour north to the Camp of the Silver Birches, a Salvation Army youth camp that had closed for the season. We were met by the Salvation Army members who left their jobs and closed their businesses that day to welcome us again. They provided us with lodging, clothes phone access and ample, delicious meals until we left a few days later. They even brought in an Irish Band to lift our spirits!\n\nMike Shlasko\n\nNokomis\n\nI got a call from one of my business partners working with NYPD on the recovery operation. They asked me to meet them at the NYPD’s new Emergency Operations Center (EOC). I put on my suit, American flag pin in my lapel, and headed to the west side where I found, in a sprawling warehouse, dozens of technology companies working to bring the new EOC to life. Beside me was a wall of Krispy Kreme donuts donated in memory of their shop lost in the WTC collapse.\n\nI picked up my phone to call and ask where my partner was, and I was interrupted by another gentleman in a suit who asked, “Are you in charge here?” I suppose as the only one in a suit that was a natural conclusion to draw. I said, “No, I have no idea who is in charge.” Then he said, “I’m here with the mayor” and in struts Rudy Giuliani and his entourage, there to inspect the new facility. That was the first time I’d met Rudy, strutting like a peacock back then, and still now.\n\nSusan \"Sky\" Makara\n\nSarasota\n\nI am an artist.\n\nThat morning every road was bumper to bumper crawling away from the Pentagon. Mine was the only car driving towards the devastation, the same direction as my studio. I had an overwhelming urge to get to my studio. Painting is my sanctuary, It helps me process trauma. When I arrived, I could smell the jet fuel and see the Pentagon’s pillar of smoke from my studio window in the Torpedo Factory Art Center. The streets were full of military personnel and equipment. Fighter jets were overhead. Nearby National Airport would be closed for weeks.\n\nMy studio remained open to the public. Stranded visitors from all over continued to come in. They were living out of their suitcases, which made for unusual and sometimes entertaining attire. As I talked with them I began to realize my feelings of inadequacy at being useless in this horrific situation were unwarranted. It helped to hear that my paintings were giving these traumatized people something beautiful to see, and I was honored to be thanked over and over by so many. Painting is my medicine and I am grateful that I can share it.\n\nDiana Berry\n\nRetired Director of Quality Assurance at SunCoast Blood Center\n\nSarasota\n\nOn 9/11, I was working at our local blood bank on Mound Street as an Education Specialist. I had just finished our annual employee training when two people burst in the room and shouted, “A plane just hit the World Trade Center and caused a tower to collapse!” We couldn’t believe what we were hearing as we hurried downstairs to the donor room to watch the TV hanging from the wall. With horror and awe, we saw the second tower collapse and were speechless.\n\nWithin 45 minutes blood donors started appearing at the front door to our building. Fifteen minutes later the front lobby was filled with donors clamoring to donate blood. President Bush was on air urging people to go and donate blood. Soon our parking lot was swamped with cars. Potential donors were lined up out the door and down the street. Volunteers were directing traffic. Employees stepped up to the plate, screening donors and drawing blood. Lab employees processed and tested the blood, ensuring its safety. Local restaurants sent food to feed everyone. Such a phenomenal spirit was present that day and the dark days that followed 9/11 as hundreds of generous blood donors and employees came together to help the fallen.\n\nRichard Morgan\n\nBradenton\n\n\n\nSeptember 11 was a beautiful sunny morning in Shannon, Ireland. My two sons and I had completed a 12-day golfing trip all around Ireland as we boarded Delta flight 129 bound for Atlanta (we thought) connecting on to home in Sarasota. Our brand new Boeing 767 was full, mostly American tourists heading home and Irish families headed for Disney World on vacation. Our crew were seasoned old timers on that route and the captain was commanding his final flight after a long and distinguished career. Surprise for all -- halfway across the Atlantic, our plane was diverted to Newfoundland.\n\nWe were the last of 37 international flights to land at Gander that day (over 12,000 people). That put us at the end of a very long line for everything -- the food and water truck, the bathroom emptying truck, the information dissemination about the terrorist attacks in the U.S., the Mountie visits to the plane, and after 24 hours locked tight on the ground, at last the wheeled exit ramp that barely reached the door. Off we went with carry-ons only by school bus for 70 miles to the tiny fishing town of Lewisporte to spend three days and nights. Three plane loads of strangers who had \"Come from Away\" suddenly grew that town's population by a third in an instant. Boy, did the Newfies handle it well.\n\nThe townspeople fed us, bedded us, took us into their homes and social clubs, entertained us, cared for our needs, and would not take a dime from us. The only thing we paid for was beer at the two main street taverns, which both ran dry for a while. We even drank the rum and kissed the cod as they \"screeched\" us in as honorary Newfies -- what an honor. We will never again meet people as hospitable and friendly as our emergency hosts in Newfoundland. I thank them again every chance I get.\n\nThere is no way I can ever fully thank the Salvation Army members, the Canadian Red Cross and the Canadians for their compassionate care of all of us.\n\nLinda Haller Sloan\n\nSarasota\n\nOn September 11, 2001, my close friend Karen and I were telecommunications attorneys in Washington, D.C.\n\nWe had business trip flights out of Dulles International Airport. Karen was headed to Los Angeles, me to Asia. As I was about to catch a taxi to the airport, news broke that two planes had hit the Twin Towers in New York.\n\nFour planes went down that morning. Karen’s husband, friends and I gathered at her house that afternoon. It wasn’t until hours later we learned Karen’s plane had hit the Pentagon. American Airlines Flight #77. My dear friend -- young, bright, marathon runner, writer, law firm partner, family-oriented Iowan of strength and innocence - was smoldering in the ashes.\n\nI was devastated about Karen. I struggled to understand how our country could have been attacked. I worried desperately how my twin sister would get home. She was in Brussels at a conference with 200 fellow Americans.\n\nAfter 9/11, many Americans answered the call. The Federal Communications Commission where I worked established a Homeland Security Policy Council. I joined it, and later, the White House, to do homeland security work.\n\nHonoring the fallen, and protecting our democracy, must never die.\n\nMike Eisgrau\n\nEnglewood\n\nIn 2001 I was Director of Public Affairs for New York’s giant Jacob K. Javits Convention Center --- handling the press and being spokesman for the Center on Manhattan’s west side. My office was eight minutes from Ground Zero --- and within hours we became the major emergency disaster relief center, the staging area for what you saw on your TV screens and heard on your radios for the first five weeks of that disaster.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive memory I have of those days is of those who volunteered. When Governor Pataki designated Javits as the Volunteer Coordination Center the outpouring of support was phenomenal. Thousands lined up on the street to fill out forms with their names, contact information and job skills -- then waited patiently for hours for us to register them.\n\nAnd talk about donations! They came in literally by the ton -- from crowbars to can openers, from aspirin to antibiotic cream to ACE bandages, from hard hats to Handi-wipes, from work boots to dog booties (for the police canine units) and dog food. They came by truck and car and bicycle and on foot---everybody was running to give something.\n\nOne huge trailer truck came from a small town in Michigan. It was driven by a husband and wife team who said simply that their townspeople had contributed what they could to help out the folks in New York. More than 50 state troopers and Javits labor staff formed a human chain to unload the truck.\n\nAnd then they left. No one can remember the names of that couple, or their hometown. But everyone there remembered them simply as Americans helping out in a time of need.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/22/homes/us-home-prices-falling/index.html", "title": "Home prices are finally falling. But how low will they go? | CNN ...", "text": "The US housing market is in the midst of a major shift. After two years of stratospheric price appreciation, home prices have peaked and are on their way back down.\n\nBut what homebuyers and homeowners alike want to know is: How much lower will prices go?\n\nThe short answer: Prices are likely to drop further, but not by as much as they did during the housing bust. From the 2006 peak to the 2012 trough, national home prices fell by 27%, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices, which measures US home prices.\n\n“It was different in 2008, 2009 because that drop in prices was because of a push from sellers,” said Jeff Tucker, senior economist at Zillow. “Because of foreclosures and short sales there were a lot of extremely motivated sellers who were willing to take a loss on their homes.”\n\nPlus, that housing crash came at a time when the inventory of homes for sale was four times higher than it is now. Current inventory is still substantially lower than pre-pandemic levels, which has increased competition for homes. And that is keeping prices relatively strong.\n\n“I would be surprised to see prices anywhere drop below where they were in 2019,” said Tucker. “There was some overheating in the housing market in 2021 through this spring that pushed prices higher than what the fundamentals would support. Now they are coming down.”\n\nHow low will prices go?\n\nWith mortgage rates more than doubling since the start of this year, the calculations for a homebuyer have changed considerably. The monthly principal and interest mortgage payment on the median priced home is up $930 from a year ago, a 73% increase, according to Black Knight, a mortgage data company.\n\nWhen you factor in soaring mortgage rates, along with elevated home prices and wages that aren’t increasing as fast, buying a home is less affordable now than it has been in decades, according to Black Knight.\n\nBut there may be some relief in sight for buyers.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs expect home prices to decline by around 5% to 10% from the peak hit in June.\n\nWells Fargo has recently forecasted that national median single-family home prices will drop by 5.5% year-over-year by the end of 2023.\n\nWells Fargo’s economists estimate that the median price for an existing single family home to be $385,000 this year, up 7.8% from last year, but the growth will be a lot less than the 19% year-over-year increase seen in 2021.\n\nThe economists anticipate the median home price will fall to $364,000, a decline of 5.5% from this year. They predict prices will rebound and rise again in 2024, with the median price ticking up 3.3% to 376,000 by the end of 2024.\n\n“The primary driver behind the housing market correction thus far has been sharply higher mortgage rates,” the Wells Fargo researchers wrote. “If our forecast for Fed rate cuts is realized, mortgage rates are likely to fall slightly just as cooling inflation pressures boost real income growth. A modest improvement in sales activity should then follow, which will reignite home price appreciation heading into 2024.”\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nUltimately, how much prices fall will depend on where you live.\n\nUnlike the run-up in prices during the pandemic that caused home values in markets across the country to surge, the cooling off will be more regional, said Tucker. The drops will be more deeply felt in places where there were larger gains during the pandemic, many of them in the West and Sunbelt, including cities like Austin, Phoenix and Boise, he said.\n\n“Nationally, we might see a 5% decline from the peak,” Tucker said. “But prices will decline by more in the West and there will be a smaller decline in the Southeast.”\n\nIn September, month-over-month home prices dropped in several pandemic hotspots, including Phoenix, down 2.3%; Las Vegas, down 1.9% and Austin, down nearly 1%, according to Zillow.\n\nAnd Boise, Idaho, where prices surged nearly 60% during the pandemic, is already seeing annual declines, with prices falling 3.9% year over year in September, according to Zillow.\n\n“A number of metro areas, especially in the West, will see some year-over-year price declines this spring,” said Tucker. “That will be the worst comparison time because that’s when many markets reached their peak.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/weather/fourth-of-july-weekend-weather-forecast/index.html", "title": "Weather forecast: Fourth of July weekend to see heavy rain, flight ...", "text": "Programming note: CNN’s annual Fourth In America special features musical performances from artists including the B-52s, Machine Gun Kelly and Pitbull, as well as fireworks shows from across the US.

He played with the jam band, Woodshed, and the Iggy Pop-influenced RagTag, featuring future Queens of the Stone Age bassist Nick Oliveri. But he had written some songs with a lonely weariness, like “Easy Lies” and “The Bed I Made,” singing like a forlorn guy who has benignly accepted his fate.\n\nShelley went to a well-known Palm Springs studio where many of his low desert colleagues, and even Doors guitarist Robby Krieger record. The owner-engineer liked his material but he wanted studio musicians to record the tracks and let Shelley lay down the vocals. It’s the way most major studios work. It didn’t feel right to Shelley. Not for those organic songs.\n\nA friend told him about a new studio off a dirt road in northern Joshua Tree called High Lonesome. It’s owned by Georgia native Chris Unck, who is playing in the Joshua Tree Music Festival next month and has also recorded with a group called Adobe Collective. Unck welcomed Shelley like a guy offering water to man lost in the desert.\n\n“The atmosphere of the place was unassuming and comfortable,” Shelley said. “It felt like I do when I’m at home. I knew instantaneously, ‘I’m going to record here.’”\n\nShelley recorded an EP and then an album released in February titled “Hope Wrapped in Razor Wire.” Both received CV Music Award nominations.\n\nINTRO:High desert, east valley music scenes are in full bloom\n\nThe singer-guitarist knows Joshua Tree's mystique. Woodshed recorded at Rancho de la Luna, a Joshua Tree studio made famous by the recordings of Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age, and played GramFest: The Cosmic American Music Festival that saluted Gram Parsons annually from 1997 to 2006. He credits the quiet, embracing high desert culture for helping to bring his musical ideas to fruition.\n\n“The songs were written down here,” he said. “But I don’t know if (they) would have been realized in any other place with any other group of people. It came together magically with the right players at the right time.”\n\nMusicians have been moving to the high desert region of Morongo Valley to Twentynine Palms in gold rush fashion the past few years to mine its mystique. Barnett English, who has produced two Joshua Tree Music Festivals at the Joshua Tree Lake Campground since 2003, says there are 35 to 40 recording studios in the area.\n\nThe studios range from small home studios owned by the likes of Gram Rabbit co-founders Todd Rutherford and Jesika von Rabbit, and Masters of Reality leader and Queens of the Stone Age producer Chris Goss, to high grade studios owned by classical composer Jarrod Radnich, and the Pink Satellite studio owned by Motocross champion Chris Haines and operated by Queen music director Spike Edney.\n\nEdney’s primary home is England, but he’s had a small house in Joshua Tree since 2004. He says a gravitational pull draws him and other musicians to the high desert.\n\n“I’ve always wondered what it is that makes me want to come back here and think about it while I’m away,” Edney said inside his studio. “There is a magnetism and whether it’s a real, actual magnetism or whether it’s something imagined… We had some guests that came out here, musicians, and one of the wives stood looking out across the desert and said, ‘There’s something here that when you look out and see this view and breathe this air, it makes you feel that anything is possible.’ I think when you’re up here and you’re looking for creativity, you can find it.”\n\nMORE MUSIC:20 albums to discover the high desert sound\n\nSpiritual legacy\n\nArtists, musicians and philosophers have long been drawn to the area.\n\nEdwin John Dingle, one of the first Westerners to study at a monastery in Tibet, founded the Institute of Mentalphysics (now the Joshua Tree Retreat Center) in Joshua Tree in 1941, at age 60, after saying he was spiritually guided to an energy vortex on Highway 62. Frank Lloyd Wright designed Dingle’s Joshua Tree home and his son, Lloyd Wright, completed the surrounding compound.\n\nArtists and expatriate movie studio “seekers” studied Dingle’s Science of Mentalphysics, espousing “the oneness of life embodied in all substance, energy and thought.” It was far from a narrow religious cult. Its metaphysical book store also sold Robert Collier’s volumes of “Secrets of the Ages” and Emmet Fox’s “Power Through Constructive Thinking.”\n\nMany of those same retired Hollywood actors, directors and producers built the Hi-Desert Cultural Center in 1964, incorporating it as a nonprofit in 1967 to promote “dramatic, musical, visual, and other forms of artistic expression.”\n\nA new generation of entertainers and spiritual seekers began arriving in the 1960s. The late Ted Markland, a co-star of “The High Chaparral” from 1967-‘69, was attracted to the high desert by a series of UFO conventions at the Integratron in Landers, built by former aircraft mechanic George Van Tassel after reportedly receiving telepathic instructions from Venus.\n\nMarkland was friends with a Chumash medicine man he knew from Hollywood named Grandfather Semu Huaute. He had participated in Indian peyote rituals since the late 1950s and studied the teachings of the 11th century Tibetan Buddhist, Milarepa.\n\nHe found a hill on the Yucca Valley side of the then-Joshua Tree National Monument where he had a series of metaphysical experiences. He began taking show biz friends to his hill to “hear the voice of God.” In 1967, he hosted the wedding of LSD guru Timothy Leary in that section of the Monument, and LSD was consumed liberally.\n\nAmong the celebrities Markland accompanied to Joshua Tree were Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and Gram Parsons of the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers. Markland said in 2006, “I can’t figure what the big thing about Gram was. He was just a singer. He OD’d on drugs.”\n\nHe overdosed in the Joshua Tree Inn in 1973, but, rather than let his family bury him, his friend and tour manager, Phil Kaufman, honored a pact they made to scatter his ashes in Joshua Tree National Monument. He stole the coffin containing Parson's body at Los Angeles International Airport before it could be shipped to his family home in Louisiana. Then he took it to the Monument and set it on fire at Cap Rock. His actions became so legendary, it was made into a 2003 movie titled “Grand Theft Parsons.”\n\nVON RABBIT:High desert hurdle may now give music priestess a lift\n\nArtists from The Doors and the Eagles to “Saturday Night Live” creator Lorne Michaels took psychedelics, such as magic mushrooms, in Joshua Tree in the 1960s and '70s. But the working musicians and artists moved to the area more gradually.\n\nBritish folk-rock singer Donovan took a break from his career to raise his family there in the 1980s. Jim Yester, who sang the lead on “Along Comes Mary” with the Association, also bought a Joshua Tree home that decade. Victoria Williams and “King of Surf Guitar” Dick Dale moved to the high desert around 1990. Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and Markland friend Eric Burdon, who had lived in the low desert since the 1960s, bought a house there in the early 2000s.\n\nWhen asked why psychedelics were so popular in the desert, Burdon said, \"It's easier to find God there than on Van Nuys Boulevard.\"\n\nMusical migration\n\nToday, the high desert is filled with working musicians. English said he’s featuring more local artists than ever at his festival next month with nine. He had previously averaged five to seven local musicians at that global festival and his roots festival in October.\n\n“I’d like to make more room because there are just so many,” he said. “The town has slowly been attracting artists over time and now it’s reached the point, ‘Hey, look around, there’s a lot. It’s not just Eric Burdon and Victoria Williams, who were here 20 years ago. It’s really become a thick scene.\n\n“People say, ‘What’s a big music town?’ and people say, Brooklyn and Portland, Austin and Seattle. But this definitely has something unique. If you consider the ratio of the population to the number of artists, our ratio is way higher.”\n\nRancho de la Luna owner Dave Catching was so busy when Shelley was looking for a studio, it inspired him to go to High Lonesome. Catching had been recording major acts like the Arctic Monkeys, the Hives, Unkle and Mark Lanegan since the late 1990s when Homme organized some jam sessions with studio founder Fred Drake known as the Desert Sessions.\n\n“Josh was a huge fan of Fred’s drumming – and of Fred – so he would come up and record with Fred,” said Catching, a guitarist with Eagles of Death Metal and Earthlings¿. “We started with people we knew and then it started growing to outside people. That definitely helped the studio. I think that’s why 95 percent of the people drawn here want to record here – because of Josh’s involvement.”\n\nJOSH HOMME AND JESSE HUGHES: Not letting Paris define them\n\nNow the Rancho is attracting international artists.\n\n“I just had a band from Norway called Motorpscyho,” Catching said. “The bass player has a country band called Sugarfoot and they just finished their second album here in January.”\n\nBritish musician Rocco Gardner recorded an album with Catching in 2012. He became so infatuated with the area, he bought a house on 40 acres near Pappy and Harriet’s and recently bought another 100 acres. He unveiled his Rancho V studio last year and added Airstream trailers for visiting recording artists. Chris Thorn of Blind Melon and Peaches are among the artists he’s recorded there.\n\n“When I first came here (in 2004), or even when I bought the ranch, it was just kind of rock and roll,” Gardner said. “It was Catching, Queens of the Stone Age and those guys. That’s what grabbed me about it. Then there was this sort of hipster arrival.\n\n“I have no negative feelings about more people arriving. La Copine (Kitchen) is getting reviewed nationally. When you see 40 people standing outside a café on Old Woman Springs Road at 9 o’clock in the morning, all looking quite trendy, you know it’s happening.\"\n\nUnck, Edney, Catching and Gardner all have studios accessible only by dirt roads. That's one of the attractions of having recording studios in the middle of nowhere. There's no one around to complain about the noise.\n\nEdney said he didn’t get excited about Haines’ idea to build the Pink Satellite until he discovered how much talent there was in the region.\n\n“I keep being introduced (to musicians) by our good friend Bobby Furgo, who is a high desert icon, and his musical mate, Robbi Robb, who is a producer and a bandleader,” he said. “They have extensive connections with the known musicians and the lesser musicians. I’m quite intrigued by the lesser known musicians.”\n\nEdney served as a judge at the last two Tachevah Music Showcases at Pappy and Harriet’s to find musicians he might like to record at the Pink Satellite. But he’s discovering talent all over.\n\nREAD MORE:East valley is an incubator for young musicians\n\n“The quality and singing and musicianship is very inspiring,” he said. “We had a little showcase and eight or nine people I’d never heard of, and they could all sing and play really well. I’ve seen similar events where people cannot sing and play, even though they think they can.”\n\nFestival boom\n\nThe explosion of studios has corresponded with a growth of boutique music festivals. Jon McKinney, who founded GramFest, folded his three-day Parsons tribute in 2006 because he said his festival had brought attention to the country rock progenitor, but it was now, “promoting all the products for Sony and Warner Bros.”\n\nDavid Lowery, leader of Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker, started his Campout at Pappy and Harriet’s in 2005, featuring both bands and supporting acts like Gram Rabbit over a weekend in September. The Clean Air, Clean Skies Festival started at Pappy and Harriet’s in 2007 and, after a short hiatus, returned as the Desert Stars Festival, specializing in the psychedelic sound that is part of the high desert heritage. Its headliners included Krieger, the Dandy Warhols and Dinosaur Jr.*\n\nThe Joshua Tree Retreat Center, which had long produced retreats with speakers such as reincarnation advocate Shirley MacLaine, began promoting Eastern spiritual-oriented music and yoga festivals with its first Bhakti Fest in September 2009. Then it presented the female-focused Shakti Fest in May 2011, a UFO convention called Contact in the Desert and a “flow art” retreat fueled by fire games called the IgNght Conference in 2013. Earlier this month, a Sam Nam Fest focused on music and healing.\n\nThe Retreat Center expanded in a more secular direction last year with an event billed as a spiritual concert by hip-hop star Childish Gambino. The much-lauded Desert Daze Festival followed with diverse rockers including Primus, Television and Deerhunter.\n\nThe dizzying pace has required some adjustment for long-time residents like von Rabbit.\n\n“I’ve definitely seen this place get a lot more trendy,” she said. “I sound like a real old person: ‘Who are these kids coming in here?’ I have to catch myself. ‘Jesika, you sound like the people who own the farm by Woodstock.’ But you want to keep that little secret to yourself.”\n\nTHE TRIBESMEN:This east valley instrumental band does not need a vocalist\n\nTerry Taylor-Castillo, interim director of the Joshua Tree Retreat Center, said it may slow down a bit. The Childish Gambino concert was “a unique situation,” she said, and, “I don’t see that happening again.”\n\nIt may have been spiritual, but it provoked controversy in Joshua Tree. English said it was a bad fit for the area.\n\n“I think because of where the Retreat Center is,” he said. “It’s located right on the highway and there’s a neighborhood across the street with quite a few houses. So, to have outdoor music there past midnight really is a square peg in a round hole. They (also) ended up grading like three acres of supposedly protected desert land, and that just got everybody up in arms.”\n\nThe Desert Daze promoters have a contract for another fall festival at the Retreat Center, but Taylor-Castillo said, “It’s not something we really want to concentrate on in the future.”\n\nThe center is now reassessing its direction after parting company with executive director Victoria Gevoian. Taylor-Castillo said she’d like to have more community events with local musicians, but only spiritually-focused big events.\n\n“We are bringing in some new things, but they’re mostly like yoga retreats, shamanistic things, cleanses, personal growth, silent retreats,” said Taylor-Castillo, who runs the Taylor Junction art gallery in Joshua Tree in addition to serving on the Retreat Center board. “I really don’t see that our future will be (secular) music festivals.”\n\nThe Joshua Tree Lake Campground, which is now preparing for the May 18 Joshua Tree Music Festival, also has expanded its offering. It recently hosted a nudity-allowed “adult carnival” for the L.A. League of Arts, an organization associated with Burning Man that produces the Burning Man Decompression Arts and Music Festival in Los Angeles.\n\nSally Jayes, co-owner of the campground with her husband, Ken, was on the Joshua Tree Chamber of Commerce from the late 1990s to 2003-’04, and she says the chamber laid out a welcome mat for musicians and artists then.\n\n“I got off because the chamber was there for commerce, for business,” she said, “and the people that were there wanted to move to art. That’s fine for downtown, but it’s not commerce.”\n\nGenie out of the bottle*\n\nRobyn Celia and Linda Krantz recall the high desert as “a completely different animal in 2003.”\n\nCelia was performing in a New York rock band called Lava Baby in the 1990s and Krantz was a props mistress in the film industry. Krantz stayed at the Pioneertown Hotel and went back to New York and told Celia about this crazy saloon, called Pappy and Harriet’s, built as a movie set for cowboy actors back in 1946. Celia and Krantz bought it in 2003 with their credit cards.\n\n“When I came out here, (the music community) was only one family; everybody knew each other,” Celia said. “At that time at Pappy’s, everybody wanted country music. It took us a really long time to not get the phone calls, like, ‘Is it country? Oh, God, it’s not?’ Now my best nights are if (Seattle grunge progenitors) the Melvins are playing.”*\n\nThis is Pappy's busiest time of the year with Coachella bands playing sold-out shows between its two weekends. But Pappy's also has presented Robert Plant, attracted by a Wanda Jackson show, crooner Rufus Wainwright playing a cabaret show and, of course, Paul McCartney performing between Desert Trip shows last October.\n\nCelia says the rapid high desert growth began with the recession.\n\n“When everybody else was panicking, I feel this area exploded because people couldn’t afford to go overseas or couldn’t afford to take an expensive vacation,” she said. “So they started to discover this area. It all happened at the same time. When people discovered Pappy’s, they discovered the Integratron and the park. If you look at the park’s numbers each year, it’s amazing.”\n\nDESERT MAG: High desert artists shift a growing music scene\n\nLike Pappy’s, you can’t just roll up to Joshua Tree National Park and expect to get into a campsite anymore. The park set an attendance record with 2 million visitors in 2015, and then drew 500,000 more in 2016. Now it’s encouraging visitors to reserve private sites out of the park.\n\nThe Joshua Tree Music Festival also sets new attendance records every year, but last year it had its biggest jump ever – up more than 12 percent to 4,100 people. English says he’ll cap attendance at 4,500.\n\n“To be honest, that size would allow us to still keep the ticket price reasonable,\" he said. \"We could produce a really nice show and you and I could still run into each other instead of having to text. I don’t want to be in the business of running a big show because then I’m just in the port-a-(potty) and security business.”\n\nHidden scene\n\nDespite the rapid growth at Joshua Tree National Park and Pappy and Harriet’s, the music scene in between remains relatively invisible to outsiders. Pete Stahl, who began recording at Rancho de la Luna in the mid-1990s and then introduced his former Washington D.C. bandmate, Foo Fighters leader Dave Grohl, to the studio in 1997, says he gets the same feeling coming to Joshua Tree from L.A. that he did 25 years ago.\n\n“It still feels the same to me,” said Stahl, who had driven in for a session with the Earthlings¿. “Obviously there are more people coming in and out of the park, but it still feels special. There’s a certain quietness to the desert and a light, and that’s the same. It’s that kind of magical atmosphere that is attractive.”\n\n“For me, it’s quiet there and when I go, it’s not busy,” said Shelley. “Where Chris (Unck)’s place is, it’s out in the middle of nowhere. So you can let yourself dig into your thoughts a little bit deeper than maybe you would with a lot of the stimulus you might get in the city. And it is a beautiful place.”\n\nEven the musicians who live there are so isolated, they aren’t aware of all the local studios or even some significant musicians in the community. Edney praised Ted Quinn for being “a magnet for aspiring musicians of all ages and all genres” with his Tuesday open mic night at the Joshua Tree Saloon and online radio show from the Joshua Tree Lounge, where he recorded his recent album, “1.11” live – before doing overdubs at Jamie Hafler’s Ghost of Future Records studio in Joshua Tree.\n\nCatching had no idea how many other studios there were in the high desert. He said he doesn’t go out much in Joshua Tree because he’s either recording or decompressing from a tour. English said that’s typical of the working musicians.\n\n“Most people are very independent, DIY-type of people anyway,” he said. “That’s why they’re out here in the middle of nowhere with their own studio. So, people could be up here for years and not know someone that lives up on the other side of the rocks.”\n\nVon Rabbit hadn’t heard of Radnich, the 34-year-old president and chairman of the Hi-Desert Cultural Center, founder of the Joshua Tree Philharmonic, and an internationally known classical composer and pianist who has appeared on NBC’s “The Today Show.”\n\nRADNICH ON PIANO: See him play music from 'Pirates of Caribbean'\n\nRadnich, a Joshua Tree native, isn't surprised that there's a whole community of musicians who don't know each or realize how many studios there are in Joshua Tree.\n\n“There really is a dichotomy in the Joshua Tree music scene,” he said, “and, in fact, that name says a lot. There’s the scene with those who perform locally or semi-locally, and whose music income is driven by live entertainment – where one needs to literally be seen by your audience – and then there are industry professionals who produce product not dependent on live performance, but who have products that have captured a global market. There really is little mixing between these two groups of musicians, as their focus is so very different.”\n\nBut Radnich is excited about re-opening the Hi-Desert Cultural Center’s main theater and showing the local musicians its improved sound quality for recording and live shows.\n\n“The Cultural Center was almost exclusively live theater for most of its existence,” he said. “It wasn’t originally designed to be a great music venue. However, Joshua Tree and the surrounding areas will soon finally find itself with a world class music and performance venue.”\n\n*An earlier version of this story contained incorrect names.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/us/five-things-august-31-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for August 31: Mar-a-Lago, Flooding, Heat waves ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Kansas voters rejected an amendment that would have removed the right to an abortion from the state’s constitution. This is the first time citizens have been able to weigh in on the issue at the polls since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and the high turnout in Kansas could be a sign that voters will continue to show up to make their disagreement known. In Missouri, disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens lost his Republican primary after a controversial attempt to reenter politics. Several election deniers backed by former President Donald Trump were on the ballot in Arizona, Michigan and Washington. Some of these races are still too close to call, but Trump-backed Tudor Dixon is projected to become Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s challenger in November.\n\n2.

Ukraine’s infrastructure losses amount to more than $100 billion, according to its prime minister. This comes as Ukraine’s military has warned that Russian forces are preparing for renewed assaults on cities in the Donetsk region still controlled by Kyiv after taking over Lysychansk – the final city to fall in the Luhansk region. Meanwhile, up to 60 million tons of grain could be stuck in Ukraine by the fall if Russia continues to block the country’s exports, Zelensky said.\n\nCNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

She steered widely clear of both policy arguments and political attacks on Democrat Joe Biden.\n\n“The common thread in all of these challenging situations is the unwavering resolve to help one another,” Melania Trump said in address that also touched on mental health and addiction with a weight few others have given to those issues.\n\nThat softer approach was set before the first lady walked onto the podium in the historic garden that was recently renovated under her direction. Unlike the convention’s opening night, most speakers Tuesday focused their fire on Biden’s policies – particularly his desire to roll back Trump’s tax cuts on high earners -- rather than on dark premonitions of “socialism” or the “destruction” of suburbs.\n\n“Americans are going back to work,” said Larry Kudlow, one of Trump’s top economic advisers. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.”\n\nSpeakers sought to tout the progress made confronting the economic crisis without offering proposals for dealing with the current dramatic increase in unemployment. Many featured speakers, including the first lady, discussed the coronavirus in broad terms, arguing that the president “would not rest” until a vaccine or therapy had approved to treat the illness.\n\nLara Brown, director of George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management, noted that some Republicans spoke as if COVID-19 was already in the past and the economy had already recovered.\n\n\"Both of those descriptions about the present moment and near future seem disconnected from the reality that most Americans are experiencing,\" Brown said.\n\nThe Republican convention started Tuesday with a recognition of the high-profile shooting in Wisconsin of Jacob Blake, a Black man shot in the back by police in an incident that has aired for days on cable news. The convention’s opening prayer, offered by a Las Vegas minister, called for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake.\n\nTrump himself made two remarkable appearances: Formally pardoning Jon Ponder, a Las Vegas man who helps ex-prisoners re-enter society, and leading a naturalization ceremony for five new U.S. citizens. Both highly unusual events were criticized by Democrats as a questionable use of presidential authority during a political event.\n\nLiz Mair, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, wondered if the president delayed the pardon so that it would coincide with the convention.\n\n\"The main thing I find troubling is that Trump knew Jon Ponder, knew his story, knew of his good works, and didn’t get around to pardoning him until today,\" she said.\n\nBut they also set a far different message than Trump’s usual rhetoric on immigration: Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, was barely raised at all. Neither were his efforts to limit legal immigration through unilateral changes to asylum and visa programs.\n\n\"Congratulations,” Trump told the group in a video the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast. “Great going.\"\n\nConvention speakers touted the tax cut law Trump signed in 2017, the recent agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. The convention featured a video noting the number of women Trump had appointed to top jobs in the White House, including the current and previous two White House press secretaries.\n\nThe night was not entirely devoid of harsh criticism of Biden. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, in particular, used her remarks to attack the former vice president's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine, revisiting an argument she raised during the president’s impeachment defense.\n\n“If they want to make this election a choice between who's been saving America and who's been swindling America, bring it on,” Bondi said.\n\nNor did the convention’s second night go off without a hitch: Organizers had to pull a speaker from the lineup after she promoted anti-Semitic, QAnon conspiracy theory on Twitter. Mary Ann Mendoza -- an advocate for stricter immigration policies whose son was killed in accident by a driver who was an undocumented immigrant – was dropped shortly before the event got underway.\n\nBut for the most part, the convention’s second night appeared to stick to a different script.\n\n“Donald is a husband that supports me in all that I do,” first lady Melania Trump said. “We will be honored to serve this incredible country for four more years.”\n\n-- John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nMelania Trump confident the nation will recover from COVID-19\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump headlined the second night of the GOP convention with a keynote address from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, opening her remarks by acknowledging the coronavirus pandemic and the devastation and anxiety it has caused across the country.\n\n“I want to acknowledge the fact that since March, our lives have changed drastically. The invisible enemy COVID-19 swept across our beautiful country and impacted all of us,” she said. “My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering.”\n\n“I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know. You are not alone,” she continued. “My husband's administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone.”\n\nAre the trees gone?:Melania Trump did not remove cherry trees, historic roses from Rose Garden\n\nTrump’s homage to women’s suffrage and the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as part of the campaign’s wider effort to appeal to the crucial female voting bloc. A recent ABC/Washington Post poll found that Joe Biden leads Trump 56% to 40% in support among women.\n\n\"I reflected on the impact of women's voices in our nation's story and how proud I will be to cast my vote again for Donald, this November,\" she said. \"We must make sure that women are heard. And that American Dream continues to thrive.\"\n\nThe first lady’s address is her biggest prime-time speech since the 2016 GOP convention, where she was accused of plagiarism after portions of her speech closely resembled parts of a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama.\n\nA Trump Organization employee later issued a statement taking responsibility for the similarities.\n\nTrump has mostly stayed out of the political spotlight as her husband has campaigned in recent months but used the address to highlight her favorite moments as the first lady.\n\nIt also gave her a chance to showcase the renovations she oversaw of the Rose Garden though not without controversy. Delivering her speech from the Rose Garden, part of the official White House, raised ethical questions about whether it blurred the line between the government and the president’s re-election campaign.\n\nShe also opened up about her experience of coming to the U.S. from Slovenia, even as her husband has sought to curb legal and illegal immigration.\n\nTrump said becoming a citizen was \"one of the proudest moments in my life, because with hard work and determination, I was able to achieve my own American dream.\"\n\n\"As an immigrant, and a very independent woman. I understand what a privilege is that we have,\" she said. \"There are no words to describe how honored humbled and fortunate I am to serve our nation as your first lady.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nKentucky attorney general: Biden ‘a backwards thinker’\n\nKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron slammed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as “a backwards thinker” and suggested President Donald Trump could live up to the “mandate” of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nCameron, the state’s first Black attorney general, blasted Biden for saying during a radio interview earlier this year that African Americans who don’t vote for him “ain’t black” and warning in 2012 that Republicans would put Blacks “back in chains.”\n\n“Joe Biden is a backwards thinker in a world craving forward-looking leadership,” Cameron said. “There’s no wisdom in his record or plan, just a trail of discredited ideas and offensive statements.”\n\nCameron, a rising star in the Republican Party, has come under criticism from activists who want his office to speed up its investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by police in her Louisville apartment in March. Her death has sparked protests across the country.\n\nIn his remarks at the Republican National Convention, Cameron criticized anarchists who “mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police officers and innocent bystanders.”\n\nRepublicans “recognize those who earnestly strive for peace, justice, and equality,” he said.\n\nCameron, who was raised just a few miles from Lincoln’s birthplace in Kentucky, said the nation’s 16th president – who is also the first Republican president – believed “the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present … and we must rise to the occasion.”\n\n“I believe President Trump can meet Lincoln’s mandate, even as Joe Biden remains trapped by his party’s radicals and his own failed record,” he said\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nPompeo touts Trump’s 'bold' foreign policy in remarks from abroad\n\nSpeaking from Israel while traveling on official government business, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump has “led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world” to secure peace and “keep us safe and our freedoms intact.”\n\n“It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked,” Pompeo said in defense of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy that has alienated traditional U.S. allies, even as Trump courted foreign adversaries. He recorded his remarks during a stop in Jerusalem, part of a four-country diplomatic mission in the region.\n\nThe State Department said Pompeo was speaking in his personal capacity, not as America’s chief diplomat. But Pompeo talked about policy decisions.\n\nThe successes he touted included holding China accountable “for covering up the China virus,” killing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, lowering the temperature with North Korea, exiting the “disastrous nuclear deal with Iran” and moving the U.S. Embassy to “this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland.”\n\nIn 2017, Trump delivered on a campaign promise to break with decades of U.S. foreign policy and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That decision, among other pro-Israel policies, has helped bolster Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a pivotal constituency for the GOP.\n\nPompeo’s remarks broke diplomatic protocol and perhaps the State Department's own policy on engaging in partisan political activity.\n\nBefore he spoke, Rep. Joaquin Castro, a top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, opened a probe into Pompeo’s decision, saying he has \"a gross disregard\" for ethics rules and \"a blatant willingness to violate federal law for political gain.\"\n\n— Maureen Groppe and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nEric and Tiffany Trump step into the spotlight to tout father's record\n\nEric Trump, Trump’s third eldest son, joined a list of relatives who spoke or are slated to speak at the Republican convention. He used his remarks to tick off a list of his father’s accomplishments and echoed his brother, Donald Trump Jr., in painting a Joe Biden presidency as “the empty, oppressive and radical views of the extreme left.”\n\n“He is a career politician who has never signed the front of a check and does not know the slightest thing about the American worker or the American business,” Trump said.\n\nLike his brother, Eric Trump falsely claimed that Biden wants to defund the police, a call by some on the left to shift public resources from law enforcement agencies to social programs and public safety alternatives. Biden has said he does not back defunding police and instead called for additional funding for local police forces.\n\nEric Trump rounded out his remarks by speaking directly to his father, saying he missed “working alongside you every day but I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight.”\n\nTiffany Trump, the fourth of the president’s five children and perhaps the least visible, offered a stinging critique of the media, technology companies and even the nation’s education system for promoting what she described as “groupthink” that stands in opposition to the president.\n\n“People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for may and are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants,” said Tiffany Trump, who graduated from Georgetown Law this year. “If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another.”\n\nTrump’s family was heavily represented on the second night of the convention at a difficult time: The president’s brother died of an undisclosed illness Aug. 15. President Trump has also been forced to contend with a critical book written by his niece, Mary Trump, and recorded audio of sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, ripping him for “phoniness” and “lying.”\n\nThere was little indication of that strife on Tuesday, though.\n\nTiffany Trump implored Americans to see “beyond the façade – the masks – that so many other politicians employ” and she urged voters to “make your judgment based on results and not rhetoric.”\n\n— John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian\n\nPolice officer touts Trump efforts on opioids\n\nMarrying two key criminal justice messages often addressed by President Donald Trump, the Republican convention on Tuesday turned to an Albuquerque police officer who adopted the baby of a woman addicted to heroin.\n\nRyan Holets recalled an incident in 2017 in which he approached a pregnant woman preparing to inject heroin. The woman confessed she seeking a family who would adopt her baby.\n\n\"God showed me exactly what I had to do,\" Holets said. \"Without hesitation, I told her that my family would adopt her baby.\"\n\nThe story hit on several important themes for Trump: First, the president has frequently touted the importance of police in communities, even as some departments have come under criticism for high-profile deadly interactions with Black citizens.\n\nThe story also spoke to an issue Trump has frequently discussed: The growth of opioid addiction in the U.S. Trump has signed several executive orders on the issue, and the administration has worked to reduce the number of opioids prescribed by doctors.\n\n\"I hold a special place in my heart for those facing opioid addiction,\" Holets said. \"That’s why I’m enormously grateful to the president for his leadership in fighting this deadly enemy.\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nNunez: Trump will oppose socialism\n\nFlorida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, the first Latina in that post in state history, urged voters to support President Donald Trump to put “America first” in economic policy and for religious freedom.\n\n“Let us join our president in his vow that America will never be a socialist country,” said Nunez, whose parents fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. “He’s defended our religious freedom, stood with democratic allies like Colombia, and shown unwavering resolve while confronting tyrants in countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China and Nicaragua.”\n\nShe said Trump would support law enforcement. She said he would fight to provide the best quality education by preserving school choice.\n\n“Americans have a choice,” Nunez said. “We can go down a dark road of chaos and government control, or we can choose the path of freedom and opportunity that was paved by those who sacrificed everything to preserve the American Dream for future generations.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nIowa governor: Trump ‘had our back’ during floods, storms\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds credits President Donald Trump with helping her state recover from devastating floods and storms.\n\nWhen 100-year floods breached nearly all levees and devastated communities along the Missouri River in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri last year, Trump approved their request for federal aid in record time – just two days, Reynolds said.\n\nAnd when a storm called a derecho, with hurricane-force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops just two weeks ago, Trump approved the state’s disaster aid request in less than 24 hours, she said.\n\nTrump “had our back,” said Reynolds, a Republican and Trump supporter.\n\n“The president cut through the bureaucracy to do what needed to be done, and to do it quickly,” she said.\n\nIowa is expected to be a key battleground state in November’s election. Trump carried the state in 2016 by nearly 9.5 percentage points. But polls show him in a tight race with Democratic challenger Joe Biden this year. Trump leads Biden by just 1.7 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of state polls.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nRepublican lawyer references Trump impeachment - to attack Joe Biden\n\nSurprisingly, President Donald Trump's impeachment came up at the Republican convention on Tuesday.\n\nNot surprisingly, a Republican lawyer used it to attack Joe Biden.\n\nFormer Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who helped Trump with his impeachment defense, used her speech to attack Joe Biden's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\"Joe Biden says he'll build back better,\" Bondi said at one point. \"Yeah ... build the Biden's Back Better.\"\n\nBondi provided no evidence that Hunter Biden's business activity in Ukraine was illegal, or that Biden himself acted improperly.\n\nDemocrats quickly pointed out that Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine into investigating Biden, despite the lack of evidence, and for threatening to withhold military aid if it did not follow through.\n\nSteve Schmidt, a former Republican and now a Trump opponent, tweeted that Bondi is \"ethically challenged,\" and \"lying about the Biden Family and repeating the talking points of Russian Intelligence Services.\"\n\nBondi has a close relationship with Trump, first as a long-time confidant from her days as attorney general and later as one of the lawyers who defended the president during the Senate impeachment trial earlier this year.\n\nShe also faced heavy criticism in 2013 when a Trump foundation sent her campaign a $25,000 check around the time her office decided not to join a New York state probe of consumer complaints against Trump University. Bondi has repeatedly said the donation had nothing to do with a decision made by independent investigators in her office not to pursue the investigation.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nRNC speaker pulled from lineup after boosting QAnon-tied conspiracy\n\nThe QAnon conspiracy theory made its way to the Republican National Convention Tuesday.\n\nShortly before the second night of programming began, Mary Ann Mendoza was pulled from the RNC lineup after earlier in the day retweeting an anti-Semitic Twitter thread with ties to the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nMendoza tweeted “Do yourself a favor and read this thread,” linking to a lengthy thread from a QAnon conspiracy theorist that claimed the Rothschilds, a famous Jewish family from Germany, created a plan to terrorize “goyim” — non-Jewish people — by having \"the goyim destroy each other\" and “rob the goyim of their landed properties.”\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nKudlow: Trump’s actions spurred coronavirus recovery\n\nLarry Kudlow, the White House’s top economic adviser, says the U.S. economy is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic thanks to “a great bipartisan rescue” led by President Donald Trump.\n\nA tax hike would disrupt the recovery, he warned.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 178,000 Americans, has had a catastrophic impact on the U.S. economy since March. A mind-boggling 57.3 million workers have filed for unemployment over the past 22 weeks. Just two weeks ago, some 1.1 million Americans filed first-time applications for unemployment, the Labor Department said, signaling that the recovery will remain volatile.\n\nBut Kudlow struck an upbeat tone in his remarks to the Republican National Convention.\n\n“Americans are going back to work,” Kudlow said. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.”\n\nLooking ahead, the Trump administration is planning more tax cuts and regulatory relief for small businesses, Kudlow said.\n\n“Our economic choice is very clear,” Kudlow said. “Do you want economic health prosperity opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation recession and pessimism? There can’t be better economic policies than we’ve had in recent years.”\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTaxes become theme of RNC\n\nRepublicans are working hard during the second night of the Republican convention to drive home a message about Democrat Joe Biden, arguing his administration would quickly increase taxes – as soon as Day 1.\n\n\"You're coming out of a pandemic, and he wants to raise taxes?\" asked Larry Kudlow, one of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers. \"That's crazy.\"\n\nIt was a theme that was repeatedly raised throughout the evening.\n\nJohn Peterson, owner a metal company, said Biden is \"ready to raise taxes, crush us with regulations.\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that Trump is the candidate to support for voters \"who want lower taxes.\"\n\nBiden has vowed to repeal the Trump tax cuts approved early in his presidency, but for top earners -- those earning over more than $400,000 – as well as corporations. If elected, Biden would need buy in from Congress to roll back the tax cuts, a move unlikely to take place on his first day.\n\n—John Fritze\n\nControversial former Planned Parenthood employee appeals to anti-abortion voters\n\nAbby Johnson, an anti-abortion advocate known for turning against Planned Parenthood after working as the director of a clinic, touted President Donald Trump’s anti-abortion agenda.\n\n“For me, abortion is real. I know what it sounds like; I know what abortion smells like. Did you know abortion even had a smell? I’ve been the perpetrator to these babies, to these women,” Johnson said on Tuesday.\n\nJohnson, author of the memoir “Unplanned” that was also adapted into a film, told the story of witnessing an abortion that changed her views on the issue while wearing a “1972” pin to symbolize the year before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal.\n\n“I left the clinic, looking back only to remember why I now advocate so passionately for life,” she said.\n\nShe praised Trump for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who would be sympathetic to pro-life ideals and for withdrawing federal funds from clinics that conduct abortion referrals.\n\n“Life is a core tenet of who we are as Americans,” Johnson said. “And this election is a choice between two radical, anti-life activists, and the most pro-life president we’ve ever had. That’s something that should compel you to action.”\n\nJohnson has come under fire for a number of controversial opinions. Vice reported Tuesday that she said in a video she thinks it is “smart” for police to be “on more high alert” when interacting with her biracial son than with her white sons because “statistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons.”\n\nRecent tweets by Johnson also show she supports head-of-household voting rights, which would only allow one representative from a household to cast their vote rather than each adult citizen. “In a Godly household, the husband would get the final say,” she said.\n\nIn a tweet ahead of her RNC appearance on Tuesday, Johnson accused abortion rights activists of being scared of her speech and “scrambling to try to find anything to detract people from my message.”\n\n—Jeanine Santucci\n\nChallenging the media\n\nNicholas Sandmann, the student at the center of a media storm, urged voters Tuesday to support President Donald Trump because he refuses to allow news coverage “to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts.”\n\n“I believe we must join a president who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism,” Sandmann, 18, said before putting on a red “Make America Great Again” hat. “This is worth fighting for. This is worth voting for. This is what President Donald Trump stands for.”\n\nThe news coverage that focused on Sandmann unfolded in January 2019, when the northern Kentucky teenager stared at Native American elder Nathan Phillips, who played a drum. A viral video of the moment played repeatedly on cable news and was reported in newspapers.\n\nSandmann, then a student at Covington Catholic High School, was attending a March for Life. Phillips was attending an Indigenous Peoples March. Sandmann said unfair coverage of the event changed his life forever in one moment without reporters asking for his side of the story or investigating Phillips’ motives.\n\n“What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage,” Sandmann said of his portrayal as a smirking boy in a red hat because of Trump’s opposition to abortion. “My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode.”\n\nSandmann sued CNN for $275 million by claiming the network defamed him, and the Washington Post. He reached undisclosed settlements in January.\n\nIn March, Sandmann sued five more outlets, including Gannett, the parent company of USA TODAY.\n\n“I learned that what was happening to me had a name. It was called being cancelled. As in annulled. As in revoked. As in made void,” Sandmann said. “Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened. Often, the media is a willing participant. But I would not be cancelled.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBilly Graham’s granddaughter praises Trump as a 'fierce advocate' for religious groups\n\nCissie Graham Lynch, the daughter of evangelist Franklin Graham and granddaughter of legendary preacher Billy Graham, hailed President Donald Trump as a “fierce advocate in the White House” for people of faith who stands up for religious freedoms that were “under attack” during the Obama administration.\n\n“Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced. Not bullied,” she said. “But during the Obama-Biden administration, these freedoms were under attack.”\n\nThe president is trying to shore up support among conservative Christians and white evangelicals who helped him secure his 2016 victory, but his approval rating among religious groups has slipped in recent months. A Pew Research Center survey last month found that 59% of white evangelicals say they “very strongly” approve of Trump, down eight points from April. But the survey also found that 82% would still vote for him if the election were held in July.\n\nGraham Lynch, whose father is scheduled to speak on Thursday, said Trump-appointed judges who “respect the First Amendment,” supported religious beliefs in court and “ensured religious ministries would not be forced to violate their beliefs.”\n\nShe added there was “no room for people of faith” in the Biden administration, though the former vice president has frequently talked about how his Catholic faith has helped him survive the death of his first wife and their daughter in a 1972 car crash, as well as the death of his son in 2015.\n\n“Whether you’re a baker, a florist or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God or to Caesar,” she said. “Because the radical left’s god is government power.”\n\nGraham Lynch’s comments came hours after Jerushah Duford, another granddaughter of Billy Graham, penned a searing rebuke of Trump and her uncle Franklin Graham for his support of the president. Duford, who wrote in USA TODAY that her faith and church have become “a laughing stock,” called on evangelical Christian women to speak out against Trump’s actions.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nRNC turns to a more hopeful message\n\nBreaking with the dire messaging of \"socialism\" and \"Loch Ness\" monsters that dominated the first night of the RNC, Republicans embraced a softer tone Tuesday -- at least in the early minutes -- ahead of first lady Melania Trump's address.\n\n\"He has followed through on his promises,\" asserted Maine lobsterman Jason Joyce.\n\n\"More than any president in my lifetime, he's acknowledged the importance of farmers and agriculture,\" said dairy farmer Chris Peterson.\n\nIn the most notable example of the shift, Trump appeared himself briefly in a taped appearance from the White House and signed a pardon to Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society.\n\nThe event drew scrutiny from Democrats, some of whom questioned the president's use of an official act at a political convention, but it nevertheless underscored more of a focus on the president's accomplishments rather than on what Republicans see as Biden's failures.\n\n\"Today, I’m filled with hope,\" Ponder said. \"I have been given a second chance.\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nFishing for votes\n\nJason Joyce, an eighth-generation lobsterman from Swan’s Island, Maine, said he didn't support President Donald Trump in 2016 because he expected the president \"to flip flop on his campaign promises.\"\n\nBut Joyce strongly supports Trump’s reelection this year because the president listened to fishermen’s views and adopted them. In contrast, Joyce characterized the Obama administration and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, as ignoring industry views.\n\n“As long as Trump is president, fishing families like mine will have a voice,” Joyce said. “But if Biden wins, he’ll be controlled by the environmental extremists who want to circumvent longstanding rules and impose radical changes that hurt our coastal communities.”\n\nTrump has promoted Maine lobster since a June 5 roundtable in Bangor. He reversed the Obama administration order that closed off 5,000 square miles of ocean to fishing for what is called the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.\n\n“This action was deeply unfair to Maine lobstermen,” Trump said.\n\nThe monument is about 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod – too far for Mainers to reach. And Obama grandfathered lobster and crab harvesting for seven years in the 2016 order, so those fisheries haven't been affected yet. But the decision still rankled fishermen.\n\n“Although Maine's lobstermen don't fish there, Obama's executive order offended us greatly. It circumvented the fisheries counsels’ input,” Joyce said. “President Trump reversed that decision, reinstating the rules that allow stakeholder input, and he supports a process that seeks and respects fishermen's views.”\n\nLobster is a valuable seafood market, with 133 million pounds landed in 2017 worth nearly $600 million, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. Mainers landed more than 80% of the U.S. lobster catch that year.\n\nBut trade wars have damaged the industry. The European Union agreed Friday to lift tariffs of 8% on U.S. lobster and 20% on lobster products, which had hurt trade compared to Canadian lobster that faced no tariffs.\n\nChina also imposed a tariff on U.S. lobster in 2018 that now stands at least at 35%. Trump asked the Agriculture Department for monthly reports on the China tariff starting Aug. 15.\n\nJoyce said he strongly supported Trump's reelection.\n\n\"When he sees something isn't right, he’s fearless in fixing it,\" Joyce said. \"He listens to working people.\"\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nRand Paul: 'If you hate war ... support President Trump'\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican known for his anti-interventionist view of global affairs, praised Trump’s approach to “end war rather than start one,\" trying to portray a stark contrast between the president and Joe Biden when it comes to making the planet safer.\n\n\"I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President Trump will bring our heroes home,\" said Paul, who has often joined the president in calling for the wind-down of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\"If you hate war like I hate war…if you want us to quit sending $50 billion every year to Afghanistan to build their roads and bridges instead of building them here at home, you need to support President Trump for another term.\"\n\nTrump has touted his unconventional strategy on foreign policy, including efforts to build bridges with authoritarian figures such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea despot Kim Jong-Un.\n\nHe’s also drawn bipartisan fire for trying to undermine the NATO alliance and for pulling troops out of Syria, a move that prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis.\n\nPaul, who did not appear at the RNC in 2016, had some unkind words for Trump four years ago when both were running for the White House. He called the billionaire businessman \"a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag.\" Trump in turn criticized Paul's looks and called him \"a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain.\"\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nPrayers for Jacob Blake during RNC\n\nNorma Urrabazo from the International Church of Las Vegas opened Tuesday’s events with a prayer for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake, the Wisconsin man who was shot multiple times in the back by police officers Sunday while he was leaning into an SUV.\n\n“I’m going to invite you to join your faith with mine and let’s prayer in agreement,” Urrabazo said. “Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight.”\n\nIn addition to prayer for Blake and his family, Urrabazo asked for protection for those who have “put their lives in harm’s way, to bring safety and security to our streets.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nRNC courts Native American vote for Trump\n\nNative Americans will make up a tiny slice of the electorate in November, but they could have an outsized influence on the election where it counts: Several battleground states.\n\nSo it was no surprise the RNC opened its second night with Myron Lizer, vice president of the Navajo Nation – a territory that covers portions of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.\n\n“Our people have never been invited into the American Dream,” said Lizer, who appeared with Trump at an event in Phoenix this year. “We’ve for years fought congressional battles with past congressmen and senators that were part of a broken system that ignored us.\n\n“That is, until President Trump took office,” he said.\n\nLizer pointed specifically to billions of dollars in economic stimulus to help tribal communities address COVID-19.\n\nTrump has had a complicated relationship with Native Americans. He repeated use of the word “Pocahontas” to mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been offensive to some.\n\nMore recently, Trump slammed the decision to change the name of the Washington, D.C., NFL team, a word that is a slur used to describe Native Americans.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 5.2 million people identified as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, or in combination with at least one other race.\n\nThe vast majority vote Democratic, except in states where energy is a large focus of the regional economy, such as Alaska, North Dakota or Oklahoma. Native Americans could also be a factor in Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\n—John Fritze and Ledyard King\n\nTrump's surprises: Swearing in new citizens, pardoning a prison activist\n\nPresident Donald Trump used a \"surprise appearance\" at Tuesday's Republican political convention to swear in five new U.S. citizens.\n\nWhile some analysts questioned Trump taking official actions at a political convention, the president supervised the swearing-in of five new U.S. citizens born in Bolivia, Lebanon, India, Ghana and Sudan.\n\n\"Congratulations – great going,\" Trump told the group in a video that the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast.\n\nNoting that one of the new American citizens has a degree in psychology, Trump said: \"In other words, she can figure me out.\"\n\nWhile Trump used the ceremony to tout the virtues of legal immigration, Democrats said his crackdowns at the border are designed to keep out any person of color.\n\nCritics said Trump should not make such political use of the presidency at a political convention.\n\nBen Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted that the GOP meeting \"is infused with the illegal and unethical use of everything from the White House to the presidential pardon power.\"\n\nBefore the immigration ceremony, Trump signed a federal pardon for Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society.\n\n\"Jon's life is a beautiful testament to the power of redemption,\" Trump said\n\nThe state of Nevada had already granted clemency to Ponder, a convicted bank robber.\n\nTrump, who has made criminal justice reform a part of his agenda, praised Ponder's work with ex-prisoners, he did not mention voting rights. The president has opposed restoring voting rights for felons, and criticized governors who support the idea.\n\nIn thanking Trump for his federal pardon, Ponder said \"we live in a nation of second chances.\"\n\nRichard Beasley, a retired FBI agent who once arrested Ponder but is now a friend, also appeared in the video, saying, \"I'm so proud of Jon with his life's turnaround, and for all the lives that he's helped to change.\"\n\nCritics said Trump's use of the presidency violates at least the spirit of the Hatch Act that forbids government employees engaging political activity. (Presidents, however, are exempt from the law.)\n\n\"The Hatch Act is a law designed to separate politics from public service,\" tweeted Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Those lines are being erased tonight.\"\n\nIn his latest break from political tradition, Trump is making appearances every night at the Republican convention.\n\nThat will include his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night.\n\nLocation: The White House.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nRNC viewership fell 29% from 2016\n\nThe first night of the Republican National Convention on Monday averaged 15.9 million television viewers – 29% less than viewership four years ago and 15% less than the first night of last week’s Democratic National Convention.\n\nIt closely resembles the 27% nosedive in viewers for night 1 of the DNC convention, which averaged 18.7 million viewers. The opening night of the 2016 RNC convention in Cleveland, Ohio drew about 22.5 million viewers.\n\nThe Nielsen figures, reported by Variety and the Los Angeles Times, combine viewership on the three main networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, and leading cable new networks CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nFox News set the pace Monday leading with 7.1 million viewers followed by CNN’s 2 million viewers; ABC, nearly 2 million; NBC, 1.7 million; MSNBC, 1,6 million; and CBS, 1.5 million.\n\nFacing challenges of a global pandemic, both conventions ditched arenas and live audiences in favor of many recorded speeches and prepackaged videos. Democrats pieced together four nights of two-hour television shows while several Republican speakers shared the same stage at Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. while President Donald Trump was featured in multiple videos shot in the White House.\n\nAlthough last week’s DNC viewership was down significantly, the campaign for Democratic nominee Joe Biden touted a record 10.2 million digital viewers, totaling 28.9 million viewers overall when combined with television viewership.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nMelania Trump big draw of RNC's second night\n\nOn its second night, the Republican National Convention will get personal.\n\nThe virtual lineup for Tuesday includes first lady Melania Trump and two of the president's children – Eric and Tiffany – along with a series of business people, advocates for Republican causes and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nMelania Trump, rarely seen campaigning with the president, will be the big draw of the evening. The first lady will speak in prime time from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, a project she supervised.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself is also expected to show up during the online convention Tuesday. He plans to appear every night this week, leading up to his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night, also at the White House.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDems push economic counter program during RNC\n\nThe battle over who gets credit for the pre-COVID economic recovery has become a defining issue of the conventions as well as this year's presidential election. Not surprisingly, Democrats argued Tuesday that Joe Biden deserves much of the credit.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, speaking as part of the Biden campaign's RNC counter-programming, said it was the Obama-Biden administration that led the country out of the worst economic downturn in generations. Trump, she said, drove that progress into the ground through his trade wars and haphazard pandemic response.\n\n“Donald Trump has severely worsened our country’s economy,” Whitmer said. “Workers and families cannot afford four more of years of that.”\n\nTrump and other Republicans have argued that the recovery under Obama, who signed a major economic stimulus in 2009, was one of the slowest in the nation's history. While unemployment and market indicators were improving under Obama, they note those numbers took off at a faster rate once Trump was in the White House.\n\nThe debate is important because both candidates are positioning themselves as best able to help the nation recover from the economic catastrophe caused by COVID-19.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., cited figures about how 1.5 million fewer jobs were created during the first three years of the Trump administration, compared to the final three years of the Obama administration. Booker also slammed Trump's tax cut bill as benefiting the rich while racking up enormous federal budget deficits.\n\n“We know people all across New Jersey are hurting and need some relief,” Booker said. “Working families know that the president isn’t looking out for them.”\n\n– Bart Jansen and John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/25"}]}

The effort had such lofty goals as providing financial services to the underbanked and extending the social media company’s mission of connecting the world into the burgeoning market for digital money.\n\nLibra was originally slated to launch within less than a year. Two and a half years later, the project — renamed Diem last year — has officially unraveled after various setbacks and regulatory pressure made it impossible to get off the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the Facebook-backed Diem Association announced it would dissolve and sell off the intellectual property and other assets related to running its planned cryptocurrency network to Silvergate Capital Corporation, in a deal valued at $182 million. The Diem Association expects to begin “winding down” in the coming weeks, according to the announcement.\n\nThe project was dogged from the start by concerns from regulators, lawmakers and other financial services industry watchers about a cryptocurrency run by Facebook (now called Meta), which has struggled to prevent issues such as crime and abuses of user data on its existing platforms. And Diem’s end is a sign that regulators, who have explored a range of ways to crack down on Meta but have yet to act on much of it, do hold some sway over the tech giant and its ability to expand into new product areas.\n\n“Despite giving us positive substantive feedback on the design of the network, it nevertheless became clear from our dialogue with federal regulators that the project could not move ahead,” Diem Association CEO Stuart Levey said in a statement Monday. He added that the group believes its work on Diem will inform future projects that could “deliver the benefits that motivated the Diem Association from the beginning.”\n\nSilvergate plans to use the Diem assets to continue investing in building a stablecoin and a global payments network built on the blockchain, the company said in a statement.\n\nComplicated from the start\n\nWhen Facebook announced Libra, the plan was to create a universal cryptocurrency that could be accessed by digital wallets — all of which would be built on the blockchain, the technology that underpins other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. In theory, that could make it cheaper and easier to send money and pay for things anywhere in the world. Libra, it said, would be backed by a reserve of fiat currencies, such as the dollar and euro, to help prevent the volatility that has plagued other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe structure and governance of the project was complicated from the get-go, which likely didn’t help garner regulatory support. Though Facebook (FB) launched the project, the company said it would not govern Libra and its reserve; that duty would fall to the Switzerland-based Libra Association, a group initially comprised of more than two-dozen companies and nonprofits that included Facebook (FB) but also PayPal (PYPL), Lyft (LYFT) and others. Facebook (FB) started an internal unit called Calibra, which was to create a digital wallet that people could connect to using their Facebook (FB) accounts to send and receive Libra. But it also said other companies would be able to create Libra wallets.\n\nRegulators and lawmakers in the United States and elsewhere were almost immediately suspicious of a new currency that would be available to Facebook’s billions of users at a time when most countries lack the regulatory infrastructure to effectively oversee digital money. They worried that Libra could threaten national currencies like the US dollar and financial markets, and that it could enable cybercrimes and compromise user privacy. They also worried that the project could give Facebook even more power.\n\n“We need to get the message loud and clear to [Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark] Zuckerberg that he’s not a country on his own and he cannot always have it his way,” Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat, told reporters months after the project was introduced. Some of the Libra Association’s founding partners, including PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, pulled out of the project as regulatory scrutiny ramped up.\n\nHearings, name changes and a key executive departure\n\nFacebook and members of the Libra Association made efforts to engage with regulators, including in Congressional hearings, and made promises to comply with US anti-money laundering and “know your customer” laws, as banks must.\n\nIn his statement Monday, Diem’s Levey said the project had “evolved substantially and improved” as a result of feedback from regulators and governments around the world.\n\nStill, the project dragged on with limited progress. In May 2020, Facebook renamed the Calibra payments unit to “Novi.” About six months later, the Libra Association rebranded as “Diem” to reflect a new, scaled back nature — the coin would now be backed only by the US dollar — and an attempt to distance the effort from Facebook’s early flop in announcing Libra.\n\nIn October 2021, Facebook launched a pilot of its Novi digital wallet, but without Diem. Users could instead send and receive a different digital coin. Shortly after, David Marcus, the leader of Novi who had spearheaded the Libra project, left the company to pursue other projects.\n\nMarcus hinted at the role Facebook’s tainted reputation may have played in the project’s demise in a series of tweets Monday.\n\n“We gave our whole hearts, blood, sweat and tears to what I will always call Libra,” Marcus said. “We were mission driven and in it for the right reasons (that remain as valid today as they were then). Here’s to yet another chapter with a maybe more ‘acceptable’ promoter driving the vision forward.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/tech/europe-digital-markets-act-consumer-impacts/index.html", "title": "How Europe's bold new rules for Big Tech could change the ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nApple users could soon install apps outside the App Store. WhatsApp users could message or video call friends using Telegram, and vice versa. And the search results users see on Google could change, with potentially major repercussions for smaller online businesses.\n\nThese are just some of the changes that could come about for consumers from new landmark legislation unveiled by European lawmakers last week that aims to bolster competition in online services. By imposing new regulations on technology platforms deemed to be dominant “gatekeepers,” the Digital Markets Act (DMA) could result in sweeping changes to how EU citizens — and potentially consumers around the world — interact with major tech companies, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL GOOGLE) and Facebook (FB) parent company Meta.\n\nRegulators in several countries have proposed new rules to rein in Big Tech, but the EU proposal is among the most ambitious and may be the closest to becoming reality. According to Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission, the DMA could take effect as early as October, although it could be longer before consumers start to see changes as regulators determine which tech companies are covered by the law and the companies figure out how to implement the new rules.\n\n“This is a very big deal, because this is the first strong, comprehensive set of regulations that’s specific to market power in internet platforms,” said Mitch Stoltz, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.\n\nEven tech advocacy groups opposed to the DMA also agree that the legislation will result in major changes. “Many of the requirements force the Big Tech platforms to change their services in pretty significant ways,” said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the Chamber of Progress, an industry organization backed by Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook’s parent, Meta. And as with other proposed regulation targeting the industry, some tech groups also warn of unintended consequences from the DMA for companies and consumers.\n\nWhile the legislation is clearly targeted at the dominance of US tech giants, it doesn’t single out specific companies. Instead, the DMA creates a special category of “gatekeeper” businesses that are subject to greater regulation. It will cover platform providers who meet several benchmarks, including having more than 45 million monthly EU users and EU revenues of at least 7.5 billion euros or a market cap of at least 75 billion euros.\n\nThe regulations will apply only in Europe, but many policy experts expect that the ideas set forth in the DMA could eventually be enshrined into law worldwide, both because it sets expectations for regulators elsewhere and because tech companies could choose to adopt the changes more widely.\n\n“We often see that it’s easier for companies to implement a change globally than to just do it in one jurisdiction,” said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at Public Knowledge, a US-based consumer advocacy group. “There very well may be changes to US products that comply with the EU rule.\n\nHere are some of the ways the rules may affect users in Europe, and possibly beyond.\n\nUnder the DMA, mobile operating system makers may be required to allow consumers to download apps from third-party app stores. Adobe Stock\n\nApp stores\n\nSome of the most visible proposed changes for EU users deal with apps — how you can install them and what can be pre-installed on devices, among other things. These changes could have major implications for Apple and Google, two of the world’s biggest mobile operating systems and app store operators.\n\nOne major provision in the DMA requires dominant operating systems to allow smaller, third-party app stores, as well as sideloading — the ability to install apps from anywhere outside the official app store. Historically, Google has allowed for both on the Android platform, while Apple has maintained tight control over iPhone apps. Apple and other industry players have argued that opening up operating systems in this way could leave users vulnerable to downloading more harmful apps.\n\n“Consumers who have pined for a more open Apple [app] store will find something to like in this legislation,” said Joel Mitnick, a competition lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. “On the other hand, many consumers purchase Apple devices in part because of their reliance on Apple as a gatekeeper of app compatibility and quality. Those consumers may be disappointed by the law.”\n\nUnder the new rules, dominant app stores also can’t de-list apps for refusing to use the gatekeeper’s proprietary payment systems, an issue highlighted most recently by Apple’s antitrust case with Epic Games. Much of Apple’s app store revenue comes from the 30% cut it receives through its payment channels from in-app sales of digital goods and services, so the provisions could directly affect the company’s business model.\n\nDefault services\n\nOther aspects of the DMA could affect what software comes bundled with electronic devices. For example, gatekeeper platforms that simultaneously control a web browser and a mobile operating system won’t be allowed to set their browser as an automatic default, said Agustin Reyna, senior legal officer at BEUC, a European consumer advocacy group. Instead, users will be given more choices.\n\n“So, when consumers start their phone for the first time, they will see a popup window that will say, ‘Would you like to install a different browser or search engine?’” Reyna said.\n\nIt wouldn’t take many people acting on the prompt to make a big difference to competition, Reyna said, offering the example of DuckDuckGo, a smaller rival to Google.\n\n“Even 1% of Google search users switching to DuckDuckGo — for Google, maybe it’s not that much, but for DuckDuckGo, that’s massive,” he said. Still, the dominant players have fiercely defended their hold as default services; Google reportedly pays Apple billions of dollars a year to ensure it is the default search engine on Apple products.\n\nGoogle began offering a browser and search engine choice prompt to EU users back in 2019 — after European officials concluded the company had violated antitrust rules by making Google search and Chrome the defaults on Android — but the DMA takes that concept and applies it across the industry more broadly.\n\nSearch engines\n\nThe DMA could affect what users see when they enter searches into Google. Under the legislation’s provisions for self-preferencing, gatekeeper companies can’t rank their own products and services more favorably than those of competing providers, and they will be required to rank competitors’ offerings in a “fair and nondiscriminatory” way.\n\nPractically speaking, this could mean a boost for smaller online travel search platforms, local restaurant review sites and other businesses that receive traffic from Google when users search for plane tickets or places to eat nearby (Yelp has been a big proponent of such regulations).\n\nUnder the new rules, Google wouldn’t be able to give preferential placement to its own travel listings or restaurant reviews. For consumers, that could mean, for example, that they may no longer see Google Flights at the top of the search results page when they’re looking to take a trip. (Google previously implemented some changes to its search results in Europe in response to antitrust regulators, including featuring rival services’ results prominently alongside its own, but the DMA could force it to go even further.)\n\nBut while search results might be the most obvious place to apply the self-preferencing ban, the prohibition could potentially be interpreted more broadly, too, said Reyna.\n\n“This self-preferencing provision applies to all gatekeepers, so what if Apple is identified as a gatekeeper [in this context]? Apple would not be able to self-preference its own Apple Music service in detriment of Spotify or other competitors,” Reyna said.\n\nEuropean Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager has said the Digital Markets Act could take effect as early as October, although it could take longer for consumers to start to see the effects of the new rules. John Thys/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMessaging services\n\nThe new legislation could also change the way consumers message each other. A big focus of the DMA is on interoperability, or the ability for platforms from different providers to connect to each other. Portions of the DMA specifically zero in on interoperability among private messaging apps, such as Apple’s iMessage and Meta’s WhatsApp and Messenger services.\n\nThe DMA sets the stage for iMessage users to be able to send messages to WhatsApp users or vice versa, or for WhatsApp users to be able to message Telegram or Signal users, or any other combination of the above. A consumer using iMessage may also be able to video call or send files automatically to someone using WhatsApp or Messenger.\n\nThe legislation gives competing messaging platforms the right to ask to connect to one another’s users. Exactly how this would work, technically, would be the subject of future standards-setting. B ut establishing the requirement is the first step toward a more interoperable world where platforms can’t simply rely on their size and popularity to “lock in” their users and prevent them from switching, policy experts say.\n\nAt the same time, however, security experts say that what makes some messaging apps so powerful — their privacy features, and particularly support for end-to-end encryption — could be compromised under the mandate. Not only are there technical challenges to building a secure system that works across multiple platforms, but there may also be problems tied to identity management and the privacy risks that crop up alongside them.\n\n“Interoperability has long been viewed as a way to solve lock-in problems,” said Bruce Hoffman, a competition expert at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb. “The thing about interoperability requirements is that you have to be very careful with how you design them and what they actually do.”\n\nThere is some risk that in order to meet the interoperability requirements, messaging services could offer the most basic format of their platforms for European consumers, removing end-to-end encryption and other, more advanced features that users elsewhere in the world will still have access to, according to Nick Seeber, a partner leading Deloitte’s Internet Regulation team, which helps advise online companies on how to comply with regulations. The new rules could also create some challenges for smaller tech players.\n\n“The companies who are best at offering regulatory compliance are the largest tech platforms who have got the deepest pockets and resources to be able to implement these parts of the regulation,” Seeber said.", "authors": ["Brian Fung Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/tech/theranos-rise-and-fall/index.html", "title": "The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes: A timeline | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore than three years after Elizabeth Holmes was first indicted and nearly four months after her trial kicked off, the founder and former CEO of failed blood testing startup Theranos was found guilty on four out of 11 federal fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nHolmes, the founder and former CEO of Theranos, was found guilty on four out of 11 federal fraud and conspiracy charges in January after a months-long trial. Balwani, Theranos’ former president and COO who was also Holmes’ live-in boyfriend at the time, was found guilty on Thursday of ten counts of federal wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\nThe verdict comes after a stunning downfall that saw Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, go from being a tech industry icon to being a rare Silicon Valley entrepreneur on trial for fraud.\n\nBut a Wall Street Journal investigation poked holes into Theranos’ testing and technology, and the dominoes fell from there. Holmes and her former business partner, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, were charged in 2018 by the US government with multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. (Both pleaded not guilty.)\n\nTheir trials were separated after Holmes indicated she would pursue a defense that included alleging she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani that impacted every part of her life. (Balwani’s legal team has strongly denied the allegations in court filings.)\n\nHere are the highlights of the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos.\n\nMarch 2004: Holmes drops out of Stanford to pursue Theranos\n\nHolmes, a Stanford University sophomore studying chemical engineering, drops out of school to pursue her startup, Theranos, which she founded in 2003 at age 19. The name is a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.”\n\nSeptember 2009: Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani joins Theranos as Holmes’ right-hand man\n\nBalwani joins as chief operating officer and president of the startup. Balwani, nearly 20 years her senior, met Holmes in 2002 on a trip to Beijing through Stanford University. The two are later revealed to be romantically involved.\n\nThe two kept in touch and began living together in 2005, Holmes testified during her criminal trial. Their personal relationship was largely concealed from employees, investors and business partners. Balwani would ultimately become the company’s chief operating officer and president of the startup.\n\nSeptember 2013: Holmes opens up about Theranos; announces Walgreens partnership\n\nA decade after first starting the company, Holmes takes the lid off Theranos and courts media attention the same month that Theranos and Walgreens announce they’ve struck up a long-term partnership. The first Theranos Wellness Center location opens in a Walgreens in Palo Alto where consumers can access Theranos’ blood test.\n\nThe original plan had been to make Theranos’ testing available at Walgreens locations nationwide.\n\nSeptember 2014: Holmes named one of the richest women in America by Forbes\n\nHolmes is named to the magazine’s American billionaire list with the outlet reporting she owns a 50% stake in the startup, pinning her personal wealth at $4.5 billion.\n\nElizabeth Holmes speaking onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California. Steve Jennings/Getty Images\n\nDecember 2014: Theranos has raised $400 million\n\nTheranos has raised more than $400 million, according to a profile of the company and Holmes by The New Yorker. It counts Oracle’s Larry Ellison among its investors.\n\nJuly 2015: Theranos gets FDA approval for Herpes test\n\nThe FDA clears Theranos to use of its proprietary tiny blood-collection vials to finger stick blood test for herpes simplex 1 virus – its first and only approval for a diagnostic test.\n\nOctober 2015: Theranos is the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation; Holmes hits back\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Theranos is using its proprietary technique on only a small number of the 240 tests it performs, and that the vast majority of its tests are done with traditional vials of blood drawn from the arm, not the “few drops” taken by a finger prick. In response, Theranos defends its testing practices, calling the Journal’s reporting “factually and scientifically erroneous.”\n\nA day later, Theranos halts the use of its blood-collection vials for all but the herpes test due to pressures from the FDA. (Later that month, the FDA released two heavily redacted reports citing 14 concerns, including calling the company’s proprietary vial an “uncleared medical device.”)\n\nOne week after the Journal report, Holmes is interviewed on-stage at the outlet’s conference in Laguna Beach. “We know what we’re doing and we’re very proud of it,” she says.\n\nHolmes speaking at a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 21, 2015. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmid the criticism, Theranos reportedly shakes up its board of directors, eliminating Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as directors while moving them to a new board of counselors; the company also forms a separate medical board.\n\nNovember 2015: Theranos and Safeway partnership falls short\n\nSafeway, which invested $350 million into building out clinics in hundreds of its supermarkets to eventually offer Theranos blood tests, reportedly looks to dissolve its relationship with the company before it ever offered its services.\n\nJanuary 2016: Federal regulators take issue with Theranos’ California lab; Walgreens pulls back\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sends Theranos a letter saying its California lab has failed to comply with federal standards and that patients are in “immediate jeopardy.” It gives the company 10 days to address the issues.\n\nIn response, Walgreens says it will not send any lab tests to Theranos’ California lab for analysis and suspends Theranos services at its Palo Alto Walgreens location.\n\nMarch 2016: CMS threatens to ban Holmes, Balwani from lab business\n\nCMS threatens to ban Holmes and Balwani from the laboratory business for two years after the company allegedly failed to fix problems at its California lab. Theranos says that’s a “worst case scenario.”\n\nMay 2016: Balwani steps down; Theranos voids two years of blood tests\n\nBalwani departs. The company also adds three new board members as part of the restructuring: Fabrizio Bonanni, a former executive vice president of biotech firm Amgen, former CDC director William Foege, and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich.\n\nTheranos voids two years of blood test results from its proprietary testing devices, correcting tens of thousands of blood-test reports, the Journal reports.\n\nJune 2016: Holmes net worth revised to $0; Theranos loses its largest retail partner\n\nForbes revises its estimate of Holmes’ net worth from $4.5 billion to $0. The magazine also lowers its valuation for the company from $9 billion to $800 million.\n\nWalgreens, once Theranos’ largest retail partner, ends its partnership with the company and says it will close all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers.\n\nJuly 2016: Holmes is banned from running labs for two years\n\nCMS revokes Theranos’ license to operate its California lab and bans Holmes from running a blood-testing lab for two years.\n\nAugust 2016: The company unveils ‘miniLab’ device\n\nHolmes tries to move past recent setbacks by unveiling a mini testing laboratory, called miniLab, at a conference for the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. In selling the device, versus operating its own clinics, Theranos seeks to effectively side-step CMS sanctions, which don’t prohibit research and development.\n\nOctober 2016: Theranos investor sues the company; Theranos downsizes\n\nTheranos investor Partner Fund Management sues the company for $96.1 million, the amount it sunk into the company in February 2014, plus damages. It accuses the company of securities fraud. Theranos and Partner Fund Management settled in May, 2017, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe company also lays off 340 employees as it closes clinical labs and wellness centers as it attempts to pivot and focus on the miniLab.\n\nNovember 2016: Walgreens sues Theranos\n\nWalgreens sues the blood testing startup for breach of contract. Walgreens sought to recover the $140 million it poured into the company. The lawsuit was settled August, 2017.\n\nJanuary 2017: More layoffs, followed by a failed lab inspection\n\nTheranos downsizes its workforce yet again following the increased scrutiny into its operations, laying off approximately 155 employees or about 41% of staffers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Theranos failed a second regulatory lab inspection in September, and that the company was closing its last blood testing location as a result.\n\nApril 2017: Theranos settles with CMS, and Arizona AG\n\nTheranos settles with the CMS, agreeing to pay $30,000 and to not to own or operate any clinical labs for two years.\n\nTheranos also settles with the Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich over allegations that its advertisements misrepresented the method, accuracy, and reliability of its blood testing and that the company was out of compliance with federal regulations governing clinical lab testing. Theranos agrees to pay $4.65 million back to its Arizona customers as part of a settlement deal.\n\nMarch 2018: Holmes charged with massive fraud\n\nThe SEC charges Holmes and Balwani with a “massive fraud” involving more than $700 million from investors through an “elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.”\n\nThe SEC alleges Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could perform only 12 of the 200 tests it published on its patient testing menu.\n\nTheranos and Holmes agree to resolve the claims against them, and Holmes gives up control of the company and much of her stake in it. Balwani, however, is fighting the charges, with his attorney saying he “accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability.”\n\nMay 2018: “Bad Blood”\n\nReporter John Carreyrou, who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Wall Street Journal, publishes “Bad Blood,” a definitive look at what happened inside the disgraced company. Director Adam McKay (who directed “The Big Short”) secures the rights to make the film, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes, by the same name.\n\nJune 2018: Holmes and Balwani indicted on criminal fraud charges\n\nHolmes and Balwani are indicted on federal wire fraud charges over allegedly engaging in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMinutes before the charges were made public, Theranos announced that Holmes has stepped down as CEO. The company’s general counsel, David Taylor, takes over as CEO. Holmes remains chair of the company’s board.\n\nFormer Theranos COO Ramesh \"Sunny' Balwani leaves the Robert F. Peckham U.S. Federal Court on June 28, 2019 in San Jose, California.

Later, in August 2021, unsealed court documents reveal Holmes is likely to claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani. The allegations led to the severing of their trials. His trial is slated to begin in 2022.\n\nDecember 2020: Holmes’ criminal trial delayed til 2021\n\nInitially set to begin in July 2020, Holmes’ criminal trial is further delayed til July 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMarch 2021: Holmes’ pregnancy further delays trial\n\nNews surfaces that Holmes’ is expecting her first child, once more further delaying her criminal trial. Holmes’ counsel advised the US government that Holmes is due in July 2021, a court document revealed. She gave birth in July.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder and former chief executive officer of Theranos Inc.

Nina Riggio/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAugust 2021: Holmes’ criminal trial begins with jury selection\n\nMore than 80 potential jurors are brought into a San Jose courtroom for questioning over the course of two days to determine if they are fit to serve as impartial, fair jurors for the criminal trial of Holmes. A jury of seven men and five women is selected, with five alternatives.\n\nJanuary 2022: Holmes found guilty on four of 11 federal charges\n\nHolmes is found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud investors as well as three wire fraud counts tied to specific investors. She is found not guilty on three additional charges concerning defrauding patients and one charge of conspiracy to defraud patients. The jury returns no verdict on three of the charges concerning defrauding investors. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count.\n\nHolmes’s sentencing date is set for late September to allow for the completion of Balwani’s trial. In the meantime, Holmes remains free on a $500,000 bond secured by property.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos Inc., left center, departs from federal court with, from left, husband Billy Evans, parents Noel Holmes and Christian Holmes IV in San Jose, California, U.S., on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022.

She's got an Oscar. She's married to a rock star. She's best friends with Beyoncé. And she was People magazine's pick for Most Beautiful Woman of 2013.\n\nYet she's mocked for what she eats. She's criticized for the pricey Christmas gift guide on her lifestyle website, Goop. She's dissed for driving her kids to school on a Vespa. And she topped Star magazine's Most Hated Celebrity list for 2013.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow may be the most polarizing celebrity to come down the stardom pike in a long, long time.\n\nHow exactly did this princess of beloved Hollywood royalty — she's the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and late producer Bruce Paltrow and her godfather is Steven Spielberg — cultivate such a love-hate relationship with the world?\n\n\"Inevitably, in a saga of Hollywood, people identify with either the sympathetic character or the villain,\" says Dylan Howard, editor in chief of celebrity news site RadarOnline. \"When it comes to Gwyneth Paltrow, she's both the villain and sympathetic figure.\"\n\nLOVE HER? HATE HER? OR LOVE TO HATE HER?\n\nA 2010 Voguearticle written by a journalist who visited Paltrow, 41, in her London home described the star as having an \"impossibly perfect life.\"\n\nAnd it seems she does.\n\nPaltrow not only has it all (as mentioned above). She does it all. She acts. (She snagged her Oscar early in her career, in 1999 for Shakespeare in Love, and in 2011 won an Emmy for her Glee guest-star stint.) She sings. (Remember her Cee Lo Green duet at the 2011 Grammys?) She's a lifestyle guru. (On Thursday, she is unveiling a special holiday collaboration with designer Michael Kors, available only through Goop.) She's an author (of at least three cookbooks). She's a mom (Apple, 9, and Moses, 7). She's a wife (Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin). She's a style icon (with seven Vogue covers to her credit) with a fab figure (Tracy Anderson is her personal trainer).\n\nDo you hate her yet?\n\nBut it isn't just having it all or doing it all that has fostered both the iconic worship and the intense scorn.\n\nThis has been building for years — or at least the past five, going back to when she launched Goop and began branching out from acting. And she began putting herself out there, Martha Stewart-style.\n\nIt's the very thing fans love about her. She'll share with you the best place in Paris to get a bikini wax. She'll say she'd \"rather die\" than let her kids eat \"Cup-a-Soup.\" She'll acknowledge she \"should have worn a bra\" with her 2002 Oscar gown. And she'll even admit that the glittery A-list-filled Met Ball was \"un-fun\" because it was crowded and hot. She'll share that she had a miscarriage and battled some postpartum depression. And she'll drop f-bombs all along the way. (If she has a potty mouth, how snooty can she be?)\n\nLove her yet?\n\nBut while Jennifer Lawrence, for example, is earning praise for her candor, Paltrow's remarks often don't seem to sit right.\n\n\"She's on this incredible high horse,\" says James Heidenry, editor in chief of Star, the publication that put her at No. 1 on the Most Hated Celeb list for 2013 (along with Chris Brown, Lindsay Lohan, Anne Hathaway and others). \"She comes off like an insufferable elitist. And she seems so unaware.\"\n\nHollywood Reporter staff editor Michael O'Connell says, \"It's that detachment, perceived detachment that comes with wealth and fame.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Daily Beast writer Kevin Fallon wrote \"Why Do We Still Hate Gwyneth Paltrow?\" in which he noted, \"There's a veritable encyclopedia of quotes those who are annoyed by her can cite to prove what they perceive as her unconscionable lack of self-awareness and apparently unstomachable pretentiousness.\"\n\nSome evidence:\n\nIn 2006 she told The Guardian : \"I love the English way, which is not as capitalistic as it is in America. People don't talk about work and money; they talk about interesting things at dinner parties.\"\n\nIn 2009, she told the March issue of Elle UK : \"I am who I am. I can't pretend to be somebody who makes $25,000 a year.\"\n\nIn 2010, she told the Press Association: \"Every woman can make time (to work out) — every woman — and you can do it with your baby in the room. There have been countless times where I've worked out with my kids crawling around all over the place. You just make it work.\"\n\nIn 2011, GQ put her on its Least Influential list, noting it was the year she \"unleashed her awful cookbook on the world, a book that included such amazingly vapid sentences as 'We've got a wood-burning pizza oven in the garden — a luxury, I know, but it's one of the best investments I've ever made.'\"\n\nIn 2011, Buzzfeed came up with a list of 7 Reasons Why People Hate Gwyneth Paltrow. Alternate title: 7 incredibly pretentious Gwyneth Paltrow quotes\n\nAnd this month, she unveiled her Goop Christmas gift guide with toys including a $100 slingshot for a boy and $531 pajamas for mom. It has been called \"silly\" (New York's Daily News), \"outrageous\" (Yahoo.com) and \"ridiculous\" (Radar).\n\n\"She doesn't have that common touch,\" explains brand expert David Johnson, CEO of Strategic Vision in Atlanta. He adds, \"She doesn't seem to know how to relate to people and that turns a lot of people off. They admire her, but at the same time, there's this sense that she's out of touch with average people.\"\n\nPaltrow has admitted she's aware of her image problem. \"I'm a real lighting rod,\" she acknowledged in an interview with USA TODAY in May. But she doesn't think it's her fault.\n\n\"People project a lot of stuff onto me. It's nothing to do with me. I don't read stuff about myself. I feel like it's none of my business. People perceive that I have too much. I understand that, but I also feel like I've suffered so much. It's not something I talk about. I don't have a perfect life. I don't have a perfect anything. I have incredible struggles, and I'm far from perfect. I struggle like every other woman, every other mother. I understand that things look a certain way.\"\n\nNow, she says, she has gotten to the point where she basically doesn't care what people think.\n\nIn one of her most recent interviews, with U.K.'s Red magazine, she said, \"The older I get I realize it doesn't matter what people who don't know you think. It doesn't matter. You're wasting your energy.\" Her advice is to \"do what is right for you and don't give a (expletive) what anyone else thinks.\"\n\nSo there.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\n\n\"For a celeb brand to be boring\" is the kiss of death, says brand expert Allen Adamson, managing director of Landor Associates in New York. \"You're better off being provocative and edgy.\"\n\nPaltrow is doing exactly what she should to be successful, he says. \"Brands need to have a point of view. Her point of view can be polarizing, but on balance, you're better having half the room loving you than having the whole room thinking you're just OK.\"\n\nIt's true of any big business, he says. \"Look at Apple. There are people who hate Apple, and of course there are Apple fans who are nuts about it.\"\n\nPaltrow is \"far more ambitious than the average Hollywood celebrity.\" He adds, \"The best brands create friction and passion in the marketplace. I think she's doing very well.\"\n\n\"It's interesting the amount of chatter Gwyneth Paltrow is generating,\" says Ammiel Kamon, executive vice president of Kontera's products and marketing division. The data analyst group measures \"consumption\" — or how often a brand is seen — of celebrities. In the lifestyle category, which relates to Paltrow's Goop, she has carved out 14% of the audience, right behind Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nSo whatever anyone's saying, Kamon notes, \"may be in a bad context for her, but it does have a net positive effect.\"\n\nPaltrow's Q score, the likability measure for famous folks, is 16, which means 16% of adults who are familiar with her say she's one of their favorite personalities.\n\nA 16 \"is about average,\" explains Henry Schafer, executive vice president of The Q Score company. A very high Q score would be somewhere around \"42, 43,\" he says. Two celebs who generally pull that kind of score: Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock.\n\nAs of September, the latest Q score report, awareness of Paltrow was at 74%, says Schafer, which means three out of four adults know who she is. The average awareness for a celeb is 31%, so \"she's pretty well-known for sure.\"\n\nAnd she has plenty of fans.\n\n\"We love her,\" says Zanna Roberts Rassi, Marie Claire senior fashion editor and E! fashion correspondent. \"She's such an icon and so fashionable. The fact that she's a smart woman and an entrepreneur makes her more than just a beauty. She's definitely got brains.\"\n\nAdds Rassi, \"She is well-respected in the industry. I could call any publicist and ask to borrow (designer clothes) for Gwyneth and they would absolutely send. That isn't true of every celebrity. She's very polished. She's a classic.\"\n\nSo what should Paltrow do to move the needle more with the masses? Is anything really at stake for her? Any reason to try to be more Sandy Bullock-y?\n\n\"If I were advising her, one thing I'd suggest is to get into the forefront as a spokesperson for different causes,\" says brand expert Johnson. \"I would advise her to get involved in something so people could see a softer side of her — animals, children or battered women. Things that people can relate to. We know a lot of young girls think she's great. They look to her beauty and her grace.\"\n\nPaltrow did step out this past week for a Kids Company Dinner, a charity event she co-hosted with designer Matthew Williamson. But the only press she got was on sites that noticed how her bejeweled dress seem to blend into the ornaments on the Christmas tree she posed in front of.\n\nAnd on Dec. 16, she launches a new AOL Web series called The Restart Project with her pal Tracy Anderson in which they spend time with and showcase inspiring stories of women who have overcome hardships.\n\nBUT WHAT'S IT ALL WORTH?\n\nSo, basically, there's nothing at stake for her.

The company’s testing centers located inside Walgreens stores all have closed. And the company, once reportedly valued at $9 billion, has laid off nearly all employees.\n\nWhile federal prosecutors have charged Holmes and former Theranos President Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani with wire fraud, former patients are pursuing cases on their own in federal and state courts. Nine ex-Theranos customers are plaintiffs in a federal class-action lawsuit against Theranos and Walgreens in U.S. District Court in Phoenix.\n\nOne woman, identified as D.L., claimed that Theranos' inaccurate results indicated she tested positive for an autoimmune disease, Sjögren's syndrome, that prompted her to consult with a doctor and be checked for food allergies. After she was tested by another lab company, her doctor determined that she did not have the autoimmune condition.\n\nThe lawsuit states another woman identified as L.M. was diagnosed with a thyroid condition called Hashimoto's disease based on inaccurate Theranos test results. Her doctor ordered testing from another lab company that showed she did not have that condition.\n\nThe initial diagnosis based on inaccurate lab tests was \"devastating to her\" because it prompted her to change her lifestyle, make unnecessary medical appointments and take medication she did not need, the lawsuit states.\n\nBoth Theranos and Walgreens have denied wrongdoing and filed separate motions to dismiss the federal class-action lawsuit. In April, a federal judge agreed to toss out 7 categories of claims but allowed 13 to move ahead for the plaintiffs in the case, now in discovery. One plaintiff, R.C., who alleged that he had a heart attack one month after getting an inaccurate blood test, voluntarily dropped his claims.\n\nPolitical leaders in metro Phoenix welcomed Theranos with open arms five years ago and the area served as testing grounds for its unproven finger-stick blood draws.\n\nAt its peak, Theranos operated 40 centers inside Walgreens stores in metro Phoenix and sold more than 1.5 million blood tests that yielded 7.8 million test results for nearly 176,000 consumers.\n\nBut court documents state slightly more than 1 in 10 test results were voided or corrected, and some patients claim in lawsuits that they were harmed by inaccurate test results.\n\nOthers chose not to sue but worry that there's little to safeguard consumers from another medical technology company making similar mistakes.\n\nPeoria, Arizona resident Steve Hammons visited a Theranos clinic five times in September and October 2015 to monitor the results of a blood-thinning drug. Based on the results of those tests, a doctor ordered him to discontinue warfarin and switch to another drug.\n\nOne test included inaccurate results that were later revised, Hammons said. Theranos did not return a USA TODAY query about Hammons' test results.\n\nHe had heart surgery and a followup procedure to drain blood from the pericardial sac, which contains the heart. He does not know whether more accurate test results would have prompted his doctors to change his course of care and potentially avert the second operation to drain blood.\n\nHowever, he said it made him realize how little protection consumers get from federal and state government regulators overseeing the lab business.\n\n“That makes me very concerned and worried for the safety of other Arizonans,” said Hammons, who once worked in the medical services division of a private health insurance company. “Government had a role in patient safety. The powers that be dropped the ball.”\n\n'An American success story'\n\nTheranos operated only one center not far from its Palo Alto, California headquarters when it chose Arizona for its ambitious expansion in the fall of 2013. At the time, company officials cited Arizona's high uninsured rate and business-friendly environment.\n\nArizona also had a state law that allowed labs to sell a limited number of tests directly to consumers without a doctor's orders.\n\nTheranos pumped up its marketing with media interviews, billboards and television commercials touting a proprietary technology that the company claimed would revolutionize the lab industry by delivering accurate results from a finger-stick sample of just a few drops of blood. But the company also appealed to Arizona's political leaders to relax rules and allow broader, direct-to-consumer testing.\n\nTheranos contributed language to House Bill 2645, which allowed labs to sell any test to a consumer without a doctor's order. The bill sailed through the Arizona Legislature despite concerns raised by doctors' groups such as the Arizona Medical Association and Arizona Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nRepublican Gov. Doug Ducey and legislative leaders from both parties hailed Theranos in an April 2015 bill-signing ceremony at Theranos' lab in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nDucey lauded Holmes as \"the definition of an American success story\" and said the bill \"keeps our regulations light\" and reflects Arizona's values as a business-friendly state.\n\nThree years later, the governor's spokeswoman said in a statement that businesses that tout new technology must prove themselves in the marketplace. \"Bad actors must be held accountable, and in this case, that's happening,\" said the statement. \"Public health and safety is always a top concern and we will continue to do all that we can to protect the well-being of Arizonans while also allowing individuals to have greater access to their medical information.\n\nThe region's dominant lab-testing company, Sonora Quest, also objected to the legislation. But after realizing the strong political momentum behind the bill, Sonora Quest did not formerly oppose the bill and later formed a unit that sells lab tests directly to consumers.\n\nQuestions of accuracy\n\nTheranos' fortune began to turn later in 2015 when the Wall Street Journal published the first in a series of stories that raised questions about the accuracy of the company's micro-blood draws and its underlying Edison technology.\n\nReports revealed that the company often relied on more traditional vein blood draws and lab equipment made by other companies rather than its unproven medical technology.\n\nFederal lab regulators with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stepped up oversight of Theranos and moved to revoke that company's laboratory certificate after finding the company's operation in Newark, Calif., posed an \"immediate jeopardy\" to consumers.\n\nTheranos reached a settlement with the federal agency, agreeing to a two-year ban from the blood-testing business and a $30,000 civil penalty.\n\nIn April 2017, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich negotiated a consumer-fraud settlement to refund up to $4.65 million to consumers who purchased Theranos blood tests. The checks were disbursed through a third-party administrator with more than 80 percent of the settlement as of June 2018, officials said.\n\nWhile the settlement provided consumers financial relief, it did little to address customers who were harmed by inaccurate test results, according to attorneys representing patients.\n\n\"The attorney general was able to get the money,\" said Leonard Aragon, a Phoenix attorney who represents a patient in a lawsuit against Walgreens in Maricopa County Superior Court. \"That doesn't compensate people for being damaged by bogus test results.\"\n\nLawmakers now acknowledge that some patients may have been harmed by inaccurate test results. However, they insist that consumers have benefited from greater access to testing sold by other labs.\n\n\"The good news is there are other very high quality laboratory companies in Arizona that have embraced the legislation and have had tremendous success,\" said Heather Carter, an Arizona House Representative who sponsored the direct-access bill.\n\n\"I am extremely concerned about patient safety,\" Carter said. \"Hopefully justice will be served and people will have their day in court on this.\"\n\nMore:Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and former president Balwani charged with federal fraud\n\nReport: Embattled blood-testing company Theranos lays off most remaining workers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2021/12/04/nft-apple-metaverse-2022-predictions/8803081002/", "title": "From NFTs to Apple and the metaverse: What 2022 holds for the tech", "text": "Peter Csathy\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJust when we thought it was safe to get back into the real world, new COVID variants emerge to brush us back – continuing to transform all aspects of our lives. While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain – a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Will the blockchain’s adoption in media accelerate in 2022?\n\nMy Magic 8-Ball says “Signs point to ‘YES’.”\n\n►What's an NFT:A guide to what they are and why someone spent $69 million for one\n\nHere are 10 predictions for the coming year in which we hope that we finally get COVID under some kind of real long-term control.\n\n1. Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple’s $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain’s poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom – opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center’s new “Crypto.com Arena” moniker is here to stay. Hey, brands out there, you better claim your \".eth\" web address now. (Here's why.)\n\n►Decoding the lingo:10 cryptocurrency terms people use every day\n\n►Crypto tithes:With fewer young parishioners carrying cash, more churches accept bitcoin as offering\n\n3. Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022’s mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself). These “unlockings” of tech conglomerates will unlock more content innovation across more competing tech platforms.\n\n►The Facebook Papers:Facebook fed posts with violence and nudity to people with low digital literacy\n\n4. Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential “lipstick on a pig”), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple’s AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable – AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse – outside of the games industry – much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n►What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n►From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We’ve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over “free to play” business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new “play to earn” model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that’s where it’s happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix – and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members – as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don’t forget Disney’s “special sauce” that Netflix can’t touch – Disney’s priceless crown jewels of content – i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions – but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty – to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth – fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably – and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today – superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n►Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market – that's you and me, the superfans – to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being “king,” private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the “big boys” in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren’t just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out “The Chosen.” If you don’t know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution – not to mention the overall “festival experience” for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it – 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

Climate Summit will be as much about business as politics.\n\nMajor companies, including Big Oil, will make pledges to help fight global warming by cutting their heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, protecting the world's forests and reducing methane leakage from fossil fuel production.\n\nThey're getting nudged to act, not just by tens of thousands of climate marchers who clogged Manhattan streets Sunday — some dressed as polar bears and others carrying signs that read, \"Go Solar,\" \"Fracking=Death\" and \"There Is No Planet B\" — but by investors demanding action.\n\nThe result will be a climate extravaganza unlike any before. \"This is very different. It's not just policy leaders,\" says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a non-profit group that promotes sustainability. There's an \"unprecedented\" number of companies, investors and finance ministers involved, she says.\n\n\"It's a very, very positive sign,\" Todd Stern, U.S. special envoy for climate change, said in a White House briefing last week. \"Business is increasingly focused on trying to, in some cases, be part of the clean energy revolution.\"\n\nMonday, one day before the summit, Archbishop Desmond Tutu is slated to announce new fossil fuel divestment. Hundreds of wealthy individuals and at least 50 foundations will pledge to divest any holdings in the world's top 200 oil and gas producers, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron.\n\n\"It's a snowballing movement,\" says Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which is signing on. His fund is controlled by a family whose fortune was made in the oil industry.\n\nThat's not all.\n\n•About two dozen large companies will join environmental groups and 24 countries to stop deforestation, which can exacerbate global warming by releasing more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They'll commit not to source products — including palm oil, soy and beef — from land where forests have been recently or illegally cut down. They'll join Nestle, Kellogg's, Hershey's and General Mills, which have already pledged action.\n\n\"It's a good news story I never would have predicted,\" says Charles McNeill, a senior policy adviser for the United Nations Development Program, adding that it brings together groups that don't usually partner. He says major companies are taking the lead, but smaller ones will follow.\n\n•Six of the world's largest oil and gas companies will commit, via a new partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, to take steps to reduce methane leaks in fossil fuel production.\n\n\"This is an enormous opportunity\" for the industry, says Nathaniel Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group. He says emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, account for 25% of global warming.\n\n•World Bank President Jim Yong Kim will unveil a growing list of companies and cities that, like his organization, support a price on carbon. Advocates say that taxing fossil fuels such as oil and coal, which emit carbon when burned, will increase investments in energy efficiency and renewable power.\n\nLast week, more than 340 global institutional investors with at least $24 trillion in assets — including Swiss Re and the Unitarian Universalist Association — called on government leaders to adopt carbon pricing. The European Union has done so, but the United States has not.\n\n•We Mean Business, a coalition working with thousands of companies and investors, will launch with a report on increasing business support for low-carbon energy. It holds a discussion Monday between top U.N. climate negotiator Christiana Figueres and the leaders of two companies that have pledged to get all their power from renewable sources: Apple's Tim Cook and Ikea's Peter Agnefjäll.\n\nDozens of climate-related events will take place this week in the Big Apple, but the summit itself occurs Tuesday at U.N. headquarters. President Obama and leaders from more than 120 countries are likely to announce climate initiatives, and company CEOs will participate in talks or make their own commitments.\n\n\"We're taking this summit seriously, both to show that the United States is committed to leading the fight against climate change and to call on other leaders to step up to the plate,\" says John Podesta, Obama's counselor.\n\nHe says Obama will outline U.S. efforts but will not make a new emissions-cutting pledge until early next year. In 2009, at U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen, Obama pledged to reduce U.S. emissions by 17%, from 2005 levels, by 2020 — a goal the country is largely on course to meet.\n\nThe leaders of China and India, the world's first- and third-largest emitters of carbon dioxide, will not attend. Podesta said, however, China will be represented at \"a very high level\" by its vice premier, and India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, will be meeting with Obama a few days later in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe summit will get a dose of Hollywood. Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, chosen as a U.N. Messenger of Peace, will speak. \"I feel a moral obligation to speak out at this key moment in human history,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThough the event is not part of formal U.N. climate negotiations, it's aimed at creating momentum for a new global accord to be signed next year in Paris. Prior U.N. agreements have not reduced global carbon emissions, which continue to rise mostly because of economic development in Asia.\n\nThis time may be different, says Jennifer Morgan, who directs climate and energy programs at the World Resources Institute, a research group. She says there's a greater sense of urgency about climate change as its impacts — sea level rise, drought, wildfires — become more visible.\n\nShe says the cost of solutions, such as wind and solar power, has fallen as their use has expanded. She says more companies see global warming as a business risk and embrace sustainability, which is \"not the bogeyman anymore.\"\n\nStern, the U.S. climate negotiator, says there may be more \"realism as well as ambition\" among countries to address climate change than occurred at the Copenhagen talks in 2009. Still, he says, \"these negotiations are always difficult.\"\n\nFigueres, the U.N. negotiator, says net carbon emissions will need to be slashed to zero in the second half of this century to keep a global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nHeintz says his fund, the legacy of John D. Rockefeller, may signal a shift in U.S. attitudes. It devotes half its grants to promoting renewable power and climate research.\n\nHe says Rockefeller believed in innovation and in founding Standard Oil, he put an older industry — whale oil — out of business. \"I'm convinced that if he were alive today,\" Heintz says, \"he'd be looking out to the future and investing in clean energy technology.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/politics/donald-trump-defense-january-6/index.html", "title": "Analysis: How the defense of Trump foretells a possible new GOP ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s a strong political case for Republicans to ignore Donald Trump halfway through a midterm primary season that’s seen his influence over voters wane. But as the January 6 hearings hit prime time, the ex-President’s thunderous demands for loyalty and the hunger for power of his acolytes in the House mean that’s not an option.\n\nTrump’s demand for, and the GOP’s willingness to offer, a robust defense into what are expected to be damaging details of his complicity in a coup attempt are deeply revealing about his future political intentions and the former President’s control over his party. The evolving plan to hit back against the committee on behalf of Trump also exposes the hypocrisy and the ambition of key House Republican leaders who whitewash Trump’s role in the history of the January 6, 2021, insurrection to advance their own careers.\n\nIt offers a foreboding reality check 17 months after the Capitol insurrection about how the House Republican conference has chosen the promise of future political advancement over the protection of American democracy.\n\nThe plan for pro-Trump lawmakers to blitz the media in order to push back at the House select committee’s findings comes ahead of the panel’s first live televised prime-time hearing on Thursday and was revealed in a new CNN report on Sunday.\n\nThe committee is expected to mount a devastating case about Trump’s behavior as he tried to steal the 2020 election in the run-up to and during the January 6 assault on the Capitol, which he incited and didn’t act to stop as lawmakers ran for their lives.\n\nThere are potential pitfalls for Republicans who stand with Trump as the lurid tale of violence, lies and autocratic power grabs is told again for the American people and for the benefit of history. The evidence could be so damning that those who seek to discredit the hearings will find themselves defending the indefensible – a dark moment of the American story that is so heinous it will live in infamy.\n\nThere are also sound electoral reasons to pass. It’s not a given that the hearings will achieve their apparent purpose and engage Americans so far after the event. After all, after four years of tumult that ended in a political cataclysm, it’s hard to imagine there are many voters who haven’t made up their minds on Trump.\n\nEngaging and turning the hearings into a partisan spectacle could only elevate them. And Republicans have a much clearer route to power five months before the midterm elections than yet again appeasing Trump’s autocracy. They can simply blame President Joe Biden for the ills afflicting the country, given the disastrous political environment for Democrats as gasoline prices hit record highs and the cost of living soars.\n\nAnything that deflects from that goal seems unwise.\n\nThere’s also a risk that standing with Trump will brand the GOP all over again with the stain of defending a strongman who tried to overthrow a democratic election. That vision repeatedly punished the party when Trump was in power. And defending him could remind critical suburban voters all over again of just how extreme their party has become.\n\nTrump demands a strong defense\n\nStelter: Pro-Trump media is already rejecting Jan. 6 hearing 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nBut the determination of Trump to paint an alternative version of events for Americans through conservative media suggests that the ex-President really doesn’t want the true story of his behavior coming out.\n\nThe committee, through hundreds of interviews – some with people deep inside the Trump West Wing, despite obstruction from some of the ex-President’s former top aides – appears to have built a behind-the-scenes story of Trump’s conduct. Former aides to ex-Vice President Mike Pence are expected to be especially prominent in the televised hearings.\n\nIf the committee succeeds in convincing Americans of his culpability, it could seriously damage the ex-President’s hopes in a broader general election audience if he does seek to run again for the White House in 2024. There’s also the possibility that the panel has uncovered information that could put the twice-impeached President in legal jeopardy, though any criminal referral from the committee would require the Justice Department to initiate a prosecution – a potential long shot.\n\nHowever worried Trump may be about the hearings, the willingness of top House Republicans to defend his assault on democracy does show his hold over the party.\n\nCNN’s Melanie Zanona, Zachary Cohen and Ryan Nobles reported that Trump’s team had communicated with his allies on Capitol Hill that the former President wants a vigorous defense while public hearings play out on television. This impulse clearly fits with Trump’s lifelong desire to be in the spotlight and to shape the television narrative of his own life.\n\nIt’s also remarkable that a former President, bumped out of office in disgrace after a single term, still has the political juice to wield that kind of influence. This speaks to his appeal in the GOP grassroots and underscores his front-runner status for any 2024 Republican presidential primary race, even if some of his chosen candidates struggle in 2022 midterm primaries.\n\nAnd it offers a preview of how a new GOP House majority next year could largely be a tool for an increasingly extreme Trump’s efforts to hobble Biden and regain power.\n\nTrump’s power over McCarthy\n\nThe CNN report revealed that the defense will be led by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who spoke out strongly against Trump publicly in the days after the insurrection and in an outspoken fashion behind the scenes, according to transcripts of calls featured in a new book by New York Times writers Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin.\n\nWhen it became clear, however, that the insurrection would not destroy Trump’s popularity in the minds of GOP voters, McCarthy soon changed course. His willingness to stand as Trump’s chief defender now shows how much leverage the ex-President has over him following the furor over the taped calls – and how his ambition to be speaker, and his tenure if he eventually wins the position, depends to a large extent in keeping the ex-President’s favor.\n\nHear how McCarthy's words on 1/6 have changed in a year 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nAnother Trump acolyte who is vowing to destroy the credibility of the January 6 committee is Rep.

But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nPolice speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}]}

Nowhere is that more true than in Russia, where the Kremlin has engaged in a campaign of false advertising to sell its invasion of Ukraine to the public.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin cast the campaign as a “special military operation” – not a war – and told citizens that they could, essentially, forget about the conflict in Ukraine. Draftees, he promised falsely, would not fight, and military operations would be left to the professionals. And Putin’s Ministry of Defense delivered platitudes about progress on the battlefield, talking points quickly parroted by Russian state television.\n\nBut a curious shift is underway in Russia’s tightly controlled information space. Ukraine’s military has been making dramatic advances in a counteroffensive, making it increasingly difficult to conceal the Russian military’s losses. And Putin last month declared a partial military mobilization, sending a message to the general population that their leader was going all in Ukraine, and that sacrifices are now in order.\n\nAgainst that background, Russia has seen some unusual public criticism of the top brass running Putin’s war. Within limits, of course: Criticizing the war itself or Russia’s commander-in-chief is off limits, but those responsible for carrying out the President’s orders are fair game.\n\nIn a recent interview with Russian arch-propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, the head of the defense committee in Russia’s State Duma demanded that officials cease lying and level with the Russian public.\n\n“First of all, we need to stop lying,” said Andrei Kartopolov, a former colonel-general in the Russian military and a member of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party. “We brought this up many times before … But somehow it’s apparently not getting through to individual senior figures.”\n\nKartapolov complained that the Ministry of Defense was evading the truth about incidents such as Ukrainian cross-border strikes in Russian regions neighboring Ukraine.\n\n“Our Russian city of Valuyki… is under constant fire,” he said. “We learn about this from all sorts of folks, from governors, Telegram channels, our war correspondents. But no one else. The reports from the Ministry of Defense do not change in substance. They say they destroyed 300 rockets, killed Nazis and so on. But people know. Our people are not stupid. But they don’t want to even tell part of the truth. This can lead to a loss of credibility.”\n\nValuyki is in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. Kyiv has generally adopted a neither-confirm-nor-deny stance when it comes to striking Russian targets across the border.\n\nSome criticism has also come from Russian-appointed quislings who have been installed by Moscow to run occupied regions of Ukraine. In a recent four-minute rant on the messaging app Telegram, the Russian-appointed deputy leader of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, lambasted Russian military commanders for allowing “gaps” on the battlefield that had allowed the Ukrainian military to make advances in the region, which is illegally claimed by Russia.\n\n“There is no need to somehow cast a shadow over the entire Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation because of some, I do not say traitors, but incompetent commanders, who did not bother, and were not accountable, for the processes and gaps that exist today,” Stremousov said. “Indeed, many say that the Minister of Defense [Sergei Shoigu], who allowed this situation to happen, could, as an officer, shoot himself. But, you know, the word officer is an unfamiliar word for many.”\n\nA provocative statement, perhaps – Stremousov might perhaps be mindful of the fact that troublesome leaders of Russian-backed separatist entities have a habit of dying violently – but some of this criticism is not new. Just weeks after Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, one of his key domestic enforcers, Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, urged the Russian military to expand its campaign, implying that Moscow’s approach had not been brutal enough.\n\nBut after Russia’s retreat from the strategic Ukrainian city of Lyman, Kadyrov has been a lot less shy about naming names when it comes to blaming Russian commanders.\n\nWriting on Telegram, Kadyrov personally blamed Colonel-General Aleksandr Lapin, the commander of Russia’s Central Military District, for the debacle, accusing him of moving his headquarters away from his subordinates and failing to adequately provide for his troops.\n\n“It’s not a shame that Lapin is mediocre, but the fact that he is covered at the top by the leaders in the General Staff,” said Kadyrov.\n\nThe US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War noted that Russian battlefield setbacks, coupled with the unease in Russian society over mobilization, “was fundamentally changing the Russian information space.” That has included robust criticism not just from hawkish men of power such as Kadyrov, but from pro-war milbloggers who have often provided a granular picture of battlefield realities for Russian forces.\n\n“The Russian information space has significantly deviated from the narratives preferred by the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) that things are generally under control,” ISW noted in its recent analysis.\n\n“The current onslaught of criticism and reporting of operational military details by the Kremlin’s propagandists has come to resemble the milblogger discourse over the past week. The Kremlin narrative had focused on general statements of progress and avoided detailed discussions of current military operations. The Kremlin had never openly recognized a major failure in the war prior to its devastating loss in Kharkiv Oblast, which prompted the partial reserve mobilization.”\n\nOne of the central features of Putinism is a fetish for World War II, known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War. And those in Russia’s party of war often speak admiringly of the brutal tactics employed by the Red Army to fight Hitler’s Wehrmacht, including the use of punishment battalions – sending soldiers accused of desertion, cowardice or wavering against German positions as cannon fodder – and the use of summary execution to halt unauthorized retreats.\n\nKadyrov – who recently announced that he had been promoted by Putin to the rank of colonel general – has been one of the most prominent voices arguing for the draconian methods of the past. He recently said in another Telegram post that, if he had his way, he would give the government extraordinary wartime powers in Russia.\n\n“Yes, if it were my will, I would declare martial law throughout the country and use any weapon, because today we are at war with the whole NATO bloc,” Kadyrov said in a post that also seemed to echo Putin’s not-so-subtle threats that Russia might contemplate the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd that’s the worrying thing. In Russia’s bellicose information space, the talk isn’t about ending a horrific and wasteful war: It’s about correcting the mistakes that forced a Russian retreat, reinforcing discipline, and doubling down in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Nathan Hodge"], "publish_date": "2022/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/25/eagle-cam-lynching-memorial-midwest-wildfires-news-around-states/50871577/", "title": "Eagle cam, lynching memorial, Midwest wildfires: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: After the company that opened a high-tech recycling center in the city went belly-up, and a second company needed steep government subsidies to keep it running, Mayor Steven Reed said the city has decided to cut its losses, end its public recycling service and sell the building.

The lawsuit filed Friday accuses Charlie Pierce of “constant unwanted physical touching, sexual remarks, and sexual advances,” the Anchorage Daily News reports. The woman’s Anchorage-based attorney, Caitlin Shortell, said in an email to the Associated Press that it was filed in the Kenai Superior Court, and she expected a judge to be assigned Monday. “When an elected official abuses their power and position to sexually harass public servants, they must be held accountable,” Shortell said. The AP does not normally identify alleged victims in sexual harassment cases. Pierce is one of four candidates running for governor in Alaska, and all appeared at a forum Saturday morning in Anchorage. “I have no comments on future litigation,” Pierce told the AP following the debate. He said he also had no plans to end his campaign just a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election. “I’ll be in the race,” he said. The lawsuit also names the Kenai Peninsula Borough south of Anchorage as a defendant in the case, claiming the local government failed to protect the woman. She claims the borough provided no way to report harassment or discrimination without fear of reprisal.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A man who runs a veterans charity lied about serving in the Army and duped Arizonans – including a retired veteran with cancer and a disabled Iraq War combat medic – out of tens of thousands of dollars, according to family and former supporters. Matt Augee of RecFX Foundation gained trust within military and church communities by touting himself as a warrior and his nonprofit as a Christian cause. He used humor, generosity and encouragement of people’s dreams to suck both the wealthy and the struggling into his schemes, people who know him said. In some cases, Augee’s actions derailed lives, depriving veterans of their nest eggs and leaving at least one military mother homeless, an investigation found. Augee denies wrongdoing. Former supporters, including Augee’s own parents, have tried to stop him by attempting to dissolve the organization and notifying local and federal authorities of their concerns. The Arizona Attorney General’s Office has closed at least two investigations without charges, while other agencies did not take action on complaints. Augee continues to operate his foundation, although the IRS website indicates it revoked its status as a nonprofit organization in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to dismiss wire fraud and bribery charges against a former state senator who was set to face trial next month for a second time after a jury deadlocked last year. Gilbert Baker, who also served as a former chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas, was accused of conspiring with a former state judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The judge, Mike Maggio, pleaded guilty to bribery in 2015 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In August 2021, a federal jury acquitted Baker of bribery conspiracy and deadlocked on another bribery charge and seven wire fraud charges. He was set to go on trial again Nov. 8, but prosecutors filed a motion Thursday seeking to dismiss the indictment against Baker. The motion did not give a reason for the dismissal, and a judge must still approve it. Baker’s attorney, Blake Hendrix, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he was preparing to go to trial up until he received the motion. He declined to comment until the indictment is dismissed. Baker’s case was among several corruption cases filed against lawmakers and lobbyists in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday vowed he would serve a full four-year term if reelected in November, trying again to knock down speculation that he wants to replace Democrat Joe Biden on the ballot should he not seek a second term. Newsom made the promise during an hourlong debate with his Republican challenger, state Sen. Brian Dahle – the only time the two candidates will meet face to face before voting ends Nov. 8. Newsom is expected to easily win reelection in November more than one year after beating back a recall attempt fueled by anger at his pandemic policies, which included the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order. He has barely campaigned in California this year, instead spending money on ads in challenging Republican leaders Florida and Texas – potential opponents in a presidential election. “Everyday Californians understand what is happening here in California, and the governor is focused on running for president,” Dahle said during a debate that was broadcast live on the radio by KQED News. Asked directly by co-moderator Marisa Lagos if he would commit to serving all four years if he’s reelected, Newsom said “yes.” He defended his national campaigning, saying he “barely” left the state to take on national Republican leaders, who he said are banning books and “demeaning” the LGBT community.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still incompetent to stand trial, a judge ruled Friday, keeping his prosecution on hold. Court proceedings against Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 23, have been paused since December, when a judge first found him to be mentally incompetent. The rulings mean he is unable to understand legal proceedings or work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa remains at the state mental hospital, where he is receiving treatment, and was not in the Boulder courtroom Friday. Relatives of those killed sat in the courtroom for the brief hearing while others watched online. District Court Judge Ingrid Bakke said Alissa’s latest evaluation Oct. 10 showed he that there was a substantial probability that he could be treated to be made competent in the “forseeable future,” echoing an outlook she first shared in March. When District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the victims’ families were frustrated with the state hospital and the doctors there, Bakke expressed sympathy, noting that there was not much either the defense or prosecution could do as Alissa underwent treatment. “It understandably is a very frustrating process,” said Bakke, who set another hearing to review Alissa’s condition for Jan. 27.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked a judge to throw out a nearly $1 billion verdict against him and order a new trial in a lawsuit by Sandy Hook families, who say they were subjected to harassment and threats from Jones’ lies about the 2012 Newtown school shooting. Jones filed the requests Friday, saying Judge Barbara Bellis’ pretrial rulings resulted in an unfair trial and “a substantial miscarriage of justice.” “Additionally, the amount of the compensatory damages award exceeds any rational relationship to the evidence offered at trial,” Jones’ lawyers, Norm Pattis and Kevin Smith, wrote in the motion. Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the 15 plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Jones, declined to comment on the filing Saturday but said he and other attorneys for the Sandy Hook families will be filing a brief opposing Jones’ request. Twenty first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School died in the attack on Dec. 14, 2012. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting and relatives of eight children and adults killed in the massacre sued Jones for defamation and infliction of emotional distress over his pushing the bogus narrative that the shooting was a hoax staged by “crisis actors” to impose more gun control.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A project decades in the making that promises to alleviate flooding issues in the low-income, low-lying neighborhood of Southbridge was unveiled Wednesday. The $26 million Southbridge Wilmington Wetlands Park was completed earlier this year, 16 years after initial work began and nearly a year after its expected completion because of delays in installing the gates that control the tidal flow within the wetlands. The project was funded through a mix of federal, state and local sources to restore a freshwater wetland and create a flood basin and open park space on contaminated, drained wetland bordered by A Street, Walnut Street and Garasches Lane in Wilmington. The park serves as recreation space as well as a stormwater management facility. Community leaders and elected officials said Wednesday that the project is a perfect example of environmental justice for a community of color surrounded by contaminated industrial sites and devastated by floods for decades. “It stores over 2 million gallons of stormwater that previously caused flooding in these homes back here,” said Wilmington Public Works Commissioner Kelly Williams, gesturing to homes along B Street in Southbridge. “It improves our water quality. As the stormwater traverses over a mile of wetland, it restores the tidal wetland with 62 different planted species.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University wrapped up its homecoming weekend celebration with a visit from Vice President Kamala Harris, a Howard alum, WUSA-TV reports. The nation’s first female and first Black vice president showed up at Sunday’s call to chapel, where she reflected on her time at Howard. “It’s a very special experience to be a student at the mecca,” she said. Howard University’s homecoming celebrations were back in person this year following two years of virtual celebrations due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: The most devastating storm in the city’s history wiped out the main nesting location for Harriet and M15, the famous North Fort Myers eagle couple whose lives are streamed across the globe during nesting season. “Their nest was completely demolished during Ian – not a stick left, and many of their foundational branches broke off,” said Virginia Pritchett McSpadden, whose family owns the land where the eagle nest is located. “After the storm passed, I remember having this gutted feeling that they were harmed, the trees had fallen, and they wouldn’t return to the area, but to my surprise … both eagles were spotted safe and already attempting to bring in new sticks. It brought tears to my eyes and I know to many others as well.” Losing the nest during September is actually good timing for the birds because there’s still time to rebuild and lay eggs this season. October is typically when bald eagles build and repair nests in South Florida. It’s also the time of year when the Pritchett family turns on the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam. There are actually multiple cameras that show different angles of the nest and branches on which the birds rest. The footage is streamed online to millions of viewers each year. But the camera system was damaged by Hurricane Ian as well, so it may be some time before their daily lives are streamed again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A trial to determine whether the state can continue to ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy began Monday in an Atlanta courtroom with testimony from an abortion provider who criticized the restriction and said it has created confusion. Carrie Cwiak, a gynecology professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and a plaintiff in the case, shared how women have reacted when she has explained that their pregnancy was past the time period when abortion is allowed under state law. “It’s upsetting,” she said. “It’s emotional.” Women have wondered aloud what they will do next, she said. Georgia’s law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many people know they are pregnant. The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable. Cwiak said the law, however, does not provide clear guidance about when doctors can intervene. The potential criminal penalty for an error is also chilling, she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Visitors fed pumpkins to elephants Sunday for the Honolulu Zoo’s “Ele-Fun” day, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: Officials with an Australian company’s newly opened cobalt mine in east-central Idaho say it could soon produce enough of the key ingredient in lithium batteries to build 400,000 electric vehicles annually. Officials with Jervois Global Limited held an opening ceremony this month at the remote, underground mine located in the Salmon River Mountains on federal land managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Officials said the mine will likely start operating at full capacity early in 2023, producing about 2,000 tons of cobalt. On its website, the company said it wants to “become the leading global supplier of responsibly sourced cobalt and nickel materials to serve both the battery and chemicals markets, and to provide a secure, reliable supply to customers in the face of geopolitical and other risks.” President Joe Biden in March directed the Defense Department to consider at least five metals – lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel and manganese – as essential to national security and authorized steps to bolster domestic supplies. U.S. officials want to reduce reliance on China and other countries for metals needed for electric vehicles and clean-energy storage systems. Gov. Brad Little said he toured the cobalt mine as part of the opening.\n\nIllinois\n\nStonington: A man killed last week in a central Illinois train accident has been identified as a worker who had been with a local grain cooperative for nearly a half-century, authorities said. Christian County coroner Amy Calvert Winans said Stephen “Steve” J. Jordan, 69, died Friday of multiple traumatic injuries, according to preliminary results of an autopsy performed Saturday. Legacy Grain Cooperative said in a post on its website that Jordan, who was from Moweaqua, had worked the co-op for 49 years. Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said Jordan was driving a rail car mover owned by the co-op when about noon Friday he crossed into the path of a Norfolk Southern engine pulling four empty cars. Jordan was pronounced dead at the accident scene. No one else was hurt in the incident, which occurred near Stonington, a village located about 20 miles southeast of Springfield.\n\nIndiana\n\nMount Vernon: More than 100 people gathered outside the city’s old courthouse on a breezy autumn Sunday to memorialize the deadliest recorded lynching of Black Hoosiers in state history. The somber ceremony capped off a months­long effort led by 17-year-old Sophie Kloppenburg, a Mount Vernon High School senior, to see a memorial honoring the slain men built on the courthouse lawn. It’s been a long time coming. One hundred and forty four years ago, in October 1878, a mob of white Posey County residents unleashed a torrent of racial violence after eight Black men were accused of raping three white women. The accused never received a trial. The mob ultimately shot, stabbed, hanged and burned to death seven men. Kloppenburg made it her mission to commemorate the lives lost when she learned of the lynchings from a family friend last year. After months of discussions with city and county leaders, and with the help of teachers, University of Southern Indiana historians and community members, Kloppenburg succeeded in securing the memorial’s place at the old courthouse. She spoke to a packed Hovey House on Sunday about the lynchings. “A mob watching African Americans hang has been replaced by a crowd watching us speak and lead,” Kloppenburg said as she recounted the events of October 1878.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A rural lawmaker wants to allow raccoons to be hunted year-round, saying their populations have grown too large, making them a nuisance. Republican state Rep. Dean Fisher plans to introduce legislation next year creating an open season on hunting for raccoons, opossums, skunks and groundhogs. Open season hunting already exists for coyotes, and a bill Fisher introduced during the last legislative session would have allowed hunting of those animals without prior state approval as well. It passed the Iowa House but stalled in the Senate. “There’s just no end of the problems with these critters. It’s just gotten out of control,” said Fisher, a retired engineer and farmer who lives in Montour. But unrestricted hunting is controversial. An open season “would cause more of these animals to die unnecessarily,” said Preston Moore, state director for the Humane Society of the United States, which opposed Fisher’s bill. “They’re native wildlife species and play an important role in a healthy and balanced ecosystem.” Wildlife in Iowa is held in the public trust, Moore said, and hunting should not be removed from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ oversight. “They should be managed for the benefit of all Iowans,” the Cedar Rapids resident said.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: An undersheriff in rural Kansas is facing a manslaughter trial for fatally shooting an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun, a case that comes amid a national reckoning on police violence. Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Virgil Brewer, who was with the Barber County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the deadly encounter with Steven Myers in October 2017 outside a shed in Sun City, about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A civil lawsuit brought by Myers’ family against Brewer and then-Barber County Sheriff Lonnie Small was settled in 2020 after county officials agreed to pay $3.5 million. Brewer’s criminal trial is expected to focus on whether his lack of knowledge and training with the less-lethal munitions amounted to reckless involuntary manslaughter. Defense attorney David Harger did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case. Brewer has been on unpaid leave since his 2018 arrest. He has been free pending trial. “The fact of the matter is that it is not going to be a good outcome for anybody, no matter whether or not he gets convicted,” Steven Myers’ widow, Kristina Myers, told the Associated Press on Thursday. “Yes, it will be over in that sense, but this one bad decision has ruined the lives of so many people.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky public school districts and private schools that own school buses can apply for funding through a program designed to reduce diesel emissions, Gov. Andy Beshear announced. The 2022 Kentucky Clean Diesel Grant Program will reimburse up to 25% of the cost of a replacement bus, the state Energy and Environment Cabinet said in a news release Wednesday. Grant recipients have to cover the remainder. The program will provide $310,643 toward replacing aging school buses. Diesel exhaust contains pollutants that negatively affect health, especially in children, the release said. Applicants in areas that don’t meet air quality standards, proposals that achieve the most cost-effective emission reductions and applications that demonstrate the greatest reductions in emissions will be given priority. The deadline to apply is Nov. 4, and projects must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023. Apply by visiting the Division for Air Quality’s website at https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Air/Pages/Clean-Diesel-Grant-Program.aspx.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state Supreme Court has suspended a Baton Rouge judge without pay for 180 days for abusing her power to hold people in contempt. East Baton Rouge Parish Family Court Judge Charlene Charet Day, who has held the seat since 2011, violated the law when she issued a bench warrant that resulted in a teacher being arrested at the school where she works, the high court ruled Friday. The Louisiana Judiciary Commission, which investigates complaints of judicial conduct, recommended the six-month suspension in July, finding that Day violated rules of conduct and committed “willful misconduct” when she locked up litigants for contempt of court. Day was directed to pay the commission a $6,260 fine. The justices unanimously agreed that a suspension was warranted, though one thought a less-severe penalty was required, The Advocate reports. “Judge Day’s conduct harmed the integrity of and respect for the judiciary,” Justice William Crain wrote in the prevailing opinion. “When a judge abuses the immense power to deprive a person of their liberty, it has a profound effect on public confidence in the judiciary.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A judge declined a request by developers of a $1 billion power line to resume construction, keeping the project on hold until a judge’s decision next year on the constitutionality of a referendum that halted the project. The judge on Friday rejected an injunction by the New England Clean Energy Connect and said the case is on a “fast track” for a trial in April. Developers suggested the project is at a “tipping point” where delays could cause Massachusetts, which is funding the project, to walk away. The project, which would supply enough Canadian hydropower for 1 million homes in New England, received regulatory approvals, but Maine voters rejected the project in a referendum after construction had begun. The proposal calls for a 145-mile power line from Canada into Maine, where it could connect to the regional power grid. Most if it would follow existing utility corridors, but new section had to be cut through 53 miles of woods to reach the Canadian border. Supporters say the project is a bold step in reducing carbon in the atmosphere and would moderate electric rates in the region. Critics say those benefits are overstated and must be weighed against destruction of woodland habitat.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A federal judge has postponed the trial of Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff. The Baltimore Sun reports that Roy McGrath asked the judge through his lawyer to postpone the trial because federal prosecutors had handed over more than 8,800 pages of evidence in recent weeks. McGrath briefly served as Hogan’s top adviser before resigning after a report in the newspaper detailed a severance payment he received from the government-owned nonprofit Maryland Environmental Service. McGrath also wants the opportunity to review the evidence in his case personally, his defense attorney, Joseph Murtha, said in court Thursday. But because he lives in Florida, he cannot look at discovery documents in the case while out of state, per an agreement with the prosecution. McGrath faces an eight-count federal indictment. Charges include wire fraud, including securing a $233,648 severance payment equal to one year of salary. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman did not immediately set a new trial date but said she would do so in the near future once all the parties were able to look at their calendars. The trial had been scheduled to begin this week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Canadian man has been arrested in connection with a series of bomb threats last month targeting several prominent locations in Boston, police said Monday. Joshua Kimble, 42, of Peterborough, Ontario, faces multiple charges in Canada, Boston police said in a statement. A series of threats were transmitted to Boston Children’s Hospital on Sept. 9, police said. Over the next four days, the Prudential Center shopping mall, the Orpheum Theater, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston Public Library all received threats, police said. All shared similar details and all appeared to have originated in Canada, police said. They did not disclose a motive. Boston police, working with the FBI and the Suffolk district attorney’s office, notified the Peterborough Police Service in Canada, which was granted an arrest warrant for the suspect and a search warrant for his home. Kimble is currently being held pending trial in Canada on 12 counts of public mischief and 12 counts of false information, police said. It could not immediately be determined if the suspect had an attorney. It was not clear when or if he would face charges in the U.S. No other details were provided.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors urged a jury Monday to convict three men for assisting the leaders of a plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor, saying they provided land, paramilitary training and inspiration for domestic terrorism in the months ahead of the 2020 U.S. election. Joe Morrison, Pete Musico and Paul Bellar were not charged with trying to abduct Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But their role was critical, according to authorities, who said the trio aligned themselves with key players and repeatedly endorsed the “boogaloo,” a term that became a code word for U.S. civil war. “The plan was hatched, nurtured here in Jackson County,” said state Assistant Attorney General Sunita Doddamani. “It’s really unmistakable what these men in this case did. They promoted terrorism. They sought out terrorists, and they found them and trained them.” The trial in state court in Jackson was an offshoot of the main case handled in federal court, where Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy. Two other men pleaded guilty, and two more were acquitted. The main charge is providing material support for a terrorist act, especially gun drills and ambush training with Fox at a rural property controlled by Morrison. Musico, Morrison’s father-in-law, also lived there.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Legislature should mandate that the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office proofread every county’s ballots before they’re mailed out, Republican challenger Kim Crockett said Thursday as she decried ballot printing errors in four counties. Crockett acknowledged that state law does not require the office to review the ballots of each precinct across the state for accuracy – that’s long been the responsibility of Minnesota’s counties. But she suggested that Democratic incumbent Steve Simon should have caught the errors anyway, since counties are required to mail copies to his office. “I think it’s a joint responsibility, certainly, between the secretary’s office and the counties, and this is something that I think the Legislature needs to step in and fix right away,” Crockett said at a news conference. Crockett has been a harsh critic in the campaign of how Simon stresses ease-of-voting. She repeated her earlier statement that the 2020 election was “rigged” against Donald Trump and called Simon’s moves to facilitate voting amid the pandemic “lawless and partisan.” She and other Republicans were especially upset with consent decrees that Simon entered into with groups seeking temporary changes, which courts approved.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: In a state where health officials expect 5,000 more births each year as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upending abortion rights, children are more likely to die before their first birthday than in any other state. Mississippi has the nation’s highest fetal mortality rate, highest infant mortality rate and highest pre-term birth rate and is among the worst states for maternal mortality. Black women are nearly three times more likely to die due to childbirth than white women in Mississippi. As the state’s Republican leaders led the legal fight against abortion, Gov. Tate Reeves said he would do everything in his power to make Mississippi the “safest state in the nation for an unborn child.” But access to prenatal and postnatal care has dwindled in Mississippi since the June ruling, making childbirth even more dangerous for poor women and children. The only neonatal intensive care unit in the state’s impoverished Delta region closed in July under financial pressures, moving lifesaving care for ill or premature newborn babies about two hours away by car. And now the publicly owned Greenwood Leflore Hospital has announced the permanent closure of its labor and delivery unit, saying it can’t pay competitive wages and retain experienced nurses. The area’s women will need to travel about 45 minutes to give birth at a hospital.\n\nMissouri\n\nWooldridge: Roughly half of a small town burned Saturday after a wildfire spread quickly from a farm field and destroyed or heavily damaged 23 buildings, officials said. No one died, and only one person was taken to a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, but the entire town of Wooldridge had to be evacuated Saturday because of the fire. The blaze was sparked in a field by a combine that was harvesting crops. A nearby stretch of Interstate 70 had to be closed for nearly two hours Saturday evening because of heavy smoke. Cooper County Fire District spokesman Jim Gann said Sunday that between 4.6 and 5.4 square miles burned before the fire was brought under control. Firefighters were working Sunday to keep hot spots under control with strong winds forecast in the afternoon. Wooldridge is a town of less than 100 people about 20 miles west of Columbia along the Missouri River. Stephen Derendinger, an engineer with the Jamestown Rural Fire Protection District, said half the town is burnt. “It’s devastated,” Derendinger said. Firefighters saved the Wooldridge Baptist Church, Wooldridge Community Club and post office as they pumped water from swimming pools to help battle the blaze.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Following extensive bargaining, Gov. Greg Gianforte and public employee unions last week reached an agreement for the state pay plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Covering the 2024-2025 biennium, the agreement includes wage increases, health benefit cost freezes, one-time payments and other contractual changes, according to the news release. It characterized the agreement as significant, the Daily Montanan reports. “This negotiated pay plan addresses challenges faced by state and higher education employees and will keep them doing important work for Montana,” said the news release. The governor and union leaders praised the agreement in statements from the governor’s office. “This agreement reflects our commitment to our hardworking state employees for all they do for Montanans,” Gianforte said in a statement. “As Montanans and all Americans face higher prices and historic inflation, this package will help ensure we retain and recruit qualified, dedicated public employees to serve Montanans.” The Montana Federation of Public Employees also lauded the negotiations, according to the news release. “This pay plan agreement is a testament to our bargaining team’s tireless commitment to their fellow MFPE members,” MFPE President Amanda Curtis said in a statement.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prairie fires pushed by tinder-dry conditions and winds topping 60 mph led to evacuations in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and destroyed homes and injured two firefighters south of Nebraska’s capital city, officials said. At least two grassland fires were first reported Sunday afternoon south of Lincoln and spread quickly as winds began to pick up and push the fires north, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office reported. The nearly 300 residents of Hallam, about 20 miles south of Lincoln, were ordered to evacuate their homes, and rural residents of southern Lancaster County and northern Gage County were urged to evacuate because of the fires. Officials also asked farmers to turn on irrigation pivots or other water sources to help combat the fires, which were contained by Sunday evening, with the help of rain showers that moved into the area. Officials said three homes and several outbuildings were destroyed in Lancaster County. Two firefighters also were injured, one seriously. Officials had not released their names or updated their medical conditions by early Monday morning. In southwestern Lancaster County, residents made plans to move cattle and other valuables to Christopher Smith’s farm south of the fires. “Everybody’s just trying to help out,” Smith said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A former Las Vegas-area politician has been indicted on a murder charge – which carries the possibility of the death penalty – in the killing of a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. Robert “Rob” Telles, 45, was indicted Thursday and scheduled for arraignment this Wednesday in Clark County District Court, according to court records. One of Telles’ court-appointed lawyers, Edward Kane, declined to comment about the indictment, a move by prosecutors that means Telles will not face a preliminary hearing of evidence that had been set for this week. Telles, 45, a Democrat, lost his party primary in June and has been stripped by court order of his position as Clark County Administrator, heading the office that handles assets of people who die without a will or family contacts. The state Supreme Court has suspended Telles’ law license pending a State Bar of Nevada investigation of allegations that he misappropriated client funds. He was arrested Sept. 7, several days after the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German outside German’s home. Telles is being held without bail at the Clark County jail. District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said he’ll make a decision in coming weeks whether Telles will face the death penalty.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The father of Harmony Montgomery, a girl who disappeared in 2019 at age 5 but was not reported missing until late last year, has been arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, authorities said Monday. He is accused of repeatedly striking her in the head with a closed fist that December. Other counts against Adam Montgomery, 32, include falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse between December 2019 and March 2020. Authorities did not say whether the girl’s body had been found. Montgomery, also is charged with tampering with a witness by attempting to cause his wife and Harmony’s stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, to provide false testimony. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Manchester. An attorney for Adam Montgomery did not immediately comment. “I do want to again express my deepest sympathies to Harmony’s family, friends and loved ones,” state Attorney General John Formella said at the news conference in Manchester. “We understand that today’s news, while significant for purposes of this investigation, is yet another difficult moment for those who loved Harmony and those who have followed this case.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNeptune: Nurses at Jersey Shore University Medical Center ratified a three-year contract that is expected to increase wages, keep veteran nurses on board and enhance security at the hospital, union officials said Sunday. The contract, approved three months before the current agreement was set to expire, could increase pay for many nurses by 8% to 11%, said Debbie White, president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union. “These workers have been adamant that working conditions must improve, and we are now on the right path,” White said. Jersey Shore University Medical Center, owned by Edison-based Hackensack Meridian Health, is the region’s biggest hospital, with 691 beds. Like its competitors, it has faced a series of challenges in recent years, including pressure from insurers to lower costs; a labor shortage; and COVID-19. In mid-September, the union released a survey of its members and found 79% said hospital management doesn’t take adequate steps to keep them safe; 58% didn’t feel safe working in the hospital; and 54% said they wouldn’t feel safe being treated there. Hackensack Meridian said the survey wasn’t scientific. It countered with a letter from Dr. Angelo Chinnici, who said he has worked with Jersey Shore University Medical Center for 40 years and entrusts his family’s care to Hackensack Meridian.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTaos: A judge has ruled five defendants are competent to stand trial more than four years after they were found in a squalid New Mexico compound with 11 malnourished children and the body of a young boy. But multiple motions filed by defense lawyers last week may slow the proceedings again. Taos County sheriff’s officials raided the compound in remote northern New Mexico in August 2018, saying they also discovered a firing range and firearms. In a second search days later, authorities reported recovering the decomposing remains of a 3-year-old boy from an underground tunnel. Authorities said the child was the son of one of the five adult suspects and had been reported missing by his mother in Georgia. All five members of the extended family are charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and providing material support to terrorists. Their attorneys said the defendants would not be facing terrorism-related charges if they were not Muslim. Albuquerque TV station KOB reports that defense lawyers filed motions last week trying to get the judge to drop all kidnapping charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City and state officials on Saturday announced new efforts to curb violence and other crimes on the city’s subway system, including increased police patrols, cameras and mental health help for those in need. Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, and other officials disclosed the new measures in the wake of more disturbing attacks in the system, including the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy on an A train in Queens earlier this month and the death of a man pushed in front of another Queens train during a dispute last Monday. Adams said that while crime in the city is down 4% since 2019 and down 17% from 10 years ago, many in the public don’t feel safer. He said the new efforts complement the subway safety plan he announced at the beginning of the year. “We can give you stats all day,” he said. “The question is, how do New Yorkers feel? We must match the actual impacts with how New Yorkers feel on the streets and in the subway system.” Adams and Hochul said police with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be taking primary responsibility for patrolling subway stations adjacent and linked to the four major commuter rail hubs – Penn Station and Grand Central Station in Manhattan, Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and Sutphin-Archer Station in Queens.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWhiteville: A suspended sheriff has resigned in the aftermath of a leaked audio recording in which he called Black employees by derogatory names and said they should be fired, his attorney announced Monday. Attorney Michael Mills made the announcement during a hearing on whether Jody Greene, who was elected Columbus County sheriff in 2018, should be removed from office, according to news outlets. “Jody Greene loves Columbus County and does not want to put the people he has served through this ordeal,” Mills told Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Douglas Sasser. The announcement prompted applause from some in the courtroom, The News & Observer reports. District Attorney Jon David had sought Greene’s removal alleging that he had engaged in racial profiling of employees both personally and through those under his command, WECT-TV reports. Sasser suspended Greene earlier this month until Monday’s hearing on the petition for removal. The rest of the hearing was called off and David, the district attorney for Bladen, Brunswick and Columbus counties, said it was no longer necessary due to Greene’s resignation. David has said that he asked the State Bureau of Investigation to probe allegations of obstruction of justice within the sheriff’s office. That investigation is ongoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Unless oil prices increase dramatically in the remaining days of October, North Dakota’s treasury won’t be banking the benefits of a tax increase on drillers that has bumped state tax collections by $120 million since June, the state tax commissioner said Monday. The increase in state oil tax collections was possible because of a state law that adjusts North Dakota’s oil extraction tax when the three-month average price of a barrel of oil went above a specified “trigger” price of $94.69. Oil prices have fallen well below the benchmark in recent weeks, and will almost certainly wipe the increased tax off the books Nov. 1, North Dakota Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. “Unless there is a significant geopolitical event or supply disruption of some sort, it will revert back,” Kroshus said. The monthly averages are figured using West Texas Intermediate prices, the U.S. benchmark set at Cushing, Oklahoma. WTI crude was fetching below $85 a barrel Monday morning, and the average has been below the price trigger since August. Oil prices would have average above $110 a barrel for the remainder of October to keep the trigger in place, Kroshus said. North Dakota has two primary taxes on oil production – a production tax and an extraction tax, the latter of which was part of an initiated measure voters approved in 1980.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Franklin County commissioners are accusing the state’s top election official of making them spend hundreds of thousands of county taxpayer dollars for election security. A directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office requires county boards of elections to implement new security standards as it continues to investigate claims of voter fraud from the 2020 presidential election, claims that it has acknowledged are largely unfounded. In Franklin County, officials say the directive requires swapping out physical security locks and keys with keycard access, electronic monitoring systems and new security cameras for areas that house voting machines, poll pads and other election equipment. The commissioners, all Democrats, reluctantly approved a request from the county elections office for $375,000 to complete the state-mandated upgrades – but not without expressing their frustration with LaRose, a Republican, who has been endorsed by and has rallied with ex-President Donald Trump, who continues to publicly deny the results of the 2020 elections while privately acknowledging that he lost. “The security measures are important and critical,” Commissioner Kevin Boyce said. “It’s just frustrating to get such a strong mandate, such a costly mandate, when we’ve been asking for so many things to help ensure voter access and engagement and just not getting any cooperation from them on that.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: As the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma works to help people hurt by rising costs of food and other necessities, the organization itself is confronting the effects of high inflation. Supply chain issues driven by labor shortages and equipment availability have reduced the variety of food products and lengthened the lead time on deliveries. Before the pandemic, food orders would be delivered within two to three weeks; it is now eight to 10 weeks. The organization is experiencing persistent hikes of 15% to 25% in costs of food plus freight. “Inflation is touching everything, and the supply chain issues are only compounding that impact both in costs and in food availability,” said Caleb Dixon, chief operations officer for the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. According to a new poll, inflation has forced 60% of Oklahoma voters to cut spending on essentials like groceries and on discretionary items like travel. The poll, by Amber Integrated, of Oklahoma City, shows only 17% of the 500 voters surveyed haven’t cut back. A majority in most age groups have cut back on groceries, travel, entertainment and dining out. The biggest percentages by age of people cutting back were those between 40 and 49 and those 70 and older.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A U.S. Forest Service employee was arrested last week by a county sheriff after a planned burn in a national forest spread onto private land. It was the latest episode that underscores simmering tensions over management of federal lands in rural, conservative eastern Oregon. That tension exploded into the 2016 takeover by armed right-wing extremists of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland. One of the extremist leaders was killed by law enforcement officers at a roadblock. Rick Snodgrass, the U.S. Forest Service “burn boss,” was arrested Wednesday and transported to the Grant County Jail, where he was conditionally released, District Attorney Jim Carpenter said in a statement. Carpenter warned that Snodgrass’ federal employment “will not protect him if it is determined that he acted recklessly.” “That the USFS was engaging in a prescribed burn may actually raise, rather than lower the standard to which Snodgrass will be held,” the prosecutor said. Prescribed burns are set intentionally and under carefully controlled conditions to clear underbrush, pine needle beds and other surface fuels that make forests more prone to wildfires.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city is asking a judge to force the state’s Department of Human Services to take custody of more than 70 juveniles sentenced in court to state rehabilitation programs, hoping to alleviate what it says is dangerous overcrowding at the city’s holding facility. In the lawsuit filed Friday, city attorneys said the state has refused to prioritize transferring juveniles from the overcrowded juvenile justice center. The city is asking a judge to mandate that the state take the sentenced juveniles within 20 days and either contract with a private or public facility or open a state-run facility to handle the increase in youths being sentenced to state centers. Workers from Philadelphia’s juvenile facility spoke last week at a City Council hearing about worsening conditions at the center that’s designed to temporarily hold up to 184 youths between the ages of 10 and 17 who are awaiting court proceedings. But as of last Friday, the lawsuit said the center had reached 223 juveniles – 74 of whom had been sentenced to state facilities and were awaiting transfer. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services declined to comment on the litigation Monday. In a statement issued after the City Council hearing last week, department officials said the state’s facilities are also at capacity.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: For the first time, authorities have detected a highly contagious form of avian flu in domestic birds in the state. The state Department of Environmental Management on Friday euthanized a small, backyard flock of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys on a farm in Newport County after confirming that some had been infected with a strain of influenza that has spread throughout much of the country in recent months and led to the deaths of millions of birds. It’s not the first case of the strain of flu in Rhode Island. That occurred in July when a great black-backed gull found seriously ill on a South Kingstown beach tested positive for the virus. But the Newport County case is the first confirmation of the virus in a domestic flock. Environmental authorities have been warning of the virus since last winter, when the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread from Europe and Central Asia to North America. Since then, more than 47 million domestic birds in 43 states have died from the virus or had to be killed after being exposed to infection. While there have been other waves of bird flu in the past, this is the largest outbreak in the nation of a variant of the virus. And the number of fatalities is soon expected to exceed the total in the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015-16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s first-ever round of early voting for the general election started Monday with no problems at the polls, but a state website where people go to check voting locations or get a sample ballot crashed. Technicians were working to fix the South Carolina Election Commission’s website at scvotes.org, agency spokesman Chris Whitmire said. In the meantime, voters can look at their ballot choices before heading to the polls at a different site. The agency’s website is not linked to the state’s voting system, Whitmire said. This is the first year South Carolina is allowing voters to cast ballots in person early without having an excuse as to why they can’t vote on Election Day. Polls are open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Nov. 5. There were a smaller number of polling places opened for early voting during the June primaries, and only a few minor problems were reported. Over the past several elections, South Carolina has allowed people to cast absentee ballots in person, but they had to include an excuse for why they could not be at the polls on Election Day. The law passed this year has South Carolina returning to mail-in absentee ballots.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Fernson Brewing Company and South Dakota State University have collaborated to create a premium beer called Ears Up. The beer will hit the shelves in the Brookings market Tuesday. On Saturday, when South Dakota State hosts Indiana State for Hobo Day, the beer will be available inside the stadium. That’s thanks to a new change in the policy of the state’s Board of Regents, which allows state schools to sell beer to the general public. “As a 2008 graduate of South Dakota State, it’s a bit surreal and deeply humbling to be able to create something for my alma mater,” Fernson co-founder Derek Fernholz said in a press release. “We are so proud of the beer we have crafted, together with SDSU, to be enjoyed by Jackrabbits everywhere. This has been one of our largest undertakings to date, and working with the amazing people at South Dakota State University has truly been (an) honor and a great collaborative effort. We cannot wait to see how this project grows and evolves for years to come.” The beer is billed as an “easy-drinking and smooth premium beer with 5% alcohol by volume.” After beers hit the shelves in Brookings, Ears Up will become available in Sioux Falls and distributors who serve across the state including Rapid City, Mitchell, Watertown, Huron, Aberdeen and Pierre.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis and Memphis International Airport are co-hosting an exhibit depicting the civil rights movement in Fayette County through the photographs of freelance photographer Art Shay. The photographs will be displayed in the airport’s terminal for departing flights, across from the TSA office, through next October. The public will be able to view the exhibit without purchasing a ticket or going through the TSA security checkpoints. Established in 1996 by civil rights activist and former NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks, the Hooks Institute seeks to promote civil rights and social change through multiple avenues, including education, research and community engagement. Shay worked as a photographer and writer after serving in World War II. His work has appeared in Life, Time and Sports Illustrated magazines. For more than five decades, Shay photographed some of the 20th century’s most intriguing figures, from Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to President John F. Kennedy. The photographer was also fascinated with the happenings of everyday life, leading him to take an interest in photographing the efforts of the civil rights movement, including in Fayette County in the 1960s.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge has dismissed illegal voting charges against a Houston man who stood in line six hours to cast a ballot in the 2020 presidential primary and became a figure over Republican efforts to tighten election laws. The decision last week followed a wider ruling in Texas that limits the state’s power to prosecute voting fraud cases, which has drawn backlash from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders. Hervis Rogers, who in March 2020 did not leave a polling center at a historically Black college until about 1:30 a.m., had faced charges that carried a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. He had voted while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Rogers said he did not know he was ineligible to cast a ballot when he got in line at Texas Southern University, where reporters had interviewed him and other voters who expressed anger and frustration over the long wait. The charges against Rogers were brought by the office of Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has promoted baseless claims of widespread election fraud and challenged the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, entirely comprised of elected Republicans judges, upheld last month that the state cannot unilaterally prosecute election fraud cases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democratic state Sen. Gene Davis resigned Wednesday, hours after legislators from both parties demanded he step aside and leadership stripped him of committee assignments. Davis’ resignation ends a saga that began in August after a former intern posted on Instagram claims that Davis, 77, had inappropriately touched her, including her toes and waist, in multiple instances in their workplace. In his resignation letter, posted on Twitter by the state Senate, Davis said he would resign effective Nov. 19, following the election and scheduled date of interim committee meetings. Davis, who has served six terms in office, is not on the ballot after he was defeated in the Democratic Party’s June primary. His resignation follows public demands from Senate President Stuart Adams and Davis’ colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus that Davis resign. An independent investigation commissioned by legislative leaders determined that it was “more likely than not” that Davis invaded former intern Sonia Weglinski’s personal space, likely violating the Legislature’s Workplace Discrimination and Harassment policy. It found her allegations to be more credible than Davis’ recollections and accused him of not being forthcoming or completely honest.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: Organizers of the Champlain Valley Fair have announced the first grandstand concert for the 2023 fair, more than 10 months before the summer show will take place. Country star Riley Green, known for hits including “There Was This Girl” and “I Wish Grandpas Never Died,” will play the Champlain Valley Exposition grounds Sunday, Sept. 3. Tickets for Green’s concert go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday. The Champlain Valley Fair, an annual 10-day event in Essex Junction, draws thousands of visitors a year for animals on display as well as rides, games and food on the midway, but the grandstand concerts are a perennial attraction. This year’s performances included rapper Nelly, Celtic rockers The Dropkick Murphys, ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and country performer Scotty McCreery.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin continued to raise funds at a quick clip over the past three months, outpacing his recent predecessors, while also traveling the country building his national profile and boosting midterm candidates. The Republican’s Spirit of Virginia political action committee raised nearly $1.8 million in cash over the July-to-September quarter, spent about $1.1 million and ended the quarter with about $2.3 million on hand, according to campaign finance disclosures filed this month. The governor, increasingly viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, far outraised any other Virginia official’s leadership committee during that timeframe, and the strong receipts are a continuation of a trend: the political newcomer’s combination of fundraising and loans to his campaign during his race last year against Democrat Terry McAuliffe shattered records set in the 2017 gubernatorial campaign. Youngkin also brought in big bucks post-election and for his inauguration. In his first two full quarters in office, he raised more than twice as much as his three most recent predecessors in donations of $10,000 of more, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project, which tracks money in politics.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The payroll premiums on workers’ wages to pay for the state’s paid family and medical leave program will increase Jan. 1. The state’s Employment Security Department announced Thursday that the rate will increase from 0.6% to 0.8% of wages to keep pace with the number of people using the program, with most of the share continuing to be paid by employees. The premium increase comes just weeks after an analysis of the financial health of Washington state’s paid family leave program estimated the fund would hit an $8.7 million deficit by the end of the year. The actuarial analysis by the consulting firm Milliman that was recently presented to a legislative task force showed that the current premium rate is not keeping up with demand for the state benefit that launched in 2020 and it recommended increasing the rate. When premiums first were enacted, 0.4% of workers’ wages funded the program, with 63% paid by employees and 37% paid by employers. An increase to 0.6% had already gone into effect earlier this year, and employees’ share increased to about 73%, with the remainder paid by employers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMartinsburg: Clorox has opened a new cat litter plant that is expected to create more than 100 new jobs. The company said the Martinsburg facility officially opened Friday, with plans to bring $190 million into the local economy. The facility is in a West Virginia Eastern Panhandle community that includes suburbs of Washington. The plant is expected to reach full capacity by early next year. The project includes a 97,000-square-foot main building and 450,000 square feet offsite at a warehouse. The facility will produce Fresh Step and Scoop Away litter. Gov. Jim Justice, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and staff for U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin joined company officials for Friday’s opening ceremony. Clorox now has three facilities in West Virginia, including Kingsford brand charcoal plants in Mineral and Tucker counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: In a trial marked by persistent disruptions, what was expected to be the final day of testimony Monday was marred by more outbursts and interruptions from Darrell Brooks Jr., which once again resulted in his removal from the courtroom. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow ruled Brooks, who is acting as his own attorney, forfeited his rights to call any more witnesses or testify as a result of his behavior after attempting multiple times to determine whether he intended to testify on his own behalf. Closing arguments are tentatively scheduled for Tuesday. Brooks, 40, of Milwaukee, is charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide, 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety, six counts of hit-and-run causing death, two counts of bail jumping, all felonies in connection to the 2021 Waukesha Christmas Parade tragedy, and one count of misdemeanor battery.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Three school districts around the state have been selected for a pilot program aimed at addressing teacher shortages through paid apprenticeships, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Districts in Laramie, Teton and Fremont counties will be the first to try the program to recruit and train educators, and other schools may be able to join the effort in 2024, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/18/asia/wang-jixian-chinese-vlogger-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "A Chinese vlogger shared videos of war-torn Ukraine. He's been ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWang Jixian didn’t set out to become the Chinese voice of resistance in Ukraine. The 36-year-old resident of Odesa, a key target in Russia’s invasion of the country, simply wanted to show his parents he was fine.\n\n“I’m coming back from buying groceries,” he said in a video posted to Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, on February 24, the first day of the invasion. Wang, a programmer originally from Beijing, described buying meat and fruit in the video, remarking that some food stores were still open.\n\nBut his mood darkened as the days passed and the Russian assault escalated. When he logged onto Douyin, he said he would see Chinese videos praising Russian troops or supporting the invasion.\n\n“I was very angry, then I thought I would record videos for them, and I’ll tell them what the real battlefield is,” he told CNN.\n\nHis daily videos, posted across various platforms including YouTube and the Chinese messaging app WeChat, quickly gained traction as a rare voice offering Chinese audiences a glimpse into war-torn Ukraine – a stark contrast from Chinese state media, which has promoted Russian disinformation such as unfounded claims Ukrainian soldiers are using “Nazi” tactics.\n\nWang Jixian holding his Chinese passport in a video posted to Douyin, China's version of TikTok. Courtesy Wang Jixian\n\nIn one widely-watched video, Wang held up his Chinese passport and said, “These Ukrainian guards are not Nazis, they are IT programmers, common people, barbers – these are the people.”\n\nBut in doing so, he had waded into the middle of a messy controversy, with China facing international pressure as it refuses to condemn Russia’s invasion, and an outpouring of pro-Russia sentiment on China’s highly restricted and censored social media – something Wang is hoping to change.\n\nBacklash of critics\n\nWang had studied art in college, and enjoyed dance, music and painting – so when he moved to Odesa four years ago for work, the city’s “artistic atmosphere” immediately appealed to him. One video on his Douyin account last year showed a man playing piano in a colorful room filled with books and paintings.\n\nHis videos look very different now. Several are filmed late at night, with the sound of explosions and air raid sirens in the background. Other clips show snapshots of daily life – quiet streets, Ukrainian flags hung outside buildings and painted onto walls.\n\n“Are those air raid alarms? Those bastards are coming again,” he said in one video. “People are doing their own business, my neighbor is out walking his dog again. This is our Odesa.”\n\nOther times, he’s more impassioned. “Someone told me nowadays, society has the laws of the jungle, where power comes from the barrel of a gun,” he said, referencing a famous quote by Communist leader Mao Zedong. “Where is the sense in that?”\n\nAs these videos began garnering attention, sometimes racking up more than 140,000 views, the number of critics rose too, with comments calling him a national traitor.\n\n“You don’t need this Chinese passport anymore, you have already forgotten which country you are from,” one popular comment on Douyin read. “The official position of the country should be the position of all Chinese people.”\n\nChina has tried to stake out a neutral position, choosing not to condemn Russia or even call it an invasion while frequently saying “all countries’ legitimate security concerns” should be addressed.\n\nIn a call with US President Joe Biden on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said both countries have a responsibility for ensuring peace. But the White House said afterward it was still concerned China could provide Russia assistance.\n\n“I don’t understand how I ‘betrayed’ the country,” Wang told CNN. With limited access to news broadcasts and widespread online misinformation, he said he doesn’t understand China’s or Russia’s position – all he knew was that “every day the city is under fire, many were killed.”\n\nThe comments of anonymous online strangers don’t bother him – but they do when it’s from people he cares about, such as a Chinese Embassy staff member he knew from his previous residence in North Macedonia.\n\nHe said the staffer reached out to him recently, insinuating Wang was being paid to post his videos, and asking: “Who sent you?” When Wang insisted he wasn’t doing it for money, the staffer replied: “Your current behavior is not in line with national interests. I want to cut off relations with you, let’s block each other.”\n\nThat “really hurt my heart,” Wang said.\n\nDetermined to stay\n\nChinese censors have also cracked down on his videos online, he said. While all his videos have stayed up on YouTube, which is blocked in China except for those with VPNs, only about 80% of his videos have been left on WeChat, and fewer than 20% on Douyin.\n\nHe doesn’t know what rules he has broken. He got so frustrated that in one video on March 7, he stuck black tape in an X over his mouth, silently gesturing to the camera to convey that he was safe and still in Odesa.\n\nAfter speaking with CNN, his Chinese social media accounts were banned, leaving him unable to contact his family back home.\n\nHe has received “countless” messages from contacts, placing pressure on him to stop posting, he said. But he has no intention of doing so.\n\n“I want to (provide) some voice for the people in Ukraine, for the heroes, for my neighbors. Because in my eyes they are all heroes,” he said. “I see people being calm, I see people brave … I want to remind you to see who is dying, who has been killed.”\n\nThere are signs his message may be landing. Under his videos, hate comments are interspersed with well wishes from viewers, urging him to stay safe and evacuate. A handful of comments express support for Ukraine.\n\nBut for now, Wang has no intention of leaving – not until “Odesa is too destroyed for humans to stay,” he said. Apart from his affection for the city, it was a matter of principle, he added: “I can’t stand the act of bullying people in front of my face.”\n\nWhen he isn’t filming videos, Wang provides volunteer support in repairing people’s cell phones and assisting the displaced.\n\n“(If) I turned back and left, it would be enough to make me regret for the rest of my life,” he said. “I have no interest or desire to leave Ukraine until the war is ended and Ukraine has won.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Yong Xiong", "Jessie Yeung", "Yong Xiong"], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/opinions/bjp-hindu-muslim-democracy-modi-arundhati-roy/index.html", "title": "Arundhati Roy: 'The damage to Indian democracy is not reversible ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Arundhati Roy is the author of “The God of Small Things,” which won the Booker Prize in 1997 and “The Ministry of Utmost Happiness,” which was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize in 2017.

View more opinion at CNN.\n\nNew Delhi CNN —\n\nWhen two spokespeople from India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made derogatory comments about the Prophet Mohammed last month, it prompted an international firestorm.\n\nThe incident led to protests among India’s Muslim minority in several states. Some Muslim-majority nations summoned their India ambassadors. India’s foreign ministry said the comments did not reflect the views of the government, and the officials involved – one of whom later withdrew her remarks – faced disciplinary action.\n\nBut for India’s 200 million Muslims, these comments were not an isolated incident.\n\nRather, they were the culmination of the BJP’s “engineering hatred of a common enemy,” says bestselling Indian author Arundhati Roy.\n\n“India’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there. We’re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously,” she told CNN.\n\n“Many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison, most of them charged under a dreaded law called the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, all of them for speaking up for minorities, Dalits and forest-dwellers facing displacement and state terror.\n\n“Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means. What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking?” writes Roy.\n\nIn this email interview with CNN Opinion, Roy says Indian politics has something in common with the US Capitol riots, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stoking hatred, and talks about who the real power in India lies with.\n\nCNN: What does this incident involving BJP officials’ comments about the Prophet Mohammed reveal about Indian politics today?\n\nRoy: It reveals how successfully the clear and present existential threat posed by Hindu nationalism in India has been masked by the face it presents to the outside world. You know the people in strange clothes, the man in furs and antlers who stormed the US Capitol? We’re being ruled by their equivalent here. The difference is that they are not a collection of random lunatics. They are members of the most powerful organization in India – the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), whose founding ideologues openly admired Hitler and likened the Muslims of India to the Jews of Germany. RSS is the real power in India.\n\nCNN: What is the connection between the BJP and RSS?\n\nRoy: The ruling party, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), considered to be one of the richest political parties in the world, is only the front office of the RSS. Founded in 1925, the RSS, traditionally controlled by a handful of Brahmins, now has millions of members including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been a member since his teenage years, and most of his cabinet ministers.\n\nIt has its own vast militia, its own schools, labor unions and women’s organizations. It’s not a political party, it’s something of a shape-shifter, a master of double-speak, its sources of funding are amorphous and leave no legal trail, it works through an array of affiliates, but it’s a nation within a nation.\n\nThe RSS believes that India should be declared a Hindu nation, just as Pakistan, Iran and several countries in the Persian Gulf are Islamic nations, just as Israel is legally the “nation-state of the Jewish people.”\n\nA demonstration against the state government demolition of the house of a local Muslim leader in Prayagraj on June 13. The demolition followed clashes after controversial remarks made by two BJP officials about the Prophet Mohammed. Amarjeet Kumar Singh/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIn fact, the RSS believes in what it calls “Akhand Bharat,” a sort of fantasy that is futuristic and ancient all at once – a future Ancient India which includes Pakistan and Bangladesh which will be conquered and subject to Hindu rule. To flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, socialand subnational identities, more diverse than all of Europe, into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process. It means setting aside the constitution and undoing the very idea of India.\n\nFirst in the line of fire is the Muslim community. Close behind are Christians – a tiny minority that is also being brutalized. Last year alone there were more than 400 attacks on Christians. Churches have been vandalized, priests and nuns beaten up, their congregations threatened and humiliated.\n\nIn the last two national elections, in 2014 and 2019, the BJP has shown that it can win a solid majority in the national parliament without the votes of India’s 200-million-strong Muslim community. That has effectively resulted in a sort of disenfranchisement and political isolation of Muslims, which is extremely dangerous.\n\nThere is also a new anti-Muslim citizenship law, a sort of refugee-manufacturing policy in which those who cannot produce a mandated set of “legacy papers,” which few people have, can find themselves deprived of citizenship. Nearly 2 million people in the state of Assam have already been struck off the National Register of Citizens. Massive detention centers for those who have been stripped of citizenship are being constructed all over the country.\n\nBut isolating Muslims is not enough. Creating an artificial majority out of a very diverse Hindu community that consists of thousands of castes and ethnicities is equally important if the BJP is to remain in power. The cement for that is engineering hatred of a common enemy. This requires an incremental ratcheting up of bigotry.\n\nApart from the mass killings and lynching of Muslims by Hindu vigilantes in recent years, we have the steady drumbeat of hatred and outlandish disinformation beamed into peoples’ homes by approximately 400 TV channels and countless newspapers. On social media handles viewed by millions of people there are open calls for the genocide of Muslims – and videos demonstrating how it should be done.\n\nWe regularly see provocative demonstrations by thousands of sword-wielding Hindu men marching through areas in which Muslims live. The deeply disrespectful comments about Prophet Mohammed made by a BJP spokeswoman on national TV this May was a part of this constituency-building exercise. As was the unconscionable bulldozing by municipal authorities of the homes of Muslims who dared to come out in protest.\n\nTo flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, social, and subnational identities… into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process Arundhati Roy\n\nSome of the protestors publicly called for beheadings and hanging and asking for a blasphemy law which the BJP would probably be more than happy to pass and use to silence its critics in swifter and more deadly ways. These individuals helped to confirm every deeply held prejudice about Muslims that the Hindu Right works so hard to perpetuate.\n\nAs a concession to international outrage, the BJP has suspended its spokeswoman, Nupur Sharma, but she has been openly embraced by its cadre. The polarization has worked in the BJP’s favor.\n\nCNN: And what does Prime Minister Narendra Modi have to do with it?\n\nRoy: Modi has made no comment whatsoever about the spokeswoman or the protests. A standard tactic of his. In situations like this, his followers, correctly I believe, read his silence as support. Although he increasingly positions himself as a messiah, he is an RSS man, and he knows that the organization is grooming other leaders who are waiting in the wings. But for now, he is the uncontested figurehead.\n\nModi made his political debut in October 2001. He was appointed, not elected, chief minister of the state of Gujarat. It was just weeks after the 9/11 attacks in the United States. The world was convulsed by Islamophobia. It was the perfect political climate for the RSS.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, pictured here on June 6, has not publicly commented on the recent BJP officials' comments about the Prophet Mohammed. T. Narayan/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA few months later, in February 2002, following an act of arson in which a railway carriage carrying Hindu pilgrims was burnt, there was a brutal pogrom against Muslims in the villages and towns of Gujarat. It lasted for weeks. While the police watched, more than a thousand people were slaughtered in broad daylight, women were gang-raped and burnt alive, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes. Subsequently the murderers were caught on camera boasting of their deeds. Many spoke of how they were inspired and protected by Modi.\n\nModi was unapologetic and came to be known as “Hindu Hriday Samrat” – the Emperor of Hindu Hearts. Soon after the 2002 massacre, he called for state elections and won with a massive majority. He has never looked back since – he was elected Chief Minister of Gujarat for three terms and in 2014 was elected prime minister. And we in India have begun to look at massacres and hatefulness against Muslims as an integral part of election campaigns. During Modi’s tenure as Gujarat Chief Minster, Hitler made it into a school textbook published by the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks as an inspirational leader.\n\nCNN: Over the years, Modi’s popularity and his brand of politics has not waned. Why is that?\n\nRoy: For the same reasons that studies of the algorithms of Facebook and Twitter show that hatefulness gets far more traction than decency. Miserable people, oppressed people, unemployed people, people living in crushing poverty are voting themselves into further hellishness, their sunken eyes fixed on the object of their hate.\n\nAfter Modi’s shocking display of callous incompetence during the pandemic – the sudden lockdown in the first wave that led to millions of stranded workers many of who had to walk thousands of miles home to their villages, the millions of deaths in the second wave – some still shake their heads in sorrowful awe and say, “Without Modi, it would have been worse.”\n\nThey’ve swallowed the story they’ve been fed about themselves, about their own lives. Meanwhile Modi has zero accountability. He has never addressed a single press conference in all his years as prime minister. All we get are staged performances and photo ops.\n\nCNN: What has contributed to this situation where the Modi government feels immune from any international reaction or action?\n\nRoy: I don’t think it is immune at all. On the contrary, our globe-trotting, head-of-state-hugging prime minister cares deeply about international opinion. None of us have ever seen him hug a fellow Indian. The optics of his foreign trips are carefully curated. His millions of followers refer to him as “Vishwa-Guru,” the Guru of the Whole World.\n\nBarack Obama, Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson have all indulged him. International action and reaction is only a game of pragmatism and expediency. It has to do with trade and geopolitics, race, religion and ethnicity, and very little with values and morality.\n\nIf India is buying a fleet of fighter planes from, say, France, it knows that lynching and a little mass murder will, at most, get a delicate finger-wag. A big market is excellent insurance against moral censure.\n\nRight now, foreign relations are a little tricky for India because of the Ukraine war and India’s proximity to Russia. So, India’s crimes in Kashmir and this very violent form of Hindu nationalism is coming under a little scrutiny. But these are all just bargaining chips in the Great Game. Sorry to sound so cynical, but I am.\n\nCNN: How should India’s international Muslim trading partners respond? (And the world, for that matter?)\n\nRoy: Most of the countries that you refer to as India’s “Muslim trading partners” have long ago given up any pretense of democracy or diversity. They are already at the destination that Modi and the BJP are trying to drag India toward. The destination that we dread to arrive at, the theocratic state.\n\nIndia’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there. We’re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously. Failing because our elected leaders are blinded by hate – and crippled by a severe lack of intelligence, which is the more dangerous thing. The consequences will be unimaginable.\n\nAs for what the rest of the world can do, all one can hope for is that people pay attention and form an informed opinion. And realize that their profits from this immense “market” will dry up if the market ceases to exist. The Indian economy is in a lot of trouble. Wealthy people, businesses big and small, have begun to flee. They are good and accurate weather vanes.\n\nCNN: Is India truly the world’s largest democracy?\n\nRoy: A democracy doesn’t just mean having regular elections. You cannot be a democracy when 200 million people who constitute a religious minority are expected to live without rights. When you can lynch them, kill them, incarcerate them, economically and socially boycott them, bulldoze their homes with complete immunity and threaten to strip them of citizenship. When the murderers and lynchers can aspire to move swiftly up the political ladder.\n\nCNN: The damage done to Indian democracy – is it reversible?\n\nRoy: The systematic indoctrination of people on the scale on which it has taken place over decades is hard to reverse. Every institution that is supposed to make up the system of checks and balances has been hollowed out, repurposed and deployed against people as a weapon of Hindu nationalism. In terms of political opposition, there are political parties that have successfully opposed the BJP at the state level in Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, but opposition is virtually non-existent at the national level.\n\nMuslim demonstrators at a protest demanding the arrest of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) official Nupur Sharma following her comments about the Prophet Mohammed, in Kolkata on June 10. Rupak De Chowdhuri/Reuters\n\nThe whole system of elections has been gamed. You can win a huge majority of seats even without anything close to a majority of actual votes. In India, we have a first-past-the-post, multi-party democracy. This means that even if you get say only 20% of the vote in a constituency, as long as its higher than your closest rival, you win. A rich party can put up spurious candidates to split the votes. But that’s just one trick in a whole bag of tricks.\n\nAnd, anyway, how do you woo an indoctrinated population? By proving that you are a better, prouder Hindu? Nobody can beat the BJP at that game. And right now, that’s the only game in town. As far as mainstream politics goes.\n\nSo, no, I don’t believe the damage is reversible. I believe we will be broken and then reborn. Change will only come when and if at all an accepting, gullible, fatalistic people realize what’s being done to them. And then it will come suddenly, and from the street. Not from the system. Until then… God help us.\n\nCNN: What changes have you personally experienced that echo the changes taking place in India at large?\n\nRoy: To begin with, many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison. Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? What does it mean to be considered a ‘success’ when the world is failing and everything you care about is being decimated? What is the moral way to be? The moral thing to do?\n\nI am one of those unfortunate people who saw this coming decades ago. I said so. I wrote so. At the time that made me something of a crazy outlier – one of those people who sets off a fire alarm right when the party’s going really well and everyone’s happy. In some ways it un-homed (not un-housed) me in all sorts of ways, literally and metaphorically – which is not a bad thing for a writer, actually.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? Arundhati Roy\n\nThe idea of patriotism has been fused with the idea of Hindu nationalism, so people like myself are on the A-list of “anti-nationals.” Of course it helps their cause that I am not Hindu. My mother who raised me is Christian. My estranged father who I never really knew came from a Hindu family and converted to Christianity as did his father and his father’s father. But this doesn’t enrage them as much as the things I write and say. Particularly about Kashmir. A Bollywood actor and BJP member of parliament suggested that I be tied to an army jeep and used as a human shield by the Indian Army in Kashmir. They really should try that.\n\nSadly, the BJP’s macro-radicalization has resulted in micro-versions of the same thing. It is mirrored by its allies, its doorkeepers, concierges and maintenance staff, as well as its victims. As everybody turns inward, bitter and doctrinaire, as every form of solidarity crumbles, as the garbage mountains grow and the rivers shrink, as stock characters locked into their own little ideological bubbles shout at each other on TV, I feel my own skin tightening around me, containing me, too. I struggle against that every day. The only home one has is in literature and poetry. That sentence that makes you gasp – or smile out loud. The song that breaks your heart.\n\nCNN: What kind of India would you like to see – and how do we get there?\n\nRoy: My dreams are not, and never have been, limited by the shape of the map of India, or any country. They’ve always been either much smaller or much bigger. The dream worth dreaming is to see our world moving toward a shared understanding of justice, however slowly, instead of racing away from it at the pace we are.", "authors": ["Arundhati Roy"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/17/tidal-basin-flooding-rally-raccoon-garden-razed-news-around-states/50241761/", "title": "Tidal Basin flooding, 'rally raccoon': News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A man convicted of murder more than a decade ago was captured Monday a day after escaping from a minimum-security corrections center near Mobile, prison officials said. Jeffery Strugg, 31, was discovered missing from community-based facility in Prichard on Sunday, according to a notice from the Alabama Department of Corrections. The agency didn’t release any information about how Strugg got out. He surrendered without any violence in Mobile County, corrections officials said. Strugg was 18 when he was sentenced to 29 years in prison after being convicted in the 2007 killing of Dewone Smiley, 15, in Selma, court records show. Strugg was accused of entering an apartment and shooting Smiley, a student at Selma High School, to death in front of two witnesses. Strugg is eligible for parole consideration Dec. 1, prison records show.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House on Saturday voted against accepting a spending package passed by the Senate that included payments of about $5,500 to residents. The vote to concur with the Senate package failed, with 18 members in favor of accepting the Senate plan and 22 against. The vote sets the stage for a conference committee, with the regular legislative session set to end by Wednesday. In a conference committee, House and Senate negotiators are tasked with hashing out differences between the state budgets that passed each chamber. The House, in its version of the budget, included a dividend of about $1,250 plus a $1,300 “energy relief” check. The Senate plan called for a dividend of about $4,200 from Alaska’s oil wealth fund, an amount in line with a long-standing formula last used in 2015. The Senate plan also included a $1,300 energy check. Some lawmakers have argued the state is benefitting from high oil prices and can afford to help Alaskans who are struggling. But critics of the higher payments to residents say oil prices are volatile, and the oil price in the state revenue forecast can’t be assured.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A federal appeals court has upheld a judge’s ruling overturning a federal agency’s approval of Toronto-based Hudbay Minerals Inc.’s plan for a new open-pit copper mine in southeastern Arizona. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the U.S. Forest Service’s approval of a permit for the Rosemont Mine project in a valley on the eastern flank of the Santa Rita Mountains near Tucson went beyond what is allowed under a federal mining law. The appellate court cited the planned use of Coronado National Forest land for long-term storage of waste rock, not actual mining, and the lack of valuable minerals on that property. Hudbay Minerals officials said in a statement Thursday that they were reviewing the ruling and would continue to pursue alternative plans for mining part of the Rosemont copper deposit on nearby private lands. A coalition of environmental and tribal groups challenging the mining hailed the appellate court’s decision, the latest in a series of legal obstacles to the project. “This momentous decision makes it clear that Hudbay’s plan to destroy the beautiful Rosemont Valley is not only a terrible idea, it’s illegal,” said Allison Melton, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. Hudbay has another mine project in the works on the western flank of the Santa Ritas.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A raccoon ran loose in the stands during Arkansas baseball’s Friday matchup with Vanderbilt, but a fan came to the rescue. Fayetteville native Grant Harmon grabbed the raccoon with his bare hands and held it up to cheers from the crowd at Baum-Walker Stadium as members of the Commodores’ bullpen looked on from left field. The incident was dubbed by fans on social media as the “rally raccoon,” as the Hogs came back to tie the game after being down 5-0 and then 6-5. Despite that, the rallies ultimately fell short as Vanderbilt won 9-6 in 10 innings. After grabbing the raccoon, Harmon continued to carry it out of the stadium. “The opportunity just came about, and I guess I just took action and grabbed it,” he said. “That was a first. I have no prior experience grabbing raccoons.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nModesto: The state will acquire a sprawling former farm property in the San Joaquin Valley and create a new state park for the first time in 13 years. Dos Rios Ranch, where the San Joaquin and Tuolumne rivers meet southwest of Modesto, will become California’s 280th state park and the first new one since Fort Ord Dunes near Monterey in 2009, the Modesto Bee reports. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday earmarked $5 million for the new park as part of his revised budget proposal for the fiscal year starting July 1. The nearly 4-square-mile expanse featuring willows and valley oaks will be donated by River Partners, a conservation group that’s spent the past decade restoring the site. State Parks Director Armando Quintero said Friday that the property will serve “a park-poor region” – the San Joaquin Valley – and help address inequities in access to state recreation sites. “Everyone deserves to have close access to vibrant parks, and this opportunity is an exciting one,” Quintero said. Dos Rios could get trails, picnic areas, restrooms and other basics within five years, state parks officials said. Campgrounds could follow within another five years, the Bee reports.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The city is enacting a fire ban after a series of blazes have spread quickly in hot and dry conditions, including a fatal one caused by smoking. Under the ban taking effect Monday, smoking and grilling will be banned in parks in Colorado’s second-largest city. People grilling at home will only be able to use gas or liquid fuel, not charcoal or wood, and chain saws must have spark arresters. Welding or torching work may still be allowed but only with a permit, the Colorado Springs Fire Department said. A woman died in a fire Thursday at a mobile home park that was blamed on “the improper disposal of smoking materials,” city spokesperson Natashia Kerr said. Eight homes were destroyed. Under the ban, smoking materials must be disposed of in a non-combustible container with a lid. Meanwhile, a wildfire in the foothills southwest of the city that also started Thursday has burned 2.4 square miles. The fire near the former mining town of Cripple Creek was 27% contained Monday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A former assistant police chief’s lawsuit claiming he was defrauded out of the police chief’s job can go forward, a state appeals court has ruled. James Nardozzi’s lawsuit stemmed from the hiring scandal that landed the city’s police chief and personnel director in prison last year. Nardozzi claimed former Chief Armando Perez and former personnel director David Dunn conspired with Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim to fix the selection process so Perez would be selected as chief, the Connecticut Post reports. Prosecutors said Perez, 65, received confidential information about the police chief’s examination that was stolen by Dunn, including the questions for an oral examination and the scoring guide for written essays. Perez, who was the acting chief at the time, also admitted that he had two officers complete his essays, passed the work off as his own and lied to federal authorities in an effort to cover up his actions. Last April, Perez was sentenced to a year in prison, and Dunn received a four-month term. Both have since been released, according to the Courant. The appeals court ruled Friday that Nardozzi’s suit can proceed even though the city had paid him to settle a previous lawsuit after he was fired by Ganim in 2016. The case could go to trial later this year.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State lawmakers have introduced bipartisan legislation that would put state law enforcement officials in charge of background checks for gun purchases. A bill filed Friday would resurrect Delaware’s Firearm Transaction Approval Program, which was eliminated more than a decade ago when lawmakers voted to rely on the federal government’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. That vote came amid concerns then that Delaware’s background check system was not providing the federal NICS with information about mentally ill individuals prohibited from buying or possessing firearms. The bill authorized state agencies to provide such information to NICS, created a federally mandated program allowing individuals previously deemed mentally ill to reestablish eligibility for gun ownership, and abolished the state’s existing background check system. Lawmakers now want to return responsibility for firearm transactions background checks in Delaware to the State Bureau of Identification. The SBI would be the point of contact between gun dealers and the federal databases checked by the FBI. The SBI would thus become responsible for determining whether a person is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm and would be able to search other databases other than NICS in making that determination.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In 100 years, if nothing is done, the historic Tidal Basin may be underwater, WUSA-TV reports. In 500, the Jefferson Memorial will be accessible only by boat. A combination of rising waters and a sinking human-made Tidal Basin puts the entire area – cherry blossoms, memorials, walking paths – at risk. But it’s not inevitable. The Trust for the National Mall and the National Trust for Historic Preservation have teamed up to create the Tidal Basin Ideas Lab, an initiative to plan out what the reservoir could become in the next century. It was once just a part of the Potomac River, but after the great flood of 1881, city planners got to work dredging up the river and Washington Channel to build the Tidal Basin. Teresa Durkin, executive vice president for the Trust for the National Mall, said the gates that engineers installed to control the water flow are no longer doing their job. “The gates have actually silted shut. So the water keeps coming through, but with it, it’s bringing all this silt and debris. So over time, it literally cannot open and close anymore. It doesn’t function as it was designed to,” Durkin said. “A lot of that sediment, because it’s not flushing out of the out gates, is also settling in the Tidal Basin itself. So it has likely raised the water.”\n\nFlorida\n\nVero Beach: A food truck exploded during a seafood festival Saturday, sending one person to the hospital with severe burns, according to authorities. The Vero Beach police said state and local fire officials are investigating the cause of the explosion. The department posted photos of the scene on Facebook that showed the sides and roof of the truck blown off the vehicle. One person was flown to a hospital burn unit in Orlando. There were no other injuries, and the festival continued as authorities secured the scene of the explosion, police said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group of voters who challenged U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s eligibility to run for reelection said Monday that they have filed an appeal of the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that she can appear on the ballot. The five voters from Greene’s district in March filed a complaint with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger alleging that the Republican congresswoman played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. They argued that puts her in violation of a seldom-invoked part of the 14th Amendment having to do with insurrection and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Georgia Administrative Law Judge Charles Beaudrot last month held a daylong hearing that included arguments from lawyers for the voters and for Greene, as well as extensive questioning of Greene herself. He then sent his decision to Raffensperger on May 6. Beaudrot found that the voters hadn’t produced sufficient evidence to back their claims. Raffensperger affirmed that decision, writing that whether Greene’s political statements and actions disqualify her from office “is rightfully a question for the voters of Georgia’s 14th Congressional District.” Under state law, the voters are allowed to appeal that decision in Fulton County Superior Court.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines is exploring electric aircraft technology with an eye toward using the vehicles for interisland travel, Hawaii News Now reports. A Boston-based company called REGENT is designing “seagliders” that would each carry up to 100 people. Hawaiian hasn’t committed to purchasing any of the aircraft but is exploring the possibility. A news release from REGENT said Hawaiian agreed to strategically invest to support the initial design of the company’s next-generation seaglider. Hawaiian is the first airline to partner with the company, which hopes to have its Monarch seagliders in the air by 2028. “We look forward to working with REGENT to explore the technology and infrastructure needed to fulfill our vision for convenient, comfortable and environmentally sustainable interisland transportation,” said Avi Mannis, chief marketing and communications officer at Hawaiian Airlines. REGENT’s seagliders fly through the air close to the water’s surface. The company said the aircraft will service routes up to 180 miles with existing battery technology and routes up to 500 miles with next-generation batteries. The company said the seagliders will move at the speed of an airplane but have the operating cost of boats and will use existing dock infrastructure.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials have agreed to a $119 million settlement with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and three major distributors over their role in the opioid addiction crisis. Republican Gov. Brad Little and Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said in an announcement Friday that it’s the second-largest consumer settlement in state history, trailing only the 1998 national tobacco settlement. An Ada County judge on Wednesday approved the settlement that includes all 44 Idaho counties, 24 cities and the state’s seven health districts. The money will address damage wrought by opioids, which the federal government declared a public health emergency in 2017. Johnson & Johnson and the three distributors agreed to a national $26 billion settlement in February. “Idaho has made significant strides in recent years in combatting the opioid crisis, and the culmination of our legal action against opioid manufacturers – led by Attorney General Wasden and his team – now offers additional resources,” Little said in a statement. Wasden is continuing legal action against other opioid makers as well as the Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma. “This settlement holds some of those most responsible for the opioid crisis accountable and provides significant funding for treatment, recovery and prevention in Idaho,” he said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot tightened a citywide curfew for young people Monday, a day after she restricted access by unaccompanied minors to downtown’s Millennium Park following the weekend shooting death of a 16-year-old boy near “The Bean” sculpture at the park. The citywide weekend curfew for minors now will begin each night at 10 p.m., instead of the 11 p.m. curfew in place since the 1990s, Lightfoot said. At Millennium Park, which is a popular stop for tourists and Chicago residents, minors will not be allowed in the park after 6 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays without an adult. “We need to make sure they are safe and importantly that our young people understand and respect basic community norms, respect for themselves, respect for each other, and we must ensure that every one of our residents and visitors – no matter who they are or where they come from or how old they are – are able to safely enjoy our public spaces,” the mayor said at a news conference. Lightfoot said she hoped and expected that people would abide by the restrictions and that it would not lead to widespread arrests. She said officials “don’t want to arrest children,” but those who break the law will be.\n\nIndiana\n\nNoblesville: A tiny community garden that provided 1,500 pounds of free food over five years to people in need was bulldozed by city crews after a nuisance call about overgrown grass. City officials said the lease with the nonprofit that managed the garden expired more than a year ago, and there was no sign that the land had been maintained since. The overgrown six parcels next to Southside Park posed a safety risk, officials said. Garden caretakers said they were in talks with the city about entering a new contract and weren’t given a warning the plot would be flattened and its furniture removed. Hidden underneath the pollinators and overgrowth were viable shrubs and plants, said Renee Rule, coordinator of the garden since its founding. The plot is messy when it’s not growing season but was a little more scraggly this year because bad weather had delayed volunteers who were to prepare it for planting, Rule said. “I wish they would have given us a call, and we could have saved some of the plants,” Rule said. The garden has provided free tomatoes, green beans, zucchini, onions and lettuces to neighborhood families and served as an instructional farm for college students and Girl Scouts alike. Families rented plots so they could grow vegetables to eat. Schoolchildren were given pumpkins in the fall. A beekeeper gave demonstrations at a beehive.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: School districts across the state are up against a federal deadline that will end a pandemic-era free meals program for students next month. While many school officials are waiting to see if federal or state lawmakers will extend the program, at least one district, Des Moines Public Schools, is working to continue offering most of its students free meals next school year. Students have faced repeated upheavals since March 2020, when schools across the country closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to help districts feed students during the health crisis – whether they were at school or home – the U.S. Department of Agriculture temporarily relaxed rules that tied who received free lunch to family income and neighborhood poverty levels. As the June 30 deadline draws near, school district officials and school nutrition advocates are asking state and federal lawmakers to intervene by either extending the relaxed rules or offering free meals to all students permanently. If no legislation is passed, students who qualify for free or reduced-price meals will still receive those services. Educators and advocates stress that studies show students do better academically when they are not hungry. School meals reduce both hunger and anxiety about it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A federal judge is blocking a public school’s policy preventing teachers from outing transgender students to their parents after a teacher raised religious objections. Fort Riley Middle School math teacher Pamela Ricard sued USD 475 Geary County Schools over LGBTQ anti-discrimination policies that conflicted with her Christian beliefs. District Judge Holly Teeter issued a preliminary injunction Monday blocking the school from disciplining Ricard if she reveals preferred names and pronouns of her transgender students when communicating with their parents. “The Court relies on Plaintiff’s statements that she does not intend to communicate with a parent for the sole purpose of disclosing a student’s preferred name and pronouns,” Teeter wrote. Ricard has two transgender students in her class, the judge wrote, neither of whom has authorized the district to disclose a preferred name and pronouns to parents. While Ricard uses their preferred names in class and avoids pronouns, she has emailed parents using a student’s legal name and biological pronouns. “Plaintiff believes that addressing students one way at school and a different way when speaking to their parents is dishonest,” the opinion said. “Being dishonest violates her sincere religious beliefs.” Teeter was appointed by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: A judge entered a not guilty plea Monday for a man accused of fatally shooting the daughter of a former state lawmaker during a home invasion. Shannon Gilday, 23, appeared in Madison Circuit Court for a continued arraignment on charges of murder, attempted murder, assault, burglary and criminal mischief, news outlets report. His attorney tried to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill on his behalf last week, but the prosecution argued against it, and the judge continued the hearing. Meanwhile, prosecutors filed a notice of aggravating circumstances seeking enhanced penalties upon a conviction, which stopped defense attorney Tom Griffiths from trying to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill, news outlets report. Gilday allegedly broke into a multimillion-dollar Madison County home owned by former lawmaker C. Wesley Morgan and shot Jordan Morgan while she was asleep, according to court records and statements from Morgan. Gilday also exchanged shots with Morgan during the Feb. 22 break-in. State police investigators said Gilday told them he was determined to get access to a bunker in the home. He was arrested in Madison County about a week after the shooting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Child drownings are on the rise in Louisiana, according to the state Department of Health, which says inability to swim, lack of supervision, and unfenced pools, spas and water bodies are top causes of drownings among babies and children under 15 years old. “As temperatures heat up and families return to water activities, it is important for parents and families to stay aware of the precautions they can take to prevent child drownings,” the department said in a news release. The agency said the number of drownings among children had fallen steadily for years, from 26 in 2015 and 2016 to 15 in 2019. But the total rose 60% in 2020, to 24. And preliminary data indicates that last year’s total was 25, it said. The department’s most recent Louisiana Child Death Review Report, covering 2017 through 2019, found that an average of 17 children drowned each year. That made drowning the No. 3 cause of injury-related death in children up through age 14, behind vehicle crashes and homicide. It found that 96% of them could not swim, 72% were unsupervised, and 54% died in water that hadn’t been fenced off. It found that 60% drowned in a pool, hot tub or spa. Looking at all drownings including adults, Louisiana had the nation’s third-highest rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposed order from the state’s Board of Environmental Protection would let stand a permit issued for a $1 billion electric transmission corridor to serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower. The draft order was written by environmental agency staff ahead of a hearing this week that was postponed because of COVID-19 illnesses. The board was supposed to meet Tuesday to decide whether to hold a public hearing or to begin deliberations the following day. The permit was suspended by Maine Environmental Commissioner Melanie Loyzim after voters rebuked the project in a statewide referendum. Because the permit was not permanently revoked, the Board of Environmental Protection was required to issue a final decision on consolidated appeals. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court, meanwhile, is weighing a lawsuit aimed at overturning the referendum on constitutional grounds, as well questions about the legality of a state lease for a small portion of land. Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the New England Clean Energy Connect would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower – enough electricity for 1 million homes – to the regional power grid. Supporters say bold projects are necessary to battle climate change. Critics say the benefits are overstated, and it would destroy woodlands.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he has suffered a minor stroke and is being treated at George Washington University Hospital. The Maryland Democrat said he has been told there are no long-term effects or damage. In a statement Sunday night, Van Hollen said he has been advised by doctors to remain under observation at the Washington, D.C., hospital for a few days out of an abundance of caution. Van Hollen, 63, was elected to the Senate in 2016 after serving seven terms in the U.S. House. The senator said he experienced lightheadedness and acute neck pain while delivering a speech in western Maryland. On the advice of a physician, he sought medical attention upon his return home. An angiogram indicated a minor stroke in the form of a small venous tear at the back of his head, Van Hollen said. “I look forward to returning to work in the Senate later this week and thank the medical team for their excellent care,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Chelsea Millsap, 32, who can trace her ancestry to the Pilgrims, is the first woman named sexton in the nearly 300-year history of Boston’s Old North Church. The critical job involves caring for and maintaining the parish buildings and equipment, including an 18th-century clock, the 75-piece chandeliers and the crypt where more than 1,100 people have been laid to rest. One of her first tasks will be managing a major renovation and restoration of the crypt. The church, still home to an active Episcopal congregation, is famous as the place where in 1775, two lanterns in the steeple signaled British soldiers were heading to Concord and Lexington, sending Paul Revere on the ride that sparked the American Revolution. One of the people who hung the lanterns was Robert Newman, the sexton at that time. “What an incredible opportunity to be able to sit in the very same pew as Robert Newman and in a world that is so divided to work in a place that welcomes all people from Bostonians to world dignitaries, like the Queen,” Millsap, a Detroit native and former firefighter with experience in fire prevention, security technology and project management, said in a statement. “I could have been the one to hang the lanterns 247 years ago. It is such an honor to show women that they too can hold these sorts of jobs.” Millsap is a descendant of teenage Mayflower passenger Mary Chilton, buried at nearby King’s Chapel.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A man walking on a footbridge to a Detroit Tigers game said he fell 15 feet to the ground when part of the concrete collapsed. Ely Hydes said the incident occurred May 9, but the bridge still was open until the Detroit News reached out to the state Transportation Department on Sunday. The Spruce Street pedestrian bridge is above M-10, also known as the Lodge Freeway. Hydes said he was walking to Comerica Park with a friend when “the bridge just collapsed under my feet.” “I remember thinking, ‘I hope I’m not over the freeway.’ I landed about 6 feet from the traffic. … After I hit the ground, I got the wind knocked out of me pretty good,” Hydes, 36, told the newspaper. He informed police, then resumed his walk to the Tigers game, a 2-0 loss to Oakland. Hydes went to a hospital a few days later. “I’m a giant walking bruise right now,” he said. The Transportation Department said it wasn’t aware of the hole in the bridge until notified by the newspaper. “The Spruce pedestrian bridge was built in 1953, and based on its age and condition, it is on a yearly detailed bridge inspection that is due this month,” spokeswoman Diane Cross said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLutsen: Communities in northeastern Minnesota are preparing to deal with more flooding and are calling for volunteers to help with sandbagging. Near Voyageurs National Park, most docks are underwater at area lakes, and some 200 homes and resorts are at risk. Kabetogama Township Supervisor John Stegmeir said his area is bracing for a record-breaking flood. Stegmeir said more volunteers are needed, especially since the average age of volunteers sandbagging right now is 65. The volunteers, along with some staff from Voyageurs National Park, have been working since last Tuesday, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “I think we’ve filled 8,000 bags this week, which isn’t big when you talk about the flooding on the Red River – they’re talking millions of bags – No. 1, we couldn’t do that, and the people who have been coming out to bag are older, you know,” he said. Volunteers are asked to check in at the town hall and to bring a shovel if possible. A flood warning is in effect for many communities in the Rainy River Basin of far northern Minnesota. In Cook County, the owner of Lutsen Resort on Lake Superior is hoping the iconic bridges on the property can be saved. Recent high water levels sent debris rushing down the Poplar River, damaging the bridges.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has revised its landlord-tenant law to give renters time to gather their belongings from a home before being forced to leave, after a federal judge ruled that the previous law was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills wrote in his Nov. 30 order that the old law was “unpredictable and absurd,” saying it went further than eviction laws in any other state. He wrote that it violated an occupant’s right to due process. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed the new law April 21, and it took effect immediately. It passed with broad bipartisan support. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the new law gives a tenant seven days to gather belongings and vacate a home after an eviction notice. An exception is made for emergencies. If the occupant does not leave during the initial order, a judge could issue a separate one authorizing law enforcement to remove a tenant. That would give the person another 72 hours to gather their belongings. The previous law allowed landlords to immediately seize and dispose of a delinquent occupant’s personal property. The impetus for his order was a lawsuit by Samantha Conner, a Columbus woman who sued her landlord after he took nearly everything she owned when she was evicted in 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The state has retained a dubious distinction for the 10th time, topping the Humane Society’s list of the worst puppy mill problem. In their annual list of worst dog breeders in the country, the advocacy group listed Missouri as having 26 of the most abusive puppy mills. Since the “Horrible Hundred” list was first published 10 years ago, Missouri has topped the list each year. This year the Show-Me State garnered 26 spots on the list, compared to just 17 in Iowa, 12 in New York, and seven each in Kansas and Wisconsin. That Missouri has so many puppy mills is no surprise, according to Humane Society Stop Puppy Mills campaign senior director John Goodwin. “Missouri has always been at the heart of the puppy mill industry since the beginning,” Goodwin said. “The post-World War II era was a time period where there was a lot of consolidation in agriculture, and a lot of small farms closed. This industry was seen as a solution in Midwestern states, and Missouri became the epicenter of large-scale puppy mills.” That evolution was aided by state regulations allowing the mills to flourish, Goodwin said. That would have changed in a 2010 proposition approved by voters that would have required large-scale breeders to provide “sufficient food, clean water, housing and space” to the dogs under their care, along with “necessary veterinary care; regular exercise and adequate rest between breeding cycles.” After the initiative was passed, the Legislature changed the language of the regulations.\n\nMontana\n\nCrow Agency: Little Big Horn College, a tribal college on the Crow Reservation, in partnership with the Crow Language Consortium, will host the 10th annual Crow Summer Institute on June6-24. The three-week program offers free Crow language and culture classes. Participants must be at least 18 years old, and registration is now open, according to a news release. The institute offers two options, one for beginners and one for intermediate learners. Learners will have access to resources developed by Crow elders, speakers and knowledge keepers, including textbooks, flashcards, dictionaries and multimedia apps. The Crow Summer Institute is offering $100 gas cards to some early registrants and Crow dictionaries for those who complete the program. Participants may also earn college credit through Little Big Horn College. Ishkoochìia Chiiakaamnáah (Jacob Brien), a Crow language learner who attended past Crow Summer Institutes, said the program helped him “realize different connections and patterns within the language.” “It really helped me understand Crow jokes and, by extension, Crow culture, which of course usually doesn’t translate, as many subtleties of the language don’t work in English,” he said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed by Terry Berry Jr.’s family against prison officials they argued were responsible for the 22-year-old’s death because they put him in the same cell as Patrick Schroeder, was dismissed last week after both sides agreed to the settlement. Berry was nearing parole on a sentence for forgery and assault when he was placed with Schroeder, who was serving a life sentence for killing a 75-year-old man and dumping his body in a well. The Lincoln Journal Star reports Schroeder later pleaded guilty to killing Berry and was sentenced to death. Berry’s family argued in the lawsuit that prison officials should have known there would be problems if they placed the two men together, and a caseworker at the prison even warned co-workers involved in the decision that Schroeder didn’t want a cellmate and wouldn’t likely tolerate Berry well because he was known to be “very talkative and bothersome.” Back in 2019, a federal judge dismissed the head of the state Department of Correctional Services and the prison’s warden as defendants, but the case had been allowed to move forward against several prison employees involved.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A proposed ballot initiative seeks to amend the state constitution to establish open top-five primaries and ranked-choice voting for general elections, though it isn’t without its critics. The Nevada Voters First political action committee is spearheading the initiative and must collect 140,777 signatures from registered Nevada voters by June 29 to qualify the measure for the 2022 general election ballot. Approval in November would call on the Legislature to institute the changes to the Nevada Constitution by July 1, 2025. In ranked-choice balloting, voters are directed to mark candidates in order of preference and to mark as many choices as they want. A voter may also choose only one candidate. The proposal would establish open primary elections, including all candidates regardless of party affiliation, squaring off in ranked-choice fashion. The top five finishers would advance to the general election, which would also be conducted using ranked-choice voting. About 30% of registered voters in Nevada list themselves as nonpartisan, and about 40% aren’t registered as Republican or Democrat, said Sondra Cosgrove, a representative with Nevada Voters First and a past president of the League of Women Voters of Nevada. “That’s a lot of people who are being shut out of important races,” she said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former Trump administration official running for Congress did not violate state law by voting twice during the 2016 primary election season, the New Hampshire attorney general’s office said Thursday without taking a position on whether federal law was broken. The Associated Press reported in April that Matt Mowers cast ballots in both the Feb. 9, 2016, New Hampshire presidential primary and the New Jersey primary four months later. Legal experts said Mowers could have a violated federal law that prohibits “voting more than once” in “any general, special, or primary election.” That includes casting a ballot in separate jurisdictions “for an election to the same candidacy or office.” Though the article did not allege violation of state law, the attorney general’s office investigated based on the report and complaints from voters. After reviewing Mowers’ voting history, rental and property records, driver’s license documents and other material, it concluded he did not violate New Hampshire’s law against double voting. Mowers is a leading candidate for the GOP nomination in the state’s 1st Congressional District, though New Hampshire has yet to complete its redistricting process and finalize the congressional map. He was the nominee in 2020 but lost to Democratic incumbent Rep. Chris Pappas.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The Ocean County Board of Commissioners plans this week to wade into the contentious debate over the state’s new health and sex education curriculum. While the five-member, all-Republican board has no legal authority to determine what is taught in schools, its bully pulpit is seen as influential in a county that is a bastion of conservatism in an otherwise progressive state. Commissioner Virginia E. Haines, who is also a Republican National Committee member, circulated a draft resolution among her colleagues last Wednesday to establish a “Parents’ Bill of Rights.” If approved as expected, the resolution would put the full weight of the county government behind a grassroots effort to establish such a bill of rights by providing political, administrative and legal support. The text of the draft resolution authorizes and directs the county commission director, the county administrator and county general counsel to organize parents, community leaders and unspecified professionals to develop the framework for such a document. The framework for such a declaration would then be used to marshal local school districts and county schools into adopting their own bills of rights.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s Asian American community is testing a new way to bolster security for Asian-owned businesses in the wake of two deadly shootings. KOAT-TV reports an Albuquerque startup is trying out an online service that connects armed security guards with Asian-owned businesses. Businesses would report suspicious activity to toServo. The service would utilize GPS-enabled mobile technology to put them in touch with a private security team, and the security on call would respond within minutes. It is part of an initiative established by the Asian Business Collaborative. The nonprofit started a Good Neighbor Program to check up on shops and restaurants. For now, four businesses will be chosen for the service. But there are hopes to expand its use by the end of the year. Collaborative organizers say the city’s Asian community has been on edge since shootings at two Asian-owned spas. In January, the female owner of one spa was shot and killed during an attempted robbery. Two men have been charged in her killing. Less than a month later, another woman of Asian descent was killed inside another massage business during a robbery. The suspect was killed in a police pursuit 10 days later.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City health officials issued an advisory Monday urging New Yorkers to wear masks in all indoor public settings as the city approaches “high risk” COVID-19 alert status. Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said everyone “regardless of vaccination status or past COVID-19 infection” should wear face coverings at all times in settings such as grocery stores, offices and building lobbies. People at high risk of severe illness from the virus, such as those over 65 years old, should avoid crowded settings and nonessential gatherings, he said. Vasan said he was issuing the guidance as the city approaches the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “high” level of COVID-19 alert, representing high community spread and increasing pressure on the health care system. New York City has been averaging about 3,600 reported new cases of COVID-19 per day over the past week – a number that is likely an undercount because it doesn’t include positive tests done at home. The daily case counts have been rising slowly since March but have leveled off somewhat recently. The CDC risk level for Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island is currently “medium,” while the Bronx is still “low.” But much of the surrounding metropolitan area has already moved into the CDC’s “high risk” category.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction in the shooting death of an endangered red wolf in North Carolina. The wolf was found in a muddy field in Tyrrell County on April 15, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The News & Observer reports it had been shot in the spine and collapsed in the mud – some of which was found in its lungs. Killing a red wolf is illegal, except under special circumstances. Red wolves once ranged across the Southeast, but after decades of habitat loss and killing by humans, they were nearly extinct by 1980. The Fish and Wildlife Service gathered up the remaining wild wolves and began a captive breeding program. The first captive wolves were reintroduced to the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina in 1987. By 2006, as many as 120 red wolves were thought to be living in the wild. Since then, wolf populations have declined again. Last year, the Biden administration abandoned a proposal made under President Donald Trump to scale back the areas where red wolves are protected and allow the killing of wolves found outside federal land.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Hoping to head off an explosion of electronic pull tab machines at gas stations and liquor, grocery and convenience stores, state regulators want to change the definition of a bar to make clear where the wildly popular Las Vegas-style games that mimic slot machines will be allowed. The state attorney general’s office, which oversees gambling in North Dakota, has identified a handful of gas stations and convenience stores that have begun selling and serving booze and are now “masquerading” as bars so that they can put the machines in their businesses, Attorney General Drew Wrigley said. Wrigley and Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator, said the idea for the rule change is to clarify and preserve what they believe the intent of the Legislature was when it defined a bar as a “retail alcoholic beverage establishment where alcoholic beverages are dispensed and consumed.” The amended language specifies that a bar does not include gas stations or liquor, grocery and convenience stores. A bar in a hotel, bowling alley or restaurant could still have the machines, under the new definition. The North Dakota Gaming Commission scheduled a Thursday meeting at the state Capitol to discuss the proposed changes and to take public comments.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state took the formal step of signaling interest in expanding Amtrak passenger rail in Ohio, though it is far from saying yes to the idea. Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the Ohio Rail Development Commission to work with Amtrak to study potential new routes, according to Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. The move was first reported by Cleveland.com. “It’s not to the point where we’re ready to go jump up and ‘yippee,’ but it’s significant, and we’re optimistic,” said Stu Nicholson with All Aboard Ohio, an advocacy group for rail. Amtrak wants to build a line connecting Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati. The company agreed to cover the cost of construction, track upgrades and operating costs for at least five years, then split the estimated $17 million to $20 million annual operating costs with the state. The roughly $100 million cost to build the line would come from a massive infrastructure package Congress passed into law. The approach could better entice Ohio to expand rail given much of the upfront cost will be covered, advocates said. Nicholson said recent guidance allows the state to use other sources outside its general revenue, such as private grants, to go toward its share.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: New laws signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt will increase funding for local enforcement of the medical marijuana industry and target illicit sales of cannabis. Each of the bills moved through the Legislature last week, and as a result county sheriffs are now able to receive grant funding to dedicate a full-time deputy to assist with compliance visits conducted by the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority. The intent of the law is to allow enforcement officers to help the medical marijuana authority in situations where licensed cannabis businesses are not willing to allow inspections of their property. According to the bill’s authors, compliance inspectors were denied access 181 times between April 2021 and February of this year. “This bill is not meant to threaten anyone. We just want to make sure our compliance inspectors can safely do their jobs,” said state Rep. David Hardin, R-Stilwell, the House author. “This is a very important piece of legislation that will help rein in illegal marijuana operations and give Oklahomans the safe, fair, free market for medical marijuana that they voted for in 2018.” Logistics of the bill create a revolving fund, provided by the medical marijuana authority, that sets aside an annual $5 million for county sheriffs to dedicate an officer for one year to the medical marijuana authority.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Criminal defendants who have gone without legal representation for long periods of time amid a critical shortage of public defense attorneys filed a lawsuit Monday that alleges the state violated their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial. The complaint, which seeks class-action status, was filed as state lawmakers and the Oregon Office of Public Defense Services struggle to address the huge shortage of public defenders statewide. The crisis has led to the dismissal of dozens of cases and left an estimated 500 defendants statewide – including several dozen in custody on serious felonies – without legal representation. Crime victims are also affected because cases are taking longer to reach resolution, a delay that experts say extends their trauma, weakens evidence and erodes confidence in the justice system, especially among low-income and minority groups. “There is a public defense crisis raging across this country,” said Jason D. Williamson, executive director of the Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law at New York University School of Law, who helped prepare the filing. “But Oregon is among only a handful of states that is now entirely depriving people of their constitutional right to counsel on a daily basis, leaving countless indigent defendants without access to an attorney for months at a time.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz is stepping up his criticism of far-right candidates gaining traction ahead of Tuesday’s primary election. After spending much of the campaign steering clear of fellow Republican Senate contender Kathy Barnette, Oz on Saturday said she was out of step with the GOP and would be unable to win the general election in November. In an interview, he took issue with a 2015 tweet from Barnette in which she wrote that “Pedophilia is a Cornerstone of Islam.” Oz, who would be the nation’s first Muslim senator, described the comments as “disqualifying.” “It’s reprehensible that she would tweet out something that is defamatory to an entire religion,” Oz told the Associated Press. “This state was based on religious freedom. I’m proud as a Pennsylvanian to uphold those founding beliefs that every faith has its merits.” The Barnette campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier in the week, Barnette told NBC News that she did not make the statement, which was still live on her Twitter feed Monday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A congressional candidate recently arrested on a menacing charge in another state has dropped out of the race. Michael Neary said in a statement Friday that he was seeking medical treatment for non-epileptic seizures following his arrest in Ohio in March. He said the decision followed “careful consultation and prayer.” Neary, 28, was among a large field of candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District following incumbent Democrat Jim Langevin’s announcement in January that he’s retiring. Neary has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of menacing by stalking March 23, as well as drug counts after marijuana and drug paraphernalia were allegedly found in his car. He’s previously said he’d remain in the race despite the charges. The Columbus, Ohio, resident, who grew up in Rhode Island, was stopped by police after another driver reported having been followed from Columbus to Troy, more than 60 miles away. Police said the driver reported that Neary’s car mimicked their every move, matching speed and lane changes and even stopping at a rest area after they did. Authorities said Neary told them he had recently returned from Rhode Island, was very stressed and had been focusing on the vehicle’s Ohio registration.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Grace Church has purchased a dormitory building from Greenville Technical College to convert into affordable housing as part of a special program to address the local housing crisis. The church will serve as the landlord for the property, and rent will be adjusted to fit families’ income. Rent prices will range from $450 for a single room to $1,000 for a three-bedroom unit. The goal, according to Grace Church’s care and recovery ministry director LeeAnne Cavin, is that the average family will pay in the $900 range for a unit. “We do have a crisis of housing,” Cavin said. “Our whole community is really starting to desire collaboration.” The units are expected to open for rent the first week of June, and the church already has almost 40 families ready to move in. The program will accept emergency housing vouchers through the Greenville Housing Authority but not Section 8 vouchers or extra subsidy from the federal government that goes directly toward rent. To sign a lease in one of the units, families agree to be a part of a Grace Church housing program that offers medical coverage, dental care, a savings matching program, mental health support, car maintenance, financial education, cooking classes, self-defense classes, and job and interview preparation.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The ongoing drought in South Dakota has been hard on the state’s wildlife. The U.S. Forest Service says the grouse population in the Fort Pierre National Grassland has declined by 15% in 2022, largely because of the dry conditions. The total grouse population has averaged about 300 since the mid-1980s. Over the past twenty years, both greater prairie chicken and sharp-tailed grouse populations have primarily remained stable or have grown. “The thing that I think was really damaging to us last year was we had record-high and record-dry conditions in early June, right when those birds started incubation or, for the earlier semester, to hatch. And, boy, that’s just so tough on a chick to thermoregulate and be able to find sufficient moisture,” District Ranger Dan Svingen said. Greater prairie chickens and sharp-tailed grouse both nest on the ground and require tall grass to hide their nests, the Capital Journal reports. Because they start laying eggs as early as April, before sufficient grass growth, they’re dependent on dead grass from the previous year as cover. However, the drought prevented extensive grass growth in 2021, leaving them more exposed to predators in 2022. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a little more than 76% of South Dakota is experiencing some kind of drought.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: In its quest to redefine tourism at the gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has inked a deal to bring an international entertainment company to the United States for the first time. Tribal Council and international theme park company Puy du Fou have signed a letter of intent to develop a new “spectacular immersive show” as part of a 200-acre development located at Exit 407 south of Interstate 40 on the way to the Smokies. The Tribal Council approved $75 million May 4 for phase one development of “The 407: Gateway to Adventure.” Its leaders are seeking world-class attractions to appeal to the record-breaking crowds flocking to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The 407 partners have estimated the development could attract 6.7 million visitors in the first year after phase one is complete. That’s expected sometime in 2024. “We are excited to take the first steps towards developing this world-class attraction that will help support our nation economically while creating a new platform to share dimensions of Cherokee history many have never heard,” said Chairman of the Tribal Council Richard French. Puy du Fou is known worldwide for its immersive experiences inspired by history.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Two people were killed and three more taken to a hospital with injuries after a shooting Sunday at a bustling flea market, authorities said. The shooting at the open-air market arose from an “altercation” that involved at least two guns and all five of the people, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. He said no “innocent bystanders” were injured. Investigators believe one of the people hospitalized was among those who opened fire, and two more suspected shooters were detained at the scene, a sheriff’s deputy told KTRK-TV. Thousands of people were shopping at the market 14 miles north of Houston’s downtown when the shooting began around 1 p.m. Sunday, Gonzalez said on Twitter. The sheriff said multiple shots were fired, and deputies recovered two pistols from the scene. Authorities did not immediately provide further information about what led to the shooting but said all the people involved were men in there 20s who appeared to know each other.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A copper mining company will begin manufacturing a rare mineral used in solar panels that used to be discarded along with the other mine tailings. Rio Tinto officials and Gov. Spencer Cox unveiled the plan Wednesday at the Kennecott refinery west of Salt Lake City where the tellurium will be produced, FOX-13 news reports. The company says it is one of two in the U.S. to produce tellurium, which is listed as a “critical mineral” by the U.S. government. Most of the tellurium produced comes from China and other countries. Rio Tinto is working with the U.S. Department of Energy on ideas to produce more tellurium. The company said it hopes to produce 20 tons of the tellurium each year. “If we can produce it here, we are all going to be better off,” said Cox, a Republican. “We desperately need more of it.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott signed legislation into law Monday that creates an advisory committee to make recommendations on how to spend the state’s share of settlement money with drug manufacturers and distribution companies over the toll of prescription opioids. The number of opioid-related overdose deaths in Vermont jumped 33% in 2021 to a record 210 fatalities, the Vermont Health Department reported last month. The committee will be made up of the state’s health commissioner; a member each from the state Senate and House; health care providers; two people who lived through the experience of opioid use disorder; an assistant judge; and representatives from municipalities. Each year, the committee will make recommendations to the Vermont Department of Health and legislative committees for expenditures from a special opioid abatement fund. The health commissioner is expected to call the first meeting of the panel to occur on or before June 30.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A professor whose research on pedophilia created a stir at Old Dominion University has landed a new job with Johns Hopkins University’s Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse. Allyn Walker stepped down from ODU in November after using the phrase “minor-attracted person” instead of “pedophile” in research, leading to an outcry on campus and social media, as well as threats of violence. The Virginian-Pilot reports the Moore Center announced last week that Walker, who uses the pronoun they, would be joining the center as a postdoctoral fellow. The center said in a series of tweets that it was excited to welcome Walker and that they would be working on research and new projects to develop a “comprehensive public health approach to addressing child sexual abuse and effective prevention programs.” On its website, the center says it works “to change the way the world thinks about child sexual abuse, from inevitable to preventable.” In the series of tweets, the center referred to Walker as “a leader in the field of perpetration prevention research.” Walker was an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice before more than 15,500 people signed an online petition calling for their removal from ODU in the fall. That came after a controversial interview about “A Long, Dark Shadow: Minor-Attracted People and Their Pursuit of Dignity,” a book focused on people who do not act on their sexual attraction to children and strategies to prevent them from acting on the attraction.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amtrak will postpone restoring its Cascades passenger-train service between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., until possibly December because of a lack of personnel. The service gap occurred despite the Biden administration’s much-hyped $66 billion allotted in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to catch up on maintenance and spread Amtrak’s national railway service to new cities, The Seattle Times reports. Janet Matkin, rail spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Transportation, said transportation officials in the state hoped the trains would roll again by summer or even late spring. Amtrak doesn’t have enough conductors, mechanics and onboard service staff yet to operate the trains, though new classes of conductors are in training, according to a letter to Washington and Oregon rail directors from Ray Lang, an Amtrak vice president. Pre-pandemic, about 159,000 people per year rode between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., or 290,000 when including stations between the cities, Matkin said. Passenger fares traditionally cover about two-thirds of operation costs, while states cover the rest.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWelch: Gov. Jim Justice visited the site of a planned $147 million highway project that will connect Welch to the Coalfields Expressway. The 5-mile stretch of highway is expected to be completed in 2026. “This announcement today means we are one step closer to bringing this area of West Virginia to the world once and for all,” Justice said in a media release. “We have waited and waited in southern West Virginia for way too long.” Justice announced Friday that Bizzack Construction of Lexington, Kentucky, won the bid to build the new highway. The governor’s office said plans are in the works to build a 5-mile stretch of the Coalfields Expressway from Mullens to Twin Falls State Park and a 3-mile link from Twin Falls toward Pineville. The four-lane Coalfields Expressway that runs from Raleigh County to Wyoming County opened in 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSparta: The popular Elroy-Sparta State Trail officially reopened over the weekend following several years of flood-related repairs. Summer flood damage in 2018 closed the 32-mile-long trail which had about 60,000 visitors a year. The state Department of Natural Resources said the western Wisconsin trail needed two complete bridge replacements and landslide repairs, among other work. According to the DNR, $2.3 million needed for repairs came from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the state. State Sen. Howard Marklein, of Spring Green, and state Rep. Tony Kurtz, of Wonewoc, spearheaded efforts in the Legislature to secure funds for the trail’s repairs, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “The easy part was the funding,” the DNR’s Missy VanLanduyt said. “The more difficult part was just the sheer amount of infrastructure that needed to be replaced, and designing all of that, and then going through the bidding process and then finally a very long construction period as well.” While repair work is largely complete, a 1-mile section of the trail was closed as of Friday because of bridge safety concerns. VanLanduyt said it’s set to reopen after Memorial Day weekend, with a permanent bridge replacement coming in late 2023 or early 2024.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis apologized Monday after getting booed and heckled for remarks she made on sexual identity during a University of Wyoming graduation speech. A first-term Republican from deep-red Wyoming, Lummis said in Saturday’s speech in Laramie that human rights are derived from God but that government seeks to redefine many of them. “Even fundamental, scientific truths such as the existence of two sexes, male and female, are subject to challenge these days,” Lummis said. She paused and smiled while many in the crowd responded with boos and heckling. “And I challenge those of you,” she said, without completing that thought, saying: “I’m not making a comment on the fact that there are people who transition between sexes.” Lummis is a former congresswoman, state treasurer and University of Wyoming graduate who’s been prominent in Wyoming politics for decades. Until now, at least, she has been less outspoken than many Republicans who’ve made a major issue of gender and sex identity.

Leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and bars, the sector hit hardest by COVID-19, led the job gains with 96,000. Professional and business services added 89,000 jobs; health care, 70,000; construction, 32,000; manufacturing, 30,000; and retail, 22,000 jobs.\n\nFederal, state and local governments added 57,000 jobs.\n\nThe employment recovery, however, masks divergent narratives for the public and private sectors. While businesses recouped all jobs lost in June and are now 629,000 positions above the pre-COVID-19 level, government is still nearly 600,000 jobs below that benchmark.\n\nThat’s mostly because state and local governments haven’t been able to provide the pay increases, remote work options and flexible hours offered by the private sector since the pandemic began in spring 2020.\n\nIn addition to July's robust payroll gains, average hourly earnings rose 15 cents to $32.27, pushing the annual increase from 5.1% to 5.2% and threatening to intensify inflation pressures.\n\nAnd the portion of Americans working or looking for jobs fell from 62.2% to 62.1%, well below the pre-pandemic level of 63.4%. That share had been rising as workers returned to a favorable labor market after caring for children or staying idle because of COVID-19 fears. But it has broadly edged down after hitting a peak in March, suggesting widespread labor shortages could persist and push pay increases higher.\n\nOverall, the blockbuster report increases the odds that the Fed will raise its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage for a third straight meeting in mid-September to fight soaring inflation, says economist Michael Pearce of Capital Economics.\n\nInflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June. The higher prices and borrowing costs have led consumers and businesses to slow spending and have stoked recession fears.\n\nThe labor market, however, remarkably has shrugged off the inflation spike, rising interest rates and an economy that has contracted for two straight quarters, adding an average 437,000 jobs a month since May. Because of the labor shortages, companies have been hesitant to let workers go and continue to add staffers to meet the demands of a reopening economy.\n\nJason Scott plans to bring on about 25 new employees this year at 120VC, his company that manages projects for businesses, and three at Brick & Matter, his marketing firm.

Plus, he says, the recent flurry of layoffs have provided him a fresh pool of talented employees.\n\n“I’m going to roll the dice,” he says.\n\nThere are signs the job market could soon soften. Last week, initial jobless claims, a gauge of layoffs, rose to the highest level since November based on a four-week moving average. Tech giants such as Oracle, Amazon, Netflix and Robinhood have announced significant job cuts recently. And job openings fell to a still-strong 10.7 million in June from a near-record 11.3 million the previous month.\n\nAlso, payroll growth is expected to downshift now that the U.S. has recouped all 22 million jobs lost in the health crisis.\n\nSome employers are dialing back their hiring plans.\n\nMichael Hobbs, president of Chicago-based PahRoo Appraisal & Consultancy, had planned to add about 20 employees this year.

Johnson\n\nIn the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic, uncertainty ruled the day for Wisconsin businesses and workers. Even as vaccines were becoming widely available in the spring of last year, Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. Secretary Missy Hughes worried about the fate of the state’s many small businesses, especially those with fewer than 20 employees.\n\n“We’re potentially looking at losing 20 to 30 percent of these small businesses,” she warned during a virtual event with Marquette University Law School in March of 2021.\n\nToday, it appears that worst-case scenario didn’t materialize. In a recent interview with us, Hughes cited several encouraging signs, including a 42% increase in new businesses formed during the pandemic. A torrent of state and federal aid — WEDC alone gave grants of $600 million to small businesses — combined with the grit and creativity of owners and workers averted an economic catastrophe. While the virus remains a concern, the greatest challenges facing most businesses right now are workforce shortages and inflation.\n\nMilwaukee is on the mend, but with a ways to go\n\nHas the economy fully recovered, or have we settled into a kind of new normal? More specifically, how is the economy of the state’s largest city and most populous county, Milwaukee, faring more than two years after the start of the pandemic? With two-thirds of the metropolitan area’s approximately 1.5 million residents living in Milwaukee County, its performance remains central to the region’s economic vitality.\n\nMore:Milwaukee businesses held on better than expected during pandemic, but the 'new normal' remains a challenge\n\nNew analysis done as part of the Milwaukee Area Project at Marquette University Law School’s Lubar Center shows an economy on the mend, but not yet fully recovered from the pandemic’s fallout. Among our findings:\n\n• There does not appear to be a mass exodus from the labor force in the city of Milwaukee, but unemployment remains higher than it was before the pandemic.\n\n• Milwaukee County saw the number of business establishments actually increase from 2019 to 2021, but the number of employees across nearly all major sectors of the economy was down from two years ago.\n\n• Employment in some industries declined in 2020 but began to rebound in 2021. Others declined two years in a row, suggesting longer-lasting changes to the local economy.\n\n• Employment in some of the county’s best-paying sectors had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. That includes manufacturing and the professional and business service sectors.\n\n• As expected, the leisure and hospitality industry was hardest hit by the pandemic. Employment declined by 31% from 2019 to 2020. The sector has recovered somewhat, but employment remains well below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n• While restaurant employment fell, the total number of restaurants in the city of Milwaukee grew in 2021, a phenomenon fueled by strong growth among caterers and food trucks.\n\n• Businesses, non-profits, local governments, and individuals in Milwaukee County benefited greatly from the federal government’s financial assistance during the pandemic. For example, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) sent $2.3 billion to employers across the county and $1.9 billion of that amount went to entities in Milwaukee.\n\nLet’s look at the employment picture first.\n\nMilwaukee unemployment rate is still relatively high\n\nSince the Great Recession, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate has consistently been slightly lower than the national rate. But for decades, Milwaukee’s unemployment rate has been consistently higher than both the state’s and the nation’s. Far from changing this basic dynamic, the economic recovery appears to have exacerbated the gap between Milwaukee and the rest.\n\nIn May of 2019, prior to the pandemic, U.S. unemployment was 3.4%. It was 3.1% in Wisconsin and 4.2% in Milwaukee.\n\nUnemployment spiked for all three in 2020, as the pandemic took hold and governments took steps to address a public health emergency. In April of 2020, unemployment stood at 14.4% nationally, 14.1% in Wisconsin, and 16.7% in Milwaukee.\n\nBut by May of this year, the U.S. and Wisconsin unemployment rates had returned, or even improved on, pre-pandemic levels. Not so for Milwaukee. Its 4.9% unemployment rate was nearly a full percentage point higher than May of 2019.\n\nTo count as unemployed, people must be looking for work. People who have left the workforce entirely don’t factor into the unemployment rate. But our analysis does not suggest a mass exodus from the labor force. In fact, the city of Milwaukee’s labor force in May of this year was 273,000, slightly higher than in 2019.\n\nThe number of unemployed people in Milwaukee was estimated to be 13,300 in May of this year. That’s down from 20,000 in May of 2021, but still higher than any other year since 2016.\n\nOne striking finding of our analysis was that almost none of the sectors in the Milwaukee County economy had fully recovered from the pandemic. The best source for employment data by sector is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Because these reports have a six-month lag time, they do not capture the most recent changes in employment. But they do give us our best and most reliable sense of which parts of the local job market are growing and shrinking. The numbers are only available on the county level, and we only discuss private-sector workers — leaving aside government employment.\n\nLeisure hospitality workers hit hard\n\nNot surprisingly, the leisure and hospitality industry was hammered by the pandemic. Employment fell from 48,000 to 33,000 in the first year of the pandemic. As of December 2021, employment had only partially recovered to 42,000.\n\nRestaurant employees were hit especially hard. In the first year of the pandemic, full-service restaurants shed 33% of their workforce, nearly 4,900 workers. By December of 2021, just under 2,600 had been added back.\n\nLikewise, food service contractors lost about half their jobs in 2020, with only about half of that recovered in 2021.\n\nHigher paying occupations also struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels. The manufacturing sector in Milwaukee County saw employment decline by 4,000 in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, and 2021 showed a modest recovery of 700 workers.\n\nIn recent years, we have written about one of the bright spots in the Milwaukee economy, the growth of employment in the “management of companies and enterprises” sector in the last 20 years. New data suggests the pandemic may have interrupted or even halted that trend. During the first year of the pandemic, the number of employees in this industry fell by more than 1,000. The industry lost 400 more in 2021. Since these are generally prestigious, desirable, high-paying jobs, it raises the possibility that some of these positions are leaving Milwaukee entirely.\n\nOther continued employment declines in 2021 may reflect a tight labor market for certain kinds of workers, not a lack of open positions. For instance, employment in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and home health care all fell in both 2020 and 2021.\n\nAs the pandemic forced Americans to change their shopping habits, employment in a few industries increased. The most dramatic example can be found in the general warehousing and storage industry. Employment has more than doubled since 2019, gaining over 2,500 jobs. The number of employees working in construction by the end of 2021 also grew, slightly exceeding its 2019 benchmark.\n\nNumber of business establishments is up\n\nEmployment is one way to measure the recovery from the pandemic. Another is looking at the number of business establishments, or workplaces. Perhaps counterintuitively, the number of establishments grew while employment fell.\n\nSometimes, this reflects changes in where people worked. The federal Department of Health and Human Services used pandemic relief funding to encourage growth in home-based care for the elderly and disabled. Similarly, the number of child day care establishments grew even while employment in these places fell. Possibly, this reflects a growing preference for smaller providers.\n\nOther cases of substantial establishment growth were among professionals and skilled trades, often related to shipping or housing, including marketing consultants, real estate agents, truckers, home remodelers, insurance agents, landscapers, and drywall contractors.\n\nStarting a business during a pandemic takes a lot of planning, and a leap of faith. But some entrepreneurs did just that in 2020 and 2021, even in the kinds of service sector industries most disrupted by the pandemic. With the help of the Milwaukee City Clerk’s office, we created a unique dataset by matching business license recipients for tavern, restaurant and grocery activities in the city.\n\nAfter a decline in 2020, most of those businesses showed a strong recovery in 2021. Compared to 2019, there were 6% more restaurants at the end of 2021. That was driven by strong growth among caterers and mobile food trucks. These two categories grew 47% since the pandemic began.\n\nThe ranks of large grocery stores were largely unaffected by the pandemic.\n\nA few gas stations closed in 2020, but their numbers recovered in 2021.\n\nConvenience stores recovered incompletely in 2021, but the data suggests their decline may predate the pandemic.\n\nBars and coffeeshops have struggled. The number of taverns — drinking establishments that don’t serve anything more complicated than frozen pizza — fell in both 2020 and 2021.\n\nLikewise, a half-dozen coffeeshops closed in 2020, with no recovery in 2021.\n\nThe impact of Upstart Kitchen, Sherman Phoenix\n\nSome parts of the city, including the 1st aldermanic district on the far north and 2nd aldermanic district on the northwest sides, saw significant declines in licensed bars, coffee shops and restaurants. These areas were also hard hit by the housing crisis of the Great Recession.\n\nWith fewer people working in office towers and less street traffic, the 4th aldermanic district downtown also saw a decline in these kinds of licenses.\n\nMore:Upstart kitchen, in Sherman Park, has a line of entrepreneurs eager to start food businesses\n\nIn contrast, Milwaukee’s 14th district, home to the Bay View neighborhood, saw an increase in licenses for restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores.\n\nEven more entrepreneurial activity occurred in Milwaukee’s 7th aldermanic district during the last two years. Located on the north side and including the Sherman Park neighborhood, the 7th added 31 new licenses, the vast majority for new restaurants.\n\nDigging a little deeper, the 7th saw an increase of at least 14 catering businesses and five mobile restaurant bases (the kitchen associated with one or more food trucks).\n\nMore:A hub for Black entrepreneurs pushes for sustainable change\n\nMuch of this burst of entrepreneurial activity can be attributed to Upstart Kitchen, a food business incubator which offers commercial kitchen space to new businesses. The shared space at 43rd and Fond du Lac is located less than a mile from the Sherman Phoenix development, which has been another source of small business growth in the 7th district.\n\nBillions in federal dollars flow into the region\n\nAs we wrote this piece, we couldn’t help but wonder about the local impact of federal assistance received during the pandemic, an impact that can now be measured in the billions of dollars. Here are numbers from a few of the biggest aid programs. To help give a sense of scale, total wages paid by all nonfarm employers in Milwaukee County added up to $26.9 billion in 2019, $26.7 billion in 2020, and $28.3 billion in 2021.\n\nUsing census data to find the eligible population, we estimate that Milwaukee County residents received about $2.2 billion directly from the three pandemic-related stimulus checks. Expanded child tax credits in 2021 paid Milwaukee County families around $240 million in total.\n\nOur calculations suggest that the various temporary expansions of federal unemployment benefits added over $700 million to the checks of unemployed Milwaukee workers across the 1.6 million weekly claims made during the eligible months. Emergency rent relief in Milwaukee County totaled about $60 million through the first half of 2022.\n\nOther stimulus efforts supported the private sector. The largest was the Paycheck Protection Program, which allowed small businesses to apply for low-interest (often forgivable) loans that could be used to cover payroll costs, rent, interest, and utilities.\n\nData from the Small Business Administration indicates the PPP paid out $2.3 billion to Milwaukee County businesses and non-profits, of which $1.9 billion went to the city of Milwaukee. $1.7 billion of the citywide loans have been forgiven.\n\nThe majority of PPP loans made to Milwaukee businesses appears to have gone to individuals. Of the more than 25,000 loans made in Milwaukee, 55% went to either sole proprietorships, independent contractors, self-employed individuals, or single member LLCs.\n\nCollectively, these recipients got $222 million in loans, of which $143 million has been forgiven to date. This rate of loan forgiveness — 64% — is much less than the rates achieved by other kinds of borrowers. For example, the forgiveness rate for corporations is 96%.\n\nMost of those corporations obtained their loans with the help of well-known banks. In contrast, thousands of the loans to individuals were processed through less well-known financial institutions located in places like California, Arizona, and Florida. Some of these loan originators have forgiveness rates as low as 49%.\n\nThe role government played in responding to a deadly virus will be debated for some time. What can be said is that the worst fears of top state officials were not realized.\n\nIn Milwaukee County, two years after the pandemic began, most Milwaukee County businesses are still in business. In fact, there are more business establishments today than there were two years ago.\n\nBut that masks the other story revealed by the data: At the start of this year, nearly every major sector of the local economy had fewer total employees than before the pandemic began. In Milwaukee County, at least, the recovery remains a work in progress.\n\nMike Gousha is senior advisor in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School.

Google's parent company Alphabet recently laid off 12,000 workers, equivalent to 12% of its workforce. Meta cut an even bigger share of its staff. Even IBM, which has been in business for 111 years, is cutting thousands of jobs.\n\nSince the start of the year, 297 tech companies laid off nearly 95,000 workers, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, a website that's been tracking tech layoffs since March 2020. If that rate continues, the industry could cut more than 900,000 jobs in 2023. That's nearly six times the total for the industry in 2022, according to the site.\n\nBut the sky isn't exactly falling in the tech industry, or at least not yet.\n\nHere's why:\n\nTech jobs were growing before the pandemic\n\nBefore the pandemic, the tech industry was steadily growing. As investments in cybersecurity, cloud computing and artificial intelligence poured into companies, their need for employees grew.\n\nIn the five years leading up to the pandemic, the tech industry added 1.3 million workers, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by CompTIA, an information-technology trade group.\n\nTracking tech layoffs:Why companies like Amazon and Meta cut jobs in 2022\n\nWho decides who gets cut?:Layoffs in a likely recession this year could be determined by software programs\n\nThe earlier hiring wasn't as widely publicized as the hiring that occurred in 2021. That resulted in a \"perception issue that there was so much more demand during the past two years compared to previously,\" said Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA.\n\nThe perception that tech hired an unprecedented level of workers also may have misled people to believe that recent layoffs were heftier.\n\nThe pandemic forced companies to layoff workers\n\nWhen COVID-19 swept across the country, consumers quickly tightened their purse strings, resulting in massive job losses.\n\nAnd even though demand for tech workers was strong leading up to the pandemic, like almost every industry, tech was not immune to layoffs during the crisis. In August 2020 tech unemployment peaked at 4.6% while the nation's overall unemployment rate was 8.4%.\n\n'I was too ambitious':Spotify CEO announces layoffs among 6% of employees as tech job cuts continue\n\n‘A huge windfall’:Automakers look to hire tech talent from job cuts in Silicon Valley\n\nTech goes on a hiring spree as economic conditions improve\n\nEconomic conditions improved in the fall of 2020, much faster than tech companies anticipated. Demand for electronics like computers, gaming systems and smartphones exploded as the government issued stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits.\n\nBut to get products to consumers, tech companies had to navigate broken supply chains and transform themselves into more e-commerce-driven businesses.\n\nTo succeed and seize the opportunity to profit from unprecedented demand, tech companies needed more manpower and they needed it immediately, said Herbert.\n\nTo meet the unprecedented demand tech went on a hiring spree.\n\nWhy are there tech layoffs? Interest rates went up, eating into tech profits\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in March 2022 to get inflation under control, tech companies felt the pain because they're more reliant on outside funding than other industries. When interest rates increase, it’s more expensive for them to borrow money.\n\nMeanwhile, many consumers stopped buying electronics after they depleted their stimulus money. Tech stocks got crushed in the months after the Fed's March rate hike.\n\nThe companies that went on hiring sprees did a 180 degree turn and began cutting. Apple, though, which hired the least number of new workers among the other four big-tech companies, has avoided layoffs so far.\n\nWhile the layoffs are alarming, they represent a relatively small share of tech companies' workforces in 2022. And even with the layoffs, all five big-tech companies have bigger workforces now than before the pandemic.\n\nLaid-off tech workers are finding new jobs\n\nEven though tech layoffs are growing, the tech unemployment rate is dropping. In January the tech unemployment rate fell to 1.5% from 1.8% in December, according to CompTIA's analysis.\n\nThat indicates that \"many of the laid-off workers were quickly reabsorbed back into the tech workforce,\" said Herbert.\n\nThe hiring is most likely coming from small and mid-size companies that are still facing worker shortages because they couldn't previously compete with the salaries and perks traditional Silicon Valley tech companies used to lure in new talent, he added.\n\nRelative to the entire industry, big tech accounts for a relatively small share of the entire tech workforce. Small and mid-size companies make up the bulk of the industry. They, for the most part, are doing OK for now.\n\nBut the future is a big question mark.\n\n\"At some point, we probably should prepare to see some of these (tech) layoffs show up in the numbers,\" Herbert said.\n\nElisabeth Buchwald is a personal finance and markets correspondent for USA TODAY.

Now port congestion and delays are back and could be around for a while.\n\nCovid lockdowns in China have wreaked havoc at Shanghai, the world’s biggest container port, and are now causing problems at other major ports around the world.\n\nSome Chinese cities, including Shanghai, have started easing Covid restrictions in recent days, but experts say that the damage has already been done, and global shipping will suffer well into the summer. That could exert even more pressure on global supply chains already reeling from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and keep inflation running hot.\n\nData from Project44, which tracks global supply chains, showed that shipment delays between China and major US and European ports have quadrupled since late March, when China shut down the city of Shanghai, which has the world’s busiest container port.\n\nA Cosco Shipping container ship is seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Shanghai, China April 24, 2022. Str/Reuters\n\nBy the end of April, ships from China to Seattle were taking four days longer than expected to arrive, up from about one day the previous month.\n\nThe time it takes ships to leave China and arrive at major ports around the world increased steadily over the past year, but there had been some signs of relief since December with transit times between Shanghai and Long Beach, for example, dropping in January and February.\n\nSince March, however, there’s been a sharp increase again in transit times on that route.\n\nTo add to the problem, many truck drivers have struggled to reach ports in China to pick up containers because of travel restrictions and Covid testing requirements. Shipping giant Maersk warned in an advisory last month that trucking services in Shanghai would be “severely” impacted by these restrictions.\n\n“With the manufacturing industry being shuttered [in Shanghai] and truckers unable to travel quickly, exports have been reduced, and shipment delays have increased,” said Josh Brazil, director of Supply Chain Data Insights at Project44.\n\nDelays will “continue into the summer months,” as factories struggle to return to normal operations in Shanghai, he added.\n\nAlthough authorities have allowed some businesses to restart production, many workers are still stuck in quarantine at home. Factories that do reopen are facing component shortages and difficulty in securing trucks to carry goods into or out of the port.\n\n“The ripples in shipment delays are only beginning to become visible and are expected to extend well into the next few months,” said Brazil.\n\nShanghai — China’s leading financial center and most populous city — has been under a strict lockdown since late March. More than 8 million residents are still banned from leaving their residential compounds. The Covid restrictions have spread to other cities, including Beijing — the nation’s capital.\n\nShanghai port remained open throughout the lockdown, but data from various shipping firms show an increasing backlog of ships and containers.\n\nUS supply chain companies have expressed concerns about fresh chaos heading towards American ports, which are still recovering from the severe congestion and delays they suffered last year.\n\nShelley Simpson, chief commercial officer for JB Hunt Transport Services, said late last month that while there has been “a temporary relief” at US ports, things may get a lot “a lot worse” this summer because of what’s happening in China.\n\nIt “just takes a little bit of disruption to really change the environment all over again,” she added.\n\nShips and containers jam the ports\n\nShipping queues are getting worse in China — and other parts of the world.\n\nNearly 20% of container vessels globally are currently waiting outside congested ports, according to a survey published last Thursday by Windward, an Israel-based global maritime data firm.\n\nAlmost a quarter of those unberthed ships are stuck outside Chinese ports. That’s 412 ships, up 58% since February, the survey added.\n\nIt’s clear that lockdowns in China have caused a bottleneck, the firm said.\n\nAcross China, at least 27 cities are under full or partial lockdown, which could be impacting up to 185 million residents across the country, according to latest CNN calculation on Wednesday. Beijing effectively shut down its largest district this week.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping signaled this week that China would continue with its zero tolerance approach to Covid. On Thursday, Xi told all levels of government to “resolutely adhere to the zero-Covid policy.”\n\nChina is home to seven of the world’s top ten container ports, including Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. In Shanghai — the epicenter of China’s current Covid outbreak, the situation remains severe.\n\nThe number of vessels waiting at the Port of Shanghai had increased to 384 by April 25, up 27% from a month earlier, according to most recent data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nPressure is also building on other Chinese ports, as vessels try to find alternative ports to berth. Ships have faced growing delays since late March outside Ningbo-Zhoushan port, the world’s third largest port, less than a hundred miles from Shanghai, according to Lloyd’s List Intelligence.\n\nContainers are also piling up because of truck shortages.\n\nTrucks wait to load containers at Yangshan Deepwater Port on April 27, 2022 in Shanghai, China.

The average wait time has since come down but was still 10 days last Wednesday.\n\nZhang Wei, vice mayor of Shanghai, acknowledged last week that the city is seeing “reduced efficiency” in cargo transport and “poor logistics” since the lockdown.\n\nManufacturing and trade take a hit\n\nThe turmoil at the ports has already hit China’s factories and foreign trade, as manufacturers have to wait longer to get raw materials.\n\nIt is also harder for them to ship their products to customers. Inventories of finished goods have surged to the highest level in about a decade, as products pile up in warehouses due to weak demand and the difficulty of finding trucks to move them.\n\nCranes lift containers at Yangshan Deepwater Port on April 27, 2022 in Shanghai, China. Tian Yuhao/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nLatest PMI surveys — released on Saturday — showed that factory activity slumped to the worst level since February 2020, when China was battling the initial Covid outbreak. New export orders that manufacturers received in April fell at a much faster pace than in March.\n\nThe decline in export orders showed that the chaos at some major ports, including Shanghai, have hit China’s trade with the rest of the world, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.\n\n“Worryingly, there was plenty of evidence of worsening supply pressures, with supplier delivery times collapsing, input prices surging and inventories of finished good rising to their highest since June 2012,” wrote Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities, in a report.\n\n“Such supply pressures will have ramifications across supply chains globally, as already evidenced in some recent US Q1 earnings reports in the tech sector,” he added.\n\nGlobal inflation to go higher\n\nThe situation in Shanghai will push global inflation higher this year, said Daejin Lee, associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHe pointed out that last year’s inflation was driven by two factors — supply shortages of key parts owing to supply chain bottlenecks, and record high container freight rates.\n\nBoth problems continue this year, even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has fueled global inflation by driving up prices for energy and other key commodities.\n\n“Another lengthy delay” in seaborne supply of key parts because of China’s port congestion could increase consumer prices “much faster than previously expected,” Lee said.\n\nMaersk said Wednesday that freight rates will stay elevated as supply chain pressures persist. According to the company, congestion in sectors such as trucking and warehousing in mainland China, have created “bottlenecks, resulting in challenged supply chain management services and elevated rates.”\n\nThe company’s average freight rate jumped 71% in the first quarter from a year earlier.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/economy/worker-shortage-small-business/index.html", "title": "America's small businesses are running out of workers | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe pandemic forced Freed Bodyworks, a wellness center offering massage therapy, yoga, acupuncture, mental health counseling and other services, to shut down for four months. But while clients returned when it reopened in the summer of 2020, workers did not.\n\nAlmost two years later, owners Frances Reed and Jessica VonDyke were forced to shut the business’ doors.\n\n“I couldn’t hire anyone,” said Reed. “We never had trouble with our demand for services. It was 100% a supply issue for us.”\n\nFreed Bodyworks Holistic Wellness Center in Washington, DC. Courtesy Freed Bodyworks\n\nBefore the pandemic, Freed Bodyworks had 20 practitioners booking up to 550 clients a month. It reopened with a skeleton crew of eight – too few, Reed said, to bring in enough revenue to sustain the business.\n\nTwo former staffers had departed for graduate school, three had moved to areas with a lower cost of living and several had to take on caregiving roles in their families. Moreover, the shutdown of in-person instruction at massage schools dried up what had once been a dependable pipeline of emerging talent.\n\n“In the entire time period from when we reopened until closing, I managed to hire three people, and that was with full-time recruiting,” they said.\n\nReed is far from alone. Small business owners across the United States today face an acute labor shortage, which experts warn has hit a crisis level.\n\nA recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business found that about half of small-business owners said in July they still can’t fill open jobs, a near-record high in the survey’s roughly five-decade history.\n\n“Hiring has never been harder for small-business owners,” said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist for the NFIB.\n\nWhile the current labor market poses a challenge for employers of all sizes, small businesses have less ammunition in the battle for talent, lacking access to the kind of cash flow, credit and economies of scale that larger corporations enjoy. That makes it harder for them to offer things like competitive wages or sign-on bonuses.\n\n“It’s likely true that the big box stores are paying more,” said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University.\n\nThat puts mom-and-pop businesses at a serious disadvantage. “If they’re operating on tight margins, maybe they can’t afford to raise wages to lure more workers,” Holzer said.\n\nInflation is a small-biz “double whammy”\n\nSusan Sarich founded SusieCakes in 2006 and has grown it into a 26-bakery chain, the vast majority of which are in California. But her head count has plunged from nearly 500 before the pandemic to just over 200 now – and rebuilding those ranks has become more and more difficult.\n\nWith gas prices in California still at around $5.30 per gallon, many prospective employees say they can no longer afford to commute an hour or more, Sarich said.\n\n“We increased hourly pay close to 20% [but] the cost of living is off the charts,” she said. “Some are commuting upwards of an hour and a half each way and you add on gas prices and it’s like, how does the math work?” she said.\n\nSusieCakes bakery chain, founded in 2006, has seen its head count plunge from nearly 500 before the pandemic to just over 200 workers now. Courtesy SusieCakes\n\nTo cope, her bakeries remain closed two days a week and are open shorter hours. She has cut her product offerings, including dropping customer favorites like iced sugar cookies based on a beloved family recipe.\n\n“The demand was there, but we didn’t have the people, so we had to pivot pretty quickly to a reduced labor model. For us, that meant fewer days, fewer hours a day and fewer products,” she said, adding that she is still down from her pre-pandemic revenue by about 15%.\n\nEric Groves, CEO of Alignable, an online platform for small businesses, said owners are taking it on the chin, with higher inflation both raising their costs and crimping their sales as consumers become more cautious.\n\n“We’re seeing this double whammy,” he said. “It’s harder to find people, and the costs are going up.”\n\nA recent Alignable survey found that only about a third of small businesses are making 90% or more of their pre-pandemic revenue, Groves said. That’s worse than the results of a similar survey conducted last year, when 42% said they had recovered 90% or more of their pre-pandemic business.\n\n“They do have to sometimes dial back the hours that they’re open,” Groves said. “It’s this constant pressure of lower revenue, higher costs and challenges of just trying to get to the other side of this.”\n\nWorkers still in the driver’s seat – for now\n\nThere’s a combination of factors working against small business owners as they try to add head count.\n\nThe July jobs report showed that the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%, matching the half-century low it reached in February 2020. The report also showed that the labor force participation fell slightly, to 62.1%.\n\n“Able-bodied people of the right age are just not out there looking for jobs,” said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nA number of factors are behind this, economists say: An ongoing shortage of care workers, lower immigration rates and a pervasive fear of the pandemic.\n\n“A lot depends on, do people feel confident that we’ve got Covid under control?” Dollar said.\n\nA hiring sign is seen on the window of a retail store in Washington, D.C., on August 5. Ting Shen/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nEdward Fox owns two franchises of Tradebank, a business barter service with locations in Wichita, Kansas, and Nashville. When his sole Nashville-based employee departed at the end of 2020, he spent six months searching in vain before giving up and shuttering the office. He estimates that he sacrificed $200,000 to $300,000 in lost business as a result.\n\n“We were hoping that the job market would bounce back, that we’d have a bunch of people applying… but, man, it has been a struggle,” he said.\n\nFox said he was constrained in his ability to raise pay because Covid quashed many of the barter deals his business brokered, knocking out around 75% of his business. Without someone on the ground in Nashville, it made it tough to recapture that revenue. “I just think that everybody is looking for the same labor pool, and it’s tough,” he said.\n\n“I think employees these days want more flexibility. I think managers don’t want to let go of the control they have over the employee,” he said. “I think we’ve got a new reality we’ve got to face there, too.”\n\nBig hit from small-business loss\n\nThe loss of any single small business might be a drop in the ocean for the US economy, but if enough small businesses like Reed’s ultimately fail due to the labor shortage, that situation could turn into an economic tsunami, experts warn. Small businesses account for nearly half of private sector employment and contribute more than 40% to the US gross domestic product.\n\n“It would be a shame to see them go out of business. You don’t want the retail sector getting more and more concentrated,” Holzer said.\n\nWhen vacant storefronts become a fixture on Main Streets across the nation, consumers wind up with fewer choices about where they spend their money, and workers are left with fewer places to seek employment.\n\n“Anytime you lose jobs, it reduces the overall health of the local labor market,” Holzer said. “It’s good for workers to have choice as well as consumers.”", "authors": ["Martha C.

Their participation rate rebounded somewhat from 2017 to 2019 as unemployment fell and wages increased in a vibrant labor market. But it slid during the health crisis and has yet to fully recover despite record job growth over the past two years.\n\nSlower wage growth?:Waiting on a raise? It may be smaller than you hoped.

By contrast, the participation rate for women in that age group had climbed to 76.9%, effectively back to its pre-pandemic level of 77%.\n\nIf the participation rate for prime-age men was at its 1990 level, there would be an additional 2.7 million of them in the workforce, estimates economist Justin Begley of Moody’s Analytics.\n\nAnd that could mean a big shot in the arm for the economy.\n\nBehind the lettuce shortage:Dole cyberattack may be the cause of prepackaged lettuce shortage\n\nHow does men leaving the workforce contribute to Fed increasing interest rates?\n\nBoosting the nation’s supply of workers could go a long way toward easing inflation and persuading the Federal Reserve to pause its aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said goods inflation is moderating, but officials are focused on slowing price increases in service industries, like health and education, which are tied to rising labor costs.\n\nThe Fed’s rate increases are intended to raise business borrowing costs, thus curtailing hiring and investment, but most economists believe they’ll tip the nation into a recession this year.\n\nBy contrast, expanding the pool of workers would be another way to bring the labor market into better balance and slow pay increases without sharply reducing job openings or increasing layoffs.\n\n“The best way to achieve a loosening in the labor market would be to increase labor supply,” Begley and Moody’s economist Matt Colyar wrote in a note to clients.\n\nMoonlighting:Could you handle more than one full-time job? 37% of workers do\n\nWhy did so many US men stop working?\n\nEconomists have long put much of the blame on the offshoring of manufacturing jobs to China, a trend that picked up steam in the early 2000s after China joined the World Trade Organization, Begley and Colyar note.\n\nA 2021 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond also cites a rise in male substance abuse and even heavy video game use.\n\nAnother study several months ago by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston cites a less obvious reason: Non-college-educated men have left the labor force in greater numbers as the shortfall in their wages compared with those of college-educated men has increased, the study says.\n\nFrom 1980 to 2019, non-college-educated men’s median weekly earnings fell 17% after adjusting for inflation, while pay for their college-educated counterparts increased by 20%.\n\n“This finding suggests that deteriorating social status is a plausible key factor,” the Boston Fed paper concluded.\n\nIn other words, the lower self-esteem associated with a lower social status has caused some men to simply drop out rather than cope with the stress.\n\nIt’s unclear how they’re generating income, but some may be relying on a spouse’s earnings or doing occasional work that’s not recorded by Labor Department surveys.\n\nOther men leave the labor force to go back to school and bolster their skill set, while still others are hampered by a disability, the paper said.\n\nGood news on housing costs:Mortgage insurance costs dropping for some new homebuyers.

Nationally, the economy added more than 528,000 jobs in July, hardly an indicator of an economy in trouble, and job openings rose in July after three months of declines.

Root, the Columbus auto insurance startup, blamed the pandemic for spiraling costs that led it lay off 330 workers. And Victoria's Secret cut 160 management jobs at its corporate offices in July as part of a corporate reorganization.\n\nIt makes sense that some companies are starting to pull back on hiring or are letting workers go, given rising interest rates, inflation and wage costs, said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide.\n\n\"You've got to cut somewhere,\" he said.\n\nNonetheless, Ayers added, \"There are still so many job openings out there.

But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.”\n\nWhile Ayers doesn't believe the economy is in a recession now, he thinks there could be one in 2023 as the Fed continues to raise interest rates to choke inflation.\n\nHe expects the state's unemployment rate to remain close to historic lows before starting to climb in six to nine months as layoffs pick up steam.

However the forecast for next year includes some key differences.\n\nEconomists say Indiana's employment situation is better than the nation's. And while the state is seeing growth in incomes and output, similar to that of the nation, that growth is occurring at a lower level.\n\nThat will continue into next year as Indiana continues to recover from the pandemic. Economic growth is expected to be higher in the first two quarters of the year but lower than what occurred in the second and third quarters of 2021.\n\n\"We expect to see continued growth in employment and job creation of around 2%, similar to the national growth,\" said Jennifer Lynn Rice, Indiana University senior lecturer of business economics and public policy. \"We expect to add jobs each quarter, but yet we will experience a labor shortage just like at the national level.\"\n\nThe forecast from the Kelley School of Business projects the U.S. may average about 300,000 new jobs each month in 2022, compared to the average rate of 450,000 new jobs per month over the past 12 months.\n\n\"This will be about two-thirds the rate during the past year, but it will be enough to put year-end employment above its pre-pandemic level,\" Bill Witte, author of the Kelley School's U.S. forecast and an associate professor emeritus of economics, said in a statement. \"Total employment remains 4.5 million below its pre-pandemic level.\"\n\nIndiana workers aren't applying for low-wage jobs. So the governor cut unemployment.\n\nThe deficit reflects a decline in labor participation. Rice noted that the U.S. labor participation rate is around 61%, while Indiana has a rate hovering around 63%, higher than all neighboring states.\n\nThough Indiana's labor participation remains slightly higher than the national rate, it's still lower than what the state has seen in the past. Economists said roughly 60,000 Hoosiers have dropped out of the labor force over the past year, meaning fewer people are looking for jobs.\n\nExperts attribute that to a variety of reasons such as retirements, workers returning to school or training programs to gain new skills, women leaving their jobs due to child care and people afforded selectivity about their work due to stimulus savings.\n\n\"During the shutdown, the participation rate dropped 3.2 points — a very large change,\" Witte said in a statement. \"During the first four months of the restart, it recovered close to half that, but in the 14 months since it has made no further progress.\"\n\nThe exodus has resulted in a shortage of available workers when the demand for labor is high. Such shortages have led to some businesses — particularly restaurants, retailers and pharmacy — closing early or limiting their days of operation to adjust.\n\nThe labor shortage is also affecting Indiana's growth and the pace of recovery from the pandemic.\n\n$15 is becoming the new starting hourly wage in Indiana\n\n\"You have fewer people looking for jobs, the decrease in truck drivers, impacts and disruptions to logistics and transportation,\" Rice said. \"Indiana is caught up in that supply chain bottleneck -- those logistic interruptions for shipping.\"\n\nOn-going challenges limit the economic growth Indiana and the nation see. Growth in GDP and overall economic output in the third quarter was not as high as economists hoped, due in part to the delta variant and supply chain issues.\n\n\"Between the delta variant and supply issues we didn't anticipate, we likely haven't recovered as fast as we'd like to,\" Anderson said, adding that although the nation is no longer in a recession challenges persist despite the growth that's occurred.\n\nHere's what else economists expect in 2022:\n\nInflation\n\nEconomists say they expect inflationary pressure to continue into the new year.\n\nEmployment\n\nIndiana will continue to see job creation, but not as high as in 2021 and lower than what was forecasted pre-pandemic. Labor shortages are expected to remain a major concern for many businesses and compound supply chain issues.\n\n\"Part of the reason that we are going to se slightly lower growth in employment and job creation in Indiana, relatively to the national level, is that Indiana tends to have slower population growth,\" Rice said.\n\nThe state's unemployment rate will continue to fall, dropping from about 4.2% now to as low as 3.6% by the end of 2022. More people will join the labor force but that number will fall in the latter half of the year.\n\nManufacturing and the services sectors\n\nGrowth in the services industry is expected to drive the state's output next year while manufacturing, a key sector, in Indiana will lag.\n\nThe services sector will grow about 2.6%, with health care, business services and leisure and hospitality being the top areas for job creation and employment. The latter will be driven by what happens in Indianapolis, where tourism and conventions business is expected to pick up in 2022.\n\nAs for manufacturing, economists expect slower growth in that sector, predicting growth of only .44%. That's concerning for Indiana, which is a manufacturing-oriented state.\n\nReasons for the low job growth vary, Rice said, noting labor shortages, supply chain and trucking issues impact the sector. Job creation in manufacturing often lags production, which can be good or bad.\n\nIn one sense, Rice explained, that would indicate higher worker productivity or it could mean that employers are accelerating their move toward automation and technology to help maintain or increase their output during the ongoing labor shortage.\n\nIn that sense, technology could replace human labor.\n\nSupply chain issues\n\nIt's pretty much given that supply chain disruptions will continue into 2022.\n\n\"They're not going to be resolved by the end of the year. We were all hoping it would be resolved and everyone would have their Christmas gifts for the holidays,\" Rice said. \"Don't get your hopes up too much, (that) will likely result in more expensive holiday celebrations this year.\"\n\nIncome\n\nIndiana saw significant growth in income in the second and third quarter of this year, partly because of the federal stimulus, but that growth has slowed.\n\n\"The stimulus packages and payments really spiked up the growth in income earlier in 2021,\" Rice said. \"The ending of those stimulus there in September really started to weaken that growth, although we did continue to see some growth.\"\n\nHowever, when compared to the national level, historically, Indiana has seen lower growth in income. Rice said that pattern is expect to continue into 2022.\n\n\"Although we have growth in income, it's not going to be as large — quite as large or slightly lower — than we see at the national level,\" she said.\n\nDowntown Indianapolis\n\nDowntown Indianapolis has yet to fully recover from the pandemic as many workers continue doing their jobs from home or other remote locations.\n\nCircle Centre Mall, a main draw for the area, has lost several high-profile chains over the past year. Restaurants have closed. A lot of those businesses were dependent on tourism and office workers, Anderson said.\n\n\"Downtown Indianapolis has been overly reliant on commuters and people coming in and working 8-5 Monday through Friday so for a lot of the restaurants and lunch places that's been the demographic,\" Anderson said. \"Some of the folks will come back but there needs to be more of a balance, for example, of more residential people living down there 24/7.\"\n\nThat could be a mix of renters or homeowners living in high-rises or townhomes.\n\nInvestment in permanent residential property will help drive help downtown's future growth, Anderson said, adding that it's incumbent upon the city's administration to explore how to replicate the residential growth seen in outlying areas in the city's core.\n\nContact IndyStar reporter Alexandria Burris at aburris@gannett.com or call 317-617-2690.

Brady, who was named Super Bowl MVP for the fifth time in his career, led Tampa Bay to a 31-9 win over the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIt was the first ceremony Brady has attended at the presidential residence since 2005. Brady turned down three other invitations – most recently in 2017 under former President Donald Trump, whom the quarterback previously called a \"good friend\" – when he won Super Bowls while playing for the New England Patriots.\n\nBrady delivered another joke when he said people began calling him \"Sleepy Tom\" after he forgot what down it was during a loss in Chicago, a jab at Trump's nickname for Biden during the election.\n\n\"I lost track of one down in 21 years of playing and they started calling me 'Sleepy Tom,'\" he said as the crowd chuckled. \"Why would they do that to me?\"\n\nTampa's professional sports teams have won three titles from 2020-21, with the Buccaneers' victory being bookended by the Tampa Bay Lightning's Stanley Cup wins.\n\n“We’re making a pretty strong case to start calling Tampa Bay the city of champions,” Biden said.\n\nBiden cited Brady and coach Bruce Arians specifically for their efforts in leading the Buccaneers to victory and for a similarity among the three of them.\n\nEach set a record related to their age earlier in 2021. Biden, 78, in January became the oldest president to be inaugurated. Brady, 43, and Arians, 68, were the oldest quarterback and coach to win a Super Bowl did so in February.\n\n\"You won't hear any jokes about that for me as far as I'm concerned,\" Biden said. \"There's nothing wrong with being the oldest guy to make it to the mountaintop.\"\n\nBrady and Arians weren't the only people Biden called out by name. Wide receiver Chris Godwin, whom Biden said he called before the Super Bowl, was born in Pennsylvania and raised in Biden's home state.\n\n\"Most importantly, you've got a star receiver from Delaware,\" Biden said. \"I'm mildly prejudiced about that.\"\n\nBiden referenced the trailblazing efforts of Tampa Bay to include women on its coaching staff, as well as efforts to improve voter turnout in Florida and administer COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\"In the middle of a long, dark winter, every Sunday people were able to sit down and watch you play,\" Biden said. \"You created memories that helped folks make it through and believe that we could get back to normal again.\"\n\nIn the middle of his speech, Biden turned to the players behind him and told those who have not received the vaccine to \"get one,\" with Arians responding \"Amen.\" Arians later spoke on the impact the pandemic had on his team.\n\n\"I want to thank our coaches, our players, our entire organization, men, women that did such a great job last year of coming together and banding together not to beat the other team, we had to beat the virus first,\" Arians said. \"You sacrificed more than any team I've ever been around.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers open training camp on Sunday, and it is unclear how many members of the team are vaccinated.

Teams can be fined if players do not stand and \"show respect\" during the anthem. Trump also said players who chose not to stand \"shouldn't be in the country.\"\n\nFewer than 10 players were planning to attend the White House event, according to several reports.\n\nWide receiver Torrey Smith, who played for the Eagles but was traded in the offseason to the Carolina Panthers, admonished Trump for the decision.\n\n\"There are a lot of people on the team that have plenty of different views,\" Smith wrote in a tweet. \"The men and women that wanted to go should’ve been able to go.

No problem with that. It’s an ideal sentiment that plays off his team’s nickname.\n\nLet’s hope that Kraft — a lifelong Democrat — implores Trump to maintain that spirit of inclusiveness during their social visits, like the dinner Friday at the President’s resort in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\n\nBennett doesn't fear backlash for skipping White House trip\n\nLeGarrette Blount adds name to growing list of Patriots who won't make trip to the White House\n\nIn the meantime, it’s refreshing to see that the “all Patriots” team includes some players with a conscious that illustrates a connection with so many people in the broader society. Trump may openly root for the Patriots and drop the names of Brady, Kraft and Belichick amid his political speeches, but at least there’s some resistance to the “Trump’s Team” narrative.\n\nLet’s call them the Initial Six: Martellus Bennett. Devin McCourty. Chris Long. LeGarrette Blount. Alan Branch. Dont’a Hightower.\n\nI’m guessing that by the time the yet-to-be-scheduled affair commences, the number of Patriot no-shows will grow. Super Bowl hero James White maintains he’s unsure if he’ll go, and will decide after the invite becomes official.\n\nWhat a statement game this is, capping the end of an NFL season that in keeping pace with the nation at large was in many ways, “The Year of the Protest.”\n\nWhile a couple of the players — Hightower and Branch — offered reasons for pulling out that were non-political, the others left no illusions about their willingness to take a stand. Or a pass.\n\nMcCourty, a team captain who might be the most respected Patriot in the locker room outside of Brady, said he doesn’t feel accepted in the White House. It’s a shame the affairs of this nation have become so polarized and the rhetoric so vile that a citizen would express that.\n\n“With the President having so many strong opinions and prejudices,” McCourty explained, “I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t.”\n\nBlount echoed McCourty’s sentiment about not feeling welcomed, while Bennett — the first Patriot to make his intentions known about skipping the White House — urged people to follow him on Twitter and check out his tweets if they need more of an understanding of his view.\n\nHow fitting, given all the tweets that have come from Trump.\n\n“It is what it is,” Bennett told reporters after Super Bowl LI. “People know how I feel about it.”\n\nLong, meanwhile, didn’t mention Trump by name. But he tweeted that his decision had absolutely nothing to do with an open letter published to him that urged that he join African-Americans by skipping the White House.\n\nNo, Long, a ninth-year vet, doesn’t need suggestions from any of us. When protests by African-American players ramped up early in the season after Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem, Long offered a response that was largely missing — that he felt it was important for white players to speak out against societal injustice, too.\n\nThat he won’t go to the White House underscores that sentiment.\n\nBrady, meanwhile, refused to get political during Super Bowl week, telling me, “I have a right to stay out of it,” even though he once displayed a “Make America Great Again” cap in his locker — which has been interpreted by many as a statement in itself.\n\nThe first quarterback to win five Super Bowls may not owe the world an explanation about his political leanings. But in this climate, you’d think that Brady — who in the past has talked about his interest in following politics — would want to set the record straight about some of views.\n\nBrady’s had a friendship with Trump over many years. So has Kraft, who points to Trump’s support during an emotional crisis after his wife Myra died in 2011 as a foundation for their bond.\n\nYet given the issues and the actions by Trump that have sparked protests and various forms of resistance, Kraft, by not distancing himself from the politics, could have his position interpreted as tacit approval.\n\nSo Brady has a big opportunity in front of him, too — even if he visits the White House this time.\n\nIn the meantime, the Patriot Way rolls on as the records keep falling.\n\nPHOTOS: TOM BRADY THROUGH THE YEARS", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/02/20/how-often-have-athletes-snubbed-the-white-house/98145974/", "title": "How often have athletes snubbed the White House?", "text": "AP\n\nThe routine is familiar. The president makes a few bad jokes. The championship-winning team presents the leader of the free world with a personalized jersey. Everyone smiles for the cameras.\n\nNothing political about that, right?\n\nNot exactly.\n\nIn a divided nation, everything is political.\n\nWhile presidents have been snubbed before, six players from the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots took it to another level by preemptively turning down an expected invitation from President Trump.\n\nRest assured, they won't be the last to mix sports and politics.\n\n\"The balance of power in professional sports now rests more with the performers than the owners,\" said Stephen Mosher, a professor of sports management and media at Ithaca College. \"Without a labor force, (Patriots owner) Robert Kraft has nothing but an empty stadium. He has to let his employees make these political statements if he wants to win. He has to. There's too many different political views held by players in the National Football League.\n\n\"Actually,\" Mosher added, \"I think it's quite refreshing.\"\n\nThe Patriots were part of the political discourse even before they dramatically rallied from 25 points down to beat the Atlanta Falcons in the first Super Bowl to go to overtime.\n\nKraft is a friend of the 45th president, and quarterback Tom Brady drew plenty of scrutiny when one of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" caps was spotted in his locker at the start of the contentious presidential campaign.\n\nThen, with the Patriots still in the midst of their Super Bowl celebration, tight end Martellus Bennett made it clear he had no intention of visiting Trump's White House.\n\nFive teammates — defensive back Devin McCourty, running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long, linebacker Dont'a Hightower and defensive tackle Alan Branch — quickly followed suit. Most pinned their decision on political differences with the Republican administration.\n\nSignificant, to be sure.\n\nBut nothing new.\n\nSNUBBING THE WHITE HOUSE\n\nSince the tradition of inviting sports champions to the nation's most famous home really began to take off under President Reagan, some two dozen athletes have turned down the opportunity.\n\nThat list includes Brady, who didn't attend a 2015 celebration because of what the quarterback insisted was a \"family commitment\" but others speculated was because of some unflattering comments a spokesman for President Obama made about the Deflategate scandal.\n\nFor some, a trip to the White House was no big deal.\n\nLarry Bird shrugged off an invitation from Reagan after the Boston Celtics won an NBA title, crabbily explaining, \"If the president wants to see me, he knows where to find me.\" After winning one of his six championships, Michael Jordan said he preferred to spend time with his family rather than hang with President George H.W. Bush. Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison turned down not one, but two chances to visit the White House, pointing out — quite correctly — that he wouldn't have gotten either of those invitations if his team had lost the Super Bowl.\n\nOthers cited political differences with those in power in declining.\n\nBoston Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas declined to join the 2011 Stanley Cup champions on their White House visit, writing on social media that the government \"has grown out of control, threatening the Rights, Liberties, and Property of the People.\"\n\nBaltimore Ravens center Matt Birk passed on a chance to meet with Obama because of the president's support of Planned Parenthood. Golfer Tom Lehman was even more outspoken when rebuffing a president, calling Bill Clinton \"a draft-dodging baby killer.\"\n\nHOW IT ALL STARTED\n\nIn 1865, not long after the end of the Civil War and before professional baseball was even a thing, President Andrew Johnson met with a pair of amateur teams, the Washington Nationals and Brooklyn Atlantics, according to the White House Historical Association. Given the tumultuous term he would serve after inheriting the office from Abraham Lincoln, Johnson probably figured he could use all the positive publicity he could get.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge invited the hometown Senators for a visit after their dramatic seven-game victory in the 1924 World Series, which proved to be a prudent move. Washington may be first in war and first in peace, but it's still stuck on that one Series title.\n\nMore teams would visit the White House in the years to come, but Mosher points to Richard Nixon as the first president who really pushed for a connection to athletes of all stripes, with some speculating that it was a way to make up for his failed football dreams. Most notably, he began the practice of placing congratulatory phone calls right to the locker room while teams were right in the midst of their championship celebrations.\n\nReagan, who knew how to work the camera far better than Nixon, stepped up the game by using the White House as a backdrop for well-choreographed photo ops with champions from a wide range of sports. While these appearances were passed off as nothing more than a chance to dole out some well-deserved kudos while escaping the divisive issues of the day, the Gipper surely knew they had everything to do with politics.\n\n\"Basking in the reflective glory\" of a championship team, as Mosher puts it, never hurts when election time rolls around. \"They keep telling us over and over again that sports and politics don't mix,\" he said. \"But that's simply not the case.\"\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nColin Kaepernick's season-long protest against police brutality and abuses in the justice system seems to have sparked a new activism among professional athletes.\n\nThe quarterback's simple act of kneeling during the national anthem \"is very different than what I've studied in the past,\" Mosher said. \"He did it so politely, with so much respect.

The Braves are just two wins behind first place in the National League East. Chief Executive Officer Terry McGuirk said he hoped they’d be back to the White House again soon.\n\nIn August 2021, the Braves were a mess, playing barely at .500. But then they started winning. And they kept doing it, clinching the World Series in six games over the Houston Astros.\n\nBiden called their come-from-behind win one of “history’s greatest turnarounds.”\n\n“This team has literally been part of American history for over 150 years,” said Biden. “But none of it came easy … people counting you out. Heck, I know something about being counted out.”\n\nFollow the money: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\nPlayers lined up on risers behind Biden, grinning and waving to the crowd, but the player most discussed was one who hasn’t been on the team in nearly 50 years and who died last year: Hall of Famer Hank Aaron.\n\nHammerin’ Hank was the homerun king for 33 years, dethroning Babe Ruth with a high flier to centerfield on April 8, 1974. He was one of the most famous players for Atlanta and in baseball history, a vocal and clear-eyed chronicler of the many hardships thrown his way – from the poverty and segregation of his Alabama youth to the racist threats he faced during his pursuit of one of America’s most hallowed records. He died in January at age 86.\n\n“This is team is defined by the courage of Hank Aaron,” Biden said.\n\nMcGuirk said Aaron, who held front office positions with the team and was one of Major League Baseball’s few Black executives, was watching over them.\n\n“He’d have been there every step of the way with us if he was here,” McGuirk added.\n\nThe president often honors major league and some college sports champions with a White House ceremony, typically a nonpartisan affair in which the commander in chief pays tribute to the champs’ prowess, poses for photos and comes away with a team jersey.\n\nThose visits were highly charged in the previous administration. Many athletes took issue with President Donald Trump’s policies and rhetoric on policing, immigration and more. Trump, for his part, didn’t take kindly to criticism from athletes or their on-field expressions of political opinion.\n\nUnder Biden, the tradition appears to be back. He’s hosted the NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks and Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers at the White House. Biden on Monday joked about first lady Jill Biden’s Philadelphia allegiances.\n\n“Like every Philly fan, she’s convinced she knows more about everything in sports than anybody else,” he said. He added that he couldn’t be too nice to the Atlanta team because it had just beaten the Phillies the previous night in extra innings.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2023/02/12/super-bowl-2023-live-updates-chiefs-eagles/11218626002/", "title": "Super Bowl 2023 score: Chiefs top Eagles 38-35 with late Mahomes ...", "text": "On one leg, Patrick Mahomes finished the job. His reward, other than resting an oft-injured ankle this postseason, is a second Lombardi Trophy for the reigning NFL MVP.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 in Super Bowl 57 on Sunday, the team’s second title in four seasons. A controversial holding penalty by Eagles cornerback James Bradberry gave the Chiefs a chance to run the clock down and kick a game-winning field goal with eight seconds left, which Harrison Butker nailed from 27 yards.\n\nMahomes finished 21 of 27 for 182 yards with three touchdowns. Kansas City scored a touchdown on its first three drives of the second half after trailing at halftime 24-14.\n\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was 27 of 37 for 304 yards passing, but was a force on the ground. He rushed for three touchdowns (15 carries, 70 yards) and tied the game at 35 on a two-point conversion with about five minutes left.\n\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce (six catches, 81 yards, touchdown) bested his brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce, on the game’s biggest stage, while Chiefs coach Andy Reid defeated his former team.\n\nChiefs win Super Bowl 57:Patrick Mahomes and Co. capture second title in four seasons\n\nThis is like watching Michael Jordan in his prime. Patrick Mahomes is 27. He's on a team-friendly contract. In the five seasons he has been starter, the Chiefs have made it at least to the AFC title game. As long as Mahomes is under center, this will be the standard. He won his second Super Bowl MVP days after he won his second league MVP.\n\nMahomes had his right ankle injury reaggravated late in the second quarter when Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards fell on it as he dragged him to the turf. Ho hum. All Mahomes did after the injury was complete 13 of 14 passes for 93 yards and a pair of scores. As if that wasn't enough, with 2:55 left to play in a tie game, he outran the Eagles defense on a 26-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal.\n\nRead Lorenzo Reyes' full analysis of Super Bowl 57's winners and losers here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles had a 10-point lead as Rihanna took center stage at halftime.

And Olsen distinguished himself with his assessment of the most critical play of the game.\n\nRead our full analysis of the Super Bowl 57 broadcast here.\n\nThe grass used in State Farm Stadium during Super Bowl 57 took nearly two years and more than $800,000 to prepare for Sunday, but it wasn't without faults. The playing conditions were less than pretty.\n\nPlayers from both the Eagles and Chiefs struggled to get traction on the natural grass and slipped many times. At least half a dozen Eagles players switched cleats during the first half in an attempt to get a better grip, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, who changed from Jordan 11 cleats to Jordan 1 cleats.\n\nEagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata, who said he's \"not a grass expert,\" described the conditions as \"pretty slippery,\" similar to \"playing on a water park.\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nSuper Bowl 57 was one of the highest-scoring Super Bowl games ever played. It was a thrilling showdown that featured numerous records either broken (longest punt return) or tied (most points scored by a player, Jalen Hurts with 20).\n\nHere is a look at the highest-scoring Super Bowls.\n\nTravis Kelce was the winner of the unofficial \"Kelce Bowl,\" as his Kansas City Chiefs defeated his brother Jason's Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 57.\n\nBut as the Chiefs celebrated their victory and Travis Kelce gave a memorable postgame interview alongside Patrick Mahomes, he made sure to see his brother following the game, as the Kelce brothers shared an embrace and briefly spoke as the confetti fell down on State Farm Stadium.\n\nJason Kelce can be heard congratulating Travis, even cracking a smile and telling him to \"go celebrate.\" Before they part, both Kelce's told each other \"I love you.\" — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThe Super Bowl, like every other NFL game, has two halves. The Philadelphia Eagles only showed up for one of them.\n\nAfter pushing the Kansas City Chiefs to the brink and hobbling Patrick Mahomes, the Eagles imploded in the second half. They were outscored, outgained, outdisciplined – outhustled – and, as a result, they're out a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nMaybe that's harsh, given the final score was 38-35 and it took the Chiefs until the closing seconds to seal the victory. But when you have a 10-point lead, all the momentum and Mahomes barely able to run off the field at halftime, that's as close to a gimme as it gets in the NFL's biggest game.\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full column here.\n\nThe Blackest, most woke Super Bowl ever — can’t believe I wrote that since this is the Republican NFL, but here we are — started by again featuring the Black national anthem, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” this time performed by Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nThen Rihanna performed at halftime. Despite once saying she wouldn’t perform in the Super Bowl halftime show because of the way the NFL treated Colin Kaepernick and protesting players, she was back, and make no mistake, Rihanna is one of the Blackest, proudest performers of our time.\n\nBut wait, it gets Blacker.\n\nSinger Babyface, a generational rhythm and blues singer, sang “America the Beautiful” before the game. He’s produced dozens of R&B hits and won 12 Grammy Awards. At this point we had the Black national anthem, Rihanna performing and two Black starting quarterbacks for the first time ever. During Black History Month. This wasn’t the Super Bowl. This was Wakanda.\n\nRead MIke Freeman's full column here.\n\nThe record for the longest punt return in Super Bowl history now belongs to Kadarius Toney.\n\nToney broke several tackles on the punt return for a 65-yard return, making it the longest punt return in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe Chiefs then scored three plays later on a Patrick Mahomes pass to Skyy Moore.\n\nThere has never been a punt return for a touchdown in Super Bowl history, but there have been multiple kickoff return TDs. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nHow excited was Andy Reid to win the Super Bowl?\n\nAndy Reid, immediately after winning his second Super Bowl, could not contain his excitement.\n\nWhen Fox sideline reporter Tom Rinaldi asked Reid how happy he was, the Kansas City Chiefs coach responded with his typical jovial sense of humor.\n\n“I could kiss you right now, but I’m not going to,” Reid told Rinaldi, as both laughed after the exchange.\n\nReid led the Chiefs to their second championship in four seasons.\n\nReid credited his offensive coordinator Eric Bienemy during his postgame interview.\n\n“Eric Bienemy was tremendous down the stretch there,” Reid said, complimenting his assistant who has been passed over for head coaching jobs several times.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nJalen Hurts ties record for points in Super Bowl\n\nThe game is not over, but Jalen Hurts has tied a Super Bowl record: most points scored in the game.\n\nIn Super Bowl 51, James White accounted for 20 in the epic 28-3 comeback the New England Patriots pulled off against the Atlanta Falcons, including the game-winning touchdown in overtime.\n\nHurts has three touchdowns on the ground (one through the air) and the two-point conversion that tied the game at 35 was the equalizer with White.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nAnd we're all tied in Super Bowl 57 after Eagles score\n\nThese Eagles will not go quietly.\n\nTrailing by eight points in the fourth quarter, Jalen Hurts converted once again on third down early in the drive with a patented sneak. He found A.J Brown on the next third down for another first. Brown and Hurts connected again for 11 yards and another first.\n\nGiven plenty of time, Hurts found DeVonta Smith streaking down the left sideline on a blown coverage. Smith could not keep his balance and remain in bounds and went out at the 2-yard line, but not before picking up 45 yards. Hurts scored on the next play via a – you guessed it – quarterback sneak.\n\nHurts then tied the game on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt on a designed run to the left, breaking tackles and persevering over the goal line to even it at 35 with 5:15 left in the game.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nKansas City continues second-half domination\n\nKadarius Toney, Super Bowl MVP?\n\nToney had two of the biggest plays for the Chiefs during the fourth quarter, his latest was a 65-yard punt return - the longest in Super Bowl history - went to Philadelphia 5-yard line with 10:11 left in the game.\n\nThree plays later the Chiefs added to their fourth-quarter lead as Patrick Mahomes found receiver Skyy Moore for a 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Chiefs took a 35-27 lead with 9:22 left in the game.\n\nToney, acquired by the Chiefs during the season, is turning out to be a pivotal move that paid off in Kansas City’s favor during the biggest game of the season. His earlier 5-yard touchdown put the Chiefs ahead in the fourth quarter.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChiefs take first lead in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe Chiefs waiting until the fourth quarter to finally go ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nPatrick Mahomes found receiver Kadarius Toney for a walk-in 5-yard touchdown, and kicker Harrison Butker made the extra point to put Kansas City ahead 28-27 with 12:04 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nToney went in motion toward the middle of the field, but turned quickly back to the right sidelinefor a wide-open touchdown.\n\nDuring the drive, running back Isiah Pacheco (with runs of 9 and 11 yards) and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster (with four catches for 38 yards) were instrumental for Mahomes and the Chiefs.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nReplay decision helps Eagles add to lead on Chiefs\n\nJalen Hurts could not have thrown a better ball. On third-and-14 from the Kansas City 47, Hurts dropped back on the team’s first drive of the half with a three-point lead. He found tight end Dallas Goedert near the sideline between two defenders past the sticks for what appeared to be yet another third down conversion.\n\nAlthough Goedert bobbled the ball, he regained possession in time to land both feet in bounds and the call was upheld. The challenge cost Andy Reid and the Chiefs their first timeout of the second half.\n\nPhiladelphia moved the ball inside the red zone after the play but had to settle for a field goal to make it 27-21 with 1:45 left in the third quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nHurt ankle, no problem for Patrick Mahomes\n\nAfter injuring his ankle on his final play of the second quarter, Mahomes started the second half, and even ran for a 14-yard gain inside the 5-yard line on the first drive of the third quarter.\n\nMahomes led the Chiefs on a touchdown drive to start the second half, which included a low pass to tight end Travis Kelce that kept their drive alive.\n\nChiefs running back Isiah Pacheco scored on a 1-yard run to help the Chiefs trim their deficit. The Eagles are holding onto a 24-21 lead after the first possession in the second half.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nRihanna shines bright in Super Bowl halftime show\n\nRihanna has already evolved into an immensely successful singer, a business mogul with a net worth of more than $1 billion and, as of last year, a mom.\n\nOn Sunday, the multihyphenate added another accomplishment to the checklist: Super Bowl halftime headliner.\n\nTaking the State Farm Stadium stage in Glendale, Arizona, with her most visible outing in years, Rihanna stormed through a vibrant production that spotlighted her flexible R&B grooves coupled with infectious pop hooks. And, of course, her distinctive fashion style.\n\nALL OF THE LIGHTS:Rihanna stuns in spectacular Super Bowl performance\n\n- Melissa Ruggieri\n\nSuper Bowl halftime stats: Patrick Mahomes held to 89 yards passing\n\nOnly once has a team lost the Super Bowl after leading by double-digits at halftime: the Atlanta Falcons before the New England Patriots staged their famous comeback from a 28-3 deficit six years ago.\n\nThe Eagles, who lead 24-14 at the break, finished the first half with a time of possession of 21:54, leaving the Chiefs with 8:06. They ran 44 plays compared to the Chiefs’ 20 and outgained them 270-128.\n\nHere are some other statistics from the first half:\n\nNotable Eagles stats\n\nThird-down efficiency: 6-for-10,\n\nJalen Hurts: 17-for-22, 183 yards, TD; 11 rushes, 63 yards, 2 TD\n\nDeVonta Smith: six catches, 55 yards\n\nA.J Brown: three catches, 74 yards, TD\n\nNotable Chiefs stats\n\nThird-down efficiency:0-for-3\n\nPatrick Mahomes: 8-for-13, 89 yards, TD\n\nIsiah Pacheco: five carries, 28 yards\n\nTravis Kelce: three catches, 60 yards, TD\n\nBolton: three tackles, fumble recovery, TD\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles take 24-14 lead at halftime after late field goal\n\nIn the NFC championship game, DeVonta Smith quickly got his team to the line of scrimmage and snapped the ball after a questionable catch on the Eagles’ first drive of their victory over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIt did not work against the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.\n\nA replay review late in the second quarter showed Smith did not maintain control of the ball after a catch to the Kansas City 13, and it was ruled incomplete. The Eagles tried to snap the ball right away, but since there were less than two minutes in the first half, the officials in the booth called down to the field for a review.\n\nAfter the over turn, A.J. Brown, had a 22-yard catch-and-run that put Philadelphia in field goal range. Jake Elliott connected from 35 yards out as time expired in the first half, with the Eagles taking a 24-14 advantage into the locker room.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nPatrick Mahomes limps off after appearing to re-injure ankle\n\nWell, Patrick Mahomes’ injured right ankle was looking good until it wasn’t.\n\nMahomes, who was suffered a high-ankle sprain against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the divisional playoff game, scrambled on third down shortly before halftime, and his injured right foot took the brunt of the fall after he was tackled by Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards with 1:44 left in the second quarter.\n\nMahomes limped off the field in obvious pain and was later shown in difficulty while his ankle was being evaluated by trainers on the sidelines.\n\nEarlier in the game, Mahomes appeared to run with ease like his foot was healed after a high-ankle sprain suffered last month.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles back in front on another Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThe Eagles entered the Super Bowl with 35 fourth-down attempts. The 36th and 37th were the most important of the season thus far.\n\nOn fourth-and-5 from the Kansas City 44, Hurts ran to daylight and converted the first fourth down of the drive with a 28-yard carry down the right sideline. Facing a fourth-and 2, the Eagles got Kansas City to jump inside the red zone to set up a first-and-goal and Hurts scored his second rushing touchdown of the game on the next play to make it 21-14 with just over two minutes left in the second quarter.\n\nThe drive was 12 plays and took 7:19 off the clock. The Eagles are dominating time of possession. They have had the ball for 20:32, while Mahomes and Kansas City have had it for 7:08.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs erase deficit with defensive touchdown after Eagles miscue\n\nThe Eagles had a seven-point lead and were in Chiefs territory once again.\n\nInstead of putting Kansas City back on its heels, they let them back in the game.\n\nFacing a thrd-and-1 from the Chiefs’ 47, right guard Isaac Seumalo jumped early and moved the Eagles back five yards. On the next play, Hurts began to run on a quarterback keeper, but he dropped the ball and Nick Bolton – the Chiefs’ leading tackler – scooped it up and scored on a 36-yard return that tied the game.\n\nIt was the first fumble Hurts lost since Week 10 against Indianapolis and the team's first turnover of the playoffs.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nA.J. Brown puts Eagles ahead with long touchdown catch\n\nThe ability to hit the big play has been a hallmark for the Eagles offense all season.\n\nIn the Super Bowl, Brown made it.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Hurts had all day in the pocket to watch Brown streak down the field and into double-coverage. Hurts threw to a place anybody who could catch the ball would have to make an adjustment.\n\nJuan Thornhill and McDuffie in coverage weren’t able. Brown did, and the Eagles regain the lead 14-7d on the 45-yard completion.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs fail to take lead as Harrison Butker field goal goes 'doink'\n\nThe Chiefs moved the ball well, but settled for a field-goal attempt when facing a fourth-and-3 at the end of their second drive. Butker’s 42-yard kick drifted left and was no good after hitting the upright, keeping the score tied at 7.\n\nThe possession by the Chiefs drive featured a stellar 22-yard pass from Mahomes to Kelce, and even some trickery from Kansas City. Kelce and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster signaled to the Chiefs sidelines like they did not know a play call, then turned around after Mahomes found running back Jerick McKinnon for a 7-yard completion on the right side.\n\nMahomes nearly threw an interception on the next play, and the Chiefs’ field-goal kick miss could come back to haunt them later this game.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles RB Miles Sanders sidelined after hit on game's first play\n\nOn the first play of the game, Sanders carried for a one-yard loss. Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie tracked him down near the sideline and delivered a large hit, knocking the ball out of bounds.\n\nSanders, a fourth-year player from Penn State, was seen shaking his hand after the play and went into the locker room before returning to the field. Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell handled the ball-carrying duting in his absence. Sanders returned to the field in the second quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs respond quickly to tie game against Eagles\n\nThe Chiefs did not waste any time responding to the Eagles’ first score.\n\nChiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes found who else than his favorite target, tight end Travis Kelce, for a 18-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7 with 6:57 left in the first quarter.\n\nMahomes’ first pass of the game was a 20-yard completion to Kelce. More important: Mahomes’ ankle looks great, too, after he galloped for an 8-yard run during the drive.\n\nThe Chiefs got near the red zone with a 24-yard run to the left side by running back Isaiah Pacheco.\n\nKelce also celebrated his touchdown with a dance in the end zone.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles jump out to early Super Bowl lead on Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThat was quick.\n\nThe Eagles received the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards in 11 plays for a touchdown on the game’s first possession. Jalen Hurts found receiver DeVonta Smith on a key third down and later hit him for 23 yards to move Philadelphia into the red zone on a run-pass option that was initially snuffed out.\n\nKenneth Gainwell initially had the score, but replay review quickly confirmed his elbow was down short of the goal line. The call was Hurts’ specialty: a quarterback sneak. Behind the Eagles’ elite offensive line, Hurts plowed ahead for six points. Extra point was good and it's Philadelphia 7-0 early.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs win Super Bowl coin toss, Eagles get ball first\n\nIf you bet on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl coin toss, congratulations.\n\nThe Chiefs called tails. And the Chiefs won the toss. They chose to defer and will kickoff to the Eagles start the game, and then get the ball to start the second half.\n\nTails breaks a two-game streak by heads, and has been the coin toss winner in seven of the last 10 Super Bowls, according to Oddsshark.com.\n\nAt +100, one would have doubled their money picking the Chiefs to win the coin toss.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph shine with Super Bowl national anthems\n\nWith nearly as much attention paid to the music as the game during the Super Bowl, the trifecta of artists who took the field Sunday prior to kickoff knew the importance of their platform.\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Babyface were tapped for the honors. Ralph singer infused the Black national anthem - \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" - with the type of gusto exhibited during her Emmy acceptance speech last fall.\n\nBabyface followed with \"America the Beautiful\" and the festivities were capped by Stapleton's rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" that showcased his vocal skills.\n\nRIGHT NOTE:Reviewing the pregame Super Bowl singing performances\n\n- Mellissa Ruggieri\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni, center Jason Kelce both cry during Super Bowl national anthem\n\nAs Chris Stapleton performed the national anthem before the kick of the Super Bowl, cameras found Sirianni and Kelce, both of whom had tears in their eyes.\n\nKelce spoke about tears on the big stage after the Eagles’ Super Bowl 52 victory, saying he would find himself crying in the shower in the lead-up to that game against the New England Patriots.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nDamar Hamlin introduced on field at Super Bowl 57, speaks to Fox's Michael Strahan\n\nThe NFL continues to celebrate the remarkable recovery by Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin from cardiac arrest he suffered in a Jan. 2 game.\n\nHamlin received a warm ovation from the crowd at State Farm Stadium.\n\nEarlier, on Fox's pregame show, Hamlin spoke with Michael Strahan about what he remembered when he made that fateful tackle on Bengals WR Tee Higgins.\n\nHamlin paused for nearly nine seconds.\n\n\"That's something I don't really want to get too deep into, in the detail,\" Hamlin said. \"That's something I'm still trying to work through. Why did it happen to me?\"\n\nThe full interview will air Monday morning on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nEagles fans boo Cowboys QB Dak Prescott pregame\n\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott received a rousing ovation after being recognized as the Walter Payton Man of the Year for his philanthropy and community impact.\n\nBut not the ovation you’d think one would receive for winning one of the NFL’s highest honors.\n\nEagles fans at the Super Bowl booed Prescott, because division rivalries don’t cease even for special awards.\n\nPrescott was a good sport about the reaction he received.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nWith injured ankle, Patrick Mahomes goes for Super Bowl win No. 2\n\nThis is the third Super Bowl start for the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback. Mahomes split his previous two appearances, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 54 before losing the championship game the following season against Tom Brady and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nMahomes’ recovery from a right high-ankle sprain in the divisional playoff and his dart to the sidelines that set up a game-winning field goal to help the Chiefs beat the Bengals in the AFC championship game on Jan. 29 only added to his growing legacy.\n\nMahomes also has a chance to further separate himself from the rest of the current pack of active quarterbacks. With Brady’s retirement, Mahomes could have more rings than any other with his second championship.\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nThree keys to victory in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe pregame hype is finally dying down and the focus of Super Bowl 57 is ready to be turned to the gridiron where it belongs.\n\nBoth the Chiefs and Eagles have been the class of their respective leagues this season, so the most important thing for either team may only be the ability to execute what they already do well.\n\nHere are three keys to winning, according to USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon:\n\nEagles pass rush vs. Chiefs offensive line\n\nChiefs aerial attack vs. Eagles pass defense\n\nEagles rushing offense vs. Chiefs defense\n\nSuper Bowl X-factors: Unknown to hero?\n\nThe Super Bowl is where a relative nobody can become a household name, a place where Malcolm Butler and David Tyree were transformed from obscurity to an association with football's biggest stage, forever.\n\nThe stars will attract the attention and have the most impact on Super Bowl 57. The X-factors, however – the ones the majority of the 100-plus-million viewers do not know – will also play pivotal roles in determining who lifts the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nHere are a few who could find themselves in the spotlight on Sunday, according to USA TODAY Sports' Chris Bumbaca:\n\nEagles DT Jason Hargrave\n\nEagles RB Kenneth Gainwell\n\nChiefs OT Andrew Wylie\n\nChiefs LB Nick Bolton\n\nHow do Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts stack up?\n\nThis margin isn't as wide as you might think. Jalen Hurts, 24, is a star who is going to be a problem in the NFC for a long time. He worked with Tom House this offseason and has refined his mechanics. His ability to compromise defenses with his rushing ability has made it increasingly difficult to defend Philadelphia. And, if the Chiefs use a spy to try to limit what Hurts can do out in open space, it takes away a potential defender Kansas City can use in the secondary.\n\nAll that said, Patrick Mahomes is the most gifted passer in the NFL, possibly of all time. His arm makes it so that the Chiefs can score on any given play. And while he may not rack up rushing yards, his mobility — though it may be tested Sunday by a high ankle sprain — allows him to extend plays and find receivers who can break off their routes.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhere Kansas City has a potential home run hitter in Isiah Pacheco, the Eagles carry significant depth in the backfield. Philadelphia’s top three running backs — Miles Sanders, Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell — are all capable of taking over a game. Just look at Gainwell’s production; he averaged just 3.1 rushes per game in the regular season. In the playoffs, that number has jumped to 13 per and he has responded by leading the Eagles in rushing in both the divisional and conference championship rounds. Sanders, meanwhile, has a nose for the end zone.\n\nPacheco is explosive both rushing the ball and catching it out of the backfield, but Kansas City often doesn’t give him enough touches to be a major factor. The team also activated Clyde Edwards-Helaire (ankle) off of injured reserve and he’d provide a huge boost if he’s able to play.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is perhaps the one position where a team has the strongest advantage over the other. A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith are both star playmakers whose different skill sets complement each other; Brown is physical and quick and can beat defenders with power and Smith is a silky route runner who is elusive in space.\n\nOn the other side, the Chiefs have navigated their first season without Tyreek Hill quite well, with Marquez Valdes-Scantling, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Kadarius Toney making plays. Still, no Kansas City wideout eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in the regular season. Making matters worse for the Chiefs is that they are facing several nagging injuries at the position, with Mecole Hardman placed on injured reserve. Better put this way, Mahomes and the Chiefs system elevate Smith-Schuster, Valdes-Scantling and Toney, while Brown and Smith are stars who would flourish anywhere.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nDallas Goedert has been a solid and steady option for Hurts. But in 14 games this season, including the playoffs, he reached the 100-yard mark only once.\n\nTravis Kelce isn’t just in the conversation for the best tight end in football — he’s already there — he’s in the conversation for the best of all time. Kelce has secured four All-Pro nominations in the last seven seasons, he’s rewriting the record book and he has become Mahomes’ preferred target and a near-unguardable player in the middle of the field.\n\nGoedert does have a clear advantage over Kelce in run blocking; because Philadelphia sets its identity on the ground, Goedert has become a key piece in the scheme. Still, Kelce is generational.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWho are the commentators on FOX NFL Sunday's Super Bowl pregame show?\n\nAs is the case during the regular season, Fox Sports has Curt Menefee hosting its NFL Sunday pregame show, which is being broadcast live at State Farm Stadium.\n\nProviding analysis and commentary are Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, Michael Strahan and Jimmy Johnson. Joining the set for the playoffs is retired NFL tight end-turned-kicker Rob Gronkowski.\n\nReporting from around the stadium: Erin Andrews, Tom Rinaldi, Charissa Thompson and Jay Glazer.\n\nStars from every industry are descending on State Farm Stadium to watch the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn the stadium early was NBA star LeBron James and his wife, Savannah.\n\nEagles superfan Bradley Cooper was also in attendance ready to cheer his team to victory.\n\nRap mogul Jay Z was spotted on the sidelines taking pictures of his daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster, Travis Kelce, Fletcher Cox make fashion statements as kickoff approaches\n\nEveryone knows what the players will be wearing when Super Bowl 57 kicks off. The Chiefs will be wearing white uniforms with red pants, red numerals and yellow trim. The Eagles will be wearing green uniforms with either green or white pants.\n\nHowever, pregame fashions can be any style and color under the rainbow, as evidenced by Chiefs WR JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nNot to be outdone, Chiefs TE Travis Kelce.\n\nAnd then there's Eagles DT Fletcher Cox.\n\nThis is another fascinating battle, as these are two of the top units in the NFL. The Eagles, however, have the best O-line in football. Their communication and ability to work together are unrivaled. They have two of the best players at their positions, center Jason Kelce and right tackle Lane Johnson (both of whom were first-team All-Pro selections). They bore open holes in Nick Sirianni’s zone read offense and are disciplined and clean in avoiding penalties.\n\nBut where Philadelphia has two All-Pros on its offensive line, the Chiefs have a pair of second-teamers in center Creed Humphrey and left guard Joe Thuney. Orlando Brown has been excellent after moving to left tackle and, considering this is a unit that has been remade, it has done a remarkable job of keeping Mahomes clean.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Eagles are five sacks in the Super Bowl from breaking the record of the 1984 Bears for total sacks in the regular and postseason combined (82). Three of Philadelphia’s starting four defensive linemen, defensive tackle Javon Hargrave and defensive ends Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham notched double-digit sack totals in the regular season, as each posted 11. The other starter, defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, is one of the game’s best interior linemen and recorded seven. The unit has depth with end Robert Quinn and tackles Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh coming on in relief.\n\nTo be clear, the Chiefs aren’t bad, they’re just not this good. Chris Jones is a force and the best interior lineman in football and Frank Clark can disrupt the timing and rhythm of opposing offenses. Kansas City just doesn’t have the depth or wealth of star talent to match Philadelphia in this spot.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nIt’s almost unfair to consider Haason Reddick as a pure linebacker, since Philadelphia loves using him in five-man fronts, rushing off the left side of the line of scrimmage — or even at defensive tackle — so his presence is frankly more of a consideration for the defensive line. With that in mind, where this Eagles defense is weakest is at the other two linebacker spots. And, considering that linebackers and safeties are among the players asked to cover tight ends, this could be a spot where the Chiefs exploit Philadelphia, using Travis Kelce.\n\nThe Chiefs unit that included Nick Bolton and Willie Gay Jr. took some time to get settled this season, but it improved after Gay returned from suspension and as the group got healthier. They have speed and excellent range, though they are sometimes caught out of position, in part because of the relative inexperience of Bolton and Gay.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is another spot in which Eagles executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman’s aggressive moves in recent seasons have paid off. The three best players on the unit — corners James Bradberry and Darius Slay and strong safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson — were all acquired via trade or free agency. Bradberry had bounced around the league but found a home in Philadelphia’s defense, earning a second-team All-Pro nod.\n\nFor the Chiefs, cornerback L’Jarius Sneed clearing concussion protocol is a welcome sight; he doesn’t shy away from contact and actually helps out quite a bit in stopping the run along the outside. Trent McDuffie is a player who has perhaps been overlooked, though he has had a huge impact as a press corner. Rounding out the starters, at safety, Justin Reid and Juan Thornhill have become capable players. The biggest issue with the Kansas City secondary is the occasional blown coverage that can lead to chunk plays.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nAs far as kicking and punting goes, this becomes tricky because where the Eagles are strong with place kicker Jake Elliott, the Chiefs are stronger with punter Tommy Townsend, a first-team all-pro. Kansas City place kicker Harrison Butker had the worst season of his career, missing six field goals for a 75% conversion rate. Still, in his last three games, Butker has converted all field goals and extra points.\n\nThe Eagles may be without punter Arryn Siposs (ankle), who has said he is ready to play. He presents an upgrade, though backup Brett Kern has been solid in relief. Where the Chiefs separate themselves is with their return men. Both Isiah Pacheco and Skyy Moore are flashes of lightning who can slip through creases and flip field position.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Chiefs have the wealth of experience and Andy Reid may be the best coach not named Belichick over the last three decades. Offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy should be a head coach. And defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo has kept Kansas City’s defense competitive and loves to disguise blitzes, making it difficult for young quarterbacks to read the field.\n\nThe narrative that the Eagles have had a favorable path to the Super Bowl, while accurate, shouldn’t discount the effort and work it takes to win week in and week out. Coach Nick Sirianni’s players swear by him and offensive coordinator Shane Steichen could end up as a head coach this cycle. The zone read offense the pair have assembled requires defenses to make decisions in split seconds. Defensive line coach Tracy Rocker brings decades of experience and coordinator Jonathan Gannon oversees a unit that has taken a huge stride since last season.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nChiefs unlikely to face 49ers catastrophe if Mahomes gets hurt\n\nThe NFC championship game was a cautionary tale to NFL teams, particularly those vying for a title, about the risks of having only two quarterbacks active on game day.\n\nHowever, if catastrophe befalls the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday in Super Bowl 57, they have a plethora of emergency quarterback options – so many, that it's not immediately clear who would take snaps if presumptive MVP Patrick Mahomes and his, backup, Chad Henne, were unable to go. Obviously, that would be a worst-case scenario. But at least the AFC champs might become so wildly unpredictable that it could keep them in a game – at least temporarily.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEx-Broncos coach helps Eagles prepare for Chiefs offense\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles reportedly brought in some veteran experience ahead of their Super Bowl 57 appearance against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAccording to reports, the Eagles hired Vic Fangio to assist with game preparations that include self-scouting and analysis. NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport reported Fangio signed a two-week contract that is expected to expire after the Super Bowl.\n\nFangio agreed to become the Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator last month.\n\n— Jaylon Thompson\n\nFathers of Super Bowl 57 QBs wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nDuring Super Bowl 57 you will see more than a game. You'll see two Black quarterbacks — raised lovingly by two Black dads (and also by their moms). You will also see one more thing: a stereotype busted.\n\nIf you're looking for the story — the often repeated one, the ever-lasting one, the stereotypical one — of the Black kid who grew up impoverished and still made it. If you're looking for the same ol' story about the Black kid without a father who overcame this and that and the other thing and golly gee, goodness gracious look at him now. Well, this Super Bowl quarterbacks story is not for you.\n\n— Mike Freeman\n\nSpecial game-day deliveries for 2 Chiefs players\n\nJust playing in the big game is already memorable enough, but two members of the Kansas City Chiefs will have even more reason to remember this Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nWhile he was busy preparing to face off against the Philadelphia Eagles, Chiefs guard Nick Allegretti learned his wife Christina went into labor and delivered healthy twin girls early Sunday morning in Chicago.\n\nAt about the same time the Allegretti girls were arriving, Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman was frantically tweeting that his girlfriend Chariah Gordon was also about ready to give birth.\n\nThere could also be another Super Bowl baby before long on the other sideline.\n\nEagles center Jason Kelce and his wife Kylie are also expecting a baby.\n\nAndy Reid could win second Super Bowl – against his former team\n\nReid, 64, is a no-nonsense coach who has become endearing, never too shy to be himself or make others laugh at his own expense. He proudly wears Hawaiian shirts and professes his love for a good cheeseburger. He’s also one of the most accomplished coaches.\n\nReid was the Eagles’ coach for 14 seasons (1999-2012) and did mostly everything for the franchise – six NFC East titles, five NFC title games, one Super Bowl appearance – except win it all.\n\nWhen he was fired by Philadelphia, Kansas City pounced at the opportunity to hire him, and it has been rewarded with 10 winning seasons, nine playoff berths and a Super Bowl during the 2019 season.\n\nReid has the respect and the résumé to match, and he has an opportunity to solidify his Hall of Fame career with a second Super Bowl title. To do it against his former team would be special, too.\n\nSUPER BOWL STORYLINES: Reid, Kelce brothers, Mahomes' ankle all worth watching\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nWho will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nWhile the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles take a break from shining bright like a diamond, Rihanna will be the Super Bowl 57 halftime show performer.\n\nIt's a show that's so exciting, at least one player is hoping to catch a glimpse.\n\nThe nine-time Grammy award-winner will perform a slew of hits with (or maybe without) some surprise guests. This will be her first public performance since 2018 when she performed DJ Khaled's \"Wild Thoughts\" at the Grammys.\n\n– Victoria Hernandez\n\nWith 10 Super Bowl appearances, Tom Brady has made his mark on the game's history, setting a plethora of individual records.\n\nBrady, who made 10 Super Bowl appearances with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice – who appeared in four Super Bowls during his career with the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders – hold multiple standards in the NFL's annual championship showcase.\n\nFrom a team perspective, Brady's New England Patriots and Rice's San Francisco 49ers figure prominently.\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any legendary marks be surpassed in Super Bowl 57?\n\nSUPER BOWL HISTORY: All-time results, winners, MVPs, more\n\nSUPER BOWL HIGHLIGHTS: Nate Davis' 57 greatest moments in Super Bowl lore\n\nHow 'No crush, no rush' slogan has Philadelphia Eagles defense on historic sack pace\n\nThe four-word phrase coined by defensive ends and outside linebackers coach Jeremiah Washburn means the defense has to stop the run to earn the right to rush the quarterback. Entering Super Bowl 57, the defense has lived up to its motto.\n\n“If you don’t stop the run, you can’t pass rush nobody,” Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham said. “You got to take care of business. Early on, you got to send a message and let them know what the game is gonna be. You got to be the dictators. That’s any defense that wants to win a game, you got to let them know what it’s gonna be for the day.”\n\nThe Eagles had the NFL’s second ranked defense in the regular season and the unit hasn’t given up more than seven points in each of its postseason wins leading up to Super Bowl 57. When it comes to rushing the quarterback, the Eagles are on an historic pace.\n\nThe Eagles defense has amassed 78 total sacks across the regular season and postseason, the third most in NFL history. Philadelphia is three sacks away from surpassing the 1985 Chicago Bears for the second most sacks ever and five sacks shy of eclipsing the 1984 Bears (82 sacks) for the NFL single-season record.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nJoe Biden's pregame Super Bowl interview with Fox called off\n\nPresident Joe Biden won’t be giving a pregame Super Bowl interview to Fox Soul after all.\n\nPresidents in recent years have granted wide-ranging interviews to the network hosting the Super Bowl. But last week there was confusion over whether Biden would follow the tradition.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted Friday that Biden had been looking forward to an interview on Fox Soul, a streaming sister service to the conservative Fox News. But she said the White House had been informed that the network’s parent company, Fox Corp., canceled the interview.\n\nBiden did pregame interviews with CBS in 2021 and with NBC in 2022.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n'Superhero?' What other Chiefs say about QB Patrick Mahomes\n\nPatrick Mahomes exploded into an NFL superstar almost from the moment when he became the Kansas City Chiefs' starting quarterback in 2018, the year he also won his first MVP trophy.\n\nBut what we all see is not necessarily what Mahomes' teammates see.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports closely monitored and asked Chiefs players and coaches during the days leading up to the big game about what it's like being around their intrepid leader, and some common themes quickly emerged.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEagles' success starts at the top\n\nTo compare the team-building philosophies of the Philadelphia Eagles and last year's Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams, and classify them as similar would be to miss the point.\n\nThere is a difference between mortgaging the future and having a foundation for continued success in place. The Rams, quite literally, employed a “(expletive) them picks” strategy. The Eagles have a pair of first-round picks in the 2023 draft and Jalen Hurts, an MVP-level quarterback on a rookie (second-round selection) contract.\n\nLeadership starts at the top. Knowing the right time to push the chips toward the middle is essential to winning it all, and Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has given general manager Howie Roseman, who has been with the organization since 2000, the latitude – and payroll – to be aggressive.\n\nIn Super Bowl 57 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Roseman's fingerprints will be all over the field.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\n'Special' Super Bowl for Black quarterbacks\n\nWhen Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts take the field Feb. 12, they will be the first two Black quarterbacks to start against each other in the Super Bowl. It’s an accomplishment both quarterbacks fully embrace.\n\n“It is history. It’s come a long way. I think there has only been (eight) African American quarterbacks to play in a Super Bowl. To be the first for something is pretty cool. I know it’ll be a good one,” Hurts, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, told reporters Thursday. “It’s history.”\n\nThere will be eight Black quarterbacks to start in a Super Bowl once the championship game kicks off: Doug Williams, Steve McNair, Donovan McNabb, Colin Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, Cam Newton, Mahomes and Hurts.\n\n– Tyler Dragon\n\nTHE 100-YEAR LONG ROAD: Fritz Pollard paved the way for Hurts, Mahomes\n\nOPINION: Fathers of Super Bowl 57 quarterbacks wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nReport: Colts target Eagles offensive coordinator as next head coach\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts have reached a decision on who they want as their next head coach – but the process will have to wait until Super Bowl 57 concludes.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen is the Colts' top choice, and, according to ESPN, the team has already begun informing the other candidates that they are no longer being considered.\n\nSteichen, 37, has run the Eagles offense for the past two seasons. On the way to reaching the Super Bowl, Philadelphia ranked first in rushing yards and third in points per game in 2022. That would seem to mesh well with the Colts, whose offense revolves around 2021 NFL rushing champion Jonathan Taylor.\n\nIn addition, the Arizona Cardinals plan to interview Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon for their head coaching vacancy, according to NFL.com.\n\nEx-Eagles, Chiefs coach Dick Vermeil can't pick a favorite\n\nDick Vermeil led the Philadelphia Eagles to the franchise’s first Super Bowl appearance. He also finished his Hall of Fame career coaching the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSo, in what direction is Vermeil’s allegiance flowing for Super Bowl 57?\n\n“I’ve put in my frame of mind right now, philosophically, I’m going to root for both teams to win,” Vermeil told USA TODAY Sports. “And I’ll feel very bad for the team that loses.”\n\nThe only person other than Andy Reid to have coached both the Eagles and the Chiefs, Vermeil, 86, won’t even be inside State Farm Stadium on Sunday.\n\n– Jarrett Bell\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any of these marks be broken in Super Bowl 57?\n\nJason or Travis?

He's never had a losing season. Never lost back-to-back regular-season games. His win percentage (.807) ranks sixth among active head coaches with tenures of at least 100 games, ahead of Dabo Swinney (.805) and Nick Saban (.801).\n\n\"People are like, 'You have the (sixth)-highest win percentage in college football right now,' \" he said. \"And I’m like, 'Yeah, but I’m the third-best coach in my own family.' \"\n\nThat would be behind middle brother Jay, who coached their high school alma mater to three New York state title games, winning two.\n\nAnd behind youngest brother, Nick, who will of course make his Super Bowl debut when the Philadelphia Eagles face the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.\n\n\"In my opinion, until Nick wins a Super Bowl, Jay’s got two state championships,\" Mike said. \"So to me, I’m still voting him No. 1.\"\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nGannett may earn revenue from Tipico for audience referrals to betting services.

Or do we give you some little quick salads that the First Lady will make, along with the Second Lady — they'll make some salads.\n\n\"(No), I said, you guys aren't into salads.\"\n\nThough the White House did not initially detail the amount of fast food and its costs, Trump said he ordered \"about 1,000 hamburgers\" for the group. He believed the football players would enjoy the meal because they have some \"very large people that like eating.\"\n\nThe result was an unusual scene in the East Room, where empty boxes of Big Macs sat atop intricately embroidered tablecloths and the ornate room smelled lightly of grease.\n\nAs the Clemson contingent finished eating, Trump stepped to the podium and spent much of his time praising the Tigers' 44-16 win over the Crimson Tide. He singled out wide receiver Hunter Renfrow, defensive coordinator Brent Venables, cornerback A.J. Terrell and Lawrence in his remarks.\n\n\"Oh I want to be the agent for that tall, handsome quarterback,\" Trump said of Lawrence. \"Six foot seven, they say great athlete, and he's accurate. That's nice.\"\n\nIt was the Tigers' second trip to the White House in less than two years, making Clemson the only repeat visitor among championship sports teams since Trump took office. The program previously met with Trump in the summer of 2017, roughly five months after its previous title-game victory that completed the 2016 season.\n\nMonday's celebration also came just seven days after the national title game — an unusually quick turnaround for a team's White House visit.\n\nTrump announced the visit in a tweet Friday, and expressed excitement about the unique menu for the event Monday morning before flying to New Orleans to address the American Farm Bureau Federation's convention. Clemson, meanwhile, spent part of Monday afternoon on the National Mall, including a pit stop at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n\"What a fun day it's been,\" Swinney said during his remarks in the East Room. \"It's an honor to be a part of this tradition, and to be honest with you, it's really cool that football can create an opportunity like this.\"\n\nWhite House visits have long been a tradition for championship teams and athletes, but they have become increasingly sporadic under Trump. None of the four NCAA men's and women's basketball champions have visited the White House under Trump, nor have the two-time NBA champion Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe most recent NFL champions, the Philadelphia Eagles, were initially invited to visit last summer before Trump learned that they would not be sending a large delegation and rescinded the invitation. The defending World Series champion Red Sox have accepted a White House invitation but a date for the visit has yet to be announced.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/14"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nNASA’s first spacecraft designed to study a metallic asteroid won’t be launching this year as planned, according to an announcement made by the agency on Friday.\n\nThe Psyche mission’s 2022 launch window, which opened on August 1 and closes on October 11, will come to an end before the spacecraft’s flight software is ready. A delay in delivering the software and its testing equipment has prevented the Psyche team from having enough time for testing prior to launch.\n\nEngineers want to be absolutely sure that the software will function as expected once the spacecraft is in flight.\n\nUsed to control the spacecraft’s orientation as it flies through space, guidance and navigation software help point its antenna toward Earth for communications and relaying data. The software also provides the spacecraft’s propulsion system with trajectory information.\n\nDuring testing at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, engineers discovered a compatibility issue in the software’s test bed simulators. The issue has since been corrected, but there isn’t enough time for a full checkout and launch in 2022.\n\nThe space agency will form an independent assessment team to review the mission and determine a path forward, including estimated costs and potential launch opportunities in 2023 and 2024. The Psyche spacecraft is currently housed at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nEngineers prepare the Psyche spacecraft inside a clean room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, on April 11. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Flying to a distant metal-rich asteroid, using Mars for a gravity assist on the way there, takes incredible precision. We must get it right. Hundreds of people have put remarkable effort into Psyche during this pandemic, and the work will continue as the complex flight software is thoroughly tested and assessed,” said JPL Director Laurie Leshin. “The decision to delay the launch wasn’t easy, but it is the right one.”\n\nTiming for the mission makes things difficult moving forward. A 2022 launch would have delivered the spacecraft to the asteroid, also known as Psyche, by 2026. But launch periods in the coming years mean that the spacecraft would arrive much later due to different orbital positions, such as 2029 or 2030.\n\n“Our amazing team has overcome almost all of the incredible challenges of building a spacecraft during Covid,” said Lindy Elkins-Tanton, Psyche’s principal investigator and foundation and regents professor at Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration.\n\n“We have conquered numerous hardware and software challenges, and we’ve been stopped in the end by this one last problem. We just need a little more time and will get this one licked, too. The team is ready to move forward, and I’m so grateful for their excellence.”\n\nThe delay will also halt two projects that were set to ride along with Psyche on the same SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket at launch.\n\nThe first is NASA’s Janus mission, which was designed to study twin binary asteroid systems, and the second is the Deep Space Optical Communications technology demonstration. This demo is designed to test high-data-rate laser communications that could change the way ground teams communicate with spacecraft across deep space.\n\nThe spacecraft also has a number of innovations, like ion propulsion rather than traditional rocket fuel.\n\nIf the decision is made to launch Psyche in the coming years, the spacecraft will embark on a 280 million-mile (450 million-kilometer) journey. The Psyche asteroid is so metal-rich, some scientists believe it’s the exposed core of a planetesimal, or a planet in the making that separated into layers.\n\nCollisions with other celestial objects over time might have stripped away the outer layers, exposing the remaining metallic core. If Psyche truly is a core, studying it would be like peering inside the very heart of a planet like Earth.\n\nThe potato-shaped asteroid only appears as a fuzzy blur to ground- and space-based telescopes.

Multiple countries are also planning to send robotic explorers to the moon as they prepare for returning humans to the lunar surface.\n\nAnd don’t miss our outlook for all of the full moons, meteor showers and eclipses to see in 2022 – including the Quadrantid meteor shower this weekend.\n\nDig this\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered evidence of an ancient mystery at a quarry.\n\nThe bones of five mammoths were discovered alongside Neanderthal stone tools. Together, these finds provide a revealing look at life in Britain during the ice age 200,000 years ago.\n\nThe dig site and its finds, the subject of a new Sir David Attenborough documentary, seem to represent a mammoth graveyard – but the investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe bones and tools were also found in proximity to other shockingly well-preserved remnants from a time period researchers are still trying to understand.\n\nFantastic creatures\n\nThis image depicts beautiful iridescent beetles, with the male (left) and female (right) side by side, discovered in India.

It is mostly only visible from the Southern Hemisphere and is one of the “pointers” to the Southern Cross constellation that appears on the country’s flag, according to Reuters.\n\nMonday’s event also made history for Australia as the first commercial space launch in the country. It was the first of three launches, with a further two planned for July 4 and July 12. These will carry out astrophysical studies that can only be done from the Southern Hemisphere, according to NASA.\n\nMichael Jones, executive chairman and group CEO of ELA, said it was a historic night.\n\n“We could never have dreamed of having such a supportive, experienced and professional partner as NASA. They have been unbelievably generous in helping us through this journey and we will be a much better organization for their support,” Jones said in a statement.\n\n“Today’s launch not only puts ELA at the forefront of global commercial space launch, it also confirms that we and Australia can provide access to space and this is just the beginning for us,” he added.\n\nAustralian National University astrophysicist Brad Tucker, who was on site to watch the launch, said wind and rain beforehand had caused some nervousness about whether it would go ahead.\n\nBut after a delay of more than an hour, excitement broke out as the rocket took off.\n\n“At that final time, nearly everyone ran outside to see the launch and watch in awe.

That board issued a report on May 30 finding that steps taken by NASA and the California Institute of Technology since November to get the delayed mission back on track have been “outstanding\" and have \"exceeded expectations,\" according to the Monday announcement.\n\nThe JPL, which the California Institute of Technology manages on behalf of NASA, now lists the launch window as Oct. 5-25.\n\nMars live stream:Watch spacecraft stream images from red planet in first-its-kind event\n\n“I am pleased with the independent review board’s resoundingly positive assessment of JPL’s hard work in correcting the issues outlined in the board’s original report,” Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a statement. “We know the work is not over. As we move forward, we will work with JPL to ensure these implemented changes continue to be prioritized to position Psyche and the other missions in JPL’s portfolio for success.”\n\nWhat caused the delay?\n\nPsyche team members scuttled plans last year to launch the spacecraft before the launch window closed on Oct. 11 partially due to concerns that the in-flight software was not ready, NASA said in October.\n\nThe review board, led by retired aerospace executive A. Thomas Young, also concluded that workforce issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the delay.\n\nIn response, the Psyche mission added more team members, reorganized part of its workforce and adopted metrics to ensure that the launch was on track. Among the changes was an update to the JPL's hybrid work policy to increase the number of days team members spend together onsite each week.\n\nThe review board's report also noted improvements to senior management’s oversight of the mission, according to NASA.\n\nMore:Two minerals, never-before-seen on Earth, found in one of planet's largest known meteorites\n\n“The independent review board is extraordinarily impressed by the accomplishments of the total JPL organization and Caltech,” the report authors noted. “Engagement in and leadership of the overall response process by the JPL director and senior leadership is deemed ‘world class.'\"\n\nWhat is the Psyche mission?\n\nNASA began planning its Psyche mission in 2017 to investigate the previously unexplored metallic asteroid of the same name as part of the agency’s Discovery Program formed in 1992.\n\nThis October, the Psyche spacecraft will finally embark on a 280 million-mile journey, reaching the asteroid Psyche in August 2029.\n\nFrom 2017:NASA planning mission to an asteroid worth $10,000 quadrillion\n\nAssembly of the spacecraft is complete except for the installation of the solar arrays and the imagers, which were to be reinstalled before June.\n\nThis month, the mission begins its final assembly, test, and launch operations. Engineers and technicians from NASA’s JPL will return to Astrotech Space Operations Facility near NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where they will work until the launch.\n\nScientists hope that as Psyche orbits the metallic asteroid for 26 months, secrets could be revealed of Earth's own core, as well as those of other terrestrial planets.\n\nAs planetary bodies take shape within star-circling rings of gas and dust, they may be smashed, broken up, vaporized or face other mayhem. Few become terrestrial planets like Earth — atmospheres intact with metallic interiors and outer crusts.\n\nPsyche — a 140-mile wide chunk of metal and rock on the solar system's asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter — didn't turn out that way. NASA scientists theorize that the asteroid could be a partial exposed core composed of nickel-iron, the shattered remnants of an early planet.\n\nEarth's own metallic core is unreachable, far below the planet's rocky mantle and crust. But if Psyche is indeed a core, scientists believe that studying it could yield valuable insights about the heart of our own planet.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Can you tell me why this is happening? The amount that is falling seems to be a lot more than normal.\n\nA: It’s normal for all types of citrus trees to drop some immature fruit at this time of year. This self-thinning is nature’s way of making sure the tree does not become too overburdened with fruit. However, if your tree is dropping a lot of the immature fruit then it could be for one of several reasons. I have listed a few of the most common ones below.\n\nChanges in weather can stress your citrus tree and cause fruit to drop. We have experienced some extremes in the weather the past couple of weeks, with an almost 50-degree difference in temperatures from one day to the next. I’m not sure what variety of Mandarin you have, but the Satsuma Mandarins — while cold tolerant — are very sensitive to the heat and are more likely to drop immature fruit than other varieties when temperatures spike in May and June.\n\nThere is not a lot you can do to change the weather, but you can help mitigate the stress on your tree by keeping the tree well-watered when the temperature spikes. If your tree is in a pot, this may mean watering it every day.\n\nDroughted trees can be another cause of fruit drop and, if the lack of water is severe enough or occurs frequently, may also cause leaves to yellow and fall off the tree.\n\nUniversity of California Cooperative Extension professor Nick Sakovich wrote in the U.C. Agriculture and Natural Resources bulletin, “Water stress during the late spring/early summer can cause a yield reduction, otherwise known as June drop (although some drop is normal). Once we get past that period, trees can tolerate substantial water stress without crop loss. However, what will happen if we don't apply adequate water will be a significant reduction in fruit size.”\n\nTo prevent excessive fruit drop from happening make sure to water deeply and frequently during hot spells. Adding a layer of mulch under your tree can help protect the tree from drying out between watering and subsequently protect against the loss of immature fruit.\n\nMore stories:\n\nWhat's causing the spots on the leaves of my tomato plants?\n\nNorth State farmers markets are back for summer. Here's how they're adapting to COVID-19\n\nA nitrogen deficiency can also be the cause of fruit drop. This time of year is when trees need the most nutrients as they are blooming and setting fruit. Mandarin trees need between one and 1.5 pounds of actual nitrogen per year. This works out to a total yearly application of approximately eight to 12 pounds of a fertilizer formulated for citrus. The University of California recommends applying fertilizer in three applications spread out over the spring and summer months. For our climate, I suggest applying these three applications in February, April and June.\n\nExcessive pruning or a severe pest infestation can also cause excess fruit drop.\n\nFor more information on growing citrus, check out the University of California’s citrus growing resources on “The California Backyard Orchard” website at https://bit.ly/2XW4pIr.\n\nThe Shasta Master Gardeners Program can be reached by phone at 242-2219 or email mastergardener@shastacollege.edu.

I need to know if you want to live. I don’t even know if you can hear me, but if you can hear me and you want to live, please squeeze my hand.’\n\n“And I waited and waited,” she continued, voice cracking. “And all of a sudden, he squeezed really hard. And I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ And then I’m thinking, ‘Oh, crap! What am I going to do?’ “\n\nStrathdee would place cool cloths on her husband's forehead during his extended illness to try to break his many fevers. Steffanie Strathdee\n\nWhat she accomplished next could easily be called miraculous. First, Strathdee found an obscure treatment that offered a glimmer of hope – fighting superbugs with phages, viruses created by nature to eat bacteria.\n\nThen she convinced phage scientists around the country to hunt and peck through molecular haystacks of sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria and their viral opponents. The impossible goal: quickly find the few, exquisitely unique phages capable of fighting a specific strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria literally eating her husband alive.\n\nNext, the US Food and Drug Administration had to greenlight this unproven cocktail of hope, and scientists had to purify the mixture so that it wouldn’t be deadly.\n\nYet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body – and save his life.\n\nHer journey is one of unrelenting perseverance and unbelievable good fortune. It’s a glowing tribute to the immense kindness of strangers. And it’s a story that just might save countless lives from the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs – maybe even your own.\n\n“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year – that’s one person every three seconds – is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” Strathdee told the Life Itself audience.\n\n“We have been caught for the last 2 1/2 years in this terrible situation where viruses have been the bad guy,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that the enemy of my enemy can be my friend. Viruses can be medicine.”\n\nHow does a virus eat bacteria? 14:22 - Source: CNN\n\nA terrifying vacation\n\nDuring a Thanksgiving cruise on the Nile in 2015, Patterson was suddenly felled by severe stomach cramps. When a clinic in Egypt failed to help his worsening symptoms, Patterson was flown to Germany, where doctors discovered a grapefruit-size abdominal abscess filled with Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent bacterium resistant to nearly all antibiotics.\n\nFound in the sands of the Middle East, the bacteria were blown into the wounds of American troops hit by roadside bombs during the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname “Iraqibacter.”\n\n“Veterans would get shrapnel in their legs and bodies from IED explosions and were medevaced home to convalesce,” Strathdee told CNN, referring to improvised explosive devices. “Unfortunately, they brought their superbug with them. Sadly, many of them survived the bomb blasts but died from this deadly bacterium.”\n\nToday, Acinetobacter baumannii tops the World Health Organization’s list of dangerous pathogens for which new antibiotics are critically needed.\n\n“It’s something of a bacterial kleptomaniac. It’s really good at stealing antimicrobial resistance genes from other bacteria,” Strathdee told Life Itself attendees. “I started to realize that my husband was a lot sicker than I thought and that modern medicine had run out of antibiotics to treat him.”\n\nWith the bacteria growing unchecked inside him, Patterson was soon medevaced to the couple’s hometown of San Diego, where he was a psychiatry professor and Strathdee was the associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n“Tom was on a roller coaster – he’d get better for a few days, and then there would be a deterioration, and he would be very ill,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was a longtime friend and colleague. As weeks turned into months, “Tom began developing multi-organ failure. He was sick enough that we could lose him any day.”\n\nPatterson's body was systemically infected with a virulent drug-resistant bacteria that also infected troops in the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname \"Iraqibacter.\" Steffanie Strathdee\n\nSearching for a needle in a haystack\n\nAfter that reassuring hand squeeze from her husband, Strathdee sprang into action. Scouring the internet, she had already stumbled across a study by a Tbilisi, Georgia, researcher on the use of phages for treatment of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nA phone call later, Strathdee discovered phage treatment was well established in former Soviet bloc countries but had been discounted long ago as “fringe science” in the West.\n\n“Phages are everywhere. There’s 10 million trillion trillion – that’s 10 to the power of 31 – phages that are thought to be on the planet,” Strathdee said. “They’re in soil, they’re in water, in our oceans and in our bodies, where they are the gatekeepers that keep our bacterial numbers in check. But you have to find the right phage to kill the bacterium that is causing the trouble.”\n\nBuoyed by her newfound knowledge, Strathdee began reaching out to scientists who worked with phages: “I wrote cold emails to total strangers, begging them for help,” she said at Life Itself.\n\nOne stranger who quickly answered was Texas A&M University biochemist Ryland Young. He’s been working with phages for nearly 45 years.\n\n“You know the word persuasive? There’s nobody as persuasive as Steffanie,” said Young, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics who runs the lab at the university’s Center for Phage Technology. “We just dropped everything. No exaggeration, people were literally working 24/7, screening 100 different environmental samples to find just a couple of new phages.”\n\n‘No problem’\n\nWhile the Texas lab burned the midnight oil, Schooley tried to obtain FDA approval for the injection of the phage cocktail into Patterson. Because phage therapy has not undergone clinical trials in the United States, each case of “compassionate use” required a good deal of documentation. It’s a process that can consume precious time.\n\nBut the woman who answered the phone at the FDA said, ” ‘No problem. This is what you need, and we can arrange that,’ ” Schooley recalled. “And then she tells me she has friends in the Navy that might be able to find some phages for us as well.”\n\nIn fact, the US Naval Medical Research Center had banks of phages gathered from seaports around the world. Scientists there began to hunt for a match, “and it wasn’t long before they found a few phages that appeared to be active against the bacterium,” Strathdee said.\n\nDrs. Robert \"Chip\" Schooley (left) and Dr. Randy Taplitz after injecting Patterson with the first round of phages at UC San Diego Medical Center. Carly DeMento\n\nBack in Texas, Young and his team had also gotten lucky. They found four promising phages that ravaged Patterson’s antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a test tube. Now the hard part began – figuring out how to separate the victorious phages from the soup of bacterial toxins left behind.\n\n“You put one virus particle into a culture, you go home for lunch, and if you’re lucky, you come back to a big shaking, liquid mess of dead bacteria parts among billions and billions of the virus,” Young said. “You want to inject those virus particles into the human bloodstream, but you’re starting with bacterial goo that’s just horrible. You would not want that injected into your body.”\n\nPurifying phage to be given intravenously was a process that no one had yet perfected in the US, Schooley said, “but both the Navy and Texas A&M got busy, and using different approaches figured out how to clean the phages to the point they could be given safely.”\n\nMore hurdles: Legal staff at Texas A&M expressed concern about future lawsuits. “I remember the lawyer saying to me, ‘Let me see if I get this straight. You want to send unapproved viruses from this lab to be injected into a person who will probably die.’ And I said, “Yeah, that’s about it,’ ” Young said.\n\n“But Stephanie literally had speed dial numbers for the chancellor and all the people involved in human experimentation at UC San Diego. After she calls them, they basically called their counterparts at A&M, and suddenly they all began to work together,” Young added.\n\n“It was like the parting of the Red Sea – all the paperwork and hesitation disappeared.”\n\n‘It was just miraculous’\n\nThe purified cocktail from Young’s lab was the first to arrive in San Diego. Strathdee watched as doctors injected the Texas phages into the pus-filled abscesses in Patterson’s abdomen before settling down for the agonizing wait.\n\n“We started with the abscesses because we didn’t know what would happen, and we didn’t want to kill him,” Schooley said. “We didn’t see any negative side effects; in fact, Tom seemed to be stabilizing a bit, so we continued the therapy every two hours.”\n\nTwo days later, the Navy cocktail arrived. Those phages were injected into Patterson’s bloodstream to tackle the bacteria that had spread to the rest of his body.\n\n“We believe Tom was the first person to receive intravenous phage therapy to treat a systemic superbug infection in the US,” Strathdee told CNN.\n\n“And three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”\n\nPatterson awoke from a coma after receiving an intravenous dose of phages tailored to his bacteria. Steffanie Strathdee\n\nA legacy\n\nToday, more than six years later, Patterson is happily retired, walking 3 miles a day and gardening. The couple are back to traveling the world. But the long illness took its toll: Patterson was diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependent, with mild heart damage, no feeling in the bottoms of his feet and gut damage that affects his diet.\n\n“But we’re not complaining! I mean every day is a gift, right? People say, ‘Oh, my God, all the planets had to line up for this couple,’ and we know how lucky we are,” Strathdee said.\n\n“We don’t think phages are ever going to entirely replace antibiotics, but they will be a good adjunct to antibiotics. And in fact, they can even make antibiotics work better,” she added.\n\n“We feel like we need to tell our story so that other people can get this treatment more easily.”\n\nTo do so, the couple published a memoir: “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug.”\n\nStrathdee and Schooley have opened the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, where they treat or counsel patients suffering from multidrug resistant infections. And Schooley will soon start clinical trials using phages on a deadly antibiotic-resistant bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that attack patients with cystic fibrosis.\n\n\"The Perfect Predator\" is a blow-by-blow account by the couple of the fight to save Patterson's life. Hachette Books\n\nPatterson’s case was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in 2017, jump-starting new scientific interest in phage therapy.\n\n“And there’s been many other labs that have joined in – Yale now has a phage therapy program, Baylor, Brussels … the Australians, Lyon, France, and more,” Strathdee told the Life Itself audience.\n\n“What we need next is a phage library,” she continued. “We don’t want to have to go from bog to bedside every time we need phages, right? We want to be able to go to a walk-in cooler and source phages that are characterized and cataloged and personalize them for patients.”\n\nStrathdee is quick to acknowledge the many people who helped save her husband’s life. But those who were along for the ride told CNN that she and Patterson made the difference – and continue to search for a solution to the growing superbug crisis.\n\n“I think it was a historical accident that could have only happened to Steffanie and Tom,” Young said. “They were at UC San Diego, which is one of the premier universities in the country. They worked with a brilliant infectious disease doctor who said, ‘Yes,’ to phage therapy when most physicians would’ve said, ‘Hell, no, I won’t do that.’\n\n“And then there is Steffanie’s passion and energy – it’s hard to explain until she’s focused it on you. It was like a spiderweb; she was in the middle and pulled on strings,” Young added. “It was just meant to be because of her, I think.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/natural-gas-ban-preemptive-laws-gop-climate/index.html", "title": "Natural gas bans: 20 states have laws that prohibit cities from ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn 2019, the city council in Berkeley, California, held a stunning vote: it would ban natural gas hookups in all new building construction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the city’s impact on the climate crisis.\n\nNo gas furnaces in new homes, the council said. No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law. It’s meant a lot of active outreach to local developers building in Flagstaff, encouraging them to build all-electric housing developments. It’s also reaching out to residents whose gas appliances are at the end of their lifecycles to consider buying electric.\n\n“Our challenge here is we have a 2030 deadline” to get to net-zero, Antonopoulos told CNN. “The urgency is so great so sometimes we don’t have that luxury in time.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Mejia Cunningham was speaking on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/11/foods-longest-shelf-life-expiration-date/39924813/", "title": "Foods with the longest shelf life: How long do these foods stay good?", "text": "Colman Andrews\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome foods have naturally long shelf lives, and if stored properly, will keep for months or years. Other foods spoil quickly, usually due to a high oil and/or moisture content, and will last a long time only if they’re dried, canned or otherwise preserved. There are numerous foods that spoil faster than you’d think.\n\nThere is great interest in long-lived foods among so-called preppers or survivalists, who anticipate having to live off the grid when widespread calamity strikes. Embracing the idea of lengthy self-sufficiency, they exchange tips on stockpiling particularly long-lasting foods.\n\nYou don’t have to be worried about doomsday, however, to see the advantages of stocking a pantry with things that will be good to eat for long periods of time. Unexpected guests, power failures and simply the kind of inertia that makes a trip to the market or going out to eat just too much of a project – these are all instances when anyone would be glad to have shelves stocked with the makings of a meal.\n\nFrom Charlottesville to Champaign:40 places young people are moving\n\nCurbing bad behavior, growing users:Why Twitter stock popped 20% in July\n\nMany kinds of food, including both fresh and dried produce, are known for their longevity. 24/7 Tempo has assembled a representative list of examples in many categories, including some that will last for weeks, and some that are virtually immortal.\n\nIn all cases, the estimated shelf life is for foods stored at room temperature or slightly cooler – not in the refrigerator or freezer, both of which will extend the lifespan of most items substantially. Evolving technology has brought many more options to the grocery store freezer, and there are a number of foods you couldn’t buy frozen 35 years ago.\n\nNote that moisture and high temperatures will shorten the lives of most foods, and that foods tend to change over time in color, texture, and/or flavor – so while they may last months or years, they may be at their prime somewhat earlier.\n\n1. Potatoes\n\n• Shelf life: 2 to 5 weeks\n\nIf stored in a cool, dry, dark place. Yukon Gold, red, and fingerling potatoes will last from two to three weeks. Larger white or russet potatoes can last for three to five weeks. Sweet potatoes have about the same shelf life. Don't store them next to onions, however: The two might go together well in cooking, but raw, each gives off gases and moisture that might cause the other to spoil faster.\n\n2. Onions\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 months\n\nAs with potatoes, store these in a cool, dry, dark place for maximum longevity. And, as above, don't store them with potatoes; both will spoil faster.\n\n3. Peanuts\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 months\n\nPeanuts in their shell, especially when kept cool and dry, are perfectly happy in the pantry for as long as two months.\n\n4. Winter squash\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 3 months\n\nThe various kinds of thick-skinned winter squash – including butternut, spaghetti, acorn, kabocha, and hubbard, among others – are among the most durable of fresh vegetables.\n\n5. Apples\n\n• Shelf life: 5 days to 6 months\n\nApples kept in a fruit bowl at room temperature will generally last five to seven days. When stored in a humid place at a temperature of 30º to 40º F, however, they can stay crisp and fresh for as long as six months.\n\n6. Tea\n\n• Shelf life: 6 to 12 months past \"best by\" date\n\nDried tea leaves, whether loose (in a sealed container) or in teabags (in an unopened box) can easily last a year or more if they're not subjected to moisture or humidity. The tea does tend to lose flavor over time, though.\n\n7. Powdered milk\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 1½ years\n\nThe color, texture, or flavor of powdered milk might change as it ages, but it will still be perfectly usable and safe for at least 18 months.\n\n8. Beef jerky\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 years\n\nBeef jerky and its predecessors in various parts of the world were invented to last a long time as sustenance in the wilderness and on long journeys. It's lean, dry, and salted – all qualities that add to its ability to stay edible for a long time.\n\n9. Canned fruits and vegetables\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 years past \"best by\" date\n\nCanning is an extremely efficient means of preserving food. Generally speaking, if canned foods aren't subjected to intense heat, their contents should stay good for two years or more. Beware, however, of dented cans or those with swollen tops, which may indicate the presence of bacteria inside.\n\n10. Dried pasta\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 years past \"best by\" date\n\nMade with just semolina flour and water, then thoroughly dried, this pasta is fairly indestructible. Its richer counterpart, fresh pasta, usually made with eggs, is much more perishable and should always be kept refrigerated.\n\n11. Bouillon cubes\n\n• Shelf life: 2 years\n\nOxygen and moisture are the enemies of these useful little blocks of instant soup or stock. Keep them dry and well sealed, and 24 months is probably the minimum they'll last.\n\n12. Peanut butter\n\n• Shelf life: 2 years\n\nAn unopened jar of peanut butter should last longer than a couple of years at room temperature, but with time, the oil will separate, the peanut butter might dry out, and the flavor may fade. Two years is likely the maximum for the best quality.\n\n13. Dark chocolate\n\n• Shelf life: 2 to 5 years\n\nBecause milk chocolate contains dairy, it will go bad more quickly than chocolate with high cacao content and little or no milk. Warm temperatures are the enemy of dark chocolate, and while it should last for a couple of years at temperatures up to around 75º F, it will keep for as long as five years if the thermometer rests between 60º and 65º F. Chocolate exposed to high temperatures can develop white spots, but these are harmless and don't affect the flavor.\n\n14. Canned or vacuum-pouched tuna\n\n• Shelf life: 3 to 5 years after \"best by\" date\n\nTuna is a hardy fish and one that takes well to canning (and in more recent times, to vacuum-packing in pouches). For optimum flavor and texture, don't keep it longer than five years after the producer's \"best by\" date.\n\n15. Dried beans\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nDried beans are pretty much indestructible if they're kept dry, though they begin to lose their moisture after a year or two. As they age, they will require longer pre-soaking and/or cooking times to become tender.\n\n16. Honey\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nThough honey is often sold with a \"best by\" date (usually somewhere between two and five years from the time it's packaged), that's because over time it may darken and form sugar crystals – perfectly harmless, but off-putting to some consumers. Pure 100% undiluted honey in an unopened jar (stored away from heat) will still be edible years, decades, probably generations down the road.\n\n17. Liquor\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nEverybody knows that wine can last a long time, sometimes greatly improving as it ages. But it can also go bad quickly through exposure to extreme heat or cold, oxidation through leaky corks, and just the natural evolution of its chemical constituents over time. Not so hard liquor. Unopened bottles of spirits are virtually unchanging. Their high alcohol content preserves them and they don't age. The only exception is with some sweet liqueurs, from which, as the years pass, some of the sugar content will precipitate out, forming crystals and leaving the liqueur slightly less sweet.\n\n18. White rice\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nBrown rice might be healthier, but it has a high oil content and so can go bad in a few months' time, while white rice – if you keep it dry – will last forever. The only possible problem, other than moisture, is the sudden appearance of tiny black bugs among the rice grains. These are rice weevils or flour bugs, and they've either found their way into the package through microscopic openings or their eggs were harvested along with the rice itself. Storing rice in thoroughly dried airtight containers will stop them from getting in; if they're already there, though, the rice should be discarded.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

In the 12 months to March, India cashed in on soaring global prices, exporting a record 7 million metric tons of the grain. That was up more than 250% on the previous year’s volumes. It had also set record export targets for the coming year.\n\nNow, those lofty goals have been abandoned and wheat exports banned as life-threatening heat waves in South Asia stunt output and push local prices to record highs.\n\nThe move shocked international markets on Monday — all the more since it came just days after India assured the world that the unprecedented heatwave wouldn’t impact its export plans. Global wheat prices spiked 6%, with futures trading in Chicago hitting $12.4 per bushel, the highest price in two months. Wheat futures dropped back a little Tuesday but are still up nearly 50% since the war started.\n\nWhile India is a huge wheat producer — even this year the country is expected to produce over 100 million metric tons — most of the grain is used to feed its population of 1.3 billion. By the government’s own admission, the country is “not among the top 10 wheat exporters.”\n\nBut the alarm its export ban caused underscores the fragility of global food supplies.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has contributed to a historic shock to commodity markets that will keep global prices high through the end of 2024, the World Bank said last month. Food prices are expected to soar by 22.9% this year, driven by a 40% rise in wheat prices, it added.\n\nThat’s because Ukraine and Russia together account for about 14% of global wheat production, and about 29% of all wheat exports. Vital shipments of agricultural exports, including an estimated 20 million tons of grain, are stuck in Ukraine because Odessa and its other Black Sea ports have been blockaded by Russian forces.\n\nUkraine is among the top five global exporters for a variety of key agricultural products, including corn, wheat and barley, according to the US Department of Agriculture. It’s also the leading exporter of both sunflower oil and meal.\n\nBut the food situation was strained even before the fighting started in Europe. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.\n\nThe number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the UN’s World Food Programme said in March.\n\nA combine harvests wheat at a field on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India. REUTERS/Amit Dave Amit Dave/Reuters\n\nAfter Modi’s promise, many vulnerable countries were banking on supplies from India.\n\n“Indian wheat exports are especially important this year on the back of Russia-Ukraine crisis,” Oscar Tjakra, senior grains and oilseeds analyst at Rabobank, told CNN Business.\n\nThe “ban will reduce the availability of global wheat for exports in 2022 and will provide support to global wheat prices,” he added.\n\nNew Delhi’s policy U-turn on wheat has already been met with criticism from members of the G7, an organization of some of the world’s largest economies.\n\nOn Monday, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Representative to the United Nations, said that she hoped Indian authorities “would reconsider that position.”\n\n“We’re encouraging countries not to restrict exports because we think any restrictions on exports will exacerbate the food shortages,” she said at a press briefing in New York.\n\nRising food protectionism\n\nIndia has responded by maintaining that the curbs are essential for its own food security and also for keeping prices in check. Annual inflation in Asia’s third largest economy hit its highest level in nearly eight years in April, a development some traders say triggered the export ban.\n\nThe government also said that restrictions do not apply “in cases where prior commitments have been made by private traders,” and to countries that request supplies “to meet their food security needs.”\n\nAn Indian farmer carries wheat crop harvested from a field on the outskirts of Jammu, India, Thursday, April 28, 2022. Channi Anand/AP\n\nAccording to Tjakra, these exceptions should be considered “good news,” but they do make it harder to assess the impact the prohibition will have on global trade.\n\nThe “severity of impact” of the ban “will still depend on volumes of India wheat exports that are still allowed at the government level and volumes of wheat production from other global wheat producers,” he added.\n\nSome analysts in India say that allowing unrestricted exports was a bad idea in the first place.\n\n“We don’t know what will happen to the climate in India,” Devinder Sharma, an India-based agriculture policy expert, told CNN Business.\n\nIndia is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the impacts of the climate crisis, according to the UN’s climate change authority, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nIf crops are ruined because of unpredictable weather, India could run short of food, and be left “standing with a begging bowl,” Sharma added.\n\nIndia is not the only country looking inward and putting curbs on agricultural exports.\n\nIn April, Indonesia began restricting exports of palm oil, a common ingredient found in many of the world’s food, cosmetics and household items. It’s the world’s top producer of the product.\n\nJust a month earlier, Egypt had banned exports of key staples such as wheat, flour, lentils and beans amid growing concerns over food reserves in the Arab world’s most populous state.\n\n“With inflation already on the rise in Asia, risks are skewed towards more food protectionism, but these measures could end up exacerbating food price pressures globally,” Nomura analyst Sonal Varma said in a note on Saturday.\n\nShe added that the impact of India’s wheat export ban will “be felt disproportionately by low income developing countries.”\n\nBangladesh is India’s top wheat export destination, followed by Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Yemen, the Philippines and Nepal, Nomura said.", "authors": ["Diksha Madhok"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/01/06/polar-vortex-pushes-subzero-temps-into-midwest/4335777/", "title": "Bitter cold scrambles travel and prompts danger warnings", "text": "William Spain, William M.

Chicago saw a record low minus 15, and Quincy, Ill., tied a record at minus 9.\n\nThe cold stretched into southern regions accustomed to a milder January. Waco, Texas, saw 16 degrees and Monroe, La., 19, both records.\n\nCalculating for the wind effect, Comertown, Mont., saw minus 63 and Rolla, N.D., saw minus 60 wind chills.\n\n\"Anyone stuck outside for any length of time will be at serious risk for injury or death,\" the National Weather Service in Minnesota's Twin Cities warned.\n\nSeveral deaths were blamed on the snow, ice and cold since Saturday, including the death of a 1-year-old boy who was in a car that went out of control and collided with a snowplow Monday in Missouri.\n\nAir travel was all but impossible Monday. More than 5,000 scheduled commercial flights were canceled Monday, according to Flightstats.com, and more than 10,000 more were seriously delayed.\n\nMany people, like David Mousseau, an operations manager for an energy company, abandoned efforts to get to work and decided to stay home, saying it was the coldest he has experienced in three decades as a Chicagoan.\n\n\"I went out and started the car but my feet were frozen within five minutes,\" Mousseau said. \"And I had on all the stuff I would for skiing. So I decided to pass.\"\n\nChicagoans awoke to a fresh foot of snowfall and a record low temperature of minus 15 degrees. Winds made for a wind-chill effect temperature in the minus-40s.\n\nTemperature in Chicago rose to just minus-10 in midafternoon. Much of the city was shut down, including the SkyDeck Chicago at the Willis (formerly Sears) Tower.\n\n\"This is some of the most extreme weather we have seen in the city of Chicago in decades,\" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said.\n\nHis office and other city agencies urged people to stay inside. The city extended hours on its warming centers where people can shelter from the cold.\n\nElsewhere across the upper Midwest, the story was similar. Sioux Falls, S.D., saw minus 18 degrees, and Fargo, N.D., had minus 23 degrees. The temperature in Minneapolis reached a low of minus 23.\n\nSchools were closed in Chicago, St. Louis, Milwaukee and the entire state of Minnesota as people were warned to keep children out of the cold. Cities urged taking pets indoors.\n\nThe most brutal cold will continue overnight in the upper Midwest, with wind chills in the minus 50s and minus 60s, said AccuWeather meteorologist Tom Kines.\n\n\"In the East, the brunt of the cold air will be tonight (Monday night) and Tuesday,\" he said. With the wind chill, it will feel like it's in the minus teens and minus twenties across much of the eastern part of the country on Tuesday, he said.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it was so cold that fuel supplies were freezing at Chicago's O'Hare International and other airports in the Midwest and Northeast.\n\n\"Our employees are only able to be out on the ramp for a few minutes at a time because wind chills are as low as 45 below zero at some airports,\" American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said.\n\nRoad travel was little better.\n\nIn Illinois, some 375 vehicles became stuck in a snowy stretch of Interstates 57 and 70 near Effingham. Snow drifts as high as 8-feet piled up Sunday night, blocking passage and covering cars. State emergency management director Jonathon Monken said it took 100 workers and more than six hours to clear the mess.\n\nIllinois Gov. Pat Quinn declared a state disaster and activated the National Guard.\n\nIn Indiana, the General Assembly postponed the opening of its 2014 session, and the state appellate courts shut down.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence ordered the National Guard to help stranded motorists, moving people to shelters and transporting emergency medical services. to those in need. Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard upgraded the city's travel emergency level, making it illegal to drive except in emergencies or seeking shelter. The last time the city issued such a travel warning was in 1978.\n\nThe so-called \"polar vortex\" -- the mass of cold air swirling over the North Pole that broke away and roared south -- is sliding East. New Yorkers who saw temperatures above 50 degrees Monday morning will see them drop to single digits Monday night. Tuesday's forecast high: 11 degrees.\n\nSouthern states are bracing for possible record temperatures, too, with single-digit highs expected Tuesday in Georgia and Alabama.\n\nTemperatures in some areas of Georgia were expected to stay below freezing for more than 48 hours, with record cold lows likely Tuesday morning. Wind chill values will be below zero in some areas Monday night and Tuesday morning.\n\nTemperatures are expected to dip into the 30s in parts of Florida on Tuesday. Though Florida Citrus Mutual spokesman Andrew Meadows said it must be at 28 degrees or lower for four hours straight for fruit to freeze badly, fruits and vegetables were a concern in other parts of the South.\n\nWith two freezing nights ahead, Louisiana citrus farmers could lose any fruit they cannot pick in time.\n\nIn Plaquemines Parish, south of New Orleans, Ben Becnel Jr. estimated that Ben & Ben Becnel Inc. had about 5,000 bushels of fruit on the trees, mostly navel oranges and the sweet, thin-skinned mandarin oranges called satsumas.\n\n\"We're scrambling right now,\" he said.\n\nSteve Cochrane, director of regional economics at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pa., said the cold's economic impact will be small for the nation's economy, though it will be felt locally.\n\n\"You spend less when you are hunkered down and more later on,'' Cochrane said.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Tim Mullaney, USA TODAY; Indianapolis Star; WXIA-TV Atlanta; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/07/gma-pcas-fda-trump-lgbtq-china-senate-warnock-walker-georgia/10850346002/", "title": "Georgia runoff, China, GMA scandal, LGBTQ, Trump, FDA, PCAs ...", "text": "Incumbent Raphael Warnock has defeated Donald Trump-backed GOP challenger Herschel Walker in Georgia's Senate runoff.

His victory makes him the first Black senator elected to a full six-year term in Georgia history.\n\nWhat it means: Warnock's win solidified a cycle in which Democrats defied history by defending every incumbent Senate seat, a first for the party in power since 1934.\n\nImpact for the Senate: A 51-49 majority will likely mean little in terms of policy goals given the Republicans took back the House, but it will be significant in terms of judicial appointments and other key confirmations for the next two years.\n\nA 51-49 majority will likely mean little in terms of policy goals given the Republicans took back the House, but it will be significant in terms of judicial appointments and other key confirmations for the next two years. High voter turnout broke fatigue talk. The Georgia secretary of state's office said Tuesday that roughly 3.3 million people voted in total either through absentee ballot, early voting in-person or on Election Day.\n\nChina announces rollback of strict anti-COVID-19 measures\n\nIn a sharp reversal, China has announced a series of measures rolling back some of its most draconian anti-COVID-19 restrictions, including limiting harsh lockdowns and ordering schools without known infections to resume regular classes. The 10-point announcement Wednesday from the National Health Commission follows recent street protests in several cities over the strict “zero-COVID” policy now entering its fourth year, which has been blamed for upending ordinary life, travel and employment while dealing a harsh blow to the national economy.

The \"lack of a single, clearly identified person\" to lead the foods program has led to a culture of \"constant turmoil\" at the agency, the report found.

The area where an EF-2 tornado hit near Town Creek is too far away from warning sirens to have made a difference for the victims even if they went off, said Johnny Cantrell, director of the Lawrence County Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service said a tornado touched down Dec. 16 south of Town Creek, went over a mountain and dipped down again before destroying everything in a path that was 370 yards wide at its maximum. A husband and wife died, and their 7-year-old son was among the injured. Town Creek Mayor Mike Parker said neither of the community’s two storm sirens emitted a warning before the killer tornado. Cantrell said the siren system is based on a concept that is decades-old, and he favors having a severe weather application for cellphones so residents in a storm’s path can be notified. He said he will continue to look at more modern notification systems and look for money to fund the application.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Matanuska-Susitna Borough has declared a local emergency from flooding brought on by an ice jam in Willow Creek. Borough Mayor Vern Halter in his declaration Monday night asked Gov. Mike Dunleavy to declare a state disaster for the affected areas. Halter cited severe threats to life and property, lack of access to homes and property damage loss. “The severity and magnitude of the flooding emergency is beyond the timely and effective response capability of the local resources,” he said. The ice jam Saturday night sent floodwater into nearby homes. At least 13 households were forced to evacuate, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Six were damaged by floodwater. Residents who chose to stay behind to tend to animals were cut off from leaving their neighborhood, KTUU-TV reported. Emergency workers on Monday used amphibious all-terrain vehicles and boats to shuttle people in and out so they could buy food, fuel and medications. There had been little change in the ice jam from Sunday to Monday, said borough emergency services director Ken Barkley. Ice jams have occurred during spring breakup but presented an unusual challenge in early winter, Barkley said. The temperature at 7 a.m. Tuesday in Willow was 6 degrees.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials said City Hall had been bugged for several months – with bedbugs, that is. The Arizona Daily Star reported officials said it took nearly three months to remove the small insects from the municipal building. The first report of bed bugs came in late September, with an employee reporting finding a dead bedbug in a file folder on the third floor. A week later, the second report surfaced with the sighting of a bedbug on the fourth floor. As a precaution, exterminators sprayed every floor of City Hall to get rid of the little bloodsuckers. Officials believe the bedbugs were brought in accidentally from an outside source. Tucson spokesman Andy Squire said after the three-month removal, the city also had to hire a Phoenix company earlier this month to bring in a specially trained dog to sniff the remaining bugs out. City officials estimated it cost about $7,853 to get rid of the infestation, with nearly half paying for the bedbug-sniffing dog.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An Arkansas fire chief has donated a kidney to a teenager he didn’t know. Maumelle Fire Chief Gerald Ezell told KATV that the surgery took place Dec. 13, two days after he met 18-year-old Sidney Burnett of Granby, Missouri. Ezell said he discovered Burnett was in need when he saw a Facebook post from her mother, an old school friend. He realized they had the same blood type. “I just felt like God was saying, ‘Hey, this is you,’” Ezell said. “Step across that line.” The transplant was performed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Burnett is still in Minnesota recovering from the surgery. “I was just so shocked that my donor was someone that had never even met me, but I’m so grateful for him,” she said. “He literally gave me my life back.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A study released this week has found that a law aimed at boosting vaccination rates across California had the greatest effect in high-risk areas where the vaccination rates were the lowest. The peer-reviewed study published in the journal PLOS Medicine on Monday showed that the 2016 legislation contributed to a 3.3% increase statewide for measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and a 2.4% decrease in the number of requests for nonmedical or personal belief exemptions to childhood vaccination requirements. California adopted the strictest childhood vaccination laws in the nation after public health officials connected more than 100 measles cases to an outbreak at Disneyland that began in December 2014. The law requires children to be vaccinated to attend public or private schools. It allows for medical exemptions if there is a clear medical reason that children should not be vaccinated.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverton: A fire that destroyed a historic building in a small mountain town in southwestern Colorado over the weekend led to power, internet and cellphone outages and took more than half of the town’s stored water to fight, officials said. The fire, which was reported about 10 p.m. Saturday, took nearly 17 hours to extinguish in subfreezing temperatures and used so much water that city officials asked residents of the small mountain town to voluntarily conserve water for a couple of days until storage tanks could refill, the Durango Herald reported Monday. Initially, “there was no way to get the word out,” to the town’s 400 residents, said John Sites, Silverton’s director of Public Works. Patrons at a brewery who spotted the fire were unable to use their cellphones to call 911 because of the outage. Fortunately, the brewery had a landline. The fire damaged a power line and CenturyLink line that run through the alley behind the gift and souvenir store that was destroyed, said San Juan County spokeswoman DeAnne Gallegos. Power was out for about six hours as outside temperatures dipped as low minus-10 degrees. Other wireless providers rely on CenturyLink’s line, so they were out of service as well. The fire was under control at 6 a.m., but Silverton’s fire crews continued to put out hot spots until 4 p.m. Sunday, said Gilbert Archuleta, chief of the Silverton-San Juan County Fire and Rescue Authority. The cause of the fire is unknown. Foul play is not suspected, Archuleta said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has been awarded a nearly $27 million federal grant to help further enhance early childhood development programs, the administration of Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday. The Preschool Development Birth through Five grant will help the state Office of Early Childhood design and launch better, more cost-effective systems to support family resilience and early childhood development. In addition to giving parents a greater voice, it focuses on developing and retaining the early childhood workforce. Connecticut was positioned to win the grant because the office is a national model integrating programs for young children and families, Commissioner Beth Bye said in a statement. Through a family-centered approach, the office serves thousands of children each year through child care, preschool, home visiting, health and safety assurance, early intervention, and parenting support. The three-year grant award starts Jan. 1.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Partially treated wastewater is being released from a treatment plant because of an equipment malfunction that state officials said cannot be immediately fixed. The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control learned of the equipment malfunction at the Lewes wastewater treatment plant on Dec. 18, according to a press release Monday. Residents in the Lewes area are being asked to take water conservation measures until a resolution is announced, news outlets reported. Those measures include reducing shower time, avoiding multiple partial loads of laundry or dishwashing and minimizing “unnecessary flushing of toilets,” according to the release. DNREC said the plant has been bypassing stages of wastewater treatment since Dec. 19. Crews are screening the partially-treated wastewater effluent to remove visible solids, and a hydrogen peroxide feed is being used to reduce bacteria, state officials said. An emergency shellfish closure order has been issued by DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin for harvest areas downstream from the plant. The closure will continue for 21 days after the malfunction is fixed per U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, according to the release.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two people were injured in a fire at a home for people recovering from drug and alcohol abuse. D.C. Fire and first responders arrived at the scene early Monday and found three people were trapped inside, news outlets reported. Once rescued, two of those people were taken to a hospital to be treated for injuries not considered to be life-threatening. The third person declined medical treatment. Fire department spokesman Vito Maggiolo said most residents were alerted to the blaze by working fire alarms and were able to escape on their own. The fire’s cause still is under investigation. The D.C. mayor’s Office of Community Relations and Services and Red Cross are helping displaced residents, of which there are about 16. The home is part of the Oxford House network, which seeks to help residents with sobriety.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Two more cases of dengue fever have been discovered in Miami-Dade County, bringing the total for the year to 14. The Miami Herald reported that it represents an uptick in reported cases of the mosquito-borne tropical disease. It continues to spread rapidly through Latin America, raising concerns that the number of cases in Miami will continue to rise. The Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County said the latest two cases are geographically linked to a travel-related case, but the department didn’t release additional details. Common symptoms of dengue virus include fever and one or more of the following: headache; eye pain; muscle, joint or bone pain; rash; nausea and vomiting; or unusual bleeding such as nose and gum bleeds. The disease is spread through the bite of an Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same insect that also spreads the chikungunya and Zika viruses. According to the Florida Department of Health, Miami-Dade has had the most cases of locally transmitted dengue in the state this year, with only Broward and Hillsborough reporting other cases – one in each county.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp submitted twin plans requesting that President Donald Trump’s administration allow changes to federal government subsidies for health insurance. Kemp said proposed changes to former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act would give individuals and families less expensive coverage options, a particular benefit for those who don’t qualify for federal subsidies to cover premiums. Critics said it would drive up insurance costs for older and sicker people. Kemp also wants to offer subsidized coverage to a fraction of Georgia’s uninsured poor if they worked or went to school for 80 or more hours a month. Kemp’s administration projects the expansion would cover 50,000 people, far less than the 400,000 uninsured Georgians who might be covered by the Medicaid expansion originally envisioned by the overhaul. This second proposal, aimed at people earning incomes of up to 100% of the federal poverty level, echoes those made by other states. Federal officials have rejected some similar partial expansions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Department of Education won a federal grant of nearly $50 million for a long-term effort to enhance literacy among children, officials said. Education officials said the grant will be used to foster skills from infancy through high school, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy Grant spans five years and will focus on disadvantaged students, officials said. The state education department will begin seeking applicants in January for the effort that will use techniques grounded in data. The funds will supplement current instruction combined with other approaches known to be effective, from family education and engagement to ensuring educators at all levels have necessary tools and training, officials said. The $49.8 million grant will be divided among grade levels, with 40% to elementary schools, 40% to secondary schools and 15% to early education from birth to age 5. The remaining 5% at the state level will cover grant administration and program monitoring, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Environmental groups have written a letter to the U.S. Forest Service requesting more time for public comment on plans for Idaho’s Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest. The coalition of a dozen environmental advocacy organizations sent a letter to the agency Monday asking for a 90-day extension because of interruptions caused by the holiday season, The Lewiston Tribune reported. The letter to Nez Perce-Clearwater Supervisor Cheryl Probert said the Dec. 20 release of the draft forest plan revision and environmental impact statement effectively removes about two weeks from the 90-day comment period. Even those with time to examine the document are not likely to be able to reach forest service employees during holiday break periods, the groups said. The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest did not immediately return a call from the Associated Press on Tuesday. The two draft documents released by the forest service broadly describe the management of Nez Perce-Clearwater for the next 15 to 20 years. The documents are revisions of the individual Nez Perce and Clearwater forest plans that were last updated in 1987.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new study has found no evidence to corroborate that a beaver-skin stovepipe hat – for years a centerpiece of Illinois’ Abraham Lincoln museum – ever belonged to the 16th U.S. president, according to a published report. Among the findings spelled out in a 54-page report was that the hat, once appraised at $6.5 million, didn’t appear to be Lincoln’s size and that descendants of the original collectors weren’t aware of the claim Lincoln had owned it, WBEZ reported Tuesday, citing a copy of the study. The 16-month study also criticized a lack of due diligence to verify any link between the hat and Lincoln before it was purchased in 2007 and went on display at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield. The hat was later purchased in 2007 by the private Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation from collector Louise Taper for display at the Springfield museum. It was the headliner in a wider Taper collection, for which the foundation paid around $25 million. The collection also included the bloodied gloves Lincoln wore to the theater the night he was shot. With secret doubts of their own, the private foundation sought to authenticate the hat over recent years, including a failed attempt to match DNA on the hat to Lincoln.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: A group working to create a monument to the lead character in “Star Trek: Voyager,” Capt. Kathryn Janeway, has met its crowdfunding campaign goal of $12,500. The Captain Janeway Bloomington Collective will receive matching funds from the Indiana Housing & Community Development. That gives them enough to build it. Peter Kaczmarcyk and his wife, Mary Beth, have headed up efforts to create the monument this year. On May 23 – three days after Bloomington-native Janeway’s fictional birthday in the 24th century – a bust bearing the likeness of actress Kate Mulgrew will be unveiled in downtown Bloomington. Included in the design is a limestone base in the shape of the Starfleet insignia; and an informational table with information about the USS Voyager captain, series writer and producer Jeri Taylor and their local connections. Taylor is also a Bloomington native and earned her bachelor’s degree from Indiana University in 1959. Initially, the unveiling was planned for May 20, the character’s birthday, but Kaczmarczyk said so many people expressed interest in attending that they decided to move it to the weekend.\n\nIowa\n\nWashington: A former bricklayer made a deal with a retirement home that when he became a resident, it would to allow him to put up a display of model trains. Jim Bennett of Washington said the holiday season is his favorite time for the past 10 years because he gets to practice and display his enthusiasm for being a train engineer, KCRG-TV reported. His train display is in the lobby of the United Presbyterian Home in the town of 7,400 people about 50 miles south of Cedar Rapids. He has posted hours of operation so that visitors can see it for more than three hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and Bennett said he will likely leave the display up through February. Bennett said he has always loved building toy trains, repairing them and watching them cruise around the tracks. But as he got older and moved into the retirement home, he worried he would not have a chance to ever bring out the sets again.\n\nKansas\n\nOsawatomie: Fire officials said a driver for the U.S. Postal Service “saved Christmas” after his delivery truck caught fire. The Wichita Eagle reported that firefighters in Osawatomie on Sunday posted photos on the volunteer department’s Facebook page of the smoldering and badly damaged engine compartment of the mail truck. The area of the driver’s seat also appeared to be damaged. But several packages, including Amazon Prime shipping boxes, were removed by the driver and placed in a ditch a safe distance from the burning vehicle. The driver’s name was not released. “Your Prime delivery may have just lost its Prime,” The Osawatomie Volunteer Fire Department said in the Facebook post. “The good news is, the driver saved Christmas!” Osawatomie is a town of 4,500 residents about 60 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The Marian Group said Monday it has withdrawn from a development agreement to transform a site in Paristown that was home to the old Urban Government Center. Louisville chose The Marian Group in 2017 to develop the roughly 2-acre lot in Paristown Pointe at 814 Vine St. as the first part of a larger mixed-use development. The developer planned to build 22 modern shotgun homes on the vacant lot, angering some neighbors because it marked an increase from the 12 shotgun homes originally proposed. In a letter Monday to Louisville Forward, the city’s development branch, legal counsel for the developers wrote that the reason for withdrawing was the city’s failure to obtain rezoning, demolition permits and other waivers for the project, which it had to complete by Dec. 31. The development agreement called for the city, not the developer, to be responsible for those tasks. Caitlin Bowling, a spokeswoman for Louisville Forward, said the termination had been received and “we respect their decision.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nAbbeville:A Roman Catholic church decided to disperse some blessings to a local town via crop dusters. According to a Facebook post from the Diocese of Lafayette on Sunday, members of St. Anne Church on Cow Island called upon crop duster pilots to help spread their blessing to the community. The Rev. Matthew Barzare and parishioners of the church loaded 100 gallons of holy water into the planes, and the pilots sprayed the water onto the town and the nearby farms, KATC-TV reported. Parishioners also bought water from their homes to the airstrip to be blessed by Barzare. The idea came from L’Eryn Detraz, a Cow Island native who is a missionary stationed in Ohio. Cow Island is an unincorporated community in Vermilion Parish approximately 38 miles south of Lafayette.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: A University of Maine Cooperative Extension program that provides fresh produce for people in need has reached 3 million pounds of donations. Maine Harvest for the Hunger has existed since 2000 and donated more than 193,000 pounds of produce from more than 120 farms in the state this year. The donations went to more than 200 hunger-relief distribution sites, the university said. In nearly two decades in existence, Harvest for the Hunger has “mobilized Master Gardener Volunteers, home gardeners, farmers, businesses, schools, and civic groups to grow, glean, and donate quality produce to distribution sites (pantries, shelters, community meals) and directly to neighbors in need,” the university said in a statement. The value of the produce harvested this year was estimated at more than $300,000, the university said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Advanced Industrial Solutions, the United Kingdom’s largest provider of offshore wind industry training, will open a Salisbury facility in early 2020. The new training hub, created in partnership with Salisbury-based welding company ARCON, will begin hiring instructors in February or March, said ARCON President and CEO Katarina Ennerfelt. In total, the number of permanent new jobs at the training center in Northwood Industrial Park will likely be in the dozens, said Salisbury Mayor Jake Day. The safety training – which includes fire, first aid, material handling and working at heights – is required for technicians working on offshore wind projects and is regulated by an international standard under the Global Wind Organisation. As a whole, the renewable energy sector is expected to add 40,000 new jobs nationwide by 2030. Although the first trainees sent to the new facility will likely be training to work on offshore wind projects elsewhere across the U.S., the center will be available to train workers for wind projects set for the waters off Ocean City, Day said. ARCON has operated a welding services training center at its Northwood location since 2015.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Public health officials are seeking organizations to set up centers where people can be monitored after using illicit drugs. These planned “medical observation and monitoring services” would be staffed by nurses and other clinicians, who would monitor the clients’ vital signs, administer oxygen, intravenous fluids and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone if necessary, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. The clients will be able to remain anonymous and receive counseling, treatment for infections and wounds, and help with obtaining primary health care and addiction treatment. People will not be allowed to use drugs inside these centers, a marked difference from the concept of “safe consumption sites.” The state’s Department of Public Health is seeking bids to create three to five monitoring sites. Each would serve five to 10 people who have taken too much of a sedative, such as heroin or fentanyl, or a stimulant, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. The site locations have not yet been determined. The observation centers were part of a $5 million item in the state budget, which charges the public health department with promoting “harm reduction” to reduce the bad consequences of drug use.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:A black rhino that is part of a critically endangered species delivered her first calf at a Lansing zoo, officials announced on Christmas Eve. The unnamed calf was born at Potter Park Zoo on Tuesday before 6 a.m. The 12-year-old mother, Doppsee, nuzzled her baby within minutes and the calf was standing up about 90 minutes later, according to the zoo. The calf, which is bonding with its mother, won’t be seen by the public until the spring of next year. Both animals will be monitored closely for the next few weeks. “This is a monumental moment for Potter Park Zoo that has taken our staff years of planning and hard work,” director Cynthia Wagner said. “We are dedicated to conserving rhinos and couldn’t be more excited about this successful black rhino birth.” Zoo officials said that the species is at risk of extinction because of illegal poaching and habitat loss. Dozens of sites are making conservation efforts, zoo officials said. The newborn’s father, Phineus, came to the zoo from Texas in 2017.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: A light breeze and blue skies greeted a 30-by-60-foot American flag as it was unfurled for the first time Friday during a ceremony at Minnesota Truck Headquarters. The flag will fly atop a 150-foot flagpole, the largest dedicated flagpole in the state, according to general manager Rick Wildtraut. A tower at Millerbernd Manufacturing in Winsted is taller, but that light tower is used for other purposes for most of the year. A flag is flown on holidays and during the town’s festival and is not on daily display. In June, Ryan Electric built a 100-foot-tall flagpole at their offices in St. Cloud. The tallest flagpole in the U.S. is 400 at the Acuity Insurance company between Green Bay and Milwaukee.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: A scraggly metal Christmas tree planted in a pothole has inspired a minister to pen a holiday song. The Rev. Leon Hitchens of Webb Chapel Church in Liberty wrote “Pothole Christmas Tree” after local radio host Fern Crossley showed him the makeshift holiday scene, the Enterprise-Journal of McComb reported. The song celebrates John Drummond, who stuck the base of a wire Christmas tree into the traffic cone sticking out of the pothole. Neighbors decorated it with tinsel, ornaments and a large star on the top. An Associated Press account went worldwide, leading to additional coverage by Fox News. Drivers are now going out of their way to check out the pothole and its decoration. The city board said at last week’s meeting that crews are repairing poles as tight finances allow, and a $3.2 million bond issue dedicated to street paving might let the city fill others. Although many people take down their Christmas trees by New Year’s Day, it’s uncertain whether the city will have the pothole fixed by then.\n\nMissouri\n\nCalifornia: A mid-Missouri couple is donating more than 3,000 pairs of socks to homeless people as part of a program to honor their late son. The Columbia Missourian reported that Janet and Edward Miller of California started Gentle Ben’s Socks for the Homeless in memory of their son, Ben, who died of a brain aneurysm in 2017 at age 34. Janet Miller said socks are the most needed and least donated items for homeless people. The couple collected 900 pairs of socks in their first year. This year, the goal was 2,000 pairs, but they ended up with 3,100 pairs. The socks were donated at collection bins in California and Jefferson City. The socks will be donated to three Columbia organizations that help the homeless.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Warm temperatures and a lack of snow in the Kalispell area has led to the cancellation of a planned skijoring competition this weekend. Skijoring is a winter sport where skiers are pulled by horses through a course and over jumps. Organizers of Skijoring at Rebecca Farm said the events scheduled for Saturday and Sunday have been canceled and would not be rescheduled. Last year’s planned event was postponed to March 2019, also because of a lack of snow. Then, the first day of the competition was canceled because of severe cold. Skijoring America lists eight other competitions this season, including five more in Montana and one each in Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.\n\nNebraska\n\nEustis: A western Nebraska woman is known in her town as “The Santa Lady” because she has collected more than 9,000 items related to jolly old Saint Nick over 50-plus years. The North Platte Telegraph reported that Santa items fill both floors and every room, including the bathrooms, of Nancy Laier’s home in Eustis, a village of about 370 people about 165 miles west of Lincoln. She gives tours of her home – but asks that visitors call in advance to make sure she’s home. Laier said she began her collection sometime in the 1960s, when the first Pizza Hut restaurant came to North Platte, about 50 miles to the northwest. She said it had a drawing for a Santa doll; she entered her infant son, and he won. She said she found a lot of items when others threw them away.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Tire chains or vehicles with FWD/AWD with snow tires were required if people were trying to drive over Donner Summit on Interstate 80 or the Mt. Rose Highway on Wednesday morning, according to the Nevada Department of Transportation. Chains were also required at Lake Tahoe on SR-28 from the Nevada/California state line in Crystal Bay to U.S. 50 near South Lake. Snowfall over Donner Summit on Tuesday night closed Interstate 80 because of several spinouts over the summit, but the road has reopened. The chain controls were later dropped for travel on Interstate 80.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State police helped to deliver a baby on Interstate 93 early Christmas morning. State police posted the news and a photo with the baby and parents at the hospital on social media Wednesday morning. State police Sgt. Vincent Grieco, Trooper Ryan St. Cyr and Boscawen Police Officer Ryan Nolan helped welcome baby Dominic into the world in Concord shortly after midnight, WMUR-TV reported. “All are happy, healthy and overjoyed to be spending Christmas together,” the state police post said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Thirteen bears were killed last week as the state concluded the second phase of its black bear hunt, according to wildlife officials. The hunt initially was scheduled for six days and ended Dec. 14, with 37 bears being culled overall. But it was extended for four more days because the harvest objectives for the year had not been met, and the hunt resumed Dec. 18. The state’s bear management policy mandates that the hunting season will be extended by four days if less than 20% of tagged bears are killed. The harvest rate for the season stood at 14.7% when the decision to extend the hunt was made, marking the third straight year that the hunt has been prolonged. That harvest rate is deemed necessary to provide better ecological balance to the bear population and reduce the potential for bear-human encounters. Officials have said 265 bears were harvested during the first phase of the hunt, which took in place in October. Overall, 315 bruins were killed during this year’s hunts.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials are urging residents and visitors to spend some time outside on the first day of the year. The State Parks Division is holding a series of hikes at nine state parks on New Year’s Day as part of the annual First Day Hikes initiative. In addition to the hikes, visitors can also participate in Polar Bear Plunges at Storrie Lake State Park in Las Vegas and Eagle Nest Lake State Park in Eagle Nest. The participating parks range from Navajo Lake State Park in the northwest corner to Cerrillos Hills near Santa Fe and Pancho Villa and Leasburg Dam parks in southern New Mexico. At Elephant Butte, the dam is only open to pedestrian traffic one day a year for First Day Hikes. The New Year’s Day tradition happens nationwide. Last year, the National Association of State Park Directors reported that nearly 55,000 people rang in the New Year, collectively hiking more than 133,000 miles throughout the country on the guided hikes.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city is expanding a program to use mobile units to reach hundreds of people who are mentally ill, the city announced Monday. The city said in a release that it will spend $9.4 million to boost its mobile mental health treatment teams, which were launched in 2016. The city said the new money will be part of a $21 million investment that will lead to the hiring of more social workers, housing specialists and legal assistance employees. The additional workers will be needed to process the 20% increase in mental health referrals the effort is expected to generate, the city said, adding that it will likely reach 900 more people annually. In addition, the city said it plans to spend $11 million to create hospital-based outreach teams to coordinate care for people who frequent emergency rooms and acute care facilities.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A college student hailed by police as a hero for preventing more injuries and deaths after a gunman opened fire in a classroom has been immortalized as a Jedi by the production company for the Star Wars franchise. News outlets reported the family of Riley Howell, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte student who is described as a huge Star Wars fan, was tipped off by Lucasfilm in May that it planned to honor him in a forthcoming book, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - The Visual Dictionary.” Howell, 21, and a classmate died April 30 when a gunman opened fire in a classroom in the Kennedy building on UNCC’s campus. Four other students were injured, but police said Howell’s actions prevented more injuries or loss of life. The book was released by publisher DK to coincide with the release of the film “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” The entry in the book is just 66 words, but credits Jedi master and historian “Ri-Lee Howell” with collecting “many of the earliest accounts of exploration and codifications of The Force.” Howell’s mother, Natalie Henry-Howell, told The Charlotte Observer this marks the second time her son has appeared in a “Star Wars” book: When he was younger, an uncle had a personalized book made for Riley that put him in the starring role of “The Phantom Menace.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Firefighters continued a 30-year tradition of delivering gifts to children at hospitals in Fargo on Christmas Day. KFGO-AM reported the tradition began in 1990 when the 3-year-old son of a Fargo firefighter was hospitalized and worried that Santa Claus would not be able to find him. The gifts this year are given in memory of Keaton Nelson, who made his Make-a-Wish be for gifts to be delivered to other hospitalized children. Nelson died from complications from Cystic Fibrosis.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Bureau of Motor Vehicles plans to begin a vehicle safety recall notification program using the state’s vehicle registration renewal process. Vehicle safety recall information will be printed on registration renewal notices sent through the mail, the bureau said in a news release. Customers will begin receiving open recall notifications beginning in January under the new program. Drivers who are not the original owners of a vehicle might not be aware of an open recall, officials said. An open recall will not interfere with a Ohioans’ ability to renew their vehicle registration, according to the bureau. BMV customers are advised to check their Vehicle Identification Numbers for open recalls by using the VIN look-up tool on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. They also can contact their authorized dealer.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt’s top adviser on tribal issues announced her resignation on Monday and accused the governor of creating an ‘unnecessary conflict’ with the tribes over casino gambling. Lisa Billy, a former Republican lawmaker and Stitt’s secretary of Native American Affairs, said in her resignation letter that Stitt’s position on the compacts poses a threat to the state’s economy and its relationship with the tribes. Stitt said in a statement he was grateful for Billy’s service and he remains committed to working collaboratively with the tribes. `The governor caught many tribal leaders off guard last summer when he announced in a newspaper editorial that he wanted to renegotiate the compacts. The sides have been locked in a dispute ever since about whether the compacts expire on Jan. 1. Stitt claims they do, but the tribes maintain triggers have been met for the compacts to automatically renew.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The Salem and Brooks vegetable processing plants owned by bankrupt NORPAC Foods could soon reopen after Lineage Logistics filed to purchase the company’s Oregon properties for $49 million, according to court records. The Statesman-Journal reported that a bankruptcy judge is scheduled to hear the petition for the proposed sale Jan. 14 in bankruptcy court in Portland. The sale would include NORPAC’s Willamette Valley processing facilities in Salem, Brooks and Stayton, along with the field shop in Quincy, Washington. NORPAC attorney Al Kennedy said in court that Lineage Logistics will lease the plants in Salem and Brooks from NORPAC until the sale is completed. And Lineage would lease those to Oregon Potato Company to operate until the sale is done, which would allow some of the 1,400 NORPAC workers who had been notified they could be laid off to continue to work. Lineage Logistics, which was formed in 2008, is one of the largest cold storage companies in the world, including operating 169 cold storage warehouses in the United States and more in countries such as China and the United Kingdom.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWashington Crossing: Thousands turned out Wednesday to watch the annual reenactment of George Washington’s daring Christmas Day crossing of the Delaware River in 1776 – the first time the crossing was completed in three years. The event was scrapped because of bad weather the last two years, but historical interpreter Nancy O’Leary said at Washington Crossing Historical Park that the conditions this year “couldn’t be better.” Jennifer Martin, executive director of the Friends of Washington Crossing Park. estimated that 4,500 to 5,000 people were watching the event, the highlight of a historical reenactment that draws people to the banks of the river in Washington Crossing and Titusville, New Jersey. Other activities included Washington’s address to his troops, historical speeches and processions, and staff in period clothing providing public interpretation. In the original crossing, boats ferried 2,400 soldiers, 200 horses and 18 cannons across the river. Washington’s troops marched 8 miles downriver before battling Hessian mercenaries in the streets of Trenton, New Jersey. Thirty Hessians were killed, and two Continental soldiers froze to death on the march.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers returning to the State House after the holidays will notice some subtle changes to the House and Senate chambers. When lawmakers return in January, they will see new shades of paint on the walls, feel thicker carpet under their feet, sit at revarnished desks, brush past brighter drapes and listen to each other’s speeches on new audio speakers, according to The Providence Journal. In addition, the cracked skylight above the House Speaker’s desk has been repaired as has the domed roof above the Senate chamber, which often leaked when it rained. It was the first significant chamber renovation since the General Assembly downsized in 2003 from 150 seats to the current 113. That renovation also brought computers to lawmakers’ desks for the first time.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: A Charleston-area landmark will be lit up for the holidays. The Post and Courier reportsed that Dominion Energy and a group dedicated to saving the Morris Island Lighthouse will illuminate the lighthouse from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. The lighthouse also was illuminated on Christmas Day. Dominion spokesperson Persida Montanez said engineers will use 12-volt batteries, LED lights and a solar panel to provide light. The lighthouse was constructed in 1876, but has faced severe erosion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Area schools and two radio stations raised more than $14,000 to give gift cards to students who don’t have a permanent address this year. In all, the Rapid City Journal reported Tuesday that 573 students will each receive $25 Visa gift cards. The radio stations that helped in the effort were 97.9 the Breeze and KLMP. It was part of a campaign called “Hope for the Homeless.” During the four years the schools and radio stations collaborated on the effort, they haved raised nearly $45,000 for gifts to homeless middle and high school students.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee’s county health department clinics are offering flu vaccines at no charge. Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey encouraged anyone who has not received a flu shot this season to get one as soon as possible. The state Health Department suggested contacting local health departments for information. Information about nearby departments is available online. Free flu vaccines are also available at the Shelby County Health Department in Memphis and the Metro Public Health Department in Nashville, in addition to health departments run by the state throughout Tennessee, the state said. Even after being vaccinated, the state Health Department recommends washing hands with soapy water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers and covering coughs and sneezes with a sleeve or tissue to help prevent the spread of illness. People who are sick should stay home so they can recover and avoid infecting others.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A resident who was diagnosed with measles is no longer a health threat, but officials are urging some people to get medical attention if they develop a fever before New Year’s Day. Public health officials made the plea to anyone who visited specific Austin locations that the affected resident was in between Dec. 14 and Dec. 17. The Austin American-Statesman created a map of those locations. The resident is currently not in Texas. Measles is a virus that can cause high fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A rash appears 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms, but other complications include pneumonia and encephalitis. Health officials first alerted people in Austin about the measles case and potential exposure on Sunday, a day after state agencies were informed by Virginia officials, said Dr. Mark Escott, the interim health authority at Austin Public Health. The person traveled to Virginia on Dec. 17. The person, whom officials are not identifying, contracted the disease while traveling in Europe from late November to early December and became sick on Dec. 14, Escott said. He noted that the person developed a rash on Dec. 17, which is the day they boarded United Airlines Flight 790 from Austin to Chicago, with a connecting flight to Virginia. The person’s measles case is the first reported in Travis County since 1999, the Statesman reported. Officials didn’t disclose if the person was vaccinated.\n\nUtah\n\nBrighton: A second ski resort near Salt Lake City is changing its parking policy to favor carpooling amid concerns about traffic congestion in a canyon home to popular ski resorts. Starting Wednesday, Brighton Resort designated prime parking areas for visitors with three people or more in their cars on holidays like Christmas that are often popular days to ski, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Officials said the policy applies to weekends, holidays and powder days. It could encourage more people to share cars or take public transportation on days when cars full of skiers can lead to long lines of traffic snaking through the snow-covered mountains. Single drivers or those with one passenger must park at a further lot, where a shuttle service will ferry them to the lifts. When that lot near the resort store is full, people will be asked to turn around and park along the road, or return to the mouth of the canyon and take public transit. The move comes after neighboring Solitude Mountain Resort, also in Big Cottonwood Canyon, made the unusual move to start charging noncarpooling guests $20 to park. The price drops to $10 if the car has three occupants and $5 for four or more people. Park staffers have said their goal isn’t to make money but rather to ease traffic gridlock. Season pass holders at both Brighton and Solitude can ride free on the canyon bus routes offered by the Utah Transit Authority.\n\nVermont\n\nJericho: The Army Mountain Warfare School in Jericho will get $30 million in federal funding for a new facility, the Vermont National Guard announced this week. The funding is part of the defense budget signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Groundbreaking is likely to happen late next year, the Guard said. Members of the school provided mountain warfare and cold-weather training to U.S. and Afghan conventional operations forces on deployments in 2005 and 2010, the Guard said. Instructors served as experts on mountain warfare in Afghanistan. The $30 million appropriation will support “a critically important but previously unfunded priority of the Army,” said U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy in a written statement on Monday. The design of the 82,600-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility will start as early as January, said Michael Bleau, deputy construction and facilities management officer. Construction is expected to be completed in early 2022, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRaven: A company that owns a coal mine has furloughed 600 workers until the end of the year. The reported reason behind the move is the trade war between the U.S. and China. The Bristol Herald Courier reported Monday that Coronado Coal idled its mining facility in Buchanan County on Dec. 16. Tarah Kesterson, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, said the company cited the trade war between China and the U.S. as a reason for the furlough. But she said the company also plans to bring the mine back into full production by Jan. 1. Coronado did not specify what it was looking for between China and the U.S. But tensions appeared to ease earlier this month with the announcement of a “Phase One” trade deal. China has agreed to buy an additional $200 billion worth of American goods and services. That agreement is expected to be signed in January. The idling of the mine in Buchanan County caps a tumultuous year for southwest Virginia’s coal industry. The region also saw the bankruptcy of Blackjewel LLC. The firm employed more than 480 people in the state.\n\nWashington\n\nNorth Bend: The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Police is asking for the public’s help to find the person or people who killed three cow elks and left them to waste in North Bend. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that police said in a Facebook post that three cow elks were found the weekend of Dec. 14 shot with archery equipment and left to die in the area behind Ken’s Truck Town Diner in North Bend. Two of the elks were found with matching arrows, and the third was found with a different type of arrow and broad head. Police said that those who provide information leading to an arrest might be eligible for a cash reward or bonus points for special permit hunting opportunities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Eligible employees at Mon Health System will soon be offered 14 straight days of paid parental leave. Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg announced in a news release that the new policy will take effect at the start of the new year. WBOY-TV reported that if both spouses or partners are employed by Mon Health, each will be afforded the same benefit. Mon Health also operates Mon Health Preston Memorial Hospital and Mon Health Stonewall Jackson Memorial Hospital. Congress passed a bill earlier this month giving the country’s 2.1 million government employees 12 weeks of paid parental leave as part of a defense bill that President Donald Trump signed into law. But it still leaves about 80% of U.S. workers in the private sector with no access to paid family leave. The U.S. is one of a handful of countries that lacks a federal policy, at least for new mothers, leaving employers to decide whether to offer it.\n\nWisconsin\n\nRib Mountain: The Salvation Army in Wausau said it got to 80% of its $170,000 Red Kettle fundraising goal before the holiday campaign ended on Christmas Eve. The organization told WSAW-TV donations have dropped in recent years and a lack of volunteers is one of the factors. Lt. Donna Thammavongsa with Wausau’s Salvation Army said another reason for falling short is that people don’t carry as much cash anymore. The Red Kettle campaign is more than 100 years old. It’s the Salvation Army’s largest annual fundraiser.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: No evidence links hydraulic fracturing to contaminated groundwater in central Wyoming, according to a state Department of Environmental Quality report. The contamination near Pavillion likely occurred naturally because of permeable geology in the gas-drilling area, the report released Monday found. However, absence of data from before drilling began in the mid-1900s limits scientists trying to determine the exact source of the contamination, the report stated. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigation began in 2008 and led to draft findings in 2011 that theorized a link between the contamination and nearby hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The process uses pressurized water, mixed with sand and chemicals, to split open underground deposits and boost oil and gas production. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry cautioned residents not to drink the water. The EPA, however, didn’t complete its report and handed the investigation over to state officials. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality announced in 2013 it would conduct a thorough study of the 12-square-mile Pavillion gas field with help from $1. million from Encana Oil and Gas USA, Inc., the Canadian-based company operating the site, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Several environmental groups and landowners expressed skepticism about the additional research.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/2018/10/16/ask-hr-food-allergy-navigate-workplace-office-noise/1618966002/", "title": "Ask HR: How does someone with a food allergy navigate the ...", "text": "Johnny C. Taylor Jr.\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr., a human-resources expert, is tackling your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.\n\nThe questions submitted by readers and Taylor's answers below have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQuestion: I have a severe peanut allergy and must carry an EpiPen. I cannot be in the same room as peanuts without having allergy symptoms flare up. Coworkers sometimes do not realize how scary things like work bake-offs, company picnics or just going into the lunchroom can be for someone with a food allergy. What can companies do to better educate their employees on this issue? How does someone with a food allergy navigate the workplace? – Anonymous\n\nJohnny C. Taylor, Jr.: You are one of millions of Americans who have food allergies. That’s why it’s important for work colleagues to be aware of how serious food allergies can be and how they can be more flexible and accommodating.\n\nEmployers strive to create a safe and healthy space for employees. But, as you might imagine, trying to control every person who comes into an office building can be difficult.\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act, employers must reasonably accommodate people with severe food allergies unless doing so creates an undue hardship for the employer. But – and this is really important – employers generally are prohibited from asking employees disability-related questions. So, if you want your employer to help protect you from peanuts in the workplace, you must alert HR or a supervisor of the problem.\n\nYou also should be prepared with suggestions on precautions your employer can take to help prevent reactions in the workplace. These could include proactive measures such as:\n\nCommunicating to staff that a coworker has a severe peanut allergy, offering tips for preventing exposure and educating employees on what to do if they witness an allergic reaction.\n\nDesignating a specific area of the office or a break room as “peanut-free.” In cases of severe allergies, an employer can consider a policy prohibiting employees from bringing peanut products to work.\n\nRequiring any foods made for company bake-offs and office potlucks that contain peanuts to be labeled, or banning peanut ingredients altogether.\n\nAllowing employees with severe allergies to work from home, if the risk of exposure is too great.\n\nI’m hopeful these steps – or others like them – can give you the peace of mind that you deserve. After all, every employee deserves to feel safe in the workplace each and every day.\n\nMore:Ask HR: Some insights on the #MeToo movement and harassment in the workplace\n\nMore:Ask HR: Advice to job-seekers and employers on the pitfalls of counteroffers\n\nMore:Ask HR: Can I be fired with no warning? When do I have to tell a boss that I'm pregnant?\n\nQ: I work in a small office where the acoustics are not good. The slightest noise or voice easily moves through the building, disturbing staff and hurting productivity. Our front-office receptionist clears her throat throughout the day, sometimes as often as once every few minutes. It is extremely disruptive. The other staff feel there is no way to broach this subject without it becoming an HR issue. I have moved my office to a different part of the building, but the noise carries. Is there anything that can be done? For what it's worth, we are all compassionate, empathetic and understanding people. However, we are frustrated. – Suzy\n\nTaylor: HR gets noise-related complaints all the time. And with open-concept workspaces dominating today’s workplace designs, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that office noise has become a common grievance.\n\nHow HR approaches noise challenges usually depends on the cause (source of the noise), resources (employer/employee ability to handle the matter) and tolerance level (the degree to which the noise can be endured).\n\nIf the noise is the result of an employee’s disability, illness or injury, employers frequently must find a way to accommodate the employee. Some employers have moved – temporarily or permanently – employees with, say, a heavy cough. Alternatively, employers sometimes move employees most affected by the cough to another area. Yet others provide earplugs.\n\nSometimes the source of the noise is routine, even necessary for getting work done. Still, there are measures companies can take. For conversations that are too frequent or too loud, many employers transmit white (or pink) noise over public address intercoms. Changing the schedules of affected staff can help, too. Even improving the furniture has been a solution for some employers. Cubicle walls can be heightened or thickened to reduce sound. Where permitted, headphone use is another great solution.\n\nWhen coworker noise is distracting but controllable, it is helpful for employers to have discreet and respectful, but frank, conversations with the employee whose annoying snacking habits or personal phone calls annoy others.\n\nYou mentioned your staff is understanding and empathetic. But even in these situations, coworkers may find it difficult to complain about their colleagues. That, among other reasons, is why well-trained and certified HR professionals are in place. I’d suggest speaking with your HR department, if your small staff has one.\n\nEmployees and employers can deal with many very pervasive, annoying noise issues by being tolerant, considerate and practical.\n\nHave a question?

The automaker claimed back in 2017 that it would be mass producing fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2019, which didn’t occur. Tech experts have said for years that several technological breakthroughs may be needed before self-driving vehicles go mainstream.\n\nWhen GM’s self-driving subsidiary Cruise demonstrated a fully autonomous ride with no human test driver behind the wheel last year, the trip took place near midnight. Late-night conditions are generally far easier for self-driving vehicles as there’s less traffic, cyclists and pedestrians, which can prove challenging for a fully autonomous vehicle to handle.\n\nBarra’s remarks at CES seemed to acknowledge that the path ahead for its self-driving vehicles is no sure thing.\n\n“We aim to deliver our first personal autonomous vehicles as soon as the middle of this decade,” Barra said. “We are working to be the fastest to market with a retail personal autonomous vehicle.”\n\nMost autonomous vehicle developers have focused on offering the technology as a service, such as robotaxis, rather than in a vehicle that people own. The parts needed for a self-driving car are expensive, like lidar, which may make owning one cost-prohibitive. When self-driving vehicles are used in a service the costs can be spread out across many riders.\n\nBarra said that GM’s self-driving company, Cruise, is continuing to work on Origin, a six-seat vehicle that it unveiled two years ago as a purpose built self-driving vehicle. The team is on track to begin charging a fee for autonomous rides or deliveries in the coming months.\n\nBarra did not say which GM vehicles would first be sold in a fully autonomous model. GM has historically launched its latest driver-assist features on its Cadillac vehicles. It also unveiled a sleek concept of an autonomous Cadillac that could sit two people Wednesday at CES.\n\nGM made its announcement just weeks after Dan Ammann, the CEO of its self-driving company Cruise, suddenly departed without a successor in place.

Does that mean the sell-off of tech and other high-growth companies is overdone?\n\nApple: The iPhone maker, whose shares are down 10% this year, reported record revenue for its all-important holiday quarter even as it continued to grapple with supply chain shortages.\n\n“We set all-time records for both developed and emerging markets and saw revenue growth across all of our product categories, except for iPad, which we said would be supply constrained,” CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nThe newly-released iPhone 13 powered $71.6 billion in global revenue from smartphone sales, while revenue from services — a growing part of Apple’s business — rose 24% to $19.5 billion.\n\nThe company’s profit totaled $34.6 billion, better than Wall Street expected. Shares are up 2.5% in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nTesla: The electric carmaker, whose stock is down 22% year-to-date, also overcame supply chain constraints to post record earnings.\n\n“With the chip shortage still a major overhang on the auto space and logistical issues globally, this impressive earnings beat speaks to an [electric vehicle] demand trajectory that looks quite robust for Tesla heading into 2022,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to clients.\n\nCEO Elon Musk did warn that the company would put plans for new vehicles on hold due to problems procuring components.\n\n“We will not be introducing new vehicle models this year,” Musk told analysts. “It wouldn’t make any sense. We’ll still be parts-constrained.”\n\nTesla will still aim to grow vehicle deliveries by 50% this year. Investors dumped its stock on Thursday, though, sending it to a three-month low.\n\nMicrosoft: The tech company, whose shares are down 11% this year, reported revenue of $51.7 billion and profit of $18.8 billion, driven in part by persistent demand for cloud services. That’s a 21% jump from one year earlier and was better than Wall Street’s forecasts.\n\nThe company’s guidance for its current quarter was also reassuring.\n\n“We expect our differentiated market position, customer demand for our high-value hybrid and cloud offerings and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth,” Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told analysts.\n\nThe takeaway: The S&P 500 is on track for its fourth week of losses in a row. Investors had hoped that earnings would serve as a welcome distraction from the Fed and would catalyze a turnaround. So far, that hasn’t really materialized — just because expectations are so high, and anxiety is running deeper.\n\n“We think the more hawkish message from the Fed increases the pressure on corporates to deliver on earnings,” BNP Paribas analysts said in a note to clients this week.\n\nUp next: Earnings from another batch of big companies next week, including Facebook’s Meta (FB) and Google’s Alphabet (GOOGL), could play a big role in solidifying the market mood.\n\nGold is shining again as stocks flail\n\nStocks have slumped this year. So has bitcoin. But gold is holding its ground.\n\nThe price of the yellow metal is roughly 2.5% lower this year, hovering near $1,786 per ounce. The S&P 500 is down 9%, while bitcoin has plunged 22%.\n\nMy CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica asks: Will the commodity pick up steam? And could it head back towards its all-time high above $2,000 during the early stages of the pandemic?\n\nSome experts think so.\n\n“Gold remains a safe haven and an insurance against geopolitical risks,” André Christl, CEO of Heraeus Precious Metals, said in a recent report. “The risk of persistently high inflation is also positive for gold.”\n\nGold is often viewed as a good hedge against rising interest rates and inflation since it should, in theory, hold onto more of its value given that it’s a tangible and scarce asset.\n\nThe return of market volatility this year, which has hurt meme stocks and bitcoin in particular, could lead to further gains for gold, according to some strategists.\n\n“Cryptos stole all the oxygen out of gold last year, and people go into crypto for many of the same reasons as gold,” said Robert Minter, director of ETF investment strategy at Abrdn, noting that bitcoin bulls have argued that it should also be considered a hedge against inflation.\n\nRecent turbulence has poured cold water on that thesis, however.\n\n“Investors are starting to realize bitcoin is more of a risky asset,” Minter said. “It’s less of a portfolio diversification tool and more of an energy drink.”\n\nRobinhood’s stock plunges after app’s big loss\n\nIn early 2021, Robinhood grabbed the spotlight as amateur traders used the trading app to snap up shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment, sending stocks in the troubled companies soaring.\n\nOne year later, Robinhood is struggling to transform its passionate user base into sustainable profits. The company’s shares are down 14% in premarket trading after it reported a net loss of $423 million for the final three months of last year. During the same period in 2020, before Robinhood’s initial public offering, it posted net income of $13 million.\n\nInvestor insight: Robinhood’s shares closed Thursday at $11.61, 69% below their IPO price of $38 apiece. The company’s stock has been hammered by the recent sell-off in tech companies, which has hit newer and riskier names especially hard.\n\nThe company’s earnings will do little to restore confidence. Monthly active users rose 48% compared to one year ago, but declined 8% versus the quarter ending in September.\n\nCosts during the fourth quarter jumped 162% from the previous year — though executives said that was mostly due to share-based compensation for employees, and sought to reassure investors that they would manage them better moving forward.\n\n“We expect to grow our costs much more slowly from here on out,” CEO Vlad Tenev said on a call with analysts.\n\nUp next\n\nCaterpillar, Chevron, Phillips 66, Colgate-Palmolive and Synchrony Financial report results before US markets open.\n\nAlso today: US personal income and spending data, along with the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, all post at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nComing next week: Earnings from ExxonMobil, Alphabet, Starbucks, Meta, Nokia, Amazon and Ford.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2021/06/15/ford-bronco-ships-dealers/7699073002/", "title": "Ford Bronco ships to dealers as company starts filling 125,000 orders", "text": "The Bronco has finally been released into the wild.\n\nTake a step back in time: This bestselling SUV was last built in 1996, the year that the Fox News Channel debuted, \"Independence Day\" dominated the box office and \"Macarena\" topped the music charts.\n\n\"The Broncos are out of the gates, out of the corral,\" Erik Williams, Ford plant manager at Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, told a handful of reporters on Monday during a tour.\n\nFactory sounds filled the enormous room, and Williams spoke loudly as Cyber Orange and Shadow Black Bronco SUVs rolled off the production line.

Brake boosters, which provide power assistance to the brakes, can corrode over an extended period of time, especially when exposed to significant amounts of water, according to announcements from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Mercedes. Corrosion can allow air to leak into the system, weakening the power brakes. This would cause drivers to have to exert more force to bring the vehicle to a stop and could lead to increased stopping distances.\n\nIn “rare cases of very extreme corrosion” sudden hard braking could damage the brake booster leading to brake system failure, according to the advisory. The parking brake is not affected by these issues.\n\nMercedes will ask owners of vehicles involved in the recall to take their SUV to a dealer for an inspection. If the brake booster does not show corrosion, no further action will be needed, according to NHTSA. SUVs that exhibit brake booster corrosion will undergo further tests to determine if the brakes are functioning normally. In this case, owners of SUVs that have brakes that are functioning well will be asked to return later, possibly up to two years, for re-inspection and possible repairs. If the brakes are not functioning normally, the booster will be replaced immediately.\n\nThere will be no charge for any recall-related repairs or inspections and Mercedes will provide free towing of vehicles to the dealer for inspections and repairs. Mercedes dealers can also help arrange alternative transportation for owners whose vehicles need recall-related repair work that cannot be done immediately, the automaker said.\n\nThere have been no crashes, injuries or deaths related to the issue, according to Mercedes. Owners with questions can contact Mercedes at 888-548-8514 or NHTSA at 888-327-4236.

You can sign up for free right here.\n\nSince the day Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, we’ve known Roe was dead too — the only question, really, was whether it would be formally overturned or just gutted in everything but name. Now, just more than a week after the publication of Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion overturning Roe, it’s worth looking back and asking ourselves: Did our coverage over the past two years, all of it, really reflect what we knew?\n\nIt’s worth asking this now because there are other significant things we know.\n\nWe know that most of the Republican Party embraces — at least publicly — the outright falsehood that Donald Trump was the real winner of the 2020 election, but that it was stolen from him by a vast conspiracy. We know that the most prominent Republican elected officials who refused to back Trump on this are leaving office or being drummed out or primaried by the true believers. We know those true believers think there is no way Trump could lose a presidential election, and maybe that no Republican nominee could.\n\nWe know — though not all of us may admit it — that if the GOP takes one or both houses of Congress this fall and enough of those true believers get into office, then in 2024 there may be no stopping the tide. We know they do not believe he could lose, so we know there is a good chance he will not be allowed to.\n\nAnd we know the result would likely be not just the overturning of an American election but a reshaping of the world order. Is your newsroom’s coverage of the midterms reflecting these things that we know? Will it?\n\n(Some people will think all of this alarmist or naïve, and will rightly think that just about every election gets treated as if it’s the most important election ever and then the vast majority aren’t. Some will think that we don’t actually know these things, that we don’t know what happen if the Republican nominee loses convincingly in 2024 and there is no evidence of fraud. But Trump lost convincingly in 2020 and there was no evidence of fraud.)\n\nThis is not a question about whether you’re covering the January 6th commission and what it’s learning, or what people who believe the lies about 2020 are saying as they run for office; many newsrooms are doing stellar coverage of both. It’s not a question about whether you’re starting up one of the units now popping up dedicated to covering democracy and challenges to it; those are worthwhile efforts but can’t do the job on their own.\n\nThis is a question about all of your coverage of politics and the midterms from now until November and then beyond. Is it business as usual, albeit with some of these stories sprinkled in – or does it show the world as it actually is?\n\nBig picture thinking\n\nLet’s be honest: The nice thing about writing something like this is I just get to hector everyone without actually having to solve the problems myself. Because there is no simple solution. It would be great if this were as easy as doing one story a day about the democracy sky falling, or doing some overwrought punditry, or adding a “to be sure, democracy is at stake” paragraph to every article – but of course it’s not.\n\nPeople in newsrooms typically don’t have time amid the crush of news to think about the big picture of our coverage, to step back and look at all of it and the overall story it conveys to our audiences. But now, right now, we have to make that time. We have to think about the coverage decisions we make, the stories we cover and don’t and the ones we play big and the ones to which we give short shrift.\n\nThis doesn’t mean being biased.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk has now found himself potentially saddled with paying $44 billion for a company he said in recent months that he no longer wanted to buy.\n\nFollowing news of his renewed willingness to purchase Twitter, Musk took, fittingly, to Twitter to claim that the acquisition would be merely one step toward creating an “everything app” he called “X.”\n\nWhile Musk did not elaborate on what he meant by an “everything app,” he could be taking inspiration from so-called “super apps” like Tencent-owned WeChat.\n\nHowever, despite his many successes, Musk has also left in his wake a long list of un- or under-realized promises for similarly ambitious technologies.\n\nHe’s not produced a long-promised electric truck for sale, programmed a Tesla to safely or reliably drive itself, or whooshed anyone through a tunnel at great speed.\n\nAnd why would he? Those aren’t things he does. Those are just things he has said he’s going to do.\n\nHere’s the thing: As Musk and his team of lawyers seemingly try to close the deal to avoid going to trial over the mess he made of the Twitter takeover, the man’s reputation is being crystallized. And it’s not the Eccentric Business Genius reputation he has worked so hard to cultivate.\n\nLet’s step back: Tesla shares jumped nearly 1,900% between 2018, when it first became profitable, and its peak in this past spring. That surge was predicated on Tesla’s promise to become the car company of the future.\n\nSoon, Musk told the world, Tesla would build cars that drove themselves. Not only would Tesla vehicles be fully electric, they would come with the option of “full self-driving” software that would allow them to pilot themselves. An unfinished version of this software is currently available, but it requires an attentive human behind the wheel.\n\nHe claimed that a new Tesla Roadster model — unveiled in 2017 but still not in production — would come with “rocket thrusters” to propel it to face-smashing velocities. Tesla, he said in 2019, was going to build an all-electric “Cybertruck,” which has yet to go into production. He claimed just this week that the Cybertruck would be “waterproof enough to serve briefly as a boat.”\n\nA Tesla-produced semi truck, he promised in 2017, would transform a trucker from a driver to a high-level systems supervisor, all while removing countless tons of choking emissions from the roads and would revolutionizing the supply chain industry. Musk has said the semi will begin shipping by the end of 2022.\n\nHe has claimed each year since 2019 that he hoped, through his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, to implant a chip into the brain of a human test subject the following year.\n\nAnd to be sure, he has managed to make over a million cars from factories all over the world. With SpaceX, he put humans into orbit and landed the rockets nice and neat next to the launch pad. Those rockets are now launching more payload than the rest of the world combined.\n\nBut there’s also a long list of things Musk has not delivered.\n\nThere were the battery swapping stations.\n\n“Full Self Driving.”\n\nThe Cybertruck.\n\nThe new roadster.\n\nThe semi.\n\nThe brain-computer interface.\n\nThe hyperloop.\n\nWe’re not holding our breath for that one.\n\nInstead of getting all those world-changing inventions, we’ve got Tesla. Which isn’t bad! All things considered, Tesla is a good carmaker that’s managed to maintain its lead in the increasingly crowded electric vehicle market.\n\nBut while Musk was busy running multiple companies, tweeting about crypto and conspiracies and trying to buy Twitter, Tesla’s competition has been busy working.\n\nFord has its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, which was so popular that Ford had to close the reservation site after receiving over 100,000 reservations to purchase a truck.\n\nGM’s Silverado EV is due out next year, as is the all-electric Chevy Equinox, with a price tag under $30,000, far less than the least expensive Tesla.\n\nMercedes has luxury electric sedans and SUVs, positioned precisely in the same segment of the market as Tesla’s original Model S and Model X, neither of which has had a major update since they first debuted a decade ago.\n\nPorsche has the Taycan. Hyundai, Volvo, BMW, and Volkswagen all have electric models that are just starting to not just compete with Tesla’s offerings, but to move beyond those market segments.\n\nMike’s Two Cents\n\nAt the risk of being the feared Biased Journalist, I want Elon Musk to succeed. Not because I have any investment in Tesla. But because if Musk is right, I desperately want to be wrong. I want cars to safely drive themselves, saving thousands of lives each year. I want robots to enable a life of leisure (never mind that most “labor saving” devices only serve to squeeze workers further). I want cars to all be free of carbon emissions.\n\nBut at some point, people are going to stop giving Musk time and money.\n\nThe image of Musk, the great prognosticator, the dreamer, and all the rest, is already giving way to Musk the huckster, the swindler, the immature and easily distracted troll.\n\nRead more\n\nElon Musk’s Twitter acquisition isn’t a done deal yet. Twitter and Musk on Wednesday had yet to reach an agreement on ending the litigation, which would avert the trial that’s set to take place in less than two weeks, a person familiar with the negotiations told CNN.\n\nDonald Trump, who was kicked off Twitter over his role in the Jan. 6 violence, could be back on the platform before the midterms if Musk’s takeover deal goes through.\n\nMusk’s “everything app” idea sounds an awful lot like China’s WeChat.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: 2 million\n\nSaudi-led OPEC and its Russian allies are giving a big middle finger to the West in general and the Biden administration in particular. The group, known as OPEC+, is slashing oil production by 2 million barrels a day, the biggest cut since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe group of major oil producers, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia and controls more than 40% of global oil production, is hoping to preempt a drop in demand from an economic slowdown.\n\nIt’s really not great for the Biden administration, which now faces the prospect of US gas prices rising just weeks ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nWhat else is going on?\n\nStocks: After a day with lots of ups and downs, US stocks were mostly flat Wednesday, snapping a two-day rally. On Wall Street, sometimes good news — like economic data showing a strong job market — is bad news. Investors know that a strong labor market will signal to the Fed that the economy can handle more tough interest rate hikes to tackle inflation. The more the Fed jacks up borrowing costs, the bigger the risk of causing a recession.\n\nThe Dow ended the day with a loss of a little more than 40 points, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.2% and 0.3% respectively.\n\nStressed: (From the FT) Wall Street players are warning about the risk of a “market accident” as the financial system comes under more and more stress. A Treasury Department gauge of strain in US markets has soared to its highest level since May 2020, which was a, um, stressful time. Here’s an illustrative take on the situation: “This is a story about boiling lobsters. You put them in cold water and slowly turn the heat up,” George Goncalves, head of US macro strategy at MUFG, told the Financial Times. “That is what is happening in markets. The Fed is turning up the heat. But because the market is still flush with liquidity, it’s not yet clear where the weakness is.”\n\n2008, Part II?: So, look, we’re probably (technically) already in a housing recession. But real estate developers aren’t sweating. David O’Reilly, CEO of Howard Hughes Corp., said he’s not terribly worried about another crash like we saw in ’08. “We had a massive oversupply when Lehman hit the wall,” he said. But these days, demand still outstrips supply, especially in cities where Howard Hughes has a big presence, such as Phoenix, Las Vegas and Houston.\n\nBye Bye, Chi: (Bloomberg) Tyson Foods is following in the footsteps of Citadel and Boeing, moving its corporate offices out of Chicago. Tyson said it’s moving all its white-collar staff to its Springdale, Arkansas, headquarters. That means employees from Chicago will relocate. Which, uh, will be quite an adjustment, one would think.\n\nEnjoying Nightcap? Sign up and you’ll get all of this, plus some other funny stuff we liked on the internet, in your inbox every night.

Although General Motors canceled its plans to attend in person, CEO Mary Barra will deliver the conference’s opening keynote address and is expected to share more about the company’s vision for mass-adoption of electric vehicles. GM (GM) is set to unveil a new, all-electric pickup truck at the show on January 5.\n\nOther forms of transportation will also be on display, such as electric scooters, electric bikes and a Sierra Space plane, which is partnering with NASA to take goods to the International Space Station.\n\nThe digital health space, which has accelerated over the past two years, will be a major point of focus at CES this year, too. While companies will tout new health gadgets, apps and services, panel discussions will highlight the future of telemedicine and emerging products, such as mobile app-enabled, at-home Covid-19 tests. A healthcare provider — Abbott, a medical device company — will deliver a keynote presentation for the first time.\n\nMeanwhile, discussions around a variety of policy issues facing the tech industry are also planned, such as how to craft effective privacy laws, how to address the growing threat of cyberattacks and how to regulate cryptocurrencies. The event comes as regulators in the United States and elsewhere consider how to rein in dominant big tech companies and how to responsibly manage emerging technologies such as AI, cryptocurrency and autonomous vehicles.\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly are all expected to attend CES.\n\nOther areas of focus include food tech, NFTs, augmented and virtual reality, and sessions focused on the metaverse, the vision for a 3D version of the internet where, among other activities, digital avatars can walk around and interact with one another in real time.\n\nA big test\n\nBeyond setting the stage for the upcoming year in tech, CES will likely be a major test for the return of large, international conventions. Similar events, including the World Economic Forum’s annual event in Davos, Switzerland, have recently been postponed due to uncertainty over the variant.\n\n“We are actively tracking the emerging news and science around the new Omicron variant,” the Consumer Tech Association said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor and adjust our plans and health protocols as necessary.”", "authors": ["Samantha Kelly Clare Duffy", "Samantha Kelly", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/13/media/joe-biden-press-freedom-advocates-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "As Biden concludes first year in office, press freedom advocates ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nIn the coming days the minute-by-minute stories about President Biden’s victories, defeats and struggles will be joined by sweeping reviews of the president’s first year in office. The Fox crowd says he’s already a failure. Some in the progressive wing are almost as critical. More sober or at least less partisan minds, like history professor Julian Zelizer, say Biden’s current challenges are very real, but “they shouldn’t be seen as a clear indication of where his presidency is headed.” In this CNN Opinion column, Zelizer notes that “we have seen many presidents recover from a difficult start.”\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, I want to zoom in on Biden’s relationship with the press corps, which is the topic of this new Committee to Protect Journalists special report by Leonard Downie Jr.\n\nDownie previously evaluated Donald Trump’s damaging attacks against the media. Obviously, Biden’s rhetoric “is a stark contrast” to Trump’s viciousness, he wrote. “However, one year into the Biden administration, press freedom advocates remain concerned about issues like the president’s limited availability to journalists, the administration’s slow responses to requests for information, its planned extradition of Julian Assange, restrictions on media access at the U.S. southern border, and its limited assistance to Afghan journalists.”\n\nDownie spoke with 30+ journalists, academics, advocates, and White House officials. His report is a well-rounded look at the push and pull between the presidency and the press corps. It concludes with some recommendations from CPJ…\n\nBiden’s #1 topic: Covid\n\nAhead of Biden’s one-year anniversary in office, CNN’s Sam Fossum and Betsy Klein compiled records of his public remarks. Since inauguration day, Biden has made remarks at least 263 times, not counting interviews. “Biden has most frequently spoken about the coronavirus pandemic (56 times), followed by his domestic agenda (48 times), and the economy more broadly (31 times),” they found. “The President has made remarks on foreign policy 26 times and spoken 15 times on various natural disasters. Other topics of note include political speeches (10), gun violence (5), and voting rights and democracy (4).”\n\nWhat the press corps wants\n\nMore access. As this recent AP story demonstrates, Biden holds fewer press conferences and grants fewer interviews than his recent predecessors. He holds informal Q&A sessions more often, but in the words of White House Correspondents Association president Steven Portnoy, “the historical record of a presidency requires more than fleeting Q&A.”\n\n“The free people of the world benefit when the American president demonstrates his willingness to stand for questions,” Portnoy told VOA. “We believe more formal opportunities to engage the president on a broad range of public concerns would be in the public interest.”\n\n>> Patsy Widakuswara’s story for VOA is titled “Under Biden, Press Given Respect but Not Access…”\n\nFurther reading\n\n– NBC’s Kelly O’Donnell: “The president declined to take questions today and continued his COVID briefing off camera.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nLondon CNN Business —\n\nThe world’s richest man wasn’t convinced he’d be successful in his bid to buy Twitter, one of the most influential social media companies on the planet.\n\nBut Tesla CEO Elon Musk pulled it off. On Monday, Twitter announced that it had reached a deal to sell the company to Musk for $54.20 a share, days after Musk announced he’d lined up $46.5 billion in financing.\n\nThe agreement is one of the biggest deals to take a company private ever recorded, according to data from Dealogic.\n\nIt sparked instant debate — much of it, naturally, playing out on Twitter.\n\nIf the deal goes through, Musk will join a growing list of billionaires who have tapped their fortunes to scoop up high-profile media properties. And given Musk’s commitment to creating “an inclusive arena for free speech,” his ownership could also have major ramifications for public discourse, thanks to Twitter’s role in steering conversation online.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, have been busy drilling down on other questions. Here are a few that still need answers.\n\nWill one of the biggest leveraged buyouts in history actually close?\n\nMusk doesn’t own any other big media properties, which means regulators that focus on antitrust issues are unlikely to hold up the deal.\n\n“We do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it’s guaranteed to cross the finish line. Twitter shares closed at $51.70 on Monday, almost 5% below the deal price. That could point to some skepticism that the transaction becomes final.\n\nBloomberg reports that Musk will have to pay a termination fee “if the deal falls apart or if he walks away.”\n\nCould Musk be forced to sell Tesla stock?\n\nMusk persuaded banks including Morgan Stanley to cough up more than $25 billion in debt financing.\n\nBut he still needs to put up roughly $21 billion on his own. Where will he get the money?\n\nMost of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla (TSLA) stock. That’s raised the specter that he could offload a portion of his 17% stake to fund the Twitter deal.\n\nHow involved will Musk be?\n\nMusk has his hands full running the world’s most valuable automaker as well as private space company SpaceX. His tunnel-building startup, The Boring Company, is also growing. Last week, it announced new funding from venture capital firms like Sequoia, valuing the firm at nearly $6 billion.\n\nSo far, Musk has been vague in outlining his plans to overhaul Twitter and the role he’ll take. He may deputize someone else to fulfill his pledge to prioritize free speech, add features, make the company’s algorithms open source and defeat “spam bots.”\n\nBut if he gets too involved, it could affect investor confidence in Tesla, given how closely Musk’s cult of personality is tied to the company’s share price. And if Musk brings back former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey — who tweeted support for Musk on Monday — that could spark a shakeup at Square parent Block, which Dorsey currently heads up.\n\nIs a bear market coming for US stocks?\n\nUS stocks have stumbled this year, breaking the stunning momentum they built during the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Could an even sharper sell-off be on the cards?\n\nThe latest: Morgan Stanley is warning clients that the S&P 500 could enter a bear market, which marks a 20% decline from recent highs, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports.\n\nInvestors have “very few places to hide” in markets right now, strategists led by Mike Wilson wrote Monday.\n\n“The market has been so picked over at this point, it’s not clear where the next rotation lies,” Wilson’s team wrote. “In our experience, when that happens, it usually means the overall index is about to fall sharply with almost all stocks falling in unison.”\n\nStep back: The S&P 500, the broadest gauge of US stocks, has been in a bull market since late March 2020, when the Federal Reserve came to the rescue with unprecedented support amid the deep recession caused by Covid-19.\n\nBut it’s faltered as the Fed has started to hike interest rates to fight the highest inflation in four decades. Price increases have been made worse by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe index has been in the red for three straight weeks. It’s currently down about 10% from record highs set in early January.\n\nThere’s precedent: The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, whose top stocks were some of the biggest beneficiaries of the Covid rally, fell into a bear market in early March.\n\nMorgan Stanley agrees that inflation may finally be at or near its peak. The bank doesn’t see this as a positive catalyst for stocks, though, since it will probably feed into a period of lower economic growth, which will weigh on corporate earnings.\n\nSmall businesses plan to keep hiking prices\n\nSmall companies are getting slammed by inflation, as higher costs for materials, transportation and labor push up the cost of doing business.\n\nAccording to a new survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group, 93% of US small business owners say inflation is having a “substantial” or “moderate” impact on their operations.\n\nOne consequence? Many plan to keep passing these price increases along to their customers to cushion the blow.\n\nThat could keep prices elevated in the coming months, even though some economists are hopeful the worst of the inflation problem may be behind us.\n\nSee here: Four in 10 US small businesses polled by the NFIB said they intended to raise selling prices by 10% or more. In March, US consumer prices rose by 8.5% compared to the previous year.\n\nBig businesses have greater leeway to fight inflation, since they have more leverage when negotiating bulk orders with suppliers. Over the past year, some companies like Walmart and Costco have even chartered their own ships to avoid shipping problems.\n\nBut smaller firms are more constrained, which can mean they feel pressure to hike prices in even larger increments when their costs jump.\n\nUp next\n\n3M (MMM), General Electric (GE), JetBlue (JBLU) and CNN parent Warner Bros.

While CEO Jim Farley divided the company into Ford Model e (electric) and Ford Blue (non-electric) units, it is Ford Blue trucks that generate the revenue needed to transform the Dearborn automaker.\n\nFarley has indicated, however, that additional job cuts may be on the horizon in an attempt to be more competitive on costs of operating the company.\n\nFord's 2023 Transit Trail:Van made for DIY adventure seekers on a budget\n\nFord recalls:Over 634K SUVs due to fuel leaks and fire risk\n\nFord employs about 176,000 employees globally.

The company does not disclose specific details related to retirees, including how many take lump sum buyouts.\n\nFinancial analyst weighs in\n\nSam Huszczo, a chartered financial analyst in Southfield, Mich., said Wednesday that his firm had a lot of discussions with Ford clients about retiring in 2022 and taking the lump sum option.\n\n\"The main group of people who decided to take the lump sum offer were planning to retire in 2023 or 2024 anyway,\" he said. \"And this was enough to push them over the edge to pull the trigger on retiring.\"\n\nMore:Biden to announce federal bailout for troubled union pension fund\n\nIn some cases, he said, people felt anxious that they were making a major life decision that would impact the next 30 years of their lives but had just two months to decide what to do – all while having to work at the same time.\n\nMany times, he said, Ford clients who were within three to five years of retiring decided not to retire after all, knowing that they'd be giving up their paychecks much sooner than expected.

After an extremely successful market debut in 2019, Beyond Meat (BYND) has lost favor with investors. The stock dropped about 77% so far this year.\n\nSome of the problems can be attributed to broader industry challenges. In the grocery store, interest in plant-based meats has waned as consumers, faced with inflation, focus on shopping for affordable basics.\n\nAt the same time, restaurant traffic is dipping. Cash-strapped customers are pulling back on dining out, making Beyond’s foodservice business more vulnerable. And Beyond is far from the only company to lay off staff as a possible recession looms.\n\nBeyond Meat's sales fell in the third quarter. Yuriko Nakao/Getty Images\n\nBut Beyond is facing some unique challenges.\n\nThe company recently parted ways with three members of its C-suite, one of whom allegedly bit someone’s nose. A recent LA Times report called into question the hygiene of a Beyond Meat facility in Pennsylvania, though the company stands by the cleanliness of the plant, saying that its “food safety protocols go above industry and regulatory standards.”\n\nAlso, a promising partnership with McDonald’s (MCD) has stalled in the United States. And fierce competition is squeezing sales, including in frozen, plant-based chicken, a category that is growing while refrigerated plant-based meat sales falter.\n\nThe company’s plan is to focus on cash flow and profitability rather than growth, and become more strategic in its restaurant and marketing initiatives, among other things.\n\n“Despite the current headwinds facing our business and category, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the long-term growth and impact expected from our global brand,” a Beyond Meat spokesperson told CNN Business in response to a request for comment.\n\n“They’ve got a big task ahead of them,” said Peter Saleh, restaurant analyst at financial services firm BTIG. Next year will be about “trying to get their financials in order to a place where they can sustain themselves,” he added. “It’s a tall order.”\n\nWhere’s the McPlant?\n\nLast year, Beyond Meat announced a strategic partnership with McDonald’s, including working with the burger chain on the McPlant, a plant-based burger.\n\nSince then, the McPlant has been added to the McDonald’s menu permanently in some European markets.\n\nIn the US, McDonald’s (MCD) tested out the burger in some locations. But it hasn’t added the item to the menu, and it’s not clear if or when that will happen.\n\n“I don’t think it’s totally off the table, but I’m not sure that it’s going to be [Beyond’s] saving grace at this point,” said Saleh.\n\nBeyond has also lost its spot on the Dunkin’ menu. The coffee chain enthusiastically rolled out a breakfast sandwich with Beyond sausage nationally in 2019, but stopped working with Beyond last year.\n\nMcDonald's tested the McPlant, but has not added it permanently to US menus. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nBeyond still has plenty of partnerships with restaurants, but many of them are limited-time tests.\n\n“In the last 12 months, we have had 25 trials for permanent menu launches with nine distinct products,” said Beyond CEO Ethan Brown during a November analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results.\n\nBrown positioned the launches as long-term investments, saying they won’t generate big sales in the short term but should pay off eventually. But getting a permanent menu spot might be challenging, noted Kathryn Fenner, principal at foodservice consulting firm Technomic.\n\n“Even if they sell, say 30 to 40 of these plant-based burgers a day … that still pales in comparison to their traditional proteins,” she said, speaking about plant-based burgers in general. And these days, making a limited-time offer permanent is a tough sell because operators have been slimming down their menus, she noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Burger King continues to sell the Impossible Whopper nationally. “We haven’t been experiencing what Beyond Meat and some of the other brands in the space have reported,” said Impossible foods spokesperson Keely Sulprizio. Impossible is private and is not required to share its sales data publicly.\n\nIn the grocery store, Beyond is facing a swell of competition.\n\nCompetition heats up\n\nBeyond has embraced competition in the past. But now, rivals are interfering with its bottom line.\n\n“We believe that healthy competition within plant-based meat is a good thing as it brings investment in marketing to the category,” said Brown during the November analyst call.\n\n“However, in the current environment, we are not seeing this benefit,” he said. “Instead, more companies are pursuing the same or fewer consumers.” Brown said Beyond is the leader in refrigerated plant-based meat, and that he expects some brands to pull back or consolidate in the future.\n\nIt’s true that the plant-based meat pie is smaller these days. Retail sales of meat alternatives fell about 12% in the year through November 6, according to data from IRI. Ground plant-based meat fell about 19%, and patties were down 30% in that period.\n\nBut frozen chicken alternatives are growing. Strips and cutlets sales increased about 16% and nuggets jumped nearly 28%.\n\n“Frozen plant-based chicken is the largest single subcategory in all of plant-based meats and continues to grow at a double-digit pace,” said Brown during the analyst call. “So we are pleased to be expanding our presence of additional chicken items.”\n\nBeyond Meat introduced plant-based chicken strips in retail in 2014, but pulled the product in 2019. It launched a retooled version, Beyond Chicken Tenders, in stores in 2021, and has built its plant-based chicken portfolio since then.\n\nBut in the few years Beyond’s product was off the market, new entrants rushed into the space.\n\nNuggs, a plant-based chicken nugget made by startup Simulate, has made a splash online thanks to its bold packaging over the last few years and has been expanding in retail.\n\nDaring, another plant-based chicken company, launched its product in the US in 2020. Daring’s chicken alternative became available at Whole Foods last year. Impossible and other legacy brands have offerings, as well.\n\n“Plant-based chicken is a good growth category,” said Saleh. “I would have liked to have seen [Beyond] double down.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/business/starbucks-china-meituan-alibaba-delivery-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Starbucks teams up with Meituan app for coffee delivery in China ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nStarbucks is joining forces with Chinese tech giant Meituan to expand delivery options in its second biggest market.\n\nThe coffee chain announced Tuesday that it has teamed up with the popular food delivery app to roll out new offerings for customers in China.\n\nNow, consumers in mainland China will be able to place orders on Meituan’s platform, which boasts more than 667 million active users.\n\nStarbucks aims to have a tab created for each of its roughly 5,000 China stores on Meituan’s platform by the end of the year, where users will be able to check out local events and see photos and videos from baristas of each location.\n\nThe move adds to a series of splashy tie-ups Starbucks (SBUX) has brokered in China recently to go after consumers more aggressively.\n\nIn 2020, the Seattle-based coffee chain launched an initiative on WeChat, Tencent’s ubiquitous social networking app, to allow users to place delivery orders.\n\nTwo years prior, it partnered with Alibaba (BABA) to let people make purchases via voice recognition, through its Ele.me food delivery app, and using Alipay, the digital payments system.\n\nStarbucks is teaming up with Chinese tech giant Meituan to expand delivery options in its second biggest market.

Rick Scott to task for once proposing massive cuts in the state’s mosquito control budget.\n\n*Scott blasted the Obama administration for failing to give the state enough help to fight Zika, then accused Democratic Sen.

But she’s not surprised at the stalemate or the bickering.\n\n“This issue is arising in the middle of a very contentious, competitive election,” she said. “And each party wants to take credit for the good and dis their opponent with the bad. That’s what we’ve seen happening on the Zika issue.”\n\nCongressional leaders have reported some progress in reaching a $1.1 billion deal to fund anti-Zika efforts, including vaccine development, insect spraying and distribution of testing kits. If a compromise is reached, it’s likely to be attached to a broad spending bill lawmakers will be asked to vote on at the end of the month.\n\nEarlier Zika legislation in the Republican-controlled Congress was blocked by Democrats who objected to unrelated provisions, including barriers to contraception, the display of the Confederate flag at national cemeteries and laxer environmental standards for pesticides. The deal being discussed would not include those.\n\nRubio and the Democrat running against him this year, Rep. Patrick Murphy, have spent weeks blaming each other for not doing enough to end the stalemate.\n\nThey both initially backed Obama’s request in February for $1.9 billion, though Rubio also has supported GOP measures that would have provided less money and included provisions Murphy and others found objectionable.\n\nWednesday, NARAL pounced on Rubio’s absence from the bipartisan press conference the day before, saying he was “putting his own political needs ahead of the needs of women and families in Florida.”\n\nRubio spokesman Olivia Perez-Cubas responded that Murphy “is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika — once again putting himself and his political aspirations before Floridians.”\n\nRubio spent part of Tuesday and Wednesday meeting with Scott, who admonished the Obama administration for ignoring Florida.\n\n“Since June 1, I’ve asked for a plan to work with (the Federal Emergency Management Agency). Haven’t given it to me,” the governor told reporters. “The White House has not been a good partner.”\n\nQ&A: Zika vaccine waits on Congress\n\nAdministration officials pushed back against Scott’s allegations, detailing efforts they’ve made to help the state:\n\n*A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team was recently dispatched to Florida to monitor Zika efforts.\n\n*The Health and Human Services Department has provided more than $35 million that can be used for Zika-related activities. In August, Florida received materials for an additional 6,300 lab tests in addition to the 2,000 already provided. CDC also provided on-site technical consultation to Florida’s public health laboratories, enabling them to substantially increase testing capacity.\n\n*FEMA officials have been in contact with the state to discuss the role the agency can play, though the White House said FEMA assistance may not be the best option for a mosquito-borne disease like Zika.\n\n“This is why the president put forward a supplemental request in February, to ensure that states like Florida would have the resources they need to effectively response to Zika,” the White House spokesman said.\n\nGrayson, the Democratic congressman from Orlando, said Scott should look in the mirror if there are fingers to be pointed.\n\nUnder the governor's watch, state aid to mosquito control programs around Florida in 2011 was sliced 40% — from $2.16 million to $1.29 million — and he vetoed a $500,000 grant that would have kept a state mosquito lab open in Panama City.\n\n“If the governor would revisit those decisions, that would be a good start in itself,\" Grayson said.\n\nMcKinley P. Lewis, a spokesman for Scott, said the state has spent more than $13.2 million for mosquito prevention and control, including a 20-year-high investment of $2.8 million this year. He also said that this summer the governor authorized more than $26 million in emergency state funds to combat Zika, including $5 million to Miami-Dade County for Zika preparedness and mosquito control.\n\nNelson was miffed that Scott singled him out for joining other Democrats in blocking the Zika bill.\n\n“He should know better,” Nelson said. “This is a serious situation, not a time for partisan politics.”\n\nWhom do voters blame?

While on the surface this law may seem harmless, if perhaps unnecessary, it is actually a very deliberate, politically motivated attack on transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, a group of people who already live their daily lives under the constant threat of discrimination, harassment and assault. Essentially, under the guise of civic concern and through capitalizing on ignorance and fear, this law reinforces the widespread lack of legal protection transgender Americans have regarding their safety, privacy and personal freedoms.\n\nUCF community remembers transgender lives at vigil\n\nThe basis of this law stems from the heinously misinformed and damaging myth of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals being “predators” who will sneak into public restrooms to commit deviant acts and prey upon women and children. This narrative incites fear in the general public and is only possible due to tragically widespread misconceptions about transgender individuals and the challenges they face every day.\n\nIn fact, the transgender predator myth could not be further from the truth. Sources such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Campaign have reported that, to this day, there has not been a single documented case of a transgender individual assailing anyone in a bathroom.\n\nUnfortunately, while the danger transgender individuals pose to everyday bathroom-goers is just a myth, the dangers that transgender individuals themselves face when using the restroom are very real and troubling. In a survey conducted by the Williams Institute in 2013, roughly 70 percent of transgender individuals surveyed reported that they had faced instances of discrimination and harassment when using the bathroom. It seems as though the passing of HB2 and the heated controversy surrounding it have only added to the already-hostile environment transgender individuals face. Just this past week, a transgender woman in Washington, D.C., was physically assaulted, called a homophobic slur and removed from the women’s restroom of a grocery store by a security guard. Two days prior to that incident, a cisgender woman was verbally harassed by another woman in a Wal-Mart bathroom after she mistook her as transgender due to her short hair.\n\nUCF Senate: Bathroom bill inherently transphobic\n\nClearly, laws such as HB2 do not help anyone and can actually do a severe amount of harm to the already-marginalized community of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. While the passing of HB2 has made it even harder for transgender individuals in North Carolina to go about their daily lives, and while the surrounding controversy has generated a surge of hateful attitudes toward transgender people from some, this whole affair has a singular bright side in the fact that it has put transgender issues in the national spotlight and forced the general public to pay collective attention to a group of people who are often overlooked even within the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nTransgender individuals deserve to go about their day in peace as much as anyone else does, which can never be achieved as long as they still face the threat of discrimination regarding something as elementary as bathroom use. Discriminatory laws such as HB2 must be changed, and transgender and gender nonconforming individuals must be afforded the right to use a bathroom facility that corresponds with their gender identity without fearing for their safety. At UCF, we have a prime opportunity to lead this charge against hate, as many initiatives for public restroom inclusivity have begun at college campuses.\n\nUCF currently has 16 gender-neutral bathrooms — which are exempt from HB2 — on campus and at Research Park, as well as at Central Florida Hillel at Northview apartments.\n\nUCF students tell all about their transgender identities\n\nIn addition to making sure that transgender individuals are welcome to use either the men’s or women’s restroom as it corresponds to their gender identity, more than 150 colleges and universities in America have introduced gender-neutral restroom facilities that can be used by students of all genders. UCF can join this list, which was an idea that was proposed by SGA President Christopher Clemente while running for office.\n\nOur diversity makes us stronger, and is something that should be celebrated rather than feared. Every student deserves to be able to go about their daily life unencumbered by fear, especially that of harassment and discrimination, and it is our responsibility as Knights to stand together in order to make this a reality.\n\n-----\n\nAudrey Widner is a Contributing Columnist for the Central Florida Future.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona/2016/05/18/federal-ruling-keeps-temporary-ban-on-arizona-executions/84574690/", "title": "Ruling keeps Arizona executions on hold", "text": "Michael Kiefer\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nA U.S. District Court judge in Phoenix ruled late Wednesday that a case challenging a controversial drug used in Arizona executions could go forward. In the meantime, Arizona executions will remain on hold until the case is decided.\n\nBut it may be a moot point. The state's supply of the drug in question, Midazolam, is set to expire on May 31, and attorneys for the state have said Arizona has been unable to secure further quantities, as drug manufacturers do not want to sell it for use in executions.\n\nLawyers from the Federal Public Defenders Office in Phoenix and attorneys from a Los Angeles law firm filed suit on behalf of Joseph Wood, an Arizona death-row inmate whose 2014 execution using Midazolam took nearly two hours, and on behalf of other inmates, against the Arizona Department of Corrections, claiming that Midazolam use violates the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nSo, too, does a paralytic drug used in the proposed Arizona execution protocol, the lawsuit added. Midazolam, the suit claims, does not sufficiently prevent pain, and the paralytic drug just masks any suffering or suffocation that the condemned prisoner may experience.\n\nThe First Amendment Coalition of Arizona, a confederation of media outlets, also entered into the suit on the side of the prisoners, alleging that the state of Arizona needs to provide more transparency in how executions are carried out, including where drugs come from and how the prisoner is brought into the execution chamber. The suit also alleged that the state violated the First Amendment.\n\nThe state of Arizona asked that the court dismiss the suit altogether so that it could resume executions.\n\nSEE ALSO: Is the death penalty in Arizona on life support?\n\nJudge Neil Wake, who has long presided over lethal-execution litigation, granted the dismissal on the First Amendment counts and threw the media groups off the case.\n\nBut Wake refused to dismiss the Eighth Amendment allegations.

The peer-reviewed observational study contradicted other published reports that showed the drug doesn't help coronavirus patients and could cause heart rhythm problems in some people.\n\nThe FDA denied Henry Ford's request this week.\n\nMore:After Fauci criticism, Henry Ford Health clams up on hydroxychloroquine study\n\nMore:Hydroxychloroquine saved coronavirus patients' lives, Michigan study shows\n\n\"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration informed us that it would not grant our request for an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine for a segment of COVID-19 patients meeting very specific criteria,\" said Dr. Adnan Munkarah, Henry Ford's executive vice president and chief clinical officer, in a statement.\n\nThe patients who would have received the drug would have had to meet the same criteria as those who were enrolled in Henry Ford's initial study:\n\nAge 18 or older\n\nHave a positive COVID-19 test\n\nBe admitted to any of its six hospitals\n\nBe low risk for heart complications based on an electrocardiogram algorithm. A QT interval higher than 500 milliseconds was considered an elevated cardiac risk.\n\nHenry Ford's study was widely criticized because it was observational, retrospective and not randomized or controlled. Additionally, the health system used hydroxychloroquine in combination with dexamethasone, a steroid, which has been known to improve outcomes for people with COVID-19.\n\nHope, and conflicting research\n\nEarly in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine looked like it could be a promising treatment for COVID-19, but use of the drug quickly became political.\n\nA French study published March 20 suggested the drug helped people with coronavirus, reporting it \"is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in patients with COVID-19.\" Positive outcomes, it noted, were improved when used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin.\n\nThe next day, President Donald Trump tweeted that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin \"have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\"\n\nEncouraged by those preliminary findings, researchers around the world began to launch their own investigations of the drug, and the FDA issued an emergency use authorization March 28 to allow doctors to begin treating patients with it in hospitalized settings outside clinical trials.\n\nHenry Ford Health System was among many nationally and across the state to begin using hydroxychloroquine in that way. Michigan Medicine, the Detroit Medical Center and McLaren Health Care also used it.\n\nIn early April, both Michigan Medicine and Henry Ford announced they would enroll patients in studies testing the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of coronavirus. Henry Ford’s study was a retrospective analysis of 2,541 patients hospitalized between March 10 and May 2, 2020 across its six hospitals.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, more research suggested that the drug might not help coronavirus patients and could cause some harm.\n\nAn April 23 preliminary review of 368 novel coronavirus patients at U.S. Veterans Health Administration hospitals suggested that the use of hydroxychloroquine — with or without azithromycin — did not reduce the likelihood of needing a mechanical ventilator and it may actually have made patients more likely to die.\n\nAnd a review of the initial French study found it was flawed and overstated the benefits of hydroxychloroquine treatment. The review also showed that patients who had bad outcomes after using the drug were dropped from the study, skewing the results.\n\nStill, Trump continued to publicly praise the drug's effectiveness, and spoke at White House Coronavirus Task Force news conferences about how he was taking it himself with hopes it would prevent him from contracting the virus.\n\nWith evidence mounting, the FDA issued a warning in late April, urging caution about using hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.\n\n\"Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19,\" it said. \"They are being studied in clinical trials.\"\n\nThe drugs, it warned, \"can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation and a dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia. ... Patients who also have other health issues such as heart and kidney disease are likely to be at increased risk of these heart problems when receiving these medicines.\"\n\nBut the federal agency didn't revoke emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine until June 15, writing: \"In light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization announced June 17 that it would stop testing hydroxychloroquine in coronavirus patients through its Solidarity Trial. The National Institutes of Health halted its hydroxychloroquine study a few days later.\n\nThe FDA's Adverse Events Reporting System logged 9,363 reports of bad reactions to hydroxychloroquine and related medications just in the first eight months of this year. Of them, 8,936 were classified as serious reactions in which 402 people died.\n\nComparatively, in all of 2019, there were 8,059 reports of adverse reactions to the drug, and 6,982 were considered serious; 146 people died.\n\nThe politics of hydroxychloroquine\n\nWhen Henry Ford Health System published its hydroxychloroquine study in early July showing success in the treatment of COVID-19 — cutting the mortality rate from 26% among those who did not receive the medicine to 13% among those who did — it was met with skepticism by many in the medical community.\n\nAmong the critics was Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, who called the study \"flawed\" in his testimony in late July at a congressional hearing on the federal government's efforts to control the pandemic.\n\nPatients in the Henry Ford study, Fauci said, were given corticosteroids, which are known to be of a benefit to people with COVID-19. And it wasn't randomized or placebo-controlled, the gold standard for medical studies.\n\nYet, Henry Ford's hydroxychloroquine research was hailed by the president as proof that the drug he touted from the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis works.\n\nTrump took to Twitter on July 6 — the same day Henry Ford asked the FDA for authorization to resume using hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients — alleging Democrats disparaged the drug for political reasons.\n\nThe next day, Dr. Steven Kalkanis, Henry Ford Health System's chief academic officer and senior vice president, told the Free Press that medicine shouldn't be political.\n\n\"We're scientists, not politicians,\" Kalkanis said. \"We've never had a preconceived agenda with this study or any study regarding hydroxychloroquine. We simply wanted to use the resources and the opportunity of COVID, given that Detroit was such a hard-hit region, to find out which treatments worked and which treatment didn't.\n\n\"So early on, we embarked on several different studies, and we wanted to let the data lead us to what is appropriate for patients. We stand behind the results of our study. We found that, you know, among 2,500 patients, the use of hydroxychloroquine cut the death rate in half.\"\n\nLast week, Henry Ford issued an open letter about its study, saying, \"the political climate that has persisted has made any objective discussion about this drug impossible.\"\n\nThe health system said in the letter that it will no longer comment outside the medical community on the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat novel coronavirus.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by this turn of events,\" said the letter, signed by both Munkarah and Kalkanis.\n\n\"Like all observational research, these studies are very difficult to analyze and can never completely account for the biases inherent in how doctors make different decisions to treat different patients. Furthermore, it is not unusual that results from such studies vary in different populations and at different times, and no one study can ever be considered all by itself.\"\n\nTrump has continued to support the use of hydroxychloroquine, saying in a July 28 White House news briefing that he believes in its benefit and that \"many doctors think it is extremely successful.\"\n\n\"I took it for a 14-day period, and I’m here. Right?\" he said. \"I’m here. I happen to think it’s — it works in the early stages. I think front-line medical people believe that, too — some, many. And so we’ll take a look at it. ... It’s safe. It doesn’t cause problems. I had no problem. I had absolutely no problem, felt no different. Didn’t feel good, bad, or indifferent.\"\n\nHenry Ford is continuing with another research study of hydroxychloroquine that was announced in April in conjunction with Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. Called the WHIP COVID-19 study, it's the first large-scale U.S. study to investigate whether using the drug can prevent coronavirus among 3,000 health care workers and first responders.\n\n\"The decision does not impact the ongoing WHIP COVID-19 study, a randomized, double-blind investigation of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive treatment,\" Munkarah said.\n\nThe outcome of that research has yet to be published.\n\nContact Kristen Jordan Shamus: 313-222-5997 or kshamus@freepress.com.

Carnival had suggested it had little choice but to comply with the Cuban rule, which forbids Cuban-born citizens of any country from entering or leaving Cuba by sea. Monday's announcement amounts to a significant policy change at the company.\n\nThe cruises will be the first from the USA to Cuba in more than 50 years.\n\nCruise giant Carnival Corp. wins approval for Cuba sailings\n\nThe change of policy at Carnival comes less than a week after the company was sued in federal court by two Cuban-born Americans who were turned down when they tried to book one of the Cuba sailings. The lawsuit claimed the inability of a group of Americans to participate in a public activity violates the Civil Rights Act. It asked for the May 1 cruise to Cuba to be stopped.\n\nCarnival also faced protests and heavy criticism in its home town of Miami, where it is a significant employer. Protesters said the company was discriminating against Cuban-Americans. Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez requested an official opinion to see whether the Fathom brand would be violating county code by banning passengers based solely on their national origin. Fathom operates out of PortMiami, which is in Miami-Dade County, and Gimenez asked if the restrictions on Cuban-born Americans would represent a breach of contract or warrant penalties.\n\nPressure on Carnival to change its policy grew on Friday after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN en Espanol that \"Carnival needs to not discriminate.\" Kerry had been asked whether the Fathom trips should be postponed until Cuban-born Americans were allowed to travel to the island by sea.\n\nIn a letter Monday to Carnival's 120,000 employees, president and CEO Arnold Donald said the company was committed to \"respecting the sensitivities of people from all backgrounds.\"\n\nDonald said the company had \"an obligation to all our employees, and to the communities in which they work and live, to be the best corporate citizen we can be. We believe (the new policy) best supports that objective.\"\n\nCarnival on Monday said it was confident that ongoing discussions with the Cuban government would result in the elimination of the rule barring Cuban-born people from sailing to Cuba. Carnival noted Cuba already allows Cuban-born people to travel to the country on chartered aircraft.

That's the quirky age when investors typically must start pulling money out of Individual Retirement Accounts and workplace 401(k)-style plans – or face the consequences.\n\nThere are exceptions, such as if you're still working and participate in a 401(k) program, but the general rule is to start making withdrawals after hitting 70½. Failure to pay heed can mean a 50 percent tax penalty on the amount that was supposed to be withdrawn but wasn't.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently ordered a review of RMD rules, specifically asking the Treasury Department to consider adjusting the amounts that people must withdraw each year after hitting 70½. It's one of several actual or potential tax changes or revisions Americans should be watching.\n\nThe \"required minimum distribution\" rule that kicks in after 70½ applies to tax-deferred accounts including traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans on which people paid no taxes when they contributed money and haven't yet paid taxes on accrued earnings.\n\nThe rules are designed to \"make sure that these plans are used to fund the owners' retirement rather than the heirs' inheritance,\" Richard Kaplan, a law professor at the University of Illinois, said in a recent commentary.\n\nThe RMD rule doesn't apply to Roth IRAs, as these plans are funded with after-tax contributions. Roth withdrawals can be delayed until the account owner's death.\n\nMore:Paying for your grown kid's rent and vacation? How to help without risking your retirement\n\nMore:Medicare traps: Learn which option is best for you, avoid paying thousands out of pocket\n\nMore:Preparing a will: What you need to know about estate planning documents, laws\n\nAfter hitting 70½, investors with traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans must pull out a portion of their account and pay taxes on the proceeds. The yearly withdrawal amounts, based on a government life-expectancy schedule, rise each year, meaning higher and higher distributions.\n\nTrump has ordered the Treasury Department to review that schedule with an eye on lowering the required withdrawal amounts to reflect slightly longer life expectancy. That would result in slightly smaller yearly required withdrawals.\n\nMany account owners, upon reaching 70½, are finding that they don't yet need to live on money withdrawn from their accounts.\n\nKaplan thinks a review of this policy also could lead to a new age for starting RMDs – something he considers much more critical. The triggering age of 70½ was established in 1982 and should be increased, in his view.\n\n\"Adjusting that age for the increase in life expectancy since then would bring it closer to 75 years old,\" he said.\n\nEd Slott, a retirement plan expert in suburban New York City, also favors boosting the starting age to 75, if not higher. \"That would be great, the better way to handle (increased life expectancy),\" he said.\n\nThe Treasury Department can change the yearly schedule but not the starting age for mandatory withdrawals without Congress' approval. Kaplan doesn't think that's likely to happen before midterm elections in November but he considers it a possibility after that.\n\nOther retirement changes\n\nSeparate from Trump's executive order on mandatory withdrawals, Congress passed legislation in late September, the Family Savings Act of 2018, that also could change some of the rules regarding IRAs and age 70½.\n\nThis bill, if it becomes law, would exempt people with small retirement balances from having to make RMD withdrawal calculations and deal with possible penalties. People with less than $50,000 in combined retirement-plan assets would be able to withdraw money whenever they wanted and in whatever amounts, Slott said.\n\nA related provision from that legislation would allow people to contribute money into IRAs past age 70½. Currently, that's not allowed. It would apply only to those individuals who continue to work beyond that age, as earned income still is required for making IRA investments.\n\nDeduction details\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service continues trying to educate the public about the considerable changes brought about by last year's tax-reform legislation – and for good reason. Reform was supposed to simplify tax-return preparation, but a review of the rules just involving itemized deductions shows that hasn't been the case.\n\nThe government expects fewer people will itemize, instead taking the standard deduction, which was nearly doubled to $12,000 a year for single taxpayers and $24,000 for married spouses. Personal exemptions, meanwhile, were discontinued.\n\nAmong itemized deductions that were retained, you may continue to write off charity contributions. So too for medical and dental expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of income in 2018 (there's no such medical deduction limit on Arizona state returns).\n\nState and local income, sales and property taxes remain deductible but only up to $10,000 in total, for both singles and married couples. Gambling losses are still deductible up to the amount of winnings.\n\nItemized deductions that are no longer allowed include job-related expenses and other miscellaneous deductions above a 2 percent AGI floor. Moving-expense deductions also are out (except for active-service military personnel).\n\nDeductions for home-mortgage interest are tricky, partly because of timing and partly because this tax break isn't based on the amount of interest paid but, rather, the debt tied to it. For mortgages incurred after Dec. 15, 2017, this deduction, in general, is limited to interest on up to $750,000 of debt incurred to buy a home.\n\nMeanwhile, interest on home-equity debt remains deductible if you use the proceeds to buy, build or improve a dwelling, such as by remodeling.

Again.\n\nChris Licht, the embattled CEO of the cable news network, is out at the company, effective immediately.\n\nThe news, first reported by trade publication Puck and confirmed by CNN's parent, Warner Bros. Discovery, comes five days after Licht was the subject of a devastating profile in The Atlantic. The 15,000-word article portrayed him as an ineffectual leader presiding over a \"meltdown\" at the news organization, including a widely-criticized town hall featuring former President Donald Trump, plummeting ratings and crashing morale among top anchors and correspondents.\n\nLicht took the reins of CNN last year after the network's then-parent company WarnerMedia merged with Discovery. The new company made swift changes at the network, immediately shuttering CNN+, a streaming service that had launched only a month earlier, laying off hundreds of workers and announcing plans to cut back on non-news programming. Licht, appointed by CEO David Zaslav, arrived with a mandate to make CNN more middle-of-the-road in its coverage, which many interpreted as more right-wing. In the Atlantic profile, Licht wavers about the mission of CNN and the definition of \"absolute truth.\"\n\nOpinion:After devastating Chris Licht profile, CNN should report only on its own drama!\n\nIn a staff meeting Wednesday, Zaslav told CNN employees, \"I met with Chris and he will be leaving CNN. ... For a number of reasons, things didn't work out, and that's unfortunate. It's really unfortunate. And ultimately, that's on me, and I take full responsibility for that. But now we begin a new page. This is an extraordinary organization.\" Zaslav said it would take several months to install a permanent leadership team.\n\nUntil then, an interim replacement team includes Amy Entelis, a longtime CNN executive who oversaw CNN Films; Virginia Moseley, EVP of editorial; Eric Sherling, executive VP of U.S. programming; and David Leavy, who was named chief operating officer last Thursday and will oversee business operations.\n\nLicht, 51, replaced beloved news chief Jeff Zucker, 58, a former CEO of NBCUniversal. Zucker was forced out of the company in February 2022 after admitting that he had violated corporate rules by not revealing his romantic relationship with a key deputy, CNN marketing chief Allison Gollust. Filling Zucker's shoes was no easy task, and Licht had an unconventional – and perhaps underqualified – background for the job, coming directly from CBS, where he was executive producer of the late-night talk show, \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\" He had also previously worked in morning television, producing \"CBS This Morning\" and MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nLicht's primary initiative in his short tenure at CNN was the relaunch of its morning show \"CNN This Morning,\" naming Don Lemon, Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow as co-anchors. But in April, Lemon, who had a history of controversial and embarrassing comments, was ousted by the company in a messy firing that spilled over onto Twitter. And he threw Collins into battling Trump in a contentious town hall, stocked with an audience of loyal supporters of the former president who hissed at her and cheered him on.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/06/07/relief-chris-licht-out-at-cnn/70299362007/", "title": "CNN fired its CEO. Here's why the network needs to get it together", "text": "Chris Licht, CNN’s CEO so mired in controversy and bad decisions that the term “embattled” would have sounded like a welcome relief, is gone from the network after little more than a year.\n\nGood.\n\nHe clearly wasn’t up to the task of running the place. Now maybe they can find someone who can.\n\n“I met with Chris and he will be leaving CNN,” David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company that owns CNN, told employees Wednesday morning, according to the network’s website. It was an ignominious end to a rocky tenure that often seemed doomed from the start.\n\nRead the story:Embattled CNN CEO Chris Licht stepping down after controversial year\n\nWhy is Chris Licht leaving CNN?\n\nIf you want an idea of how things were going, this is from the network’s own story about Licht’s exit: “Licht’s departure, which came days after a devastating 15,000-word profile in The Atlantic, capped a tumultuous year for CNN, marked by layoffs, historically low ratings, and rock-bottom employee morale.”\n\nIt doesn’t get much uglier than that. And it doesn’t even include the network’s disastrous Donald Trump town hall, in which the former president spent more than an hour lying and trying to bully moderator Kaitlan Collins.\n\nAccording to the brutal Atlantic story, Licht had said the crowd would be “extra Trumpy.” And it played like a Trump rally, not an exercise in journalism.\n\nOf course, ratings are the one truly unforgivable sin in TV. CNN’s are awful under Licht; two days after the town hall temporarily boosted ratings, Newsmax had more viewers in prime time. Newsmax!\n\nIt’s a bizarre turn for the original cable news network, which seems to be lost in terms of its mission.\n\nZaslav’s marching orders for Licht were to push CNN more toward the political middle. It makes some sense — Fox News is a right-wing propaganda machine; MSNBC is basically the same thing for the left. You’d think there would be a fair amount of room right down the center.\n\nBut maybe not. Maybe the nation is too polarized, and no longer turns to news outlets for anything other than confirmation of their preexisting beliefs.\n\nIf that’s the case it’s tragic — not for TV news, but for democracy.\n\nLicht botched the shift. His entire tenure was marked by bold moves that were at best questioned, often ridiculed. He shut down CNN+ shortly after his arrival. He rebuilt the network’s morning show, with Collins, Poppy Harlow as co-hosts; their chemistry, crucial in morning TV, was non-existent.\n\nDon Lemon was fired not long after saying on-air that Nikki Haley, a Republican presidential candidate, “isn’t in her prime, sorry.” He also said that a woman is “considered to be in her prime in her 20s and 30s and maybe 40s.”\n\nThose are Lemon’s words, not Licht’s, obviously. But it was just another blow to the network’s reputation.\n\nDonald Trump soured Republicans on CNN for years\n\nLicht clearly wanted to mend fences with Republicans. And, after years of Trump bashing the network and calling it “fake news” and an enemy of the people, the thought of appearing on CNN became a form of betrayal for some Republicans.\n\nLicht is right, both sides should be heard — if both sides are dealing with reality. Bringing on election deniers in an attempt to appear fair to both sides of a political argument, as Licht did, is not objective reporting. It’s irresponsible, because for the deniers, reality is not a constraint.\n\nIt’s simple: Don’t give liars a platform.\n\nWho will replace Chris Licht as CNN CEO?\n\nZaslav told employees Wednesday the company was looking for a new CEO, and that it would take some time to find one.\n\nWhoever it is, they would do well to remember that bothsideism isn’t journalism. It’s pandering. It’s weak, and it doesn’t deserve to be rewarded with an audience.\n\nThis doesn’t mean you should demonize one side or another — unless it does something that deserves to be demonized. If one side is attacking the structures of democracy, it’s fine to say so. In fact, it’s essential to.\n\nIt’s the old adage about journalism, repeated often: If one person tells you it’s raining and another tells you it’s not, it isn’t your job to quote them both. It’s your job to look out the window and report the truth.\n\nLicht uses a form of that analogy often in the Atlantic story.

Thanks to a wildly critical profile of CNN chief executive Chris Licht, the network's boss is out and EVERYONE is talking about the struggling news network!\n\nThe Atlantic ran a 15,000-word piece on Licht under the headline “Inside the Meltdown at CNN,” and it prompted not just off-the-record criticisms from CNN staff but headline after headline about the network’s internal drama:\n\n“Chris Licht pledges to regain trust of CNN staff after scathing article,” wrote The Washington Post.\n\n\"Chris Licht of CNN Faces a Crisis,” wrote The New York Times.\n\nFox News got in on the action with “Mission Impossible: Why media are pummeling CNN’s Chris Licht.”\n\nHey, at least The Atlantic's Chris Licht profile has people talking about CNN again!\n\nWednesday morning, Licht stepped down, leaving the network with a void in its top leadership position.\n\nOn the plus side, this is the most public attention CNN has had in months, and it helped me come up with a simple plan to help the once-mighty network: CNN should rebrand itself as the No. 1 source for news about what a mess CNN has become.\n\nIt’s clear there’s both an audience and a thirst for coverage of CNN drama. Heck, entire crowds at Trump rallies have broken into chants of “CNN SUCKS!”\n\nSo why not lean into that? Why let other news organizations rake in ratings and page views with their coverage of a network trying – and failing – to redefine itself?\n\nCNN's hopeless quest for middle ground seems to make everyone angry\n\nAside from Licht, who according to The Atlantic profile and other reports seemed simultaneously overconfident and in over his head, CNN has been struggling with staking out an identity between the left-leaning MSNBC and far-right-leaning Fox News.\n\nThat explains the network’s willingness to host a town hall that allowed former President Donald Trump, now a GOP presidential candidate, to lie and lie and lie some more in prime time while also lambasting the media, including CNN itself. It was an embarrassment, hated by both the left and right and people at the network.\n\nPlease explain where there's middle ground between believing in facts and believing in nonsense\n\nThat’s the problem with seeking a middle ground in this political climate: What is the middle ground between “the 2020 presidential election was legitimate” and “the 2020 presidential election was rigged and stolen by a liberal Deep State hellbent on destroying America”?\n\nWhere exactly is the middle ground between “LGBTQ+ people exist and should be able to live their lives safely and authentically” and “A DISNEY MOVIE HAD A GAY CHARACTER SO I’M GOING TO LABEL THE WHOLE CORPORATION AND ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS IT A PEDOPHILE”?\n\nCNN could try to find a rational space between conservative voters who reject the hardcore-MAGA conspiracy/culture war nonsense and liberal-minded viewers seeking balance. But that doesn’t seem to be in the network’s plans. Instead, it keeps trying to get the people who chant “CNN SUCKS!” to like it, like a lonely kid hoping a handful of bologna will get the dog to love him.\n\nIt's time for CNN to lean into its own soap opera and give people what they want\n\nThe most compelling thing about CNN right now is the reality-show-style mess CNN has created. So THAT’S where the network’s bosses need to focus their attention. All CNN, all the time. They’ve got reporters right there in the studio! Let them do their jobs and give the people what they want.\n\nAnderson Cooper’s nightly show “Anderson Cooper 360°” could be renamed “Anderson Cooper 180°.” It would feature Cooper spinning around 180-degrees and looking to see what kind of zaniness and absurd miscalculations are happening in the studio behind him.\n\nMaybe CNN could bring back Chris Cuomo and Jeff Zucker for some insight\n\n“CNN Tonight” could keep its name, as it would focus on what new mess CNN finds itself in each night. Fired CNN host Chris Cuomo could be rehired to host, perhaps alongside former network head Jeff Zucker, who was forced to step down last year for not revealing a romantic relationship with another senior executive.\n\nAnd Wolf Blitzer’s “The Situation Room” could be called “A Room Full of Situations at CNN,” featuring Blitzer thoughtfully caressing his beard while recounting the poor decisions being made around him.\n\nInstead of being “The World’s News Leader,” CNN can become “The World’s News-About-CNN Leader.”\n\nThink about it, Mr. Licht and Co.

The merger aims to create \"a new, collectively owned, for-profit entity to ensure that all stakeholders benefit from a model that delivers maximum excitement and competition among the game’s best players.\"\n\nThe terms of the agreement are not fully finalized and are scheduled to be completed in the coming months.\n\n\"After two years of disruption and distraction, this is a historic day for the game we all know and love,\" PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\n\"Going forward, fans can be confident that we will, collectively, deliver on the promise we’ve always made — to promote competition of the best in professional golf and that we are committed to securing and driving the game’s future.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the merger agreement.\n\nBryson DeChambeau: 'I do feel bad for the PGA Tour players'\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who is among the most notable names who bolted from the PGA Tour to join LIV Golf last year, appeared on \"CNN Primetime\" for an interview with anchor Kaitlan Collins to discuss Tuesday's stunning news of a merger between the Tour and LIV.\n\n\"There’s a lot more behind closed doors that’s been going on. What I can tell you is that H-E, Yasir, has always been a staunch supporter of golf globally and wanting to grow the game,\" DeChambeau said, referring to Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who is the governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. \"That’s been his vision from the start, when we first started talking a few years ago. As it’s come to fruition now I think this is the best thing that could ever happen for the game of golf. And I'm extremely proud to be part of that because of the fact that the fans are going to get what they want, the players are going to experience something a little different, a little new on the PGA Tour side, but I truly believe, in the end, the game of golf wins in this scenario.\"\n\nCollins then asked DeChambeau if he thought that Jay Monahan was a hypocrite after the PGA Tour commissioner had been critical of the Saudi-back golf league and the players who bolted the Tour for LIV.\n\n\"I do feel bad for the PGA Tour players because they were told one thing and something else happened, and our side, we were told one thing and it’s come to fruition. In the end, for me, I want the players, the fans and the game of golf to win,\" DeChambeau said. \"It does stink a little bit from my perspective that the PGA Tour players are not necessarily winning. I hope they can find a way to make sure they are valued in the same way that we are over at LIV. I think that’ll happen, it’s just going to take some time with players pushing back a little bit and trying to figure out what gives them the best opportunity to be successful on their own end. Eventually, we all come back together now and play as one group, and I think that's the best thing.\"\n\nPGA Tour commissioner: 'People are going to call me a hypocrite'\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said Tuesday he's well aware \"people are going to call me a hypocrite\" after he made a stunning reversal and merged with LIV Golf having previously denounced the Saudi-backed league over its ties to the terrorist attacks on 9/11.\n\nBut on Tuesday evening, Monahan described Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as \"a great and world-class investor.\"\n\n“I recognize that people are going to call me a hypocrite. Anytime I said anything, I said it with the information that I had at that moment, and I said it based on someone that’s trying to compete for the PGA Tour and our players. I accept those criticisms,\" Monahan said in a conference call on Tuesday, according to Golf Week. \"But circumstances do change. I think that in looking at the big picture and looking at it this way, that’s what got us to this point.”\n\nMonahan said the deal has been in the works for seven weeks: \"We just realized that we were better off together than we were fighting or apart, and by thinking about the game at large and eliminating a lot of the friction that’s been out there and doing this in a way where we can move forward.\"\n\nPGA Tour commissioner held 'intense' player meeting after merger\n\nJay Monahan held a players-only meeting at the Canadian Open Tuesday afternoon following the surprise announcement merger of the PGA Tour and LIV Golf that blindsided many players. Many top players were not present at the meeting, which Monahan described as \"intense, certainly heated,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\n“I’m not surprised,” Monahan said. “This is an awful lot to ask them to digest. This is a significant change for us. As I’m trying to explain as we go forward, this ultimately was a decision in the best interests of all at the PGA Tour.”\n\nMonahan said that although he expects \"a lot of questions and criticism\" right now, \"players who stayed with the PGA Tour will see they benefited in many ways\" in the long run.\n\nMichael Kim attended the meeting and said he was \"disappointed as all of you.\" He tweeted, \"Well… the meeting happened… Came in very excited… but not a whole lot happened, too many details still up in the air.\"\n\nGolf Channel's Brandel Chamblee 'disappointed' in PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger\n\nFormer men's pro golfer and current Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee has been one of the most outspoken critics of LIV Golf and its disruption to the sport. After news of the merger broke, Chamblee spoke about the matter and expressed his displeasure with the PGA Tour.\n\n\"After the shock sort of ebbed away, I was hugely disappointed,\" Chamblee said Tuesday during an appearance on the Golf Channel. \"I think this is one of the saddest days in the history of professional golf. I do believe the governing bodies, the entities, have sacrificed their principles for profit.\"\n\nChamblee said he suspected there were three key reasons behind the decision to merge: legal issues over previously-pending antitrust litigation; \"entanglements\" some PGA Tour sponsors have with PIF capital; and the sheer amount of Saudi money that became available to the PGA Tour with the merger.\n\nWhat do we know about the terms of the merger agreement between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf?\n\nThere are still several key details that are unknown about the merger. For starters, the new entity does not have a name yet.\n\nA key element in the merger is financial. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, \"will make a capital investment into the new entity to facilitate its growth and success,\" according to the news release. The PIF had been the sole entity to entirely fund the LIV Golf operation.\n\nAdditionally, the merger stipulates that the PIF \"will initially be the exclusive investor in the new entity\" and \"will have the exclusive right to further invest in the new entity, including a right of first refusal on any capital.\"\n\nA newly established board of directors will direct and oversee the new entity's operations, schedule, investments. PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will be part of the new entity's board of directors and will be on its executive committee. The announcement of the full board will come at a later date.\n\nAdditionally, the merger will lead to \"a mutually agreed end to all pending litigation between the participating parties.\" In August 2022, a number of golfers who joined the LIV tour filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour, challenging their suspensions.\n\nThe merger stipulates that after the conclusion of the 2023 season, the PGA Tour, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour \"will work cooperatively and in good faith to establish a fair and objective process\" to allow players who left the PGA Tour and DP tour to re-apply for membership.\n\nLIV Golf only part of Saudi 'sportswashing'\n\nIt's not just golf that is being upended by Saudi money.\n\nIn addition to financing Tuesday's merger between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced this week that it has effectively seized controlling stakes in four of the largest teams in the country's pro soccer league, in an effort to lure top European talent there.\n\nFreelance reporter Fabrizio Romano reported for The Guardian on Tuesday that the one of those teams, Al-Ittihad, is signing Real Madrid star Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante of Chelsea, each for exorbitant sums. Benzema is due to make roughly $213 million per year over two seasons, according to Romano, while Kante's contract is reported to be in excess of $106 million per year.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is making more than $200 million per year with another Saudi team, Al-Nassr, and Romano reports that Lionel Messi has been offered more than $370 million to play for Al-Hilal. The PIF also owns Newcastle United, a prominent English team.\n\nActivists and academics have pointed to the PIF's investment in soccer and golf as part of a broader campaign of Saudi \"sportswashing,\" or using sports to polish a country's otherwise problematic reputation. Saudi Arabia has a track record of human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. — Tom Schad\n\nU.S. Senators call out PGA Tour for 'hypocrisy' over merger with LIV Golf\n\nTwo United States senators took to social media on Tuesday to address the monster news that the PGA Tour was merging with LIV Golf.\n\nOregon’s Ron Wyden, who serves as the chairman of the Committee on Finance, blasted the deal, vowing to explore its economic impact. The merger means that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will be backing professional golf stateside and abroad.\n\n\"Hypocrisy doesn’t begin to describe this brazen, shameless cash grab,\" he said on Twitter. \"I’m going to dive into every piece of Saudi Arabia’s deal with the PGA. U.S. officials need to consider whether a deal will give the Saudi regime inappropriate control or access to U.S. real estate.\"\n\nConnecticut’s Chris Murphy expressed surprise at the deal. He said representatives from the PGA recently visited his office and were upset at the track record of social justice violations by the Middle Eastern country.\n\n\"So weird. PGA officials were in my office just months ago talking about how the Saudis' human rights record should disqualify them from having a stake in a major American sport,\" he said while retweeting a news post of the unification.\n\n\"I guess maybe their concerns weren't really about human rights?\" — Victoria Hernandez\n\nWhat was Phil Mickelson's LIV Golf deal worth?\n\nAlthough Phil Mickelson has not revealed the exact amount of his signing bonus to join the LIV tour, it was widely expected that his deal exceeded the $125 million figure that fellow golfer Dustin Johnson took. Reports later emerged that Mickelson's contract was worth $200 million, which was the largest contract issued by the Saudi-backed tour.\n\nLIV Golf, PGA Tour merger shines spotlight on 'sportswashing'\n\nOver the past six years, the term has been used to describe everything from the 2018 World Cup in Russia to a 2019 heavyweight boxing match in Saudi Arabia to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAnd at a news conference ahead of the Saudi-funded LIV Golf league's first event last summer, it came up twice.\n\n\"Isn't there a danger,\" one reporter asked Phil Mickelson, \"that you're also being seen as a tool of sportswashing?\"\n\nThat term — \"sportswashing\" — is still relatively new. But the strategy it represents has been employed by governments around the world, in some form or fashion, for a century or more.\n\nFor world leaders, it is a way to improve their nation's reputation by hosting a prestigious sporting event, or financing a popular team. — Tom Schad\n\nWhat is going on with the antitrust lawsuit filed against the PGA Tour?\n\nIn August 2022, 11 players who left the PGA Tour for LIV Golf filed an antitrust lawsuit to challenge their suspensions from the PGA Tour.\n\nThis followed a report from the month before that the United States Department of Justice was investigating the PGA Tour for possible anticompetitive behavior. Augusta National Golf Club, which operates the Masters Tournament, the United States Golf Association and the PGA of America were later revealed to also be part of the investigation.\n\nSince then, lawyers on both sides have battled in various court proceedings to gain leverage. With the merger, however, both sides are mutually agreeing to end all pending litigation against the other.\n\nWho is on the PGA Tour board of directors?\n\nJay Monahan is currently serving as the PGA Tour commissioner and will retain a large presence after the merger. Ed Herlihy is serving as the 2023 PGA Tour policy board chairman and the co-chair of the board of directors. Jimmy Dunne is acting as the vice chair and senior managing principal on this year's board of directors. Under the merger, however, the board of the new entity will look a little different.\n\nAccording to the news release, PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will serve as chairman. Al-Rumayyan will also join the PGA Tour's policy board and will be part of the board of directors' executive committee. Monahan will serve as the CEO of the board of directors.\n\nAl-Rumayyan, Monahan, Herlihy and Dunne will all serve on the executive committee of the board.\n\n9/11 families group slams PGA Tour over LIV Golf merger: 'Paid Saudi shills'\n\nAn organization representing families of 9/11 victims ripped the PGA Tour's decision Tuesday to merge with Saudi-funded LIV Golf, describing the PGA and its commissioner, Jay Monahan, as hypocrites who have become \"paid Saudi shills.\"\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday afternoon, 9/11 Families United said it was \"shocked and deeply offended\" by the news of the merger, which will see the PGA, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour all operating under a single business umbrella, funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The chair of 9/11 Families United, Terry Strada, said she and the other family members who make up the group felt \"betrayed\" by the PGA Tour and Monahan individually.\n\n\"Mr. Monahan talked last summer about knowing people who lost loved ones on 9/11, then wondered aloud on national television whether LIV Golfers ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour. They do now — as does he,\" said Strada, whose husband, Tom, died at the World Trade Center.\n\n\"PGA Tour leaders should be ashamed of their hypocrisy and greed. Our entire 9/11 community has been betrayed by Commissioner Monahan and the PGA as it appears their concern for our loved ones was merely window-dressing in their quest for money — it was never to honor the great game of golf.\" — Tom Schad\n\nThe White House is staying out of the PGA Tour-LIV Golf partnership\n\nAs news of the PGA Tour's merger with LIV Golf spread, the White House is opting not to weigh in, when reporters at a briefing asked about the agreement in light of Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\n\n\"I have no comment on that,\" White House spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday during a briefing. — Joey Garrison\n\nAs PGA Tour and LIV announce merger, the current standings and top players on each tour\n\nLIV golfers Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau and Phil Mickelson have been hard to miss near the top of major tournament leaderboards this year – especially with Koepka collecting his fifth major at the PGA Championship.\n\nBut what about all the other players who left the PGA for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour in past months?\n\nWith the surprise announcement Tuesday morning of the merger of the two tours' business operations, here's a look at the top 52 players of each tour in 2023. — Jim Sergent\n\nTune in for 'Full Swing' Season 2\n\nA producer on the Netflix docuseries \"Full Swing,\" which follows the lives of several men's pro golfers, said that the cameras were rolling when the news of the PGA Tour-LIV Golf agreement came through.\n\n\"You better believe we were filming when this broke,\" producer Chad Mumm wrote Tuesday in a tweet.\n\nSeason 2 drops in 2024.\n\nPGA Tour golfers frustrated they didn't know about deal with LIV Golf beforehand\n\nThe golf world was stunned by the PGA Tour-LIV Golf deal, and apparently, so were the ones on the tours.\n\nThe announcement Tuesday morning was a shocker since the PGA Tour and its players have been critical of the LIV Golf Invitational Series, primarily because it is funded entirely by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, which has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners.\n\nWhen the announcement was made, PGA Tour golfers voiced their displeasure on Twitter with how they found out about the deal, with many saying that they found out through social media. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJack Nicklaus says PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger 'good for the game of golf'\n\nJack Nicklaus is thankful the infighting is coming to a close.\n\nNicklaus, who said he was offered but turned down $100 million to be the CEO of the LIV Golf series and said LIV Golf \"wasn't for me,\" reacted to the stunning news that the PGA Tour and LIV Golf will merge.\n\n“The last three years have been difficult for the game and the players,\" said Nicklaus, who lives in North Palm Beach. \"I spoke with PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan this morning. He seemed pleased with the arrangement that will once again bring together the best players in the world. I agree that this is good for the game of golf.\"\n\nThis came just one week after Nicklaus spoke ahead of the Memorial Tournament about the LIV players who had decided to split off from the PGA Tour.\n\n“I don’t even consider those guys part of the game anymore,\" he said then. \"I don’t mean that in a nasty way. This is a PGA Tour event, and we have the best field we can possibly have for a PGA Tour event for those who are eligible to be here. The other guys made a choice of what they did and where they’ve gone and we don’t even talk about it.\" — Tom D'Angelo, Palm Beach Post\n\nAugusta National, Royal and Ancient weigh in on merger\n\nFred Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, which is the home of the Masters, said the club is \"encouraged\" by the PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger, and said it \"represents a positive development in bringing harmony to men’s professional golf.\"\n\nRidley added that August and the Masters are \"devoted to developing the game and celebrating its many virtues.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Martin Slumbers, the CEO of R&A, said the club was \"pleased that an agreement has been reached which will help men’s professional golf move forward in a collaborative, constructive and innovative fashion. ...\n\n\"We care deeply about golf’s future and are committed to ensuring that the sport continues to thrive for many years to come,\" Slumbers continued. \"This agreement represents a hugs step toward achieving that goal for golf and we look forward to working with the new entity for the benefit of the sport globally.\" — Casey Moore\n\nOPINION: PGA Tour sold out to LIV Golf and the Saudis. Pro golf will never be the same.\n\nFrauds, all of them. But frauds now united in the only thing that actually matters to the world of professional golf: Making money.\n\nIn the end, it didn’t actually matter to PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan that the money came from a country, Saudi Arabia, that treats human rights like an inconvenience. The tradition and history of the PGA Tour, in fact, didn’t matter all that much to those who argued that LIV Golf was an unworthy, unserious rival whose guaranteed money and 54-hole events were mocking competition.\n\nAnd as for the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Greg Norman, they did not, in fact, care all that much about growing the game. They wanted to own it. Now they do: The PGA Tour, brought to you by Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.\n\nThey sold out. Professional golf will never be the same.\n\nRead the rest of Dan Wolken's column here.\n\nJay Monahan, Yasir Al-Rumayyan discuss PGA Tour and LIV Golf merger on CNBC\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan sat down for a joint interview on CNBC on Tuesday morning to discuss the merger news that rocked the golf world.\n\nMonahan called it a historic day.\n\n\"There’s been a lot of tension in our sport over the last couple of years,\" Monahan said, \"but what we’re talking about today is coming together to unify the game of golf and to do so under one umbrella.\"\n\nConversations began in London over golf and lunch, said Al-Rumayyan, who noted that had the two tours met two or three years ago for those same discussions, the impact on the game would not have been as significant.\n\n\"Because it would be something small,\" he continued. \"But the way we’re doing our partnership, it’s going to be really big, in many senses.\"\n\nAl-Rumayyan said the PIF is committed to investing \"whatever it takes\" to ensure success, later noting that they wouldn’t be doing this if they didn’t think it would be profitable.\n\n\"If you look at the size of golf, monetary-wise, it’s about $100 billion today,\" said Al-Rumayyan. \"And I think the growth, it’s there. I think working together we can have a faster growth rate than it was for the past 10 or 20 years.\" — Casey Moore\n\nPGA Tour will retain oversight over tour\n\nAs part of the agreement, PGA Tour Inc. will remain in place as a 501(c)(6) tax-exempt organization, which means it will continue to have oversight over its tour. During an interview with CNBC, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan offered more insight into the breakdown and Public Investment Fund Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan confirmed that PIF is prepared to invest billions.\n\n\"The c6 still stays in place and out of the c6 we’ll continue to operate our tours,\" Monahan said. \"We’ll put our player retirement plans and assets there. So that stays in place. One of the things that’s important to both of us is every single week we’re playing tournaments, we’re making a huge impact on the communities where we’re invited guests. That continues.\n\n\"At the c6 level — you take the assets of the PGA Tour, the PIF assets, and LIV and the Asian Tour and the DP World Tour, take all of those commercial assets and drop them down into that for-profit LLC … we’re going to go through an evaluation of all of the businesses and the PIF will invest … there will be additional investment and growth initiatives. That’s what’s really exciting here.\" — Casey Moore\n\nWhat has former U.S. President Donald Trump said about LIV Golf?\n\nDuring a pro-am event at his Trump National Golf Club May 25, Trump praised LIV Golf and defended his business relationship with the controversial Saudi-funded tour.\n\n\"They've been great for golf. The Saudis have been fantastic for golf,” Trump said then. “And they're going to make it a big part of, inside their country, they're going to do some great courses.\"\n\nLIV Golf also has upcoming stops scheduled at Trump courses in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Miami, Florida, later this year.\n\nAfter the news Tuesday, Trump celebrated the merger on his Truth Social platform, according to CNBC. “Great news from LIV Golf. A big, beautiful, and glamorous deal for the wonderful world of golf. Congrats to all!!!”\n\nIs the PGA Tour a nonprofit?\n\nWhile the merger announced the creation of \"a new, collectively owned, for-profit entity,\" the PGA Tour is retaining its position as \"a 501(c)(6) tax exempt organization.\"\n\nThe difference with the merger, however, is that — in the threat of continued disruption in men's professional golf — the PGA Tour reversed course and is aligning with the massive influx of Saudi capital.\n\nIn an interview on CBS in June 2022, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan ripped the LIV tour over links between the Saudi government and the terrorist attacks on 9/11. In the interview, Monahan spoke about players who joined LIV Golf needing to apologize to the families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11 and asked: \"Have you ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour?\"\n\nWhat is LIV Golf?\n\nThe LIV Golf Invitational Series made its debut in June 2022 after the tour lured some notable players from the PGA Tour such as Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Others like Brooks Koepka, the winner of the most recent PGA Championship, Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Smith have since joined. The LIV tour presented a disruption in the dynamics of the sport.\n\nThe format of play of the tour also presented a shakeup to the PGA Tour.\n\nEvents were designed as 54-hole, three-round, no-cut competitions. LIV Golf incorporated shotgun starts to expedite play. Players were split into four-person teams. Purses were divided between individual placement and team placement, offering players more financial incentives to participate.\n\nWhat has Phil Mickelson said about the PGA Tour merger with LIV Golf?\n\nThough he has not made public comments yet, Mickelson, one of the most high-profile players on the LIV tour, posted a message on Twitter to celebrate the news of the merger.\n\n\"Awesome day today 😊,\" he wrote.\n\nWhy is LIV Golf so controversial?\n\nThe LIV tour drew criticism because it is funded entirely by the PIF, the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. And members of the royal family and Saudi government were accused of involvement in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist.\n\nWhat has been Tiger Woods' stance on LIV Golf?\n\nIn May 2022, Tiger Woods reaffirmed his commitment to the PGA Tour.\n\n\"Phil has said some things that I think a lot of us who are committed to the Tour and committed to the legacy of the Tour have pushed back against, and he's taken some personal time, and we all understand that,\" Woods said ahead of the 2022 PGA Championship. \"Some of his views on how the Tour could be run, should be run, been a lot of disagreement there. Obviously we're going to have difference of opinions, how he sees the Tour, and we'll go from there.\"\n\nLIV Golf CEO Greg Norman confirmed in August 2022 that the league offered Woods in the neighborhood of $700 million to $800 million to join the Saudi-backed tour.\n\nWhat have other notable PGA Tour golfers said about LIV Golf?\n\nA number of players who declined to join LIV Golf, such as Rory McIlroy, had been publicly outspoken in their criticism of the Saudi-backed tour.\n\n“There’s no room in the golf world for LIV Golf,” McIlroy said in July 2022. “I don’t agree with what LIV is doing. If LIV went away tomorrow, I’d be super happy.”\n\nWhat is the timeline of how LIV Golf got started?\n\nLIV Golf first teed off last June after rattling the golf world with the news that it would offer players larger purses backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. The inaugural tournament was held in London and then the tour traveled to its first stateside event in Portland.\n\nDustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Sergio García were among the leading PGA Tour players to leave for LIV. The PGA suspended the players for participating in the new series.\n\nLIV Golf was met with much criticism from Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods and others for accepting support from a country with a history of human rights violations and for breaking tradition.\n\nAt the end of the first LIV Golf season, Johnson was crowned the champion, earning a prize of $18 million.\n\nIn January, LIV Golf signed a broadcast deal with CW Network to air 14 events of the 2023 season.\n\nA month later, the PGA invited LIV golfers to participate in the Masters. Mickelson and Brooks Koepka tied for second place. — Victoria Hernandez", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/06/09/pga-tour-liv-golf-merger-definition-antitrust/70304195007/", "title": "Why PGA Tour doesn't want deal with LIV Golf to be called a merger", "text": "The PGA Tour announced its shocking new deal with LIV Golf Tuesday by issuing a press release under a bold headline that said it would \"merge commercial operations under common ownership.\"\n\nThat description and other details in the release led news outlets around the world to call it a \"merger.\" But by the end of the day Tuesday, that headline and that word – \"merge\" – were removed from that press release on the PGA Tour website.\n\nAnd now the PGA Tour is saying its deal with LIV Golf and the DP World Tour is not a \"merger.\"\n\n\"I know it’s been called a merger as shorthand, but that is not accurate,\" PGA Tour spokeswoman Laura Neal said in an email Thursday to USA TODAY Sports. \"PGA TOUR Inc. remains intact as it was prior, as a 501c6 (tax-exempt organization). We have created a separate, commercial entity – underneath that structure.\"\n\nShe said this entity will include the Tour’s commercial assets, the European DP World Tour, LIV Golf and other golf-related commercial businesses of the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF).\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nThe same press release still says the agreement \"combines\" those businesses and rights into a \"new collectively owned, for-profit entity.\"\n\nSo isn’t that still a merger? And what does it matter anyway?\n\nIt depends whom is asked.\n\nWhen is a merger not a 'merger?'\n\nThe simple dictionary definition of \"merge\" is to combine into one. A merger is \"any of various methods of combining two or more organizations,\" according to Merriam-Webster’s dictionary.\n\nMeanwhile, the same PGA Tour press release (now without the word \"merge\") still says these businesses are being \"combined\" into one.\n\n\"The new entity (name TBD) will implement a plan to grow these combined commercial businesses,\" the release stated.\n\nThat still doesn’t make it a merger to some who echo the Tour’s company line.\n\n\"This is NOT a 'merger,' \" Tour golfer Michael Kim said on Twitter. He said the Tour \"still controls how and where the money goes.\"\n\nGolf.com also posted a \"public service announcement\" on Twitter Wednesday that said, ­\"The PGA Tour and DP World Tour did not merge with LIV Golf. They partnered up with the PIF.\"\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan also never used the words \"merge,\" \"merger\" or \"combine\" in a news conference about the deal Tuesday. He referred instead to being \"partners\" even though the press release quoted him as saying the partnership \"combines\" those businesses and assets.\n\nSo what's going on here?\n\nThere are sensitivities related to government scrutiny of this deal for antitrust reasons, legal experts told USA TODAY Sports. Last year, LIV Golf and several golfers sued the PGA Tour for alleged antitrust violations, calling it a monopoly throughout their 118-page complaint. The U.S. Department of Justice also had been looking into possible anticompetitive practices of the PGA Tour after the Tour tried to fend off LIV Golf as a rival league and punish players for joining it.\n\nBy merging, the new combination could dominate golf and become an even bigger target for antitrust regulators, who could try to block or delay the deal.\n\nTherefore the PGA Tour might like to avoid calling it a \"duck,\" even if it still quacks, walks and looks like one.\n\n\"The word 'merger' for antitrust purposes means both merger and acquisition,\" Baruch College law professor Marc Edelman told USA TODAY Sports Thursday. \"So, for antitrust purposes, none of this matters. It's still an antitrust merger. This is what happens when you play telephone. The lawyers talk to business people who talk to the PR folks, who talk to the media. By that many steps down the road, the message is gibberish as the speaker doesn't even understand the relevance.\"\n\nPenn State law professor Steve Ross called it \"semantics\" and noted there are \"slight\" differences in the proof the government needs to challenge mergers under Section 7 of the Clayton Act and agreements between rivals under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\n\nWhat about that press release?\n\nUSA TODAY Sports asked the PGA Tour about removing the word \"merge\" from a secondary headline in its initial press release.\n\nNeal of the PGA Tour said she hadn’t been aware of the removal and asked her digital team about it. She said that team replied by saying it was simply an editorial decision to unclutter the page and avoid redundancy.\n\n\"We removed it because it basically said the same thing as the (main) headline,\" the team said.\n\nThe main headline above it read, \"PGA TOUR, DP World Tour and PIF announce newly formed commercial entity to unify golf.\"\n\nThe Saudi Arabian PIF behind LIV Golf still is using the original press release with the word \"merge,\" as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nAnd while speculation abounds about whether LIV Golf will continue to exist, that appears to be up to the board of directors of the new entity, which itself is a combination of the PGA Tour and the Saudi PIF, with PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan set to become chairman and Monahan the CEO, according to the press release.\n\nThe release said the PGA Tour still will appoint a majority of the board, while the PIF will initially be the \"exclusive investor in the new entity, alongside the Tour, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour.\" The PIF also will have a right of first refusal on any capital that may be invested in the new entity, including into the PGA Tour, LIV Golf and DP World Tour, the release stated.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan was at the Canadian Open that week and said pointedly about any player who joined LIV or was thinking about it: “Have you ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour?”\n\nNow they are partners, giving Saudi Arabia a commercial voice in golf’s premier organization.\n\n“I recognize everything I’ve said in the past. I recognize people will call me a hypocrite,\" Monahan said in a conference call Tuesday evening. \"Any time I’ve said anything, I’ve said it with the information I had, and I said it with someone trying to compete with our tour and our players.”\n\nMost PGA Tour players were bewildered by the shocking turnaround. It didn't help that a news outlet broke the embargoed announcement before Monahan could send a memo to the players. Most learned of the development on social media.\n\n“I love finding out about morning news on Twitter,” two-time major champion Collin Morikawa tweeted.\n\nMany were not happy. Wesley Bryan tweeted, “I feel betrayed, and will not ... be able to trust anyone within the corporate structure of the PGA Tour for a very long time.”\n\nByeong Hun An added on Twitter: “I’m guessing the liv teams were struggling to get sponsors and pga tour couldn’t turn down the money. Win-win for both tours but it’s a big lose for who defended the tour for last two years.”\n\n“They were going down their path, we were going down ours, and after a lot of introspection you realize all this tension in the game is not a good thing,” Monahan said in a phone interview with The Associated Press.\n\n“We have a responsibility to our tour and to the game, and we felt like the time was right to have that conversation.”\n\nMonahan held a player meeting at the Canadian Open, though most top players are not there. He described the meeting as “intense, certainly heated.”\n\nAnd while this likely will only lead to greater riches in golf, there still was explaining to do on why the tour would merge with a group that tried to take away some of the PGA Tour's best players and was seen as the latest example of “sportswashing.”\n\nThe deal was in the works for the last seven weeks, when Monahan first met with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund. Players typically approve changes to the schedule and other competition matters. On this one, they were left out.\n\n“No one had word of this,” Monahan said. “Our players expect us to operate in the best interests of the tour.”\n\nInstead, he cited guidance from corporate members of the PGA Tour board.\n\nStill, Monahan has his toughest work ahead of him.\n\nHe sought loyalty from his players against a league accused of taking part in sportswashing, an attempt by Saudi Arabia to shift focus away from its human rights abuses, such as the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nNow the very group that posed such a threat is the commercial partner of the PGA Tour and European tour.\n\n“The divisiveness is now over, and two years of disruption and distractions ... is over and now we can concentrate on building our respective tours,” said Keith Pelley, CEO of the European tour. “And we are building it with PIF, who is clearly committed to the game.”\n\nAlong the way, PGA Tour players also got rich. The tour raised prize money at elite events to $20 million, the same purse for LIV’s individual competition. The 2024 schedule has been reshaped for roughly 16 tournaments like that.\n\n“In the short term, I expect a lot of questions and criticism,” Monahan said. “In the long run, players who stayed with the PGA Tour will see they benefited in many ways.”\n\nThe agreement combines the Public Investment Fund's golf-related commercial businesses and rights — including LIV Golf — with those of the PGA and European tours. The new entity has not been named.\n\nAl-Rumayyan will join the board of the PGA Tour, which continues to operates its tournaments. The PIF will invest in the commercial venture.\n\n“From the very beginning, the whole initiative was how to grow the game of golf,” Al-Rumayyan said. “And I think what was achieved today was exactly that.”\n\nAugusta National and the Royal & Ancient welcomed the news because it ends a bitter feud. Augusta National said the deal “represents a positive development in bringing harmony to men's professional golf.” R&A CEO Martin Slumbers said it would help golf “move forward in a collaborative, constructive and innovative fashion.”\n\nAs for the new role of Greg Norman, Al-Rumayyan said only that Norman is LIV Golf's commissioner and details of his future role would be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nMonahan's memo to players indicated a strong Saudi Arabian presence. He said PIF would make a financial investment to become a “premier corporate sponsor” of the PGA Tour, the European tour and other international tours.\n\nThe PIF initially will be the exclusive investor in the new entity and will have the exclusive right to further invest, including a right of first refusal on any capital that may be invested.\n\nAl-Rumayyan has been spotted wearing a “MAGA” hat during LIV events at courses owned by former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump predicted last July that a merger was inevitable and said anyone not signing with the Saudi league would be losing out. He weighed in Tuesday and called it a “glamorous deal for the wonderful world of golf.”\n\nMonahan said the merger came together the last seven weeks, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne responsible for bringing together Monahan and Al-Rumayyan. Dunne and Ed Herlihy, chairman of the PGA Tour's board, will serve on the board of the commercial venture.\n\nPhil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau were among 11 players who filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour last August. LIV joined as plaintiffs, and the PGA Tour countersued.\n\nThe concern for PIF was whether its leaders could be deposed, which Saudi Arabia wanted to avoid. Being open to depositions would leave the kingdom's leaders more vulnerable to legal action, including lawsuits demanding they reveal business deals in the United States.\n\nA federal judge had ruled the PIF could not claim immunity from the Foreign Service Immunity Act because of its commercial work with LIV Golf in the U.S.\n\nThe PIF appealed the ruling to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which was likely to extend the lawsuit deep into 2024 if not longer.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington and AP Sports Writer Steve Douglas in Stockholm contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/06/08/jimmy-dunne-pga-tour-liv-golf-merger-participation/70301457007/", "title": "Jimmy Dunne explains why he got involved in PGA Tour-LIV Golf ...", "text": "The deal that could fundamentally reshape the world of professional golf had a simple beginning: PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne said he reached out to Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, via WhatsApp.\n\n\"I thought it made sense to understand who he was and what he was trying to do, and what his view was for the game of golf,\" Dunne told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview Thursday morning. \"And I went to meet him.\"\n\nNearly two months later, that initial reachout culminated in a stunning announcement Tuesday from the PGA Tour and Saudi-funded LIV Golf. After more than a year of acrimony and a pricey legal fight, the two golfing entities agreed to join the Europe-based DP World Tour under a singular corporate umbrella, led by PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan but funded by the PIF, which is effectively the financial arm of the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nThe deal drew immediate backlash from PGA Tour players, many of whom remained loyal to the tour last year despite receiving lucrative overtures from LIV. And it's been heavily criticized by human rights activists and some members of Congress, who view the PIF's involvement as a clear example of \"sportswashing\" − an attempt by the Saudis to use sports to polish their international reputation and draw attention away from their human rights abuses.\n\nDunne, the vice chairman and senior managing principal at investment banking firm Piper Sandler, played a key role in the negotiations, along with PGA Tour board chairman Ed Herlihy.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nDunne is a familiar face in the game, someone who is a member at Augusta National and friendly with several tour pros.

I’m confident that what we came up with is the best long-term for the game. It's true. That’s it. I’m not trying to get more shares of this company. ... I'm not trying to make anybody look bad or good. I’m just dealing with the facts, as we have them. And I’m trying to find a way that we can go forward, positively.\"\n\nThe fact that Dunne made the initial reachout to the PIF came as a surprise to many, given the personal tragedy he experienced on Sept. 11, 2001. His firm was based in offices on the 104th floor of the World Trade Center's south tower, and 66 of his coworkers died in the terrorist attack that day − including his longtime friend Christopher Quackenbush and mentor Herman Sandler. Dunne would have been there, too, had he not decided to go to an area golf course in an attempt to qualify for the U.S. Mid-Amateur Championship.\n\nGiven that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the attack were Saudi nationals, groups like 9/11 Families United have been extremely critical of sports groups like LIV taking Saudi money.\n\nWhen asked about what he would say to people who are having trouble squaring his involvement in the deal and his experience on 9/11, Dunne said he believes golf is \"a force for good.\" He said what happened on 9/11 is still the first thing he thinks about every morning, the last thing he thinks about every night and something that crosses his mind in several moments in between.\n\n\"But my guys − Chris Quackenbush, Herman Sandler, those guys − thinking about it and remembering it will not be enough for them. They would want me to do something about it,\" Dunne said. \"And to the degree that we can reach out to people that are different than us (and) share experiences, we might be reducing the chances of some other thing happening, that’s equally horrific, down the road.\n\n\"So it isn’t a matter of just remembering. My guys are going to want me to remember − and act. So the game of golf, to the degree we can use it, can be a really important gift.\"\n\nDunne likened the sport, at another point, to a bridge between people. And he said he believes all the parties involved in Tuesday's deal \"wanted to do good and loves the game of golf.\"\n\nWhen asked what gives him confidence that those intentions are genuine and that golf is not being used as a form of \"sportswashing\" by the PIF, Dunne said: \"I believe that, based on the people I’ve met with, the multiple times I’ve been with them, the golf we played with each other. That’s my belief.\"\n\nDunne spoke generally about the PGA Tour's deal with LIV Golf in the context of the broader golfing ecosystem. Ultimately, he said, he wanted to stop the \"distractions and unpleasantness\" that have run through the sport over the past few years. He said he wants the sport to be more accessible to more people around the world.\n\nWill Tuesday's deal accomplish that?\n\n\"I know it will,\" Dunne said, \"if we can all move forward.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/golf/961173/pga-tour-liv-shock-merger-winners-losers-golf", "title": "PGA Tour-LIV shock merger: golf's big winners and losers | The ...", "text": "It was an announcement that shocked the world of golf. After a bitter civil war, the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf series revealed yesterday that a “landmark agreement” had been reached to “unify the game of golf” on a “global basis”. The parties have agreed that the “golf-related” commercial businesses and rights of the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), including LIV Golf, will be “combined” with those of the PGA and DP World tours into a “new, collectively owned, for-profit entity”. Following two years of “disruption and distraction”, this is “a historic day for the game we all know and love”, said Jay Monahan, commissioner of the PGA Tour. Keith Pelley, chief executive of the DP World Tour (formerly the European Tour), described it as a “momentous day”, while PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan said the partnership “represents the best opportunity to extend and increase the impact of golf for all”. Former US president Donald Trump, who has hosted LIV competitions at his golf courses, “hailed the deal” on his Truth Social platform, said the Financial Times. Trump posted that it was a “big, beautiful, and glamorous deal for the wonderful world of golf”. How the golf pundits reacted The formation of an “industry powerhouse” is “expected to transform the sport”, said Alan Blinder in The New York Times. It all “came together so quickly” that the new entity “does not yet even have a name”. However, it will be controlled by the PGA Tour and “significantly financed” by the PIF, the sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. Al-Rumayyan will be the new company’s chairman and Monahan will be CEO. When yesterday’s email “dropped” it was like “reading an April Fools’ Day spoof”, said Iain Carter, the BBC’s golf correspondent. The notion of the established golf tours “harmoniously joining forces” with the “breakaway” LIV circuit was “so far-fetched”. While there is “now peace between rival factions”, there will “still be plenty of turmoil ahead”. Skip advert There are “plenty of questions left unanswered” following the announcement, which “rocked the sports world and the golf landscape”, said Kyle Porter on CBS Sports. In his 11 years of covering professional golf, “no single piece of news has been more shocking”.\n\nWith golf fans, pundits and officials still digesting the fallout of the shock merger, we break down the winners and losers from the sport’s unification. Winners: the breakaway LIV players When LIV Golf launched in 2022 it was able to “lure some of golf’s biggest names away” from the PGA Tour and DP World Tour by offering “staggering sums of money”, said Sky Sports. Stars who joined the breakaway included Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia and Ian Poulter. This year’s LIV schedule will “continue as planned”, but golfers who were “suspended indefinitely” by the PGA and DP World tours will be able to “re-apply for membership” from the end of the 2023 season. Mickelson and the other LIV golfers “who got paid” are winners from the “blockbuster” deal, said Tim Crean on ClutchPoints. It seems as though all these players will come back to the “now-larger Tour” and “be able to compete as they had in the past”. The “only real difference” is that the superstars who jumped ship “are now nine figures richer”. Mickelson called it an “awesome day” on Twitter. Losers: the loyal PGA players “Stunned” PGA loyalists who “rejected lucrative paydays” to snub the Saudi-backed series “must be sick”, said Daniel Davis in the Daily Mail. Ultimately, “household names” opted to remain on the PGA Tour, “even in spite of the eye-watering packages” being tabled by LIV. Golf icon and 15-time major winner Tiger Woods turned down between $700 and $800m (£575m-£650m) to switch, according to LIV chief Greg Norman. Rory McIlroy is said to have declined £400m and Jon Rahm “waved away” £321m, Davis added. McIlroy and Woods had “established themselves as the biggest supporters” of the PGA Tour in its battle with LIV Golf, said Sky Sports. However, “both were kept in the dark” about the stunning deal. Winners: Saudi Arabia The PGA’s merger with LIV “can’t be seen as anything other than a Saudi victory”, said Ewan Murray in The Guardian. “Forget the talk of released tension”, this deal is “merely a depressing illustration that money can disrupt and distort everything in sport”. Skip advert This victory for Saudi Arabia is “another sign that money can overwhelm almost any other force in sports”, said David Leonhardt in The New York Times. As part of the deal, the Saudi investment fund will “have the right of first refusal for future investments in the tour, allowing it to expand its stake”. Losers: Jay Monahan and Greg Norman PGA Tour boss Monahan accepts that he will be labelled a “hypocrite” as he had previously ruled out any merger. And after also admitting that players could be compensated for turning down millions to join LIV, Monahan is facing “calls to resign”, said Sky Sports. Following a “contentious” players’ meeting, Tour Advisory Council member Johnson Wagner revealed there were “many moments” where certain players were “calling for new leadership” of the PGA Tour and “even got a couple of standing ovations”.\n\nAnother official whose role is expected to be under threat is Greg Norman. The Australian has been a “divisive figurehead” as chief executive of LIV, but the former world No.1 “was not mentioned” during the official announcement, said Ben Collins on BBC Sport. In the 973-word statement, “none of these shocking words were Greg, or Norman”, Jacob Polychronis added on Fox Sports. Having fought a “bitter crusade” as the “frontman” of LIV for nearly two years, Norman’s omission was “curious”. “Chewed up” and “spat out”, he became a “pawn” in golf’s great war “and still lost”. Winners: sportswashing The term “sportswashing” means “the use of games and teams and stadiums to cleanse an image and launder a reputation”, said Jon Wertheim on CBS News. A country that has “never won an Olympic gold medal”, Saudi Arabia has “suddenly emerged as a major player in global sport” – hosting events, buying teams, and luring athletes with “staggering” contracts. PIF already owns Premier League club Newcastle United and in recent years has “poured billions into one-off spectacles” for individual sports, said DJ Dunson on Deadspin. The impending golf merger has brought Saudi sportswashing efforts to an American pro sport and is their “boldest foothold into the American market yet”. This is a “gigantic victory” for sportswashing, said Ben Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. He told The Guardian that “in fact, it is the biggest sportswashing win that any authoritarian regime has ever had”. The PIF have “effectively bought the whole of international golf in one swoop”. Skip advert “Sportswashing works, kids,” said Murray in The Guardian. The cost of this chapter is to “the tune of several billion dollars”, which is “chump change” to the PIF. Losers: human rights The PGA Tour has rolled out a “blood-red carpet” for the Saudis and LIV Golf, said Dave Zirin on MSNBC. The tour and its commissioner have “suddenly decided to ignore all the negative implications” that he said would come with working with Saudi Arabia. As recently as Monday, the “official position” of the PGA Tour was that its competitor was a “scandalous, even odious, operation”, said Zirin. Referring to Saudi Arabia’s horrific human rights record, Monahan said last June: “You’d have to be living under a rock to not understand the implications of involving yourself with the Saudis.” Monahan’s “strong comment” is now “just a reminder that pencils have erasers”.", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2023/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/02/16/comcast-time-warner-cable-merger-tellusatoday-your-say/5536401/", "title": "Cable merger can create headache for customers: #tellusatoday", "text": "Comcast announced last week that it wants to acquire Time Warner Cable for $45 billion.

The Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, \"will make a capital investment into the new entity to facilitate its growth and success,\" according to the news release. The PIF had been the sole entity to entirely fund the LIV Golf operation.\n\nAdditionally, the merger stipulates that the PIF \"will initially be the exclusive investor in the new entity\" and \"will have the exclusive right to further invest in the new entity, including a right of first refusal on any capital.\"\n\nA newly established Board of Directors will direct and oversee the new entity's operations, schedule, investments.

The companies own dozens of chains, including Safeway, Vons, Harris Teeter and Fred Meyer and reach a combined 85 million households.\n\nKroger (KR) and Albertsons, which both employ mostly union workforces, want to merge to be more competitive against non-union giants such as Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), and Costco (COST). The grocers are also facing increased pressure from Aldi, the fast-growing German discount supermarket chain.\n\nA Kroger-Albertsons merger could reshape the grocery industry. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nThere’s no guarantee the deal will go through, however.\n\nThe merger will face intense scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and other regulators. Opponents, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have already called on regulators to block the deal. The companies say they will divest hundreds of stores in areas where they overlap to win regulatory approval.\n\nHere’s how the mega-merger could impact grocery shopping in America.\n\nLower prices…for now\n\nPrices at the grocery store are a major concern for shoppers right now.\n\nGrocery prices increased 13% in September over the last year, the fastest pace in decades.\n\nThe companies say that they will be able to use $500 million in cost savings from the deal to reduce prices for shoppers and tailor promotions and savings. They will also invest $1.3 billion in Albertsons, including on lowering prices.\n\n“Our expanded portfolio, along with more personalized promotions and benefits, will help customers save… and help to relieve the inflationary pressures facing shoppers across the country,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said Friday.\n\nAlbertsons stores are concentrated more on the West Coast, while Kroger is dominant in the Midwest.\n\nAlbertsons has higher prices than Kroger and other grocers, analysts say, and they predict Kroger will try to reduce Albertsons prices to be more competitive against discount chains like Aldi.\n\n“This deal could provide some food pricing relief for consumers,” said Ken Fenyo, a retail analyst at Coresight Research. “With Aldi, Lidl and other discount grocers coming in, this positions Kroger to drive the market forward.”\n\nBut supermarket mergers can also lead to higher prices for shoppers.\n\nA 2012 study published in the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy found that “mergers in the supermarket industry can result in significant increases in consumer prices and thereby harm consumers” in highly concentrated markets.\n\nMergers in less concentrated markets are most often associated with price decreases, the study found.\n\nAntitrust advocates say the merger would force out competition and concentrate power among the largest chains, driving up prices.\n\n“A Kroger-Albertons deal would squeeze consumers already struggling to afford food,” said Sarah Miller, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a policy group against concentrated economic power.\n\nMore store brands\n\nKroger and Albertsons have each been building out their own exclusive food brands in recent years as alternatives to big-name brands.\n\nKroger, for example, offers its own brands such as Private Selection and Simple Truth, while Albertsons has O Organics, Open Nature and others.\n\nThe two companies’ brands generated a combined $43 billion in sales last year.\n\nThis is an important strategy for these stores because it’s more profitable to sell their own brands than national labels, and it helps keep big brands’ prices in check.\n\nBy merging, the companies plan to expand their own brand selection and lower production costs.\n\nStore closures and pain for mom-and-pops\n\nGrocery stores in the United States are on the decline.\n\nThe number of US grocers fell by roughly 30% from 1993 to 2019, according to a report last year by Food & Water Watch, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nAnalysts say that Kroger and Albertsons are likely to close some of their overlapping stores, particularly in some cities where they are heavily concentrated, such as Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\n“There will, no doubt, be some closures if a merger goes ahead,” said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail. “Over time, the rate of closures may be more pronounced as the combined chains seek to minimize duplication,” he said.\n\nAdvocates fear the merger would harm small grocery stores. Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nAnalysts and advocates also say that a merger would make it harder for smaller grocers and mom-and-pop stores to stay in business.\n\nThe National Grocers Association, which represents small retailers and wholesalers, said the merger would put smaller competitors at an “unfair disadvantage” and increase “anticompetitive buyer power over grocery suppliers.”\n\nThis would disproportionally hurt cities and rural areas, where independent stores are typically located.\n\n“This deal would almost certainly put more rural towns and Black and Latino neighborhoods in cities at risk of becoming ‘food deserts’ as more local grocers are driven out of business,” said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy organization that challenges economic concentration.\n\nMerger frenzy\n\nThe food industry in America has consolidated in recent decades.\n\nThe top five grocers – Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Ahold Delhaize and Amazon – control about half the market, according to UBS.\n\nA Kroger-Albertsons merger would spark a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions as companies seek to keep up, analysts predict.\n\nThe proposed deal “accelerates the ongoing consolidation of the sector,” said UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser.\n\nAmazon “has aspirations to be larger in the space,” he said. “The warehouse clubs, hard discounters, strong [regional grocers] and specialty players will look to fortify their positions.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2014/04/10/revamped-pro-bowl-will-likely-hit-glendale/7538135/", "title": "Revamped Pro Bowl will likely be a hit in Glendale", "text": "Bob McManaman\n\nazcentral sports\n\nAnything the NFL wraps around its multibillion-dollar shield these days seems to turn into gold.\n\nIf the NFL decided to start packaging bologna, they'd probably outsell Oscar Mayer.\n\nIt's true.

We've got a lot of things in place: the infrastructure, our tourism infrastructure, the stadium, and all the things we're doing around the Super Bowl.\n\n\"It's going to be a great, great event.\"\n\nThe Pro Bowl was left languishing for several years amid general disinterest — and because so many star players regularly decided to skip the game because of aches and pains and apparent apathy.\n\nLet's face it: A free trip to Hawaii wasn't exactly a dream vacation anymore for a rich football player who's been there, done that. Some players were just too tired to attend after a grueling 16-game regular season, in addition to the playoffs.\n\nThe Pro Bowl sank in popularity, always seemingly a distant fourth to the All-Star Games involving Major League Baseball, the NBA and even the NHL.\n\nIt got so bad that the NFL considered scrapping the event. It needed a facelift in the worst way.\n\nBidwill, who had been trying for the past couple of years to lure the game to Arizona, was among a contingent of NFL executives who flew to New York to meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell and discuss possible solutions.\n\nChanges have been made in recent years, though, including a big one involving this latest Pro Bowl by which the game was no longer AFC vs. the NFC, but rather an unconferenced selection process; players are picked by fans, coaches and fellow players.\n\nFor the first time, teammates actually lined up against each other, as was the case between the Cardinals' Larry Fitzgerald and Patrick Peterson.\n\nNearly 12 million viewers tuned in to watch.\n\nAdrian Peterson, the perennial Pro Bowl running back for the Minnesota Vikings, said the Pro Bowl was always a nice little postseason junket for him, but that it means more for younger players and not so much the veterans.\n\n\"But I think with the types of changes they've made, that's going to boost it up a little more,\" he told azcentral sports on Wednesday.\n\n\"Now guys get the opportunity to play with guys they'd probably never get to play with.

There were also 11 positive COVID-19 cases announced on Saturday. We need an average of around 4.5 cases per day to meet the “cases per 100,000 requirement” for re-opening our schools. We are still very committed to Dr. Washburn and our school board to helping get our schools back open. Please help us reduce our area’s numbers by practicing social distancing and wearing a face covering when the situation demands it.\n\nTrevor Rogers pitched three innings against the New York Yankees on Saturday. He was pulled early in order to save his arm for the playoffs. He finished the game with four strikeouts on two hits and a walk. The Miami Marlins will be hosted by the Chicago Cubs in the first round of the playoffs at noon MST on Wednesday. Congratulations to Trevor and to all his friends and family members. We also appreciate the excellent local coverage of Trevor’s rookie year by sports editor Matthew Asher.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/28"}]}

Now, the bulbous Grimace has returned too.\n\nIt's all part of a Grimace birthday celebration, beginning Monday, which includes a limited-edition Grimace Birthday Meal, which comes with either a Big Mac or 10-piece Chicken McNuggets, fries – and the new purple berry-flavored shake. The meal is available at participating restaurants, while supplies last. Most restaurants will also sell you the shake separately.\n\nBirthdays have been a part of McDonald's for decades – some may remember redeeming their free McDonald's birthday meal postcard as kids.\n\n\"We're using that heritage that the brand has with people, but also want to connect with youth of today,\" said JJ Healan, vice president, U.S. marketing, brand, content & culture for McDonald's.\n\nActivities on tap for McDonald's Grimace birthday celebration\n\nThe Grimace birthday celebration goes beyond the restaurant:\n\n◾ Merchandise. Customers can buy Grimace merchandise including T-shirts and socks at McDonald's online merchandise site.\n\n◾ Games. A Grimace video game arrives June 12 on desktop and mobile. \"It's reminiscent of games from the '90s,\" Healan said. \"Grimace actually goes on this journey with his McDonaldland friends.\"\n\n◾ Social media and charity. When McDonald's fans post a birthday memory June 13-14 on McDonald’s Instagram story (use the \"add yours\" sticker), the company will donate $5 to the Ronald McDonald House Charities, up to $200,000 total.\n\n\"There's a lot of really cool layers to the campaign overall\" in the effort to \"connect with our fans to drive the brand in culture, as we are on our journey to make McDonald's a cultural icon,\" Healan said. \"What better way to celebrate birthdays and actually give one of our favorite McDonaldland characters a spotlight for June.\"\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nMcDonald's reintroducing characters such as Grimace and Hamburglar to new Gen Z audience\n\nThe fast-food chain has been giving some of its classic characters more face time lately. The Hamburglar is shepherding McDonald's campaign to improve its burgers.\n\nAnd some classic characters from the ’70s and ’80s made appearances last year when McDonald's partnered with Cactus Plant Flea Market on a Happy Meal for adults, with collectible toys including Grimace, the Hamburglar and Birdie the Early Bird.\n\n\"So if you think about that experience of unlocking your childhood joy when you had a Happy Meal, that's the nostalgia piece,\" Healan said.\n\nPartnering with Cactus Plant Flea Market made sense because \"Gen Z knows who that is. That was a perfect combination of nostalgia and putting the brand in culture with a partner who connects with Gen Z.\"\n\nMore new McDonald's menu items? A Cheesy Jalapeño Bacon Quarter Pounder coming next month?\n\nMcDonald's is already in the process of improving its burgers with a saucier Big Mac, softer sandwich buns, toasted golden brown, \"perfectly melted cheese,\" and caramelized onions.\n\nIt apparently has a new burger coming to the menu soon, with two sites reporting a Cheesy Jalapeño Bacon Quarter Pounder could hit menus this summer. The food site Chew Boom said the burger would be available as a single or double, with three strips of bacon, pickled jalapeños and cheese sauce, along with two slices of cheese on a sesame seed bun. The menu item has been tested at some locations in Texas, the site reports.\n\nAnother site, The Krazy Coupon Lady, reports that when the burger arrives you will be able to order cheesy sauce and jalapeño slices on the side with any order.\n\nMcDonald's declined to comment about the new burger to USA TODAY, but we will stay vigilant on the burger beat in the days ahead.\n\nMore from USA TODAY\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/06/09/squishmallows-happy-meals-mcdonalds-us/70306765007/", "title": "Squishmallows coming to Happy Meals at McDonald's across the US", "text": "Squishmallows, the soft, squishy stuffed toys loved by kids, will be coming to McDonald's restaurants across the U.S. in late 2023 as the featured toys in Happy Meals.\n\nJazwares, the company that produces cuddly toys, is partnering with the famous chain restaurant for the promotion, which will include 24 collectible Squishmallows, according to a Jazwares release issued Tuesday.\n\nAdditionally, 14 of the stuffed animals will have a playlist matching their personality created by Universal Music Group that can be used by scanning an included QR code.

It’s been a year since the 2017 McDonald’s All American was ruled ineligible for the 2018-19 college basketball season by the NCAA based on alleged recruiting benefits his father received from Louisville.\n\nThe 6-7, 202-pound forward was one of 12 players to participate in the Pacers’ pre-draft workouts Tuesday. It wasn’t the first time he had been through the pre-draft process, either. Bowen declared for the NBA draft last season and worked out for the Los Angeles Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder before withdrawing his name 12 days later and deciding to play for the Sydney Kings in Australia’s National Basketball League.\n\nLast year, the questions surrounding his recruiting violations were rampant. While the questions have died down this time around, Bowen said he’s still trying to change the narratives connected with his name.\n\n“Off the court, I’m a good guy, man,” Bowen said. “There’s a lot of narratives out there about me, but once you meet me you can tell I have a pretty good character and everything. I like to be responsible and everything and I’m just going to show teams that I’m going to give it everything I’ve got. (I) just want to show that improvement over the year, from last year’s workouts, last year’s combine to this year. I feel a lot better about myself, a lot more confident and that’s the biggest thing for me.”\n\nMore:Brian Bowen moving past FBI college basketball scandal after year in Australia\n\nGoing through team and individual drills in solid purple shoes, Bowen said “it’s been a blessing” to once again be working out with an NBA team.\n\nIn high school, Bowen averaged 18.9 points and 7.4 rebounds per game in the Nike EYBL circuit and helped La Lumiere in LaPorte go 27-1 en route to a national championship victory.\n\nOne of the most highly touted recruits in the Class of 2017, Bowen would never play a college basketball game.\n\nThree months after committing to Louisville, FBI investigators alleged that Adidas executive James Gatto, former Adidas consultant Merl Code, sports agent Christian Dawkins and financial advisor Munish Sood conspired to pay Bowen's family $100,000 to steer him to the school. In return, Bowen would hire Dawkins and Sood and sign with Adidas as a professional.\n\nBowen was suspended by Louisville and transferred to the University of South Carolina where he was eventually ruled ineligible by the NCAA for the 2018-2019 season \"based on alleged benefits received by the Bowen family at his former institution and his requirement to serve a transfer year in residence at South Carolina.\"\n\nBrian Bowen:'I'm a lot stronger mentally than I thought'\n\nDespite everything that’s happened, Bowen said he and his father still have a strong relationship.\n\n“Our relationship is even stronger than what it was before,” Bowen said. “He’s got me where I am today on the court and off the court.”\n\nIn Australia, Bowen played 15.4 minutes per game, averaged 6.3 points and shot 45.1% percent from the field. On the Kings, he played alongside former NBA players Andrew Bogut, Jerome Randle and Brad Newley.\n\nBowen’s gained 12 pounds since his workout with the Lakers last season and said the physicality of the NBL has helped better prepare him for the NBA.\n\n“Just trying to deal with that physicality,” Bowen said. “Obviously, guys (in Australia) are a lot older, a lot bigger and stronger, so I think dealing with that helped me, just taught me to take the pace of the game and slow it down with everything.

That changed during the question-and-answer session at McDonald's annual shareholders meeting May 23, when the 9-year-old stood in front of a microphone and bawled out McDonald's CEO Don Thompson for marketing fast food to children. Sure, the 4th-grader from the city of Kelowna in British Columbia, got there with the backing of her nutritionally savvy parents as well as the activist group Corporate Accountability International. It picked up the family's travel expenses to Chicago, where the world's largest fast-food chain is based and where its annual meeting was held. But Hannah insists she wrote much of her own speech that has since gone viral on the Internet. Her first mass media interview, the day after the meeting, was with USA TODAY marketing reporter BRUCE HOROVITZ. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nQ. Why did you bawl out McDonald's CEO Don Thompson?\n\nA. Because I wanted to speak for all those kids and parents who wanted to have that voice and talk to McDonald's.\n\nQ. Can you sum up what you told him?\n\nA. I said it's not fair that big companies try to trick kids into eating food that's not good for them by giving them toys -- and with cartoon characters.\n\nQ. Do you think he heard what you said?\n\nA. Not very much. He kept saying the same thing: We sell veggies; and we want kids to eat healthy; and we don't sell junk food.\n\nQ. Was it scary to publicly address the CEO of one of America's biggest brands?\n\nA. It was very scary. I was shaking. I couldn't control my shaking, but no one could tell. So many people were there, and I was talking to the CEO of McDonald's. He's got a big reputation.\n\nQ. Who wrote your speech?\n\nA. Me and my mom wrote it together at home on the computer. It took about a day to write.\n\nQ. Who wrote the part of your speech that said that some things in life aren't fair, like when a pet dies -- or when a big company markets to kids.\n\nA. That was me. One of my pets recently died. It was a gerbil named \"Squeekers.\" I had him for two years. It didn't feel fair when he died -- it was sad. It's not fair that McDonald's markets to kids and that so many kids are getting sick because they eat junk food.\n\nQ. What's your biggest problem with McDonald's?\n\nA. My biggest problem with McDonald's is that they trick kids into eating their food by using toys and cartoon characters and sports icons.\n\nQ. What if they stopped all that?\n\nA. If they put more healthy food on their menu, I'd be OK with that. But when you think of the Golden Arches and McDonald's, you think of Big Macs, fries and nuggets.\n\nQ. How many times have you eaten at McDonald's?\n\nA. I don't know. Maybe three or four times.\n\nQ. Did you know you were going to speak at the meeting?\n\nA. Sort of. But we weren't sure. We were prepared to speak, but not guaranteed.\n\nQ. Did you practice the speech?\n\nA. Yes, three times -- at the hotel and at home. My mom was acting like she was the CEO.\n\nQ. Since you don't like McDonald's food, do you feel different from other kids?\n\nA. Sometimes I feel different. But everyone feels different once in a while.\n\nQ. Did your parents push you to do this speech?\n\nA. My parents never push me into anything.\n\nQ. What's your favorite meal?\n\nA. Spaghetti, tomato sauce, garlic bread and Caesar salad.\n\nQ. Where do you like to eat out?\n\nA. Pizza places.\n\nQ. What's your favorite dessert?\n\nA. Mangoes.\n\nQ. What's your favorite sweet?\n\nA. Gummy bears.\n\nQ. What do you think McDonald's should add to its menu?\n\nA. Healthy things like kale chips and veggies on a stick and fruit on a stick.\n\nQ. What's it like being famous at age 9?\n\nA. I was shocked that anything was written. I didn't think I would be famous.\n\nQ. Why do you think McDonald's targets kids?\n\nA. Because kids get what they want easily, and they pester their parents until they get it.\n\nQ. Should McDonald's sell Happy Meals to kids?\n\nA. Yes, but they should come without toys.\n\nQ. Does it seem like you might be picking on McDonald's?\n\nA. They are more popular than most of the other places, therefore they have more ability to market to kids.\n\nQ. Do you think McDonald's is naughty?\n\nA. No. But they should stop marketing to kids.\n\nQ. What do think of Mr. Thompson?\n\nA. He is a very nice man. We met before the meeting in the lobby. He said he wanted to get kids to eat healthy, too. After the meeting, he shook my hand and told me I did a good job. He said to e-mail him and that he's always open to getting new ideas about getting kids to eat healthy.\n\nQ. What do you want to be when you grow up?\n\nA. I don't know.\n\nQ. Would you ever work for McDonald's?\n\nA. No. I don't like the way their company works.\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/07/11/50-worst-product-flops-of-all-time/36734837/", "title": "Product launch blunders: 50 worst flops of all time", "text": "Michael B. Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Pikachu Illustrator\n\nIn April 2022, it was confirmed that Logan Paul paid $5.275 million for a PSA grade 10 Pikachu Illustrator card.

How have other stars done in MLS?", "text": "Major League Soccer has had its fair share of international soccer stars, but arguably no one greater than Lionel Messi. The 35-year-old Argentine star is planning to join Inter Miami following two seasons at Paris Saint-Germain. After speculation he would return to his boyhood club, FC Barcelona, Messi announced Wednesday he instead will head to the United States.\n\nThe move to Inter Miami comes six months after Messi achieved his greatest goal as a soccer player — winning a World Cup, Argentina’s first since 1986. Adding that achievement to his record-setting seven FIFA Ballon d'Or's solidified Messi as arguably the best soccer player of all-time. He achieved similar success with PSG, winning Ligue 1 for the second straight season. But his club floundered in Champions League competition, losing in the Round of 16 to Bayern Munich.\n\nMessi will start the next chapter of his career in the United States, joining a list of soccer icons who took their talents abroad later in their careers. That transition doesn’t always lead to immediate success. However, history says Messi is going to be just fine. Here's a breakdown of how eight former superstars fared in the league.\n\nDavid Beckham\n\nThe iconic English midfielder was the first notable name to join MLS when he made his move to the LA Galaxy in 2007. His decision to leave Spanish mega club Real Madrid in 2007 for a fledgling American league drew criticism but also helped grow MLS exponentially. It opened the door for stars to do the same in years to follow. The Galaxy reached records in merchandise sales and ESPN nationally broadcasted its first friendly against Chelsea FC.\n\nBeckham spent five years with the Galaxy, including two seasons on loan to Italian club AC Milan. In 98 MLS appearances, he scored 18 goals and had 31 assists. Injuries filled his first four seasons in Los Angeles before he had his best year in 2011, when Beckham and the Galaxy won their first of two consecutive MLS Cups. He returned to European play in 2013 to end his career with PSG. He is currently is a co-owner of Inter Miami.\n\nSteven Gerrard\n\nFrom one iconic English midfielder to another, Steven Gerrard joined LA Galaxy in 2015 after 17 seasons with Liverpool FC. The move was announced while Gerrard was in the middle of the English Premier League season. He made his debut at the conclusion of his Liverpool tenure.\n\nGerrard had a quiet stay in Los Angeles, playing in 34 games across two seasons. He scored two goals and had three assists his debut season, when he was named an MLS All-Star. Gerrard considered retirement after the 2015 season but stuck around for one more year. He had three goals and nine assists in 2016, retiring at the end of the year.\n\nThierry Henry\n\nWith his role diminishing with Barcelona, the French forward signed a multi-year deal with the New York Red Bulls in 2010. Henry had a short loan spell with Arsenal during the 2011-12 English Premier League season, which occurs while MLS is on break.\n\nHenry’s time in New York was his second-longest tenure with any club. He played in 122 matches with the Red Bulls, only playing more in nine seasons with Arsenal. Henry scored 51 goals, third-most in franchise history, and had 37 assists, the most in franchise history. His best statistical season came in 2012 when he had 15 goals and 12 assists and was a finalist for the MLS’ Most Valuable Player award.\n\nThe Red Bulls never won the MLS cup with Henry, but did win the Supporters Shield in 2013, awarded to the club with the best record. Henry retired with the Red Bulls in 2014.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimović\n\nMessi isn’t the first player to go from PSG to an MLS club. Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimović made the move in 2018 when he joined the LA Galaxy. He announced his decision with a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times, telling readers: “Dear Los Angeles, you’re welcome.”\n\nIbrahimović took the league by storm, coming off the bench for his debut and scoring two goals to lead the Galaxy to a comeback win over their rival, LAFC. He had 52 goals in 56 appearances during two seasons, often calling himself “by far” the best player in MLS. He was named an All-Star both seasons and reached 500 career goals while with the Galaxy.\n\nHis 30 goals during the 2019 season were the second-most he’s ever scored in a season. The Galaxy never won an MLS Cup with Ibrahimović, but his play continued to grow interest in the league. He returned to Italian club AC Milan in 2019, playing four seasons before retiring Sunday.\n\nKaká\n\nThe Brazilian midfield star joined MLS expansion team Orlando City in 2015, citing his interest to always play in the United States. Kaká signed a $6.6 million deal that, at the time, made him the highest paid MLS player ever. His decision to play for Orlando came after a long career in Europe and a short stint at his boyhood club in São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nKaká appeared in 75 games during his three seasons in Orlando, scoring 24 goals and adding 21 assists. He was named an MLS All-Star each season. His 11 assists during the 2016 season were his highest since the 2004-05 season with AC Milan. Orlando City never made it to the playoffs with Kaká, who called it a career after the 2017 season.\n\nFrank Lampard\n\nOut of all the international stars to join MLS, Frank Lampard's start may have been the bumpiest. Reports surfaced in July 2014 that Lampard signed a two-year deal with New York City FC. The parent club of New York City, Manchester City, announced a month later Lampard would be loaned to Manchester City for six months. Days before the end of his loan, it was announced Lampard's contract was extended to the end of the English Premier League season.\n\nFans expressed anger about the decision and MLS accused New York City FC of dishonesty. Lampard finally made his MLS debut in August 2015, playing 10 games that season. New York City fans jeered him in his 2016 season debut, a game Lampard’s side lost 7-0. But they turned around quickly, as Lampard scored 12 times in 19 games, including the club’s first ever hat trick. Lampard retired in February 2017, two months after New York City’s season concluded.\n\nWayne Rooney\n\nThe Manchester United legend left England for D.C. United in 2018. Rooney signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with the club, marking the first time he’d ever played in a league outside of England.\n\nHe only fulfilled two years of his deal, making 48 appearances with 23 goals and 15 assists. His 12 goals during his debut season earned him D.C. United’s MVP award and the club’s Golden Boot. D.C. United never advanced past the first round during Rooney’s tenure. He left MLS in 2019, retiring with his boyhood club Derby County in 2021.\n\nDavid Villa\n\nAfter 11 seasons in Spain’s top league, playing for Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, Villa decided to join newly-formed New York City FC in 2014. Villa expressed his desire to grow MLS as a reason for his move, calling it an “irresistible project.”\n\nHe dominated his four seasons with New York, scoring 77 goals and adding 20 assists. Villa was named an All-Star every season and won the MLS Most Valuable Player award in 2016. He scored at least 20 goals in two seasons, finishing second in the Golden Boot race in 2017. His 400th career goal came with New York City in 2018. He left the club that year for Vissel Kobe in Japan, retiring in early 2020.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2023/06/07/lionel-messi-inter-miami-deal-mls-over-saudi-club-barcelona/70296035007/", "title": "Lionel Messi to Inter Miami: Soccer star announces MLS decision", "text": "Lionel Messi has decided! He will join Inter Miami CF of Major League Soccer, he announced Wednesday, a stunning development that brings the 2022 World Cup champion and record-setting seven-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner to one of the league's newest teams.\n\nA deal is not yet done, Messi said during a joint interview with Mundo Deportivo and Sport, but he is committed to completing the transaction.\n\n\"I made the decision that I'm going to go to Miami,\" he said during the interview. \"I still haven't closed it 100% percent. I'm missing some things, but we decided to continue on the path. If the Barcelona thing didn't work out, I wanted to leave Europe, get out of the spotlight and think more of my family.\"\n\nCBS Sports and BBC journalist Guillem Balague, who wrote Messi's authorized biography, first reported earlier Wednesday that Messi had decided.\n\nWhy did Messi choose Miami over Saudi Arabia and Barcelona?\n\nWhile a move by Messi to Miami had been rumor fodder, such a transaction seemed like a dreamland scenario for MLS and a team that is in its fourth season, sits in last place in the Eastern Conference and recently sacked its coach. An offer from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly would have paid Messi around $400 million a year, according to The Telegraph.\n\nFC Barcelona – where Messi played 17 seasons, winning 10 La Liga titles – also was considered in the mix, with Messi's father suggesting his son would prefer a return to his old club.\n\nMessi said Wednesday there were a lot of things missing from his talks with Barcelona, and there wasn't a formal, written proposal. He didn't feel comfortable waiting on the unknown. He also said economics were not a problem for him and that if his decision was solely about money, he would have gone to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"I had offers from other European teams, but I didn't even evaluate them because my idea was to go to Barcelona,\" he said. \"And if the Barcelona thing didn't come out, analyzing it, then leaving European football.\"\n\nHe added he's hopeful to focus more on family and his well-being in the United States.\n\n\"Obviously, I really wanted to (return to Barcelona),\" Messi said. \"I had a lot of desire to be able to return. But, on the other hand, having lived what I lived, and the exit that I had, I did not want to return to be in the same situation again.\"\n\nMLS and Inter Miami, which is owned by David Beckham, had to get imaginative in the attempt to lure Messi. MLS and its broadcast partner, Apple, offered Messi a share of revenue generated by new subscribers to MLS Season Pass on Apple TV+, the Athletic reported citing multiple sources. Messi also was offered a profit-sharing deal with Adidas, per the Athletic. On Tuesday, Apple TV+ announced that it was developing a four-part documentary series featuring Messi.\n\n\"We are pleased that Lionel Messi has stated that he intends to join Inter Miami CF and Major League Soccer this summer,\" MLS said in a statement. \"Although work remains to finalize a formal agreement, we look forward to welcoming one of the greatest soccer players of all time to our League.\"\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW: Stay up to date with our sports newsletter\n\nMilestone moment for MLS\n\nLanding Messi will be considered a seminal moment in the history of a league that continues to strive for consistent relevance in a crowded American sports landscape. One such moment happened 16 years ago when global soccer icon David Beckham joined the Los Angeles Galaxy. Beckham's arrival spawned the league's designated player rule ― also known as \"The Beckham Rule\" ― in which MLS teams can acquire players outside of the salary cap. Also part of the deal to get Beckham to join the Galaxy was an option for him to buy an MLS expansion team for $25 million. In February 2014 Beckham exercised that option to bring a team to Miami, and on March 1, 2020 Inter Miami CF finally made its debut.\n\nThe Major League Soccer that Messi will join is very different from the league Beckham joined in 2007. That season, there were just 13 teams; MLS recently announced its 30th club. MLS' regular-season attendance averaged 15,504 in 2006, the season before Beckham's arrival. During the 2023 season, five MLS teams ― each of which did not exist before Beckham's arrival ― average more than 25,000 fans a game. So far this season, the league averages more than 21,000 a game.\n\nHOW DID THEY DO? 8 major soccer stars who moved from Europe to MLS before Lionel Messi\n\nTHE MESSI EFFECT: Inter Miami CF ticket prices, popularity soar after MLS announcement\n\nRough end for Messi at PSG\n\nMessi's contract with Paris Saint-Germain expired with the end of the 2022-23 Ligue 1 season, during which PSG were league champions but had a disappointing UEFA Champions League campaign, bowing out during the Round of 16. Messi was expected to be the missing piece for Champions League glory for PSG, which had never won European club soccer's most prestigious trophy; Messi arrived in Paris after having won the Champions League four times during his time with Barcelona.

Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nPiqué returned to Barca in 2008, where he blossomed into a first-team regular and one of the world’s best defenders under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola, who is now Manchester City’s manager.\n\nPiqué was a vital part of those famous Barcelona teams, known for it’s tiki-taka style of play with Lionel Messi the main focal point.\n\nThe defender played 615 games – including 396 in the Spanish league and 126 in the Champions League – with Barcelona, winning eight La Liga title and the Champions League three times.\n\nThis season, Piqué has fallen down the pecking order as Barcelona attempt to transition to a new era, meaning he’s found his playing time limited.\n\n“I have been thinking a lot about … what little Gerard would have thought had all his dreams come true,” he said.\n\n“That he would make it to the Barca first team, that he would win every trophy possible. That he would become a European champion and world champion. That he would play alongside some of the best players in history, and captain the club and make friends for life.\n\nPiqué poses for a fan during a public training session at the Joan Gamper Sports City training ground in Sant Joan Despi on January 5, 2020. Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“It has been 25 years since I joined Barca, I left and I came back. Football has given me everything. I have always said that I would not be in any other team after I left Barca, and that is how it will be.”\n\nIn recent years, there have been rumors that Piqué could be interested in running to become Barcelona’s club president. And he hinted that his time at the club is not over.\n\n“I will become a regular fan,” Piqué said. “I will support the team. I will pass my love for Barca to my children, like my family did with me. And you know me, sooner or later, I will be back.”\n\nBarcelona president Joan Laporta paid tribute to Piqué, calling him part of the fabric of the club.\n\n“Piqué is part of the Barca badge, he has achieved everything with the club,” Laporta said.\n\n“He will always be an icon for the culers, he has more than demonstrated what he wants from Barca. 25 years he has been linked to the club. It has been an honor to have him as a Barca player.”\n\nPiqué’s contract ran until 2024, but according to La Vanguardia newspaper the 35-year-old will forego the remaining year-and-a-half of his salary, a gesture that will help Barca given the club’s well documented financial problems.\n\nPiqué carries the UEFA European Championship trophy down the steps after the game, as he is mobbed by fans.

He played in four World Cups and is the only player in history to win three, but his legacy stretched far beyond his trophy haul and remarkable goal-scoring record.\n\n“I was born to play football, just like Beethoven was born to write music and Michelangelo was born to paint,” Pelé famously said.\n\nTributes have been pouring in for the soccer legend. Pelé’s first club, Santos FC, responded to the news on Twitter with the words “eternal” shared next to an image of a crown.\n\nBrazilian footballer Neymar said Pelé “changed everything.” In a post on Instagram, he wrote: “He turned football into art, into entertainment. He gave a voice to the poor, to black people and especially: He gave visibility to Brazil. Football and Brazil have raised their status thanks to the King!” he added.\n\nPelé is carried off the field by fans after Brazil defeated Italy in the final of the 1970 World Cup.

Shirlaine Forrest/WireImage/Getty Images Pelé's life in pictures Prev Next\n\nPortuguese star forward Cristiano Ronaldo sent his condolences to Brazil in a post on Instagram, saying “a mere “goodbye” to the eternal King Pelé will never be enough to express the pain that currently engulfs the entire football world.”\n\nKylian Mbappé of Paris Saint-Germain said of Pelé’s death: “The king of football has left us but his legacy will never be forgotten.”\n\nFormer English soccer player Geoff Hurst wrote on Twitter of his memories of Pelé, calling the late star “without doubt the best footballer I ever played against (with Bobby Moore being the best footballer I ever played alongside). For me Pele remains the greatest of all time and I was proud to be on the the pitch with him. RIP Pele and thank you.”\n\nBrazil’s incoming President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took to Twitter to pay his respects to Pelé, saying “few Brazilians took the name of our country as far as he did.”\n\n“As different from Portuguese as the language was, foreigners from the four corners of the planet soon found a way to pronounce the magic word: ‘Pelé,’” Lula added.\n\nA public wake will be held for Pelé on Monday at the Urbano Caldeira stadium, popularly known as Vila Belmiro and home to Santos football club, in Brazil’s São Paulo state, according to a Thursday statement from Santos FC.\n\nAt dawn Monday, Pele’s body will be moved from the Albert Einstein Hospital to the stadium. The soccer legend’s coffin will be placed in the center of the pitch.\n\nThe wake at Vila Belmiro will continue until Tuesday 10 a.m. local time (8 a.m. ET), after which a funeral procession will carry Pelé’s coffin through the streets of the city of Santos, including the street where Pelé’s 100-year-old mother, Celeste Arantes, lives.\n\nThe cortege will continue to Pelé’s final resting place, the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica cemetery in Santos, where a private funeral, reserved for family members, will be held.\n\nDazzling ability\n\nPelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento in Três Corações – an inland city roughly 155 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro – in 1940, before his family moved to the city of Bauru in São Paulo.\n\nThe genesis of the nickname Pelé are unclear, even to the footballer. He once wrote in the British newspaper The Guardian that it likely started with school classmates teasing him for mangling the nickname of another player, Bilé. Whatever the origin, the moniker stuck.\n\nExactly how many goals Pelé scored during his career is unclear, and his Guinness World Records tally has come under scrutiny with many scored in unofficial matches. Domicio Pinheiro/Agência Estado/AP\n\nAs a child, his first taste of soccer involved playing barefoot with socks and rags rolled up into a ball – a humble beginning that would grow into a long and fruitful career.\n\nBut when he first took up the game, his ambitions were modest.\n\n“My dad was a good football player, he scored a lot of goals,” Pelé told CNN in 2015. “His name was Dondinho; I wanted to be like him.\n\n“He was famous in Brazil, in Minas Gerais. He was my role model. I always wanted to be like him, but what happened, to this day, only God can explain.”\n\nAs a teenager, Pelé left home and began training with Santos, scoring his first goal for the club side before his 16th birthday. He would go on to score 619 times over 638 appearances for the club, but it is his feats in the iconic yellow jersey of Brazil for which he is best remembered.\n\nThe world first got a glimpse of Pelé’s dazzling ability in 1958, when he made his World Cup debut aged 17. He scored Brazil’s only goal in the country’s quarterfinal victory against Wales, then netted a hat-trick in the semifinal against France and two in the final against host Sweden.\n\nBrazil players hold a banner showing support for former Brazil player Pele after the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Round of 16 match between Brazil and South Korea on December 5. Michael Steele/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n“When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding,” said Sweden’s Sigvard Parling.\n\nFor Pelé, the standout memory from the tournament was putting his country on the sporting map.\n\n“When we won the World Cup, everybody knew about Brazil,” he told CNN’s Don Riddell in 2016. “I think this was the most important thing I gave to my country because we were well known after that World Cup.”\n\nAnother World Cup victory came in 1962, although an injury sidelined Pelé for the tournament’s later stages. Further injuries hampered his next campaign in 1966 as Brazil exited the competition after the group stage, but redemption came in 1970.\n\n“Pelé was saying that we were going to win, and if Pelé was saying that, then we were going to win the World Cup,” Brazil’s co-captain Carlos Alberto said about the tournament.\n\nThat team – featuring the likes of Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostão, Rivellino, and, of course, Pelé – is regarded as one of the greatest ever assembled.\n\nIn the final – a 4-1 victory against Italy – Brazil scored arguably the most famous World Cup goal of all time, a sweeping, length-of-the-pitch move involving nine of the team’s 10 outfield players.\n\nIt ended with Pelé teeing up Alberto, who drilled the ball into the bottom corner of the net. Brazil’s mantra of jogo bonito (the beautiful game) has never been better encapsulated.\n\nPelé, who had considered retiring before the 1970 World Cup, scored a goal of his own in the final and a total of four over the course of the tournament.\n\n“Before the match, I told myself that Pelé was just flesh and bones like the rest of us,” Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich said after his side’s defeat in the final. “Later, I realized I’d been wrong.”\n\nThe tournament capped Pelé’s World Cup career but not his time in the spotlight. In 1975, he signed a $1.67-million-a-year contract in the United States with the New York Cosmos.\n\nOne of the greatest players\n\nWith his larger-than-life personality and extraordinary dribbling skills – a trademark of his game – Pele’s helped the Cosmos win the North American Soccer League championship in 1977 before officially retiring from football.\n\nThe league, which attracted further big names like Giorgio Chinaglia and Franz Beckenbauer, wouldn’t last, ultimately folding in 1984. But around the world, Pelé’s influence endured.\n\nHe remained in the public eye through endorsement deals and as an outspoken political voice who championed the poor in Brazil. He served as a Goodwill UNICEF ambassador for many years, promoting peace and support for vulnerable children.\n\nHealth problems persisted for much of Pelé’s later life. He got around with the support of a walker – an item he was filmed shoving around with disdain in a documentary released last year – and in September 2021, he underwent surgery to remove a tumor from his right colon.\n\nParis Saint-Germain and France national football team forward Kylian Mbappe (R) and Brazilian football legend Pele take part in a meeting at the Hotel Lutetia in Paris on April 2, 2019. Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPelé’s cancer treatment continued over the past year. He was hospitalized in Sao Paulo in November as the 2022 World Cup was being played in Qatar, prompting an outpouring of support from the global soccer community and beyond.\n\nDebate will inevitably rage about whether Pelé is the greatest player of all time – whether it is possible to compare Pelé’s achievements to those of Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, who have rewritten soccer’s record books over the past 15 years, or to Diego Maradona, the late Argentinian star who captivated the footballing world in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nIn 2000, FIFA jointly named Maradona and Pelé as Player of the Century, but to some, the outright winner of the award should have been obvious.\n\n“This debate about the player of the century is absurd,” said Zico, who represented Brazil in the decade after Pelé’s retirement. “There’s only one possible answer: Pelé. He’s the greatest player of all time, and by some distance, I might add.”\n\nBefore Christmas, Pele's daughter posted a moving photo with father in hospital. Kely Nascimento/Instagram\n\nExactly how many goals Pelé scored during his career is unclear, and his Guinness World Records tally has come under scrutiny with many scored in unofficial matches.\n\nIn March 2021, he congratulated Portugal’s Ronaldo for passing his “record of goals in official matches” – 767.\n\nThere is little doubt, however, that Pelé was, and always will be, football’s first global superstar.\n\n“If I pass away one day, I am happy because I tried to do my best,” he told The Talks online magazine. “My sport allowed me to do so much because it’s the biggest sport in the world.”", "authors": ["Camilo Rocha George Ramsay Tara John Flora Charner Rodrigo Pedroso", "Camilo Rocha", "George Ramsay", "Tara John", "Flora Charner", "Rodrigo Pedroso"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mls/2021/06/02/lionel-messi-mls-rumors-usmnt-nations-league-euro-2020-players/7516020002/", "title": "Lionel Messi to MLS rumors.

But when an iconic player of Lionel Messi's stature is being linked to a possible move to MLS, exceptions can and will be made. It’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time this year that Messi’s been linked with a move to MLS, but it is the latest episode of it.\n\nAnd, of course, David Beckham’s Inter Miami CF project is in the fray. Sport.ES, based in Spain’s Catalan region, reported that Messi’s current negotiation to re-sign for FC Barcelona as part of a 10-year deal that includes both on- and off-field roles also features a multi-year stay at Inter Miami.\n\nDoes this report have more teeth than reports this past winter of a contract with City Football Group that suggested Messi would jump to Manchester City and later to New York City FC? Who knows? But one thing we know for sure is that it’s worth keeping occasional tabs on Messi’s possible movements and that’s even more true if MLS is being mentioned alongside his name.\n\nRATINGS:UEFA Champions League final averages 3.65 million viewers in U.S.\n\nMLS news and notes\n\nLeague goes on break: With the Concacaf Nations League and World Cup qualifying taking place, MLS goes on an extended break between games, returning to full action the weekend of June 18-20. The U.S., Costa Rica, Honduras and Mexico will compete in Denver in the first-ever Concacaf Nations League finals, thus completing a competition that started in 2018. For the USMNT, it represents the first meaningful games since it clinched its spot in the Nations League final with a 4-0 win over Cuba on Nov. 19, 2019. Elsewhere, the remaining Concacaf squads carry on with first-round qualification games for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The USMNT, Costa Rica, Honduras, Jamaica and Mexico already have qualified for the eight-team final round that will begin play in September.\n\nConcacaf Nations League finals schedule\n\nThursday (semifinals) Honduras vs. USMNT, 7:30 p.m. ET (Paramount+, TUDN)\n\nMexico vs. Costa Rica, 10 p.m. ET (Paramount+, TUDN) Sunday Semifinal winners, 9 p.m. ET (Paramount+, TUDN)\n\nMLS shows well in USMNT-Switzerland friendly: The U.S. men’s national team opened the ongoing FIFA window for international play with a 2-1 loss to world-ranked No. 13 Switzerland on Sunday. Putting the loss aside, there were plenty of positives to take from the game, including periods of impressive play from the Americans. It was an especially positive match for Major League Soccer fans as three players from the league featured in the game. Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Sebastian Lletget opened the scoring in the fifth minute to put the USMNT in front. Lletget, whose goal was the seventh of his international career, started alongside San Jose Earthquakes midfielder Jackson Yueill. Both players went for 61 minutes in the game. When they were subbed off by manager Gregg Berhalter, Colorado Rapids midfielder Kellyn Acosta entered the game. The only MLS-based player who didn’t see time in the match was Real Salt Lake goalkeeper David Ochoa.\n\nDike rejoins USMNT camp: Daryl Dike, who lit up England’s second-division Championship while on loan with Barnsley (nine goals in 19 appearances), returned to the U.S. men’s national team picture this week, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. After Barnsley declined the purchase option on Dike’s loan agreement, Dike participated in the U.S. men’s national team camp centered around the Concacaf Nations League finals, which resumed Thursday for the Americans against Honduras (7:30 p.m.). Dike is set to return to Orlando City SC, but will train in Berhalter’s camp ahead of next week’s friendly against Costa Rica, which he would be eligible to play in. Dike isn’t rostered for the purposes of Nations League play.\n\nJozy Altidore's TFC future in doubt: On-again, off-again USMNT forward Jozy Altidore was not with his Toronto FC teammates during last week's loss to the Columbus Crew after being told to train on his own following a disagreement with coach Chris Armas, according to multiple reports. \"We still are going to use the international break to discuss the situation, in-house,\" Toronto FC GM Ali Curtis told The Canadian Press. \"That conversation will be handled internally. It will be a club decision. And it will incorporate what I would say is the totality of the time that Jozy has been with the club.\" Altidore is one of three designated players for Toronto FC, along with midfielders Yeferson Soteldo and Alejandro Pozuelo, the reigning MLS MVP.\n\nInter Miami penalized: Last week, MLS announced sanctions against Inter Miami CF for salary budget and roster violations. Sure, the league has complicated and convoluted roster rules, but Inter Miami really botched this. The team had five players on its roster in 2020 that should have occupied designated player spots (the league limit is three). It also underreported the salaries for three other players. While the league fined the club $2 million and issued a $250,000 fine to managing owner Jorge Mas, it's the reduction of $2,271,250 in allocation money for the 2022 and 2023 seasons that will hinder Inter Miami's roster-building capabilities moving forward.\n\nAnother Aaronson: On the same day that the 20-year-old Brenden Aaronson started for the USMNT in the friendly against Switzerland, his 17-year-old brother Paxten made his Philadelphia Union debut in a 3-0 win over the Portland Timbers. Expectations are high for Paxten, whose brother made the move from the Union to Red Bull Salzburg – the Austrian Bundesliga champions – after the 2020 MLS season. Also, Paxten is coming up in one of the league's top developers of young talent, and his older brother wasn't the only Union product to make the move to Europe over the winter. Defender Mark McKenzie – who also started for the USMNT on Sunday – transferred from the Union to Genk in Belgium.\n\nVancouver adds firepower: The Vancouver Whitecaps (2-4-1) are currently the 10th team out of 13 in the Western Conference and have been just a few goals short of putting themselves in far better position in the standings. The ‘Caps attempted to address their offensive needs by trading for the New York Red Bulls’ 25-year-old Brian White. Vancouver sent an initial $400,000 in General Allocation Money to the Red Bulls and performance incentives could see the number rise to as much as an additional $100,000 GAM. White had 15 goals and four assists in 47 appearances in his time with New York.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n68: Squads for the postponed Euro 2020 were finalized this week, and seven Major League Soccer players made rosters for their respective nations: Chicago Fire FC midfielder Przemyslaw Frankowski (Poland); Minnesota United midfielder Ján Greguš (Slovakia); Philadelphia Union midfielder Dániel Gazdag and FC Dallas forward Szabolcs Schön (Hungary); and Minnesota United defender Jukka Raitala and midfielder Robin Lod, and CF Montreal forward Lassi Lappalainen (Finland). Those three players named to Finland's Euro squad represents the most MLS has ever had called into a single team for the European Championships. In all, 68 MLS players – representing 26 of the league's 27 teams – have been called into national team competitions, with the Columbus Crew and Toronto FC having the most players called up by their national teams (five apiece). Canada, meanwhile, is the country that has called up the most MLS players (10).\n\nEURO 2020:Complete squads for the European Championship\n\nMLS power rankings: Top 10 power poll\n\n1.

New England Revolution: Coach Bruce Arena's Eastern Conference front-runners have won their previous three games, in large part due to the contributions of playmaking midfielder Carles Gil, an early season favorite for league MVP honors.\n\n3. Philadelphia Union: With Concacaf Champions League obligations out of the way for the time being (Philadelphia's semifinal showdown with Club America isn't until Aug. 12), the Union have been on an absolute tear that has reminded fans of why this team was Supporters' Shield winners in 2020.\n\n4. Los Angeles Galaxy: While Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez is pacing the league with seven goals scored, Jonathan Bond has been stellar in goal. Bond recorded 12 saves in last week's win over the San Jose Earthquakes, earning MLS Player of the Week honors.\n\n5. Orlando City SC: Orlando's unbeaten start to the season came to an end last week in a road loss to the New York Red Bulls. Could Daryl Dike be back with the team after the break? The striker had his option to purchase declined by Championship side Barnsley, with whom Dike had thrived.\n\n6. Sporting Kansas City: SKC sits in second place in the Western Conference and just two points behind Seattle, despite the Sounders' hot start. Fueling Kansas City's surge are Alan Pulido (third in MLS in goals scored) and Gianluca Busio, who scored a bend-it-like-Beckham-esque free kick in Saturday's win, just a day after his 19th birthday.\n\n7. New York City FC: NYCFC rallied for a late road win over Los Angeles FC after being reduced to 10 players in what coach Ronny Deila called \"by far the biggest win\" of his two-year tenure with the team.\n\n8. Colorado Rapids: Colorado collected 12 points from five games in May to enter June in the Western Conference mix. Coach Robin Fraser's team comes off the break facing FC Cincinnati and Sporting Kansas City on the road, the latter matchup being a test of this team's chances in the West.\n\n9. Nashville SC: Nashville remained one of two undefeated teams (along with the Seattle Sounders) with a dramatic road draw against Atlanta United last week. Down 2-0, Hany Mukhtar scored two goals in three minutes to stun the crowd of 41,000 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and keep Nashville's surprising unbeaten streak alive.\n\n10.

The merger aims to create \"a new, collectively owned, for-profit entity to ensure that all stakeholders benefit from a model that delivers maximum excitement and competition among the game’s best players.\"\n\nThe terms of the agreement are not fully finalized and are scheduled to be completed in the coming months.\n\n\"After two years of disruption and distraction, this is a historic day for the game we all know and love,\" PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\n\"Going forward, fans can be confident that we will, collectively, deliver on the promise we’ve always made — to promote competition of the best in professional golf and that we are committed to securing and driving the game’s future.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the merger agreement.\n\nBryson DeChambeau: 'I do feel bad for the PGA Tour players'\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who is among the most notable names who bolted from the PGA Tour to join LIV Golf last year, appeared on \"CNN Primetime\" for an interview with anchor Kaitlan Collins to discuss Tuesday's stunning news of a merger between the Tour and LIV.\n\n\"There’s a lot more behind closed doors that’s been going on. What I can tell you is that H-E, Yasir, has always been a staunch supporter of golf globally and wanting to grow the game,\" DeChambeau said, referring to Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who is the governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. \"That’s been his vision from the start, when we first started talking a few years ago. As it’s come to fruition now I think this is the best thing that could ever happen for the game of golf. And I'm extremely proud to be part of that because of the fact that the fans are going to get what they want, the players are going to experience something a little different, a little new on the PGA Tour side, but I truly believe, in the end, the game of golf wins in this scenario.\"\n\nCollins then asked DeChambeau if he thought that Jay Monahan was a hypocrite after the PGA Tour commissioner had been critical of the Saudi-back golf league and the players who bolted the Tour for LIV.\n\n\"I do feel bad for the PGA Tour players because they were told one thing and something else happened, and our side, we were told one thing and it’s come to fruition. In the end, for me, I want the players, the fans and the game of golf to win,\" DeChambeau said. \"It does stink a little bit from my perspective that the PGA Tour players are not necessarily winning. I hope they can find a way to make sure they are valued in the same way that we are over at LIV. I think that’ll happen, it’s just going to take some time with players pushing back a little bit and trying to figure out what gives them the best opportunity to be successful on their own end. Eventually, we all come back together now and play as one group, and I think that's the best thing.\"\n\nPGA Tour commissioner: 'People are going to call me a hypocrite'\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said Tuesday he's well aware \"people are going to call me a hypocrite\" after he made a stunning reversal and merged with LIV Golf having previously denounced the Saudi-backed league over its ties to the terrorist attacks on 9/11.\n\nBut on Tuesday evening, Monahan described Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as \"a great and world-class investor.\"\n\n“I recognize that people are going to call me a hypocrite. Anytime I said anything, I said it with the information that I had at that moment, and I said it based on someone that’s trying to compete for the PGA Tour and our players. I accept those criticisms,\" Monahan said in a conference call on Tuesday, according to Golf Week. \"But circumstances do change. I think that in looking at the big picture and looking at it this way, that’s what got us to this point.”\n\nMonahan said the deal has been in the works for seven weeks: \"We just realized that we were better off together than we were fighting or apart, and by thinking about the game at large and eliminating a lot of the friction that’s been out there and doing this in a way where we can move forward.\"\n\nPGA Tour commissioner held 'intense' player meeting after merger\n\nJay Monahan held a players-only meeting at the Canadian Open Tuesday afternoon following the surprise announcement merger of the PGA Tour and LIV Golf that blindsided many players. Many top players were not present at the meeting, which Monahan described as \"intense, certainly heated,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\n“I’m not surprised,” Monahan said. “This is an awful lot to ask them to digest. This is a significant change for us. As I’m trying to explain as we go forward, this ultimately was a decision in the best interests of all at the PGA Tour.”\n\nMonahan said that although he expects \"a lot of questions and criticism\" right now, \"players who stayed with the PGA Tour will see they benefited in many ways\" in the long run.\n\nMichael Kim attended the meeting and said he was \"disappointed as all of you.\" He tweeted, \"Well… the meeting happened… Came in very excited… but not a whole lot happened, too many details still up in the air.\"\n\nGolf Channel's Brandel Chamblee 'disappointed' in PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger\n\nFormer men's pro golfer and current Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee has been one of the most outspoken critics of LIV Golf and its disruption to the sport. After news of the merger broke, Chamblee spoke about the matter and expressed his displeasure with the PGA Tour.\n\n\"After the shock sort of ebbed away, I was hugely disappointed,\" Chamblee said Tuesday during an appearance on the Golf Channel. \"I think this is one of the saddest days in the history of professional golf. I do believe the governing bodies, the entities, have sacrificed their principles for profit.\"\n\nChamblee said he suspected there were three key reasons behind the decision to merge: legal issues over previously-pending antitrust litigation; \"entanglements\" some PGA Tour sponsors have with PIF capital; and the sheer amount of Saudi money that became available to the PGA Tour with the merger.\n\nWhat do we know about the terms of the merger agreement between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf?\n\nThere are still several key details that are unknown about the merger. For starters, the new entity does not have a name yet.\n\nA key element in the merger is financial. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, \"will make a capital investment into the new entity to facilitate its growth and success,\" according to the news release. The PIF had been the sole entity to entirely fund the LIV Golf operation.\n\nAdditionally, the merger stipulates that the PIF \"will initially be the exclusive investor in the new entity\" and \"will have the exclusive right to further invest in the new entity, including a right of first refusal on any capital.\"\n\nA newly established board of directors will direct and oversee the new entity's operations, schedule, investments. PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will be part of the new entity's board of directors and will be on its executive committee. The announcement of the full board will come at a later date.\n\nAdditionally, the merger will lead to \"a mutually agreed end to all pending litigation between the participating parties.\" In August 2022, a number of golfers who joined the LIV tour filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour, challenging their suspensions.\n\nThe merger stipulates that after the conclusion of the 2023 season, the PGA Tour, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour \"will work cooperatively and in good faith to establish a fair and objective process\" to allow players who left the PGA Tour and DP tour to re-apply for membership.\n\nLIV Golf only part of Saudi 'sportswashing'\n\nIt's not just golf that is being upended by Saudi money.\n\nIn addition to financing Tuesday's merger between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced this week that it has effectively seized controlling stakes in four of the largest teams in the country's pro soccer league, in an effort to lure top European talent there.\n\nFreelance reporter Fabrizio Romano reported for The Guardian on Tuesday that the one of those teams, Al-Ittihad, is signing Real Madrid star Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante of Chelsea, each for exorbitant sums. Benzema is due to make roughly $213 million per year over two seasons, according to Romano, while Kante's contract is reported to be in excess of $106 million per year.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is making more than $200 million per year with another Saudi team, Al-Nassr, and Romano reports that Lionel Messi has been offered more than $370 million to play for Al-Hilal. The PIF also owns Newcastle United, a prominent English team.\n\nActivists and academics have pointed to the PIF's investment in soccer and golf as part of a broader campaign of Saudi \"sportswashing,\" or using sports to polish a country's otherwise problematic reputation. Saudi Arabia has a track record of human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. — Tom Schad\n\nU.S. Senators call out PGA Tour for 'hypocrisy' over merger with LIV Golf\n\nTwo United States senators took to social media on Tuesday to address the monster news that the PGA Tour was merging with LIV Golf.\n\nOregon’s Ron Wyden, who serves as the chairman of the Committee on Finance, blasted the deal, vowing to explore its economic impact. The merger means that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will be backing professional golf stateside and abroad.\n\n\"Hypocrisy doesn’t begin to describe this brazen, shameless cash grab,\" he said on Twitter. \"I’m going to dive into every piece of Saudi Arabia’s deal with the PGA. U.S. officials need to consider whether a deal will give the Saudi regime inappropriate control or access to U.S. real estate.\"\n\nConnecticut’s Chris Murphy expressed surprise at the deal. He said representatives from the PGA recently visited his office and were upset at the track record of social justice violations by the Middle Eastern country.\n\n\"So weird. PGA officials were in my office just months ago talking about how the Saudis' human rights record should disqualify them from having a stake in a major American sport,\" he said while retweeting a news post of the unification.\n\n\"I guess maybe their concerns weren't really about human rights?\" — Victoria Hernandez\n\nWhat was Phil Mickelson's LIV Golf deal worth?\n\nAlthough Phil Mickelson has not revealed the exact amount of his signing bonus to join the LIV tour, it was widely expected that his deal exceeded the $125 million figure that fellow golfer Dustin Johnson took. Reports later emerged that Mickelson's contract was worth $200 million, which was the largest contract issued by the Saudi-backed tour.\n\nLIV Golf, PGA Tour merger shines spotlight on 'sportswashing'\n\nOver the past six years, the term has been used to describe everything from the 2018 World Cup in Russia to a 2019 heavyweight boxing match in Saudi Arabia to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAnd at a news conference ahead of the Saudi-funded LIV Golf league's first event last summer, it came up twice.\n\n\"Isn't there a danger,\" one reporter asked Phil Mickelson, \"that you're also being seen as a tool of sportswashing?\"\n\nThat term — \"sportswashing\" — is still relatively new. But the strategy it represents has been employed by governments around the world, in some form or fashion, for a century or more.\n\nFor world leaders, it is a way to improve their nation's reputation by hosting a prestigious sporting event, or financing a popular team. — Tom Schad\n\nWhat is going on with the antitrust lawsuit filed against the PGA Tour?\n\nIn August 2022, 11 players who left the PGA Tour for LIV Golf filed an antitrust lawsuit to challenge their suspensions from the PGA Tour.\n\nThis followed a report from the month before that the United States Department of Justice was investigating the PGA Tour for possible anticompetitive behavior. Augusta National Golf Club, which operates the Masters Tournament, the United States Golf Association and the PGA of America were later revealed to also be part of the investigation.\n\nSince then, lawyers on both sides have battled in various court proceedings to gain leverage. With the merger, however, both sides are mutually agreeing to end all pending litigation against the other.\n\nWho is on the PGA Tour board of directors?\n\nJay Monahan is currently serving as the PGA Tour commissioner and will retain a large presence after the merger. Ed Herlihy is serving as the 2023 PGA Tour policy board chairman and the co-chair of the board of directors. Jimmy Dunne is acting as the vice chair and senior managing principal on this year's board of directors. Under the merger, however, the board of the new entity will look a little different.\n\nAccording to the news release, PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will serve as chairman. Al-Rumayyan will also join the PGA Tour's policy board and will be part of the board of directors' executive committee. Monahan will serve as the CEO of the board of directors.\n\nAl-Rumayyan, Monahan, Herlihy and Dunne will all serve on the executive committee of the board.\n\n9/11 families group slams PGA Tour over LIV Golf merger: 'Paid Saudi shills'\n\nAn organization representing families of 9/11 victims ripped the PGA Tour's decision Tuesday to merge with Saudi-funded LIV Golf, describing the PGA and its commissioner, Jay Monahan, as hypocrites who have become \"paid Saudi shills.\"\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday afternoon, 9/11 Families United said it was \"shocked and deeply offended\" by the news of the merger, which will see the PGA, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour all operating under a single business umbrella, funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The chair of 9/11 Families United, Terry Strada, said she and the other family members who make up the group felt \"betrayed\" by the PGA Tour and Monahan individually.\n\n\"Mr. Monahan talked last summer about knowing people who lost loved ones on 9/11, then wondered aloud on national television whether LIV Golfers ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour. They do now — as does he,\" said Strada, whose husband, Tom, died at the World Trade Center.\n\n\"PGA Tour leaders should be ashamed of their hypocrisy and greed. Our entire 9/11 community has been betrayed by Commissioner Monahan and the PGA as it appears their concern for our loved ones was merely window-dressing in their quest for money — it was never to honor the great game of golf.\" — Tom Schad\n\nThe White House is staying out of the PGA Tour-LIV Golf partnership\n\nAs news of the PGA Tour's merger with LIV Golf spread, the White House is opting not to weigh in, when reporters at a briefing asked about the agreement in light of Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\n\n\"I have no comment on that,\" White House spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday during a briefing. — Joey Garrison\n\nAs PGA Tour and LIV announce merger, the current standings and top players on each tour\n\nLIV golfers Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau and Phil Mickelson have been hard to miss near the top of major tournament leaderboards this year – especially with Koepka collecting his fifth major at the PGA Championship.\n\nBut what about all the other players who left the PGA for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour in past months?\n\nWith the surprise announcement Tuesday morning of the merger of the two tours' business operations, here's a look at the top 52 players of each tour in 2023. — Jim Sergent\n\nTune in for 'Full Swing' Season 2\n\nA producer on the Netflix docuseries \"Full Swing,\" which follows the lives of several men's pro golfers, said that the cameras were rolling when the news of the PGA Tour-LIV Golf agreement came through.\n\n\"You better believe we were filming when this broke,\" producer Chad Mumm wrote Tuesday in a tweet.\n\nSeason 2 drops in 2024.\n\nPGA Tour golfers frustrated they didn't know about deal with LIV Golf beforehand\n\nThe golf world was stunned by the PGA Tour-LIV Golf deal, and apparently, so were the ones on the tours.\n\nThe announcement Tuesday morning was a shocker since the PGA Tour and its players have been critical of the LIV Golf Invitational Series, primarily because it is funded entirely by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, which has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners.\n\nWhen the announcement was made, PGA Tour golfers voiced their displeasure on Twitter with how they found out about the deal, with many saying that they found out through social media. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJack Nicklaus says PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger 'good for the game of golf'\n\nJack Nicklaus is thankful the infighting is coming to a close.\n\nNicklaus, who said he was offered but turned down $100 million to be the CEO of the LIV Golf series and said LIV Golf \"wasn't for me,\" reacted to the stunning news that the PGA Tour and LIV Golf will merge.\n\n“The last three years have been difficult for the game and the players,\" said Nicklaus, who lives in North Palm Beach. \"I spoke with PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan this morning. He seemed pleased with the arrangement that will once again bring together the best players in the world. I agree that this is good for the game of golf.\"\n\nThis came just one week after Nicklaus spoke ahead of the Memorial Tournament about the LIV players who had decided to split off from the PGA Tour.\n\n“I don’t even consider those guys part of the game anymore,\" he said then. \"I don’t mean that in a nasty way. This is a PGA Tour event, and we have the best field we can possibly have for a PGA Tour event for those who are eligible to be here. The other guys made a choice of what they did and where they’ve gone and we don’t even talk about it.\" — Tom D'Angelo, Palm Beach Post\n\nAugusta National, Royal and Ancient weigh in on merger\n\nFred Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, which is the home of the Masters, said the club is \"encouraged\" by the PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger, and said it \"represents a positive development in bringing harmony to men’s professional golf.\"\n\nRidley added that August and the Masters are \"devoted to developing the game and celebrating its many virtues.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Martin Slumbers, the CEO of R&A, said the club was \"pleased that an agreement has been reached which will help men’s professional golf move forward in a collaborative, constructive and innovative fashion. ...\n\n\"We care deeply about golf’s future and are committed to ensuring that the sport continues to thrive for many years to come,\" Slumbers continued. \"This agreement represents a hugs step toward achieving that goal for golf and we look forward to working with the new entity for the benefit of the sport globally.\" — Casey Moore\n\nOPINION: PGA Tour sold out to LIV Golf and the Saudis. Pro golf will never be the same.\n\nFrauds, all of them. But frauds now united in the only thing that actually matters to the world of professional golf: Making money.\n\nIn the end, it didn’t actually matter to PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan that the money came from a country, Saudi Arabia, that treats human rights like an inconvenience. The tradition and history of the PGA Tour, in fact, didn’t matter all that much to those who argued that LIV Golf was an unworthy, unserious rival whose guaranteed money and 54-hole events were mocking competition.\n\nAnd as for the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Greg Norman, they did not, in fact, care all that much about growing the game. They wanted to own it. Now they do: The PGA Tour, brought to you by Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.\n\nThey sold out. Professional golf will never be the same.\n\nRead the rest of Dan Wolken's column here.\n\nJay Monahan, Yasir Al-Rumayyan discuss PGA Tour and LIV Golf merger on CNBC\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan sat down for a joint interview on CNBC on Tuesday morning to discuss the merger news that rocked the golf world.\n\nMonahan called it a historic day.\n\n\"There’s been a lot of tension in our sport over the last couple of years,\" Monahan said, \"but what we’re talking about today is coming together to unify the game of golf and to do so under one umbrella.\"\n\nConversations began in London over golf and lunch, said Al-Rumayyan, who noted that had the two tours met two or three years ago for those same discussions, the impact on the game would not have been as significant.\n\n\"Because it would be something small,\" he continued. \"But the way we’re doing our partnership, it’s going to be really big, in many senses.\"\n\nAl-Rumayyan said the PIF is committed to investing \"whatever it takes\" to ensure success, later noting that they wouldn’t be doing this if they didn’t think it would be profitable.\n\n\"If you look at the size of golf, monetary-wise, it’s about $100 billion today,\" said Al-Rumayyan. \"And I think the growth, it’s there. I think working together we can have a faster growth rate than it was for the past 10 or 20 years.\" — Casey Moore\n\nPGA Tour will retain oversight over tour\n\nAs part of the agreement, PGA Tour Inc. will remain in place as a 501(c)(6) tax-exempt organization, which means it will continue to have oversight over its tour. During an interview with CNBC, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan offered more insight into the breakdown and Public Investment Fund Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan confirmed that PIF is prepared to invest billions.\n\n\"The c6 still stays in place and out of the c6 we’ll continue to operate our tours,\" Monahan said. \"We’ll put our player retirement plans and assets there. So that stays in place. One of the things that’s important to both of us is every single week we’re playing tournaments, we’re making a huge impact on the communities where we’re invited guests. That continues.\n\n\"At the c6 level — you take the assets of the PGA Tour, the PIF assets, and LIV and the Asian Tour and the DP World Tour, take all of those commercial assets and drop them down into that for-profit LLC … we’re going to go through an evaluation of all of the businesses and the PIF will invest … there will be additional investment and growth initiatives. That’s what’s really exciting here.\" — Casey Moore\n\nWhat has former U.S. President Donald Trump said about LIV Golf?\n\nDuring a pro-am event at his Trump National Golf Club May 25, Trump praised LIV Golf and defended his business relationship with the controversial Saudi-funded tour.\n\n\"They've been great for golf. The Saudis have been fantastic for golf,” Trump said then. “And they're going to make it a big part of, inside their country, they're going to do some great courses.\"\n\nLIV Golf also has upcoming stops scheduled at Trump courses in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Miami, Florida, later this year.\n\nAfter the news Tuesday, Trump celebrated the merger on his Truth Social platform, according to CNBC. “Great news from LIV Golf. A big, beautiful, and glamorous deal for the wonderful world of golf. Congrats to all!!!”\n\nIs the PGA Tour a nonprofit?\n\nWhile the merger announced the creation of \"a new, collectively owned, for-profit entity,\" the PGA Tour is retaining its position as \"a 501(c)(6) tax exempt organization.\"\n\nThe difference with the merger, however, is that — in the threat of continued disruption in men's professional golf — the PGA Tour reversed course and is aligning with the massive influx of Saudi capital.\n\nIn an interview on CBS in June 2022, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan ripped the LIV tour over links between the Saudi government and the terrorist attacks on 9/11. In the interview, Monahan spoke about players who joined LIV Golf needing to apologize to the families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11 and asked: \"Have you ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour?\"\n\nWhat is LIV Golf?\n\nThe LIV Golf Invitational Series made its debut in June 2022 after the tour lured some notable players from the PGA Tour such as Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Others like Brooks Koepka, the winner of the most recent PGA Championship, Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Smith have since joined. The LIV tour presented a disruption in the dynamics of the sport.\n\nThe format of play of the tour also presented a shakeup to the PGA Tour.\n\nEvents were designed as 54-hole, three-round, no-cut competitions. LIV Golf incorporated shotgun starts to expedite play. Players were split into four-person teams. Purses were divided between individual placement and team placement, offering players more financial incentives to participate.\n\nWhat has Phil Mickelson said about the PGA Tour merger with LIV Golf?\n\nThough he has not made public comments yet, Mickelson, one of the most high-profile players on the LIV tour, posted a message on Twitter to celebrate the news of the merger.\n\n\"Awesome day today 😊,\" he wrote.\n\nWhy is LIV Golf so controversial?\n\nThe LIV tour drew criticism because it is funded entirely by the PIF, the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. And members of the royal family and Saudi government were accused of involvement in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist.\n\nWhat has been Tiger Woods' stance on LIV Golf?\n\nIn May 2022, Tiger Woods reaffirmed his commitment to the PGA Tour.\n\n\"Phil has said some things that I think a lot of us who are committed to the Tour and committed to the legacy of the Tour have pushed back against, and he's taken some personal time, and we all understand that,\" Woods said ahead of the 2022 PGA Championship. \"Some of his views on how the Tour could be run, should be run, been a lot of disagreement there. Obviously we're going to have difference of opinions, how he sees the Tour, and we'll go from there.\"\n\nLIV Golf CEO Greg Norman confirmed in August 2022 that the league offered Woods in the neighborhood of $700 million to $800 million to join the Saudi-backed tour.\n\nWhat have other notable PGA Tour golfers said about LIV Golf?\n\nA number of players who declined to join LIV Golf, such as Rory McIlroy, had been publicly outspoken in their criticism of the Saudi-backed tour.\n\n“There’s no room in the golf world for LIV Golf,” McIlroy said in July 2022. “I don’t agree with what LIV is doing. If LIV went away tomorrow, I’d be super happy.”\n\nWhat is the timeline of how LIV Golf got started?\n\nLIV Golf first teed off last June after rattling the golf world with the news that it would offer players larger purses backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. The inaugural tournament was held in London and then the tour traveled to its first stateside event in Portland.\n\nDustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Sergio García were among the leading PGA Tour players to leave for LIV. The PGA suspended the players for participating in the new series.\n\nLIV Golf was met with much criticism from Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods and others for accepting support from a country with a history of human rights violations and for breaking tradition.\n\nAt the end of the first LIV Golf season, Johnson was crowned the champion, earning a prize of $18 million.\n\nIn January, LIV Golf signed a broadcast deal with CW Network to air 14 events of the 2023 season.\n\nA month later, the PGA invited LIV golfers to participate in the Masters.

He was invited to the Spanish club’s academy as an 11-year-old, had posters of Real’s Cristiano Ronaldo on the walls of his childhood bedroom, and had said he wanted to join the now 14-time European Cup winners last year.\n\nMbappé scored a goal at the Bernabéu Stadium in PSG's 3-2 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinal this year. Angel Martinez/Getty Images\n\nThe Spanish giants submitted a $188 million bid for Mbappé in August. The deal was close to being struck, and the striker even admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG.\n\n“I was honest. I gave a feeling, I gave what I have in my heart,” Mbappé told CNN’s Becky Anderson in December.\n\nSo, when the Frenchman extended his contract with PSG instead of signing with Los Merengues, it was a shock – to say the least.\n\n“It was the hardest decision of my life,” Mbappé told CNN’s Amanda Davies on May 23. “I wanted to make the best decision … and that takes time … but I think I made the right decision.”\n\n‘The project is to win always’\n\nMbappé explained his decision to stay in Paris by repeatedly referencing the “project” being built at PSG.\n\nDespite drawing upon seemingly limitless reserves of money, PSG has so far failed to win a Champions League title, and has an unfortunate knack of imploding in the knockout stages.\n\nNow, it appears the club is altering its approach.\n\n“If I change all the things I want to change in the club,” said Mbappé before pausing and recalibrating. “If the club grows up with me, if I can write the history of the club collectively with the Champions League or individually too, I will be happy with this contract.\n\n“When they showed me this project, I was like, okay it’s interesting. And I want to try. I want to try again,” he said.\n\nMbappé was a crucial part of the French World Cup winning team, scoring a goal in the final as France beat Croatia 4-2.

I think it’s really important that everybody gets motivated again.”\n\nIn a press conference announcing his contract extension, however, Mbappé denied that his new contract would give him added clout on or off the pitch.\n\n“As for the project here, you don’t need special responsibility to be invested,” he told reporters.\n\n‘Macron gave me good advice’\n\nMbappé was born and raised in Bondy, a suburb of Paris 11 kilometers from the city center and, aside from a two-year spell playing for Monaco, has lived in the French capital his entire life.\n\n“He’s Parisian. He’s French. He loves his country. He loves his club,” Al-Khelaifi told CNN. “So he plays for the club for five years [and] there’s a relationship. There’s love between him, the club, the fans, his country.”\n\nMurals dedicated to him are scattered around his former neighborhood where he has become a hero for young footballers there.\n\nOn the side of one building, a painting depicts a young Mbappé sleeping, dreaming about representing France. “Love your dream and it will love you in return,” a small caption reads.\n\nSince winning the World Cup in 2018, Mbappé has become a French cultural icon. Baptiste Fernandez/Icon Sport/Getty Images\n\nAs the figurehead of the French team, from a banlieue north of Paris, Mbappé’s value reaches beyond just his performances on the pitch, and into the political arena.\n\nSpeaking on the television show Chez Jordan, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo was effusive in her praise for the young striker.\n\n“Above all, I think that beyond football and results, he is so important, so useful to give hope to our young people… That’s why I want him to stay,” she said.\n\nEven the French President Emmanuel Macron intervened to implore the young star to stay at PSG and in France.\n\n“He gave me good advice,” Mbappé said, “but with all the respect I have for him, it was my decision. I took this advice but afterwards I took my decision.”\n\n“I’m staying and I want to give my best toward the history of the club and my country.”\n\nNew money v old money\n\nQatar Sports Investments (QSi) is the the owner of PSG and Al-Khelaifi sits on the board of the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the Qatari state-run sovereign wealth fund.\n\nSince the Qatari group – led by the Emir of Qatar himself – took control of PSG in 2011, the club has spent an estimated $1.5 billion on transfers, won Ligue 1 10 times, even if the Champions League title has proved elusive.\n\nJust six months before Qatar plays host to the World Cup, keeping the likely star of that tournament at the club owned by the Emir has been seen as huge coup.\n\nReal Madrid, according to The New York Times, offered Mbappé a signing bonus of almost $140 million, a net annual salary of more than $26 million and complete control over his image rights.\n\nBacked by vast reserves of state money, PSG countered with a similar signing fee but a far higher annual salary of $65 million, according to Sky Sports.\n\nMbappé, Neymar and Messi are all strikers for PSG. PAUL ELLIS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt signaled a rare occasion on which Real Madrid was unable to match a rival’s financial offer, and a victory for the ‘new money’ clubs bankrolled by the deep pockets of nation-states over the more established ‘legacy’ clubs with sprawling histories behind them.\n\n“What PSG are doing by renewing with Mbappé for a huge amount of money (who knows where and how it’ll be paid) after announcing losses of €700 million in the last few seasons and having a wage burden of €600 million is an INSULT to football. Al-Khelafi is as dangerous as the Super League,” Javier Tebas, president of La Liga, tweeted.\n\nTebas’ tweet echoed the views of his organization who issued an inflammatory statement once it seemed clear that Mbappé would be staying in France.\n\n“La Liga will file a complaint against PSG before UEFA, the French administrative court and fiscal authorities and European Union authorities to continue to defend the economic ecosystem of European football and its sustainability,” the statement read.\n\n“We know we are doing everything legally, everything in the right way,” Al-Khelaifi told CNN. “And we are very happy.

Inter Miami CF’s ownership includes former England’s David Beckham, who has long been one of the world's biggest celebrities. That tends to open doors and draw attention.\n\nBecause of Beckham, the club has been linked to some of the world’s best soccer players and biggest names, guys like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez.\n\nFor Nashville SC, that's just fine.\n\n“I'm quite content with having Miami become a glamour club in our league and for us to operate in the shadows about how we go about our own business,” said Mike Jacobs, Nashville SC’s general manager.\n\nAfter expansion draft picks and subsequent trades, Nashville SC ended Tuesday with six new players, bringing its total to at least 15.\n\nA solid group has so far been assembled, one that appears to fit well together and will be expected to be competitive immediately in MLS. In terms of star power, though, if you don’t follow the sport closely, you probably wouldn’t know most – if any – of these names.\n\nAnd that’s fine. There is nothing wrong with valuing substance over flash.\n\nThe other pro teams in Nashville roll that way, too.\n\nThey’ve yet to win the Stanley Cup, of course, but the Predators have gotten close and are a consistently successful operation in the NHL. The Titans catch criticism for not winning more, but they are in a run of three consecutive winning seasons. That’s not an easy feat in the NFL.\n\nYet when you think about it, who is the face of Nashville sports?\n\nIf it ever was Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota, it’s not now. Since the Predators have traded P.K. Subban, you could maybe say goalie Pekka Rinne or defenseman Roman Josi.\n\nThe biggest sports star in town now might be Titans running back Derrick Henry, as evidenced by the fact that Henry was on hand at Tuesday’s expansion draft event at Ole Red to announce Nashville SC’s second pick. But Nashville as a sports city lacks that singular star.\n\nAnd that void that could present a unique opportunity for Nashville SC. One big-name player addition in the coming weeks and months could make an especially impactful splash before this introductory season.\n\nIn Miami, we’ll see if Beckham can actually lure a European-league megastar to MLS, but it shouldn’t be considered impossible.\n\nMLS is something of a seniors tour for the world’s best. It makes sense that top players, once they’ve won enough trophies and made enough money in Europe, would want to finish their careers in the United States. Awareness in soccer is undoubtedly growing here, but there’s still a good chance an international soccer icon could go to an American grocery store or restaurant and not be noticed, much less swarmed by paparazzi or the public.\n\nBeckham himself once took that route, in fact, exiting Real Madrid to join MLS’ LA Galaxy in 2007. So he can make a case to aging superstars like Messi (32 years old), Ronaldo (34) or Suarez (32).\n\nAnd evidently, he’s trying. The Sun, a British tabloid, has reported as much and just a few days ago listed Inter Miami as a possible landing spot for Ronaldo.\n\n“Beckham knows a marquee player will immediately draw fans to games,” The Sun wrote, “and Ronaldo may opt to make the move to America in his search of more silverware.”\n\nSo what does this have to do with Nashville SC?\n\nNot much.\n\nThat’s not how this club is saying it is going to operate. The focus is winning, Jacobs said, “and if we do that, we’re going to have our own self-made stars on our own team.”\n\nWithout much sizzle, they'll instead be selling the steak.\n\n“Every club is different,” Jacobs said. “We're going to be authentic from the standpoint that we're not going to try to fool our fans with over aged players maybe who are past their prime. For us, we're going to hope to have our fans buy in and appreciate what we're doing, because we're trying to just win.”\n\nReach Gentry Estes at gestes@tennessean.com and on Twitter @Gentry_Estes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/20"}]}

There were no reported shark bites in any of the 26 beaches surveyed between January 2019 and March 2021, according to the Shark Lab.\n\nThe juvenile white sharks mostly grouped together in two locations — in southern Santa Barbara County and central San Diego County — the researchers discovered through roughly 1,500 drone flights over the two years. Adult white sharks are generally solitary animals.\n\nIn those two spots, the juvenile sharks swam near humans on 97% of the days surveyed, the researchers wrote in a paper published Friday. The sharks often swam within 50 yards (45.72 meters) of the wave breaks — closest to surfers and stand-up paddle boarders.\n\n\"Most of the time water users didn't even know the sharks were there, but we could easily see them from the air,\" said Patrick Rex, a Cal State Long Beach graduate student who led the study.\n\nSHARK BITES AROUND THE WORLD:Shark attacks and bites dropped in 2022.

In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists mapped the glacier’s historical retreat, hoping to learn from its past what the glacier will likely do in the future.\n\nThey found that at some point in the past two centuries, the base of the glacier dislodged from the seabed and retreated at a rate of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) per year. That’s twice the rate that scientists have observed in the past decade or so.\n\nThat swift disintegration possibly occurred “as recently as the mid-20th century,” Alastair Graham, the study’s lead author and a marine geophysicist at the University of South Florida, said in a news release.\n\nThe floating ice edge at Thwaites Glacier margin in 2019.

Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier, located in West Antarctica, is one of the widest on Earth and is larger than the state of Florida. But it’s just a faction of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which holds enough ice to raise sea level by up to 16 feet, according to NASA.\n\nAs the climate crisis has accelerated, this region has been closely monitored because of its rapid melting and its capacity for widespread coastal destruction.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier itself has concerned scientists for decades. As early as 1973, researchers questioned whether it was at high risk of collapse. Nearly a decade later, they found that – because the glacier is grounded to a seabed, rather than to dry land – warm ocean currents could melt the glacier from underneath, causing it to destabilize from below.\n\nIt was because of that research that scientists began calling the region around the Thwaites the “weak underbelly of the West Antarctic ice sheet.”\n\nA workboat recovering the Rán autonomous vehicle in one of the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula during the expedition to Thwaites Glacier in 2019. Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nIn the 21st century, researchers began documenting the Thwaites’ rapid retreat in an alarming series of studies.\n\nIn 2001, satellite data showed the grounding line was receding by around 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) per year. In 2020, scientists found evidence that warm water was indeed flowing across the base of the glacier, melting it from underneath.\n\nAnd then in 2021, a study showed the Thwaites Ice Shelf, which helps to stabilize the glacier and hold the ice back from flowing freely into the ocean, could shatter within five years.\n\n“From the satellite data, we’re seeing these big fractures spreading across the ice shelf surface, essentially weakening the fabric of the ice; kind of a bit like a windscreen crack,” Peter Davis, an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN in 2021. “It’s slowly spreading across the ice shelf and eventually it’s going to fracture into lots of different pieces.”\n\nMonday’s findings, which suggest the Thwaites is capable of receding at a much faster pace than recently thought, were documented on a 20-hour mission in extreme conditions that mapped an underwater area the size of Houston, according to a news release.\n\nSee Bill Nye's warning about 'doomsday' glacier 02:30 - Source: CNN\n\nGraham said that this research “was truly a once in a lifetime mission,” but that the team hopes to return soon to gather samples from the seabed so they can determine when the previous rapid retreats occurred.

The drownings happened on the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts, as well as along the Great Lakes.\n\n“People consider the ocean a swimming pool and not a very dynamic, turbulent place,” said Francis Smith, a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. But nothing could be further from the truth, he said. “It’s powerful.”\n\nMore people die from surf zone incidents than any other single weather-related cause except flooding. Between 2014 and 2018, flooding killed 549 people. Currents, high surf and surprise waves killed 510, weather service records show. Nearly two-thirds of them were caught in rip currents.\n\nIn Florida, 102 people have drowned in the surf zone since 2014, including 27 in 2018 and 28 so far in 2019.\n\nThe 2014-2018 deaths, which span the entire United States and its territories, are greater than the combined number of fatalities by lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes over the same five years.\n\nThe count is a minimum, the weather service said, and may not include every death.\n\nBeachgoers face a far greater risk of drowning in a rip current than they do being bitten by a shark, said Stephen Leatherman, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Florida International University.\n\nAnd yet, Leatherman said the death toll “almost seems like a secret to some degree.”\n\n“People see one shark and everybody goes nuts,” he said. But twice as many people are killed by currents and waves in the U.S. than are bitten by sharks.\n\nLeatherman, also known as Dr. Beach for his annual ranking of the nation’s best beaches, calls the ocean’s strong currents “silent killers.”\n\nRECENT VICTIMS\n\nThe National Weather Service posts warnings about dangerous conditions in an effort to prevent such deaths. It did so throughout late September as Hurricane Lorenzo churned the waters from Florida to North Carolina.\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 30, it advised beachgoers in Duck, N.C., that the risk of rip currents was high: “It is recommended that you stay out of the water.”\n\nBut Bill Lapenta did not heed the warning. Rescue personnel pulled NOAA’s director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction from the ocean unresponsive and could not revive him. “Surf conditions and a rip current in the area were likely a factor” in his death, according to a town news release.\n\nLapenta’s death was especially discouraging, Leatherman said.\n\n“Here’s a trained meteorologist, a leader who understands weather and waves, and yet he didn’t recognize them and got swept offshore and drowned,” he said. “If he’s that knowledgeable, what chance does the average person have who doesn’t have that training or background?”\n\nJohn and Suzi Merical know the answer to that question all too well. Their only child, Paige, was pulled out to sea in a rip current on April 19 during a beach trip to Emerald Isle, N.C.\n\nShe had been at the beach just 45 minutes when a stranger used Paige’s phone to call her mother to relay the horrific news. Although Paige was rescued and taken to the hospital, she died a week later from her injuries.\n\nA friend with Paige, Ian Lewis, was also swept away in the current and died.\n\n“It is the greatest nightmare I will ever experience,” said John Merical. “I’ve cried more tears in the last five and a half months than I have in my entire life.”\n\nThe two athletic teenagers were in water below their knees when the rip current knocked them down and pulled them out, he said. Paige, who started swimming at age 2, had been taught if she became trapped in a current to swim parallel to the shore, advice long given to swimmers.\n\nFLIP, FLOAT AND FOLLOW\n\nBut now the Mericals believe their advice was wrong. They are among a growing group of community organizations and researchers working to change the message.\n\nSwimmers should “flip, float and follow,” said Jamie Racklyeft, executive director of the Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium. Flip onto their backs, float with the current and follow the path of least resistance.\n\nRip currents form when water piles up on the shore and rushes to the lowest point to return to the sea. The water finds an existing channel or carves out a channel in the sand beneath the water’s surface, perpendicular to the beach.\n\nMany beachgoers have never heard of a rip current, said Leatherman, who’s working with his son to develop videos with drones and environmentally safe dyes to help people visualize the danger. The currents can be deceptive or hard to see, even for experts.\n\nMany swimmers aren’t strong enough to swim out of a rip current, Leatherman said. Drowning can happen quickly.\n\n“When you panic,” he said, “your brain stops working.”\n\nWhen a swimmer starts swallowing water, it immediately attacks the air sacs in the lungs, said Smith, the University of California scientist and former lifeguard. “Your body just shuts down,” he said. “You don’t get the oxygen you need, especially to your brain.”\n\nSwimmers who can flip over and float give themselves time to control their panic, breathe and make themselves more buoyant by filling their lungs with air. Once they’re calm, they can get themselves to shore or wait for rescue.\n\nThe drownings in North Carolina also have prompted renewed calls for additional lifeguards and other safety measures.\n\nIn Florida, which leads the country in surf zone drownings, only a fraction of the state’s 825 miles of beaches have lifeguards. But Leatherman points to the success of lifeguard programs like the one in Volusia County, Florida, home of Daytona Beach.\n\nOn Oct. 6 the county’s lifeguards rescued eight people from Lorenzo’s rough surf, including two later hospitalized as a precaution.\n\n“We’d like to see lifeguards everywhere,” Leatherman said, “but it’s expensive.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/us/things-more-likely-to-kill-you-than-a-shark/index.html", "title": "Shark attacks are in the news again, but plenty of other phenomena ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAlong both US coasts, Americans this summer have been hearing reports of shark bites and sightings, triggering beach closures and advisories.\n\nIn Long Island, New York, several people were injured in suspected shark attacks this month. To the northeast, a Cape Cod beach was temporarily closed after a white shark sighting. In Northern California, one man was hospitalized in serious condition last month after being bitten by a shark while swimming near Grey Whale Cove State Beach.\n\nBut even as encounters with sharks make headlines this summer, the risk of being attacked by the often misunderstood creatures remains low, and plenty of other phenomena are far more dangerous.\n\nCows and bees kill more people every year than sharks do, according to conservation group Defenders of Wildlife.\n\n“Your chances of being bitten are kind of like your chances of winning the Powerball,” said Marine Biology Professor Christopher Lowe, who is director of the Shark Lab at California State University Long Beach.\n\nIn other words: It’s not likely to happen.\n\nAlso, humans are a far greater danger to sharks than the sea creatures are to us. On average, sharks kill five people per year in unprovoked attacks. Meanwhile, humans kill tens of millions of sharks every year.\n\nThings more likely than a shark to kill or injure you\n\n“You have a much bigger risk driving to the beach, or even getting caught in a rip current than you ever would from being bitten by a shark,” Lowe said.\n\nTo shed light on just how slim the odds of being attacked by a shark are, the Florida Museum of Natural History has a list of phenomena more likely to result in deaths and injuries.\n\nSo before you swear off going into the water on your next beach trip, here’s what to know:\n\nIn Florida, where the majority of US shark attacks happen, people were nearly 21 times more likely to die in a tornado (125 deaths) than a shark bite (six deaths) between 1985 and 2010.\n\nResidents of Florida and five other states with alligators were also more likely to die of a bite from the reptile (18 deaths) than a shark bite (nine).\n\nThere were 15,011 US bicycle fatalities compared to 14 shark fatalities between 1990 and 2009, which means Americans were over a thousand times more likely to die in a biking accident than a shark attack.\n\nLightning strikes killed nearly 76 times more people (1,970 deaths) than sharks (26) did between 1959 and 2010 in the Coastal US.\n\nSince 2004, rip currents were responsible for 45 times more deaths than sharks were.\n\nDogs killed more than five times the number of people (349) than did sharks (65) in the US between 2009 and 2018.\n\nInanimate objects have even killed more people than sharks have. In 1996, toilets injured 43,687 people, ladders injured 138,894 people, and 198,849 people were hurt by nails, screws, tacks, and bolts. In comparison, there were only 13 shark injuries and deaths during the same year.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, there were 441 hunting fatalities, compared to seven shark bite deaths in the US and Canada.\n\nThese numbers aren’t meant to incite fear at the sight of dogs, toilets or ladders, but are instead meant to demonstrate just how uncommon shark attacks are.\n\nHas there been an increase in shark attacks?\n\nEven though the risk of being bitten by a shark remains extremely low, there was an increase in attacks in 2021, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History.\n\nAfter three years of declines, the number of reported shark bites went up in 2021, with a total of 73 unprovoked incidents reported worldwide, according to a January 2022 report by the museum’s International Shark Attack File.\n\nThe incidents included nine deaths globally, including one death in the US. A surfer was killed in a shark attack in California on Christmas Eve last year.\n\nThe numbers are on par with the five-year international average of 72 attacks annually, but represents an increase from the 52 attacks reported in 2020, when Americans hunkered down at home amid COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nIt is common to see annual fluctuations in shark-human interactions, and despite a spike in fatalities in 2021, long-term trends show the number of annual shark bite deaths are decreasing, according to the Shark Attack File.\n\nThe US leads the world in the annual number of documented shark bites, with a total of 47 reported in 2021. Most of those attacks were in Florida, according to data compiled by the museum. Surfers and boarders made up more than half of reported shark bite victims.\n\nLowe said the increase can be attributed to climate change and rising temperatures driving more people to the beach just as shark populations are recovering and possibly swimming closer to shore to feed.\n\n“The country is warmer than it’s ever been. And that’s going to drive more people to the water than ever before, which just simply increases your probability of somebody getting accidentally bit,” the professor explained.\n\nStill, when taking into account just how many people are going into the water, the probability of being attacked by a shark is very low.\n\nWe’re not on their menu\n\nResearchers don’t really know for sure why sharks sometimes bite people. It’s possible they do it because they feel threatened and are just trying to defend themselves, Lowe said.\n\n“The number one thing people have to remember is that it is the shark’s home, and we’re guests in their home, and quite often, we’re not good guests,” the professor added.\n\nIt’s also possible sharks sometimes mistake swimmers and surfers for food. Sharks could see a hand or a foot in the water and mistake it for a small fish. A tiger shark or a white shark could even mistake a human for a seal or sea turtle.\n\nSome attacks are “cases of mistaken identity,” occurring under conditions of poor water visibility, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History.\n\n“People are bitten but rarely consumed, and that tells us that we are not on the shark’s menu,” Lowe said.\n\nSharks just don’t care about us\n\nLowe and his team at Shark Lab have been using drones to study how sharks behave around humans along the California coast.\n\n“After two years of looking at hundreds of hours of footage, basically, our conclusion is that sharks ignore people,” Lowe said.\n\nDrone video from Shark Lab shows sharks peacefully swimming near unsuspecting paddleboarders, at times close enough for the humans to lean down and touch them.\n\n“People have been taught to fear sharks, thinking that if the shark’s nearby it’s going to bite, and we know that is not true,” Lowe said.\n\nStill, shark attacks can happen on rare occasions, so it is good to remember if you ever encounter a one, turn towards it, so it knows you can see it, and slowly back away.\n\n“The ocean is a wild place. It’s not Disneyland, your safety is not guaranteed,” Lowe said.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your next summer beach trip!

Recreational diving is capped at 130 feet for safety reasons, but Rocha dives as far as 500 feet. To do this requires deep concentration, intense technical training and a strong dose of bravery.\n\n“What really makes this research special is that there’s only a handful of scientists in the world doing this,” he says.\n\nRocha usually dives in a group with two scientists and one safety officer. They spend hours preparing the kit, ensuring every piece of equipment is functioning well and that they are equipped to deal with underwater emergencies. The divers must use rebreathers, which recycle the gas exhaled by the diver, and a special breathing gas containing helium that is safe for deep dives.\n\nRocha and a team of divers prepare to explore the twilight zone reefs of the Maldives during a recent expedition. Claudia Rocha © California Academy of Sciences\n\nGetting down takes just 10 to 15 minutes depending on how steep the reef is, says Rocha, but the ascent can take five to six hours to allow the body to decompress.\n\nAll that effort gives him just seven to 10 minutes at maximum depth, where he and his team look for fish, collect DNA samples and record the number of organisms in an area. If they think they have found a new species, they usually catch it and carry it up to the surface in a decompression chamber so they can study the specimen back in the lab.\n\nRelated: Ocean photographer Shawn Heinrichs wants to save the seas\n\nDespite having done it dozens of times, Rocha still feels the pangs of anxiety before each dive. The deeper you go, the darker and colder the water gets, he says. “But when we get there, we know why we’re there. When you see something that nobody has ever seen before … it’s absolutely amazing.”\n\nPlunge into the ocean twilight zone and you'll encounter an array of weird and wonderful species like nothing else found on earth.

No looker, those bumps on its head are mucus-filled cavities. Known for its curious \"rowing\" style motion through the water, relying on its pectoral fins. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Glass squid -- Glass squid are filled with ammonium chloride, a solution lighter than seawater, allowing them to float through the ocean in search of food and mates. Born in the surface ocean, they grow to full size at fourth months and will enter the twilight zone. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Anguilliform leptocephalus -- Leptocephalus are tiny and grown up to become Leptocephalus are tiny and grown up to become glass eels . Despite their size (sometimes less than 5 mm), these skeletal creatures still partake in the nightly vertical migration into shallower waters -- the larger the leptocephalus, the longer the migration. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Barbeled dragonfish -- A fish with a fearsome mouth, the barbeled dragonfish has fangs embedded with nanocrystals that make its bite stronger than a shark, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). Females have a bioluminescent lure dangling from their chin. Grows to up to 20 inches (51 cm). Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanogra Strawberry squid -- Two eyes are better than one -- particularly in the case of the strawberry squid, whose eyes are different sizes. Its larger yellow eye is super-sensitive and picks out prey in waters above, while its smaller blue eye looks below for signs of bioluminescent fauna it will also eat.\n\n\n\nPaul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanogra Slender snipe eel -- The snipe eel has a whole lot of backbone, with 750 vertebrae -- the most of any species on earth according to the WHOI. Their large eyes make up for a lack of bioluminescence when hunting for prey. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Fangtooth -- According to the WHOI the fangtooth has the highest tooth to body ratio of any fish in the ocean. In fact, it's able to catch fish bigger than itself. Sockets in the roof of its mouth prevent the fish's teeth from puncturing its own brain in the process. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanogra Hyperiid Amphipod (Pegohyperia princeps) -- This crustacean is a This crustacean is a parasite to salps and other gelatinous creatures, and grow to just over one centimeter Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanogra Transparent hatchetfish (Sternoptyx diaphana) -- The The hatchetfish has evolved so that it has pale blue lights on its underside, camouflaging it against the surface from any predators loitering below.

It has a slit-like mouth from which feathery antennae extend, which the ostracod uses to swim, feed and sense its surroundings. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Copepods -- This crustacean's rowing-like movement lends it its name -- copepod means \"oar-feet\" in Latin. It migrates up and down in the ocean by adjusting the density of fats in its body, staying low and out of predators' paths during the day.\n\nPaul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Bristlemouth -- There may be as many as a quadrillion (1,000 trillion) of these small fish in the ocean, making it the most abundant vertebrate on Earth. Bristlemouths do not take part in the nightly migration to the surface ocean. A clue as to why might be their swim bladders: while those creatures that make the migration have swim-bladders filled with air, the bristlemouth's is filled with fat.

But Rocha proved this wrong: “One of our first discoveries is that those deeper reefs are really not a refuge for shallow reef organisms. They are almost as impacted as the shallow reefs are,” he says.\n\nHe has found plastic trash and fishing gear in some of the deepest reefs and has observed the impact of overfishing and climate change. While there is not yet enough data to determine the scale of the damage compared to shallow reefs, he says it is clear that water temperatures are warming in the deeper zones too and causing reefs to bleach.\n\nThis year, Luiz Rocha identified the Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa or rose-veiled fairy wrasse. Yi-Kai Tea\n\nRocha hopes that his research can help to educate people about the twilight zone and inspire action to protect it. He works with policymakers, making the case for marine protected areas where these deep reefs lie. In 2019, the Hope for Reefs initiative was involved in the protection of a coral reef habitat on Maricaban Island in the Philippines, and the year before their research informed the establishment of two protected areas in Brazil.\n\nRelated: A shark ‘superhighway’ is being protected by fishermen\n\nRocha also works closely with local communities, collaborating with local researchers and giving local names to newly discovered species. For instance, earlier this year he and Maldivian biologist Ahmed Najeeb discovered a rainbow-colored fish which they named Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa or rose-veiled fairy wrasse, after the national flower of the Maldives, a pink rose called Finifenmaa. Rocha hopes this will “give ownership to the local people.”\n\nAhmed Najeeb (left) and Luiz Rocha inspect fish specimens during a recent expedition in the Maldives. Claudia Rocha / California Academy of Sciences\n\nRocha believes that technology will soon advance to a point that gives many more people access to the twilight zone and even more species will be discovered. But his main goal is that when they do, the ecosystems will look the same as they do now.\n\n“I don’t think it’s enough just to do the science,” he says. “We take many, many photographs … and we bring those stories back up to the surface and we share it with as many people as possible.”\n\n“For the most part, when people realize that those reefs are there, they move towards protecting them,” he adds.", "authors": ["Written Nell Lewis", "Video Hazel Pfeifer"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/weather/california-megaflood-study/index.html", "title": "Climate change could make parts of drought-prone California a \"vast ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMany Californians fear the “Big One,” but it might not be what you think.\n\nIt’s not an earthquake. And it isn’t the mega drought. It’s actually the exact opposite.\n\nA megaflood.\n\nA new study by Science Advances shows climate change has already doubled the chances of a disastrous flood happening in California in the next four decades. And experts say it would be unlike anything anyone alive today has ever experienced.\n\nCNN reporter shows impact drought has had on California river 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA and a researcher involved in the study, describes a megaflood as, “a very severe flood event across a broad region that has the potential to bring catastrophic impacts to society in the areas affected.” He said a megaflood is similar to the 1,000-year flash flood events seen this summer in the St. Louis area and Kentucky, but across a much wider area, such as the entire state of California.\n\nThese massive floods, which experts say would turn California’s lowlands into a “vast inland sea,” might have previously happened once in a lifetime in the state. But experts say climate change is increasing the likelihood of these catastrophic disasters, causing them to occur more like every 25 to 50 years.\n\nClimate change supercharges heavy rain events, making flash floods occur more regularly, as has been noted several times this summer in Eastern Kentucky, St. Louis, and even in California’s Death Valley National Park.\n\nCalifornia is prone to these floods from atmospheric rivers naturally, and major floods from them have happened before – but climate change is upping the ante, and millions of people could be impacted.\n\nThe study said atmospheric rivers could become consecutive for weeks on end, like seen in this animation. Xingying Huang, one of the authors of the study, made this loop, which illustrates the water vapor transportation and potential precipitation accumulation at selected time slices during the 30-day scenario.\n\nThe area with the most destruction would be the Central Valley of California, including Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield, the study’s authors project. The Central Valley, roughly the size of Vermont and Massachusetts combined, produces a quarter of the nation’s food supply, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nA flood with the size to fill this valley has the potential to be the most expensive geophysical disaster to date, costing upwards of $1 trillion in losses and devastating the state’s lowland areas, including Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the study.\n\nThat would be more 5 times the cost of Hurricane Katrina, the current costliest disaster in US history.\n\n“Such a flood event in modern California would likely exceed the damages from a large magnitude earthquake by a considerable margin,” the study showed.\n\nIn this photo provided by the National Park Service, Mud Canyon Road is closed due to flash flooding in Death Valley, California. National Park Service/AP\n\nThis study is the first phase of a three-part series studying the effects of a future megaflood event in California. The next two phases are expected to be released in two to three years.\n\n“Ultimately, one of our goals is not just to understand these events scientifically, but it’s also to help California prepare for them,” Swain said. “It’s a question of when rather than if (the megaflood) occurs.”\n\nIt’s happened before. It will happen again, but worse, warns scientists\n\nOver 150 years ago, a strong series of atmospheric rivers drenched the Golden State, causing one of the most exceptional floods in history following a dry spell that had left the West parched for decades.\n\nCommunities were demolished in minutes.\n\nThis 1861 photograph shows flooding in Sacramento. Sacramento Public Library\n\nIt was the winter of 1861-1862 and a historic megaflood transformed the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys into a “temporary but vast inland sea,” according to the study. Some areas had up to 30 feet of water for weeks, obliterating infrastructure, farmland, and towns.\n\nSacramento, the new state capital at the time, was under ten feet of debris-filled water for months.\n\nThe catastrophe began in December 1861, when nearly 15 feet of snow fell in the Sierra Nevada. Repetitive atmospheric rivers dropped warm rain for 43 days thereafter, dumping water down the mountainous slopes and into the valleys.\n\nFour thousand people lost their lives, one-third of the state’s property was destroyed, a quarter of California’s cattle population drowned or starved, and one in eight homes were a complete loss by floodwaters.\n\nIn addition, one-fourth of California’s economy was obliterated, resulting in a state-wide bankruptcy.\n\nSwain warns a megaflood like this will happen again, but worse and more frequent.\n\nDowntown Sacramento today, which was raised 10-15 feet after the historic floods. Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\n“We find that climate change has already increased the risk of a (1862) megaflood scenario in California, but that future climate warming will likely bring about even sharper risk increases,” the study warns.\n\nMany of today’s major cities with millions of residents are built directly on top of the ancient flood deposits, Swain added, putting far more people in harm’s way.\n\nAbout 500,000 people lived in California in 1862. Now, the state’s population is over 39 million.\n\n“When this (flood) occurs again, the consequences would be wildly different than they were back in the 1860s,” Swain said.\n\nClimate change increases the amount of rain the atmosphere can hold and causes more water in the air to fall as rain, which can lead to immediate flooding. Both are and will continue to occur in California.\n\nThe new study shows a rapid increase in the likelihood of week-long, recurring strong-to-extreme atmospheric rivers during the cool season. An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region of heavy moisture in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. They usually bring beneficial rainfall to drought-prone regions like California but could quickly become hazardous with a warming climate.\n\nHistorically these winter atmospheric rivers dump feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada, but as climate warms, more of the snow will fall as rain. Instead of melting slowly over time, it all runs off, piles up, and floods immediately.\n\nCalifornia's Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of the nation's food, will be ravaged by a megaflood. Citizen of the Planet/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nWith a neighbor like the Pacific Ocean, California has “an infinite reservoir of water vapor offshore,” Swain added.\n\nCalifornia’s mountainous terrain and wildfire risk make it especially vulnerable to flooding. Lingering burn scars from wildfires can create a steep, slick surface for water and debris to flow off. With wildfires becoming larger and burning more area thanks to climate change, more areas are susceptible to these debris flows.\n\nAlthough models show this megaflood is inevitable, experts say there are ways to mitigate excessive loss.\n\n“I think the extent of (megaflood) losses can be significantly reduced by doing certain sorts of things to revamp our flood management and our water management systems and our disaster preparedness,” Swain said.\n\nHuang, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a researcher involved in the study, said everyone can make a small effort in combating climate change.\n\n“If we work together to decrease future emissions, we can also reduce the risk of extreme events,” Huang said.", "authors": ["Payton Major Judson Jones", "Payton Major", "Judson Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/health/melatonin-overuse-wellness/index.html", "title": "Using melatonin for sleep is on the rise, study says, despite potential ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nMore and more adults are taking over-the-counter melatonin to get to sleep, and some may be using it at dangerously high levels, a study has found.\n\nThe overall use among the US adult population is still “relatively low,” but the study does “document a significant many-fold increase in melatonin use in the past few years,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA, found that by 2018 Americans were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than a decade earlier.\n\nMelatonin has been linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mild anxiety, depression and tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure. It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short-term use for people with jet lag, shift workers and those who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“In an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use — every night or most nights — of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,” Robbins said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid — over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications — was responsible for the findings.\n\nMelatonin’s side effects\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the dosage of 5 milligrams a day typically used as a short-term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to ensure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they did a decade ago, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n“Previous research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from — 83% to +478% of the labeled content,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, “a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\n“We cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,” Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIs it bad to take melatonin every night?\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body’s sleep cycles.\n\n“There is a view that if it’s natural, then it can’t hurt,” Robbins told CNN in an earlier interview on the impact of melatonin on children. “The truth is, we just really don’t know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.”\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly — taking it at least two hours before bed — but the actual benefit is small.\n\n“When adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,” Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN in 2021.\n\n“So for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don’t drink any caffeinated products at all,” Breuner said.\n\n“These are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?”\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body’s normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n“Any LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,” said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That’s fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n“Digital light will suppress the circadian drive,” Polotsky said, while a “dim reading light will not.”\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we’re a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use “short term,” Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAs Antarctica’s emperor penguins are increasingly threatened by the climate crisis, the flightless seabirds will receive new protections under the Endangered Species Act, or ESA.\n\nWith global warming melting the sea ice the penguins depend on for their survival, the US Fish and Wildlife Service now categorizes the species as threatened. The federal agency lists “imperiled species as endangered or threatened regardless of their country of origin.”\n\nThe Tuesday announcement came more than a year after an initial proposal by the service to protect emperor penguins under the ESA.\n\nEmperor penguins rely on sea ice to form their breeding colonies, avoid predators in the ocean and forage for food. But as Earth’s temperature rises in relation to greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions, sea ice is at risk of disappearing.\n\nEmperor penguins are the largest and heaviest in the world. Bernard Breton/Adobe Stock\n\nWhen sea ice melts or breaks apart earlier in the season than expected due to global warming, entire penguin colonies can decline or disappear.\n\n“This listing reflects the growing extinction crisis and highlights the importance of the ESA and efforts to conserve species before population declines become irreversible,” said Martha Williams, US Fish and Wildlife Service director, in a statement.\n\nParts of the Antarctic Peninsula’s sea ice have melted by more than 60% in 30 years, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. And if emperor penguins suffer and decline, it’s likely that other species within the ecosystem are also at risk due to the climate crisis. Emperor penguins forage for krill, fish and squid in the sea, but they also serve as prey for leopard seals and killer whales.\n\n“Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the (Biden) Administration. The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action,” Williams said.\n\nThere are about 61 emperor penguin breeding colonies along Antarctica’s coastline, which in total consist of between 270,000 to 280,000 breeding pairs (or 625,000 and 650,000 individual penguins, including juveniles), according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The bird population is currently stable, but research has suggested that the emperor penguin’s population will decrease by 26% to 47% by 2050, or drop to 185,000 or 132,500 breeding pairs, according to the service.\n\nEmperor penguins are the tallest and heaviest of the 18 penguin species. They can weigh up to 88 pounds (40 kilograms) and stand 45 inches (1.1 meters) tall. A female emperor lays one egg per breeding season, then passes it over to her male partner to incubate while she forages for food for about a two-month period.\n\nOnce the female bird returns, she shares parenting duties with her partner until their chick leaves the colony about 150 days after birth. The chick is then able to look after itself and set out for open water to forage. But first, the chick must shed its down before growing the waterproof feathers it uses to swim — if it’s still covered in down when the ice breaks, it’ll sink and drown.\n\nProtecting penguins\n\nListing the species as threatened now could help save emperor penguins from becoming endangered or extinct in the future.\n\nAntarctica's emperor penguin colonies could suffer if greenhouse gas emissions go unchecked. John Conrad/Corbis Documentary RF/Getty Images\n\nThe Endangered Species Act is “the world’s strongest environmental law focused on preventing extinction and facilitating recovery of imperiled species,” according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The polar bear was the first species listed as threatened due to climate change under the Endangered Species Act in 2008. Since then, many of the world’s polar bear populations have stabilized, but they remain vulnerable as the climate crisis continues.\n\nThe listing can help establish strategies to increase the resilience of threatened species and reduce threats to their existence. For emperor penguins, this means international cooperation on conservation practices, increased funding for conservation efforts and likely more research into the species.\n\n“Listing emperor penguins as a threatened species is an important step for raising awareness about the impact of climate change,” said Stephanie Jenouvrier, associate scientist and seabird ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in a statement.\n\n“Emperor penguins, like many species on earth, face a very uncertain future, which is dependent on people working together to reduce carbon pollution. We should draw inspiration from the penguins themselves; only together can penguins brave the harshest climate on Earth, and only together can we face a difficult climate future.”\n\nA sentinel species\n\nEmperor penguins are an ideal species to study in a fluctuating ecosystem because their population numbers and behavior can indicate if something is wrong. By studying the birds, Dan Zitterbart, an associate scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and his team can learn about the impacts of the climate crisis in Antarctica.\n\n“Emperor penguins are a sentinel species that highlight the vulnerability of ice-dependent species in a rapidly warming world,” said Zitterbart. “Although they live far from human activity, the far-reaching effects of climate change present the most substantial threat facing the species’ survival.”\n\nSince 2017, Zitterbart and other researchers have been tagging 300 penguin chicks per year with a system similar to the way dogs and cats are microchipped. The initiative is part of the MARE project, which aims to measure the health of the Antarctic marine ecosystems through long-term monitoring of emperor penguin populations over the next 30 years.\n\nThe ECHO rover (right) slowly travels back after surveying the Atka Bay emperor penguin colony in Antarctica.

Microchipping the penguins allows the team to determine where the penguins go when they dive off the sea ice into the ocean and understand their foraging strategies. This insight can help determine the size of marine protected areas.\n\nIf greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current rates, leading to warming temperatures and melting Antarctic sea ice, 98% of the emperor penguin population could all but disappear by 2100, according to a study published last year in the journal Global Change Biology.\n\n“The world needs to take aggressive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now, and the Paris Climate Agreement objectives must be met, to help prevent further population declines,” Jenouvrier said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/us/mauna-loa-eruption-volcano-chasers-risk/index.html", "title": "Mauna Loa: As scientists in Hawaii carefully monitor the risks of the ...", "text": "Mauna Loa, Hawaii CNN —\n\nSince Hawaii’s Mauna Loa began erupting last week, photographer CJ Kale has sacrificed hours of sleep, rising before dawn to catch the volcano against the sunrise and working late into the night to capture its magnificent glow.\n\nFor years, Kale has been going to extraordinary lengths to photograph volcanic events, including swimming just feet from flowing lava as it cascaded into the ocean.

We push a little far, yeah, but I wouldn’t recommend pushing it far for everybody.”\n\nIn a photograph by Kale, lava can be seen flowing from Mauna Loa on November 29.

For those who try to venture close to the lava flow, however, the situation can be unpredictable.\n\nAs the slow-moving flow is advancing, its edges can cool into a rough, spiny surface which may seem secure, but its core still contains molten lava, Cheryl Gansecki, a geologist at the University of Hawai’i at Hilo who is studying the eruption, told CNN.\n\n“It might just look like a big wall of hot rock and it doesn’t look like it’s moving much, but they can surge where all of a sudden the front breaks off and lava comes spewing out.”\n\nDue to the eruption hazards, including dangerous gases and volatile conditions, the Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park has closed the volcano’s summit and high elevation areas, as well as some nearby roads. Visitors are still able to see Mauna Loa – and its erupting sister volcano Kilauea – from several park overlooks and a viewing road that was opened along the Daniel K. Inouye Highway.\n\nPeople gather to observe the eruption of Mauna Loa on December 1. Go Nakamura/Reuters\n\nBut for Sherry and Curtis Grumbles, that’s nowhere near close enough.\n\nThe couple made a round-trip trek of four hours to see the towering head of Mauna Loa’s lava flow. They stood just yards from the crawling tidal wave, they said, describing the sound of bursting lava as like shattering glass.\n\n“You get a feeling of awesomeness, of how much power is coming,” Curtis Grumbles said. “There’s a two-story wall of lava just inching towards you, and you know there’s no way that anything’s going to stop it.”\n\nThe area technically is government property. It’s not only illegal to be there during closures, but dangerous because of unexploded military ordnance.\n\nDespite the known risks, the pair plans to hike the lava field again at night to see the “dramatic glow.”\n\n“You know, you can live caged up and have a pretty boring life or you can go see for yourself and take the chance and enjoy your life,” Sherry Grumbles said.\n\nScientists carefully study eruption’s movement\n\nMeanwhile, researchers with the US Geological Survey are making calculated visits to the eruption site. Clad in flame-resistant clothing, heavy boots and gloves, they carefully gather lava samples that may be key to learning what moves the eruption could take next.\n\nAfter “quenching” the lava samples in water, researchers bag them up and send them to the University of Hawai’i at Hilo where Gansecki and her colleagues are able to quickly extract valuable data that can help the agency model future behavior.\n\n“The composition of the lava can affect things like flow rates, so understanding rapidly what is in the rock can help predict how that flow is going to react in the real world,” said University of Hawai’i anthropologist Peter Mills.\n\nLava fissures flow from the north flank of the Mauna Loa volcano on December 7.

It has been inching closer to the Big Island’s major Daniel K. Inouye Highway for days, though it is still about 1.8 miles from the roadway, the agency said.\n\nCurrently, no homes or businesses are threatened, but island officials and researchers are using the modeling to detect any developments that could cause communities to be at risk.\n\n“We’re kind of the first line of defense,” explained university geologist Steve Lundblad. “We can get information that’s quite good right away.”\n\nResidents of the Big Island have experienced the devastation of volcanic eruptions as recently as 2018, when Kilauea – a much smaller volcano sitting on Mauna Loa’s southeastern flank – erupted for months, destroying more than 700 homes in the Leilani Estates neighborhood and displacing residents.\n\nKale lost property in the 2018 eruption, and his mother has also had a property destroyed. But to Kale and many other residents, the risk is just a fact of life on the Big Island.\n\n“We don’t view it as loss. We view it as borrowed time,” he said. “We have this special time in this moment in this area that’s close to the volcano. And as much time as she gives us, that’s how much time she gives us.”", "authors": ["David Culver Anna-Maja Rappard Elizabeth Wolfe", "David Culver", "Anna-Maja Rappard", "Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/us/common-questions-nuclear-fusion-climate/index.html", "title": "Nuclear fusion: How long until this breakthrough discovery can ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nScientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility have made history by successfully producing a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, a breakthrough hailed by US officials as a “landmark achievement” and a “milestone for the future of clean energy.”\n\nHere’s what you need to know about this new form of nuclear energy that could eventually turn on your lights and help end dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nWhat is nuclear fusion and why does it matter?\n\nNuclear fusion is a man-made process that replicates the same energy that powers the sun. Nuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat.\n\nScientists around the world have been studying nuclear fusion for decades, hoping to recreate it with a new source that provides limitless, carbon-free energy – without the nuclear waste created by current nuclear reactors. Fusion projects mainly use the elements deuterium and tritium – both of which are isotopes of hydrogen.\n\nThe deuterium from a glass of water, with a little tritium added, could power a house for a year. Tritium is rarer and more challenging to obtain, although it can be synthetically made.\n\n“Unlike coal, you only need a small amount of hydrogen, and it is the most abundant thing found in the universe,” Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct and a former chief energy technologist at Lawrence Livermore, told CNN. “Hydrogen is found in water so the stuff that generates this energy is wildly unlimited and it is clean.”\n\nHow is fusion different from nuclear fission?\n\nWhen people think about nuclear energy, cooling towers and mushroom clouds may come to mind. But fusion is entirely different.\n\nWhereas fusion fuses two or more atoms together, fission is the opposite; it is the process of splitting a larger atom into two or more smaller ones. Nuclear fission is the kind of energy that powers nuclear reactors around the world today. Like fusion, the heat created from splitting atoms is also used to generate energy.\n\nNuclear is a zero-emission energy source, according to the Department of Energy. But it produces volatile radioactive waste that must be stored safely and carries safety risks. Nuclear meltdowns, although rare, have occurred throughout history with wide-ranging and deadly results such as at the Fukushima and Chernobyl reactors.\n\nNuclear fusion does not carry the same safety risks, and the materials used to power it have a much shorter half-life than fission.\n\nHow could nuclear fusion power eventually turn the lights on in your house?\n\nThere are two main ways to generate nuclear fusion, but both have the same result. Fusing two atoms creates a tremendous amount of heat, which holds the key to producing energy. That heat can be used to warm water, create steam and turn turbines to generate power – much like how nuclear fission generates energy.\n\nThe big challenge of harnessing fusion energy is sustaining it long enough so that it can power electric grids and heating systems around the globe. The successful US breakthrough is a big deal, but it’s still on a far smaller scale than what’s needed to generate enough energy to run one power plant, never mind tens of thousands of power plants.\n\nThis illustration provided by the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory depicts a target pellet inside a hohlraum capsule with laser beams entering through openings on either end. The beams compress and heat the target to the necessary conditions for nuclear fusion to occur. (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via AP) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via AP\n\n“It’s about what it takes to boil 10 kettles of water,” said Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College in London. “In order to turn that into a power station, we need to make a larger gain in energy – we need it to be substantially more.”\n\nWhy is DOE’s forthcoming announcement about a fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain important?\n\nThis is the first time scientists have ever successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, instead of breaking even as past experiments have done.\n\nWhile there’s many more steps until this can be commercially viable, it’s essential for scientists to show that they can create more energy than they started with. Otherwise, it doesn’t make much sense for it to be developed.\n\n“This is very important because from an energy perspective, it can’t be an energy source if you’re not getting out more energy than you’re putting in,” Friedmann told CNN. “Prior breakthroughs have been important but it’s not the same thing as generating energy that could one day be used on a larger scale.”\n\nWhere does the fusion take place?\n\nSeveral fusion projects are in the US, United Kingdom and Europe. France is home to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, on which thirty-five countries are collaborating – including main members China, the United States, the European Union, Russia, India, Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn the US, much of the work is happening at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, in a building that spans the size of three football fields.\n\nThe west gate entrance to the US Department of Energys Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 12, 2022.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe National Ignition Facility project creates energy from nuclear fusion by what’s known as “thermonuclear inertial fusion.” In practice, US scientists fire pellets that contain hydrogen fuel into an array of nearly 200 lasers, essentially creating a series of extremely fast, repeated explosions at the rate of 50 times per second. The energy collected from the neutrons and alpha particles is extracted as heat.\n\nIn the UK and the ITER project in France, scientists are working with huge donut-shaped machines outfitted with giant magnets called a tokamak to try to generate the same result. After fuel is put into the tokamak, its magnets are turned on and temperatures inside are raised exponentially to create plasma.\n\nPlasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. The neutrons then escape the plasma, hitting a “blanket” lining the walls of the tokamak, and transferring their kinetic energy as heat.\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\nScientists and experts now need to figure out how to produce much more energy from nuclear fusion on a much larger scale.\n\nAt the same time, they need to figure out how to eventually reduce the cost of nuclear fusion so that it can be used commercially.\n\n“At the moment we’re spending a huge amount of time and money for every experiment we do,” said Chittenden. “We need to bring the cost down by a huge factor.”\n\nScientists will also need harvest the energy produced by fusion and transfer it to the power grid as electricity. It will take years – and possibly decades – before fusion can be able to produce unlimited amounts of clean energy, and scientists are on a race against the clock to fight climate change.\n\n“This will not contribute meaningfully to climate abatement in the next 20-30 years,” Friedmann said. “This the difference between lighting a match and building a gas turbine.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen René Marsh", "Ella Nilsen", "René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}]}

Upon arrival, Harry held a Bible in one hand as he was sworn in.\n\nThis is the first of several lawsuits to go to trial. He accuses the publisher of the Daily Mirror of using unlawful techniques on an \"industrial scale\" to get scoops. Harry has made a mission of holding the U.K. press to account for what he sees as its hounding of him and his family.\n\nOn the stand, Harry told Mirror Group attorney Andrew Green that he had \"experienced hostility from the press since I was born.\" The prince accused the tabloids of playing \"a destructive role in my growing up.\"\n\nHere's everything that happened in court.\n\nHarry's lawsuitsFrom phone hacking to aerial photos: What to know about all of Prince Harry's issues with the press\n\nPrince Harry takes the stand, testifies 'every single article' published about his family 'caused me distress'\n\nHarry was forced almost immediately to acknowledge that he couldn't recall specific articles he was complaining about. Green pressed him on how they could have caused such distress if he couldn’t remember having read them at the time.\n\n\"It isn't a specific article; it is all of the articles,\" he said. \"Every single article has caused me distress.\"\n\nGreen asked him to identify what evidence he had of phone hacking in specific articles, and Harry said he'd have to ask that question of the journalist who wrote it. He repeatedly said that the manner in which information had been obtained was highly or incredibly suspicious.\n\nHe said that it was also suspicious that some of the journalists had been known for hacking or invoices to third parties, including private investigators known for snooping, around the time of the articles.\n\nWhen asked how reporters could have hacked his phone for an article about his 12th birthday – a time when he admitted he didn’t have a mobile phone – he suggested they may have hacked the phone of his mother, the late Princess Diana.\n\n\"That's just speculation you’ve come up with now,\" Green suggested.\n\nIn the same article, Green pointed out that a reference to him taking his parents' divorce badly was obvious.\n\n\"Like most children, I think, yes,\" Harry said.\n\nBut the prince said it was not legitimate to report such information and \"the methods in which it was obtained seem incredibly suspicious.\"\n\nGreen then pointed out that his mother previously made public comments to reporters about the difficulties of her children after the divorce.\n\nHarry also told the court he was distraught when he discovered Diana’s private conversations might have been hacked by the Mirror Group. He said he felt “sick” learning of payments by the newspaper to private investigators for information related to Diana.\n\nHe lashed out at TV host Piers Morgan, who was editor of the Daily Mirror from 1995 to 2004.\n\n“The thought of Piers Morgan and his band of journalists earwigging into my mother’s private and sensitive messages … three months prior to her death in Paris, makes me feel physically sick,” Harry wrote. He called it “vile and entirely unjustified behavior.”\n\nPrince Harry accuses tabloids of casting him in a role\n\nIn his witness statement, Harry claimed that during his adolescence and young adulthood, tabloids cast him in a role — “the ‘thicko,’ the ‘cheat,’ the ‘underage drinker,’ the ‘irresponsible drug taker.’”\n\n“I ended up feeling as though I was playing up to a lot of the headlines and stereotypes that they wanted to pin on me, mainly because I thought that, if they are printing this rubbish about me and people were believing it, I may as well ‘do the crime,’ so to speak,” Harry said. “It was a downward spiral, whereby the tabloids would constantly try and coax me, a ‘damaged’ young man, into doing something stupid that would make a good story and sell lots of newspapers.”\n\nHarry alleged that journalists’ behavior damaged his mental health, spurring “bouts of depression and paranoia ... I now realize that my acute paranoia of being constantly under surveillance was not misplaced after all.\"\n\nPrince Harry skips first day in court:What to expect when he testifies in phone-hacking case\n\nPrince Harry says some journalists have 'blood on their typing fingers'\n\nAfter leaving royal life in 2020, citing unbearable media scrutiny and alleged racism toward his wife, Meghan, Harry is on a mission to reform the British media.\n\nHis witness statement ends with a call to arms, calling for press regulation and accusing some journalists of having “blood on their typing fingers.\n\n“They claim to hold public figures to account, but refuse to hold themselves accountable. If they’re supposedly policing society, who on earth is policing them, when even the government is scared of alienating them because position is power? It is incredibly worrying for the entire U.K.,” Harry said.\n\nHe’s no fan of Britain’s Conservative government, either. “Our country is judged globally by the state of our press and our government — both of which I believe are at rock bottom,” he said.\n\nPrince Harry is the first British royal to testify since the 19th century\n\nThe 38-year-old son of King Charles III will be the first British royal since the 19th century to enter a courtroom witness box. He will face cross-examination by a lawyer for the defendant, Mirror Group Newspapers.\n\nHarry's showdown against the publisher of the Daily Mirror kicked off Monday but the royal did not show up in court due to a travel conflict as he was in Los Angeles celebrating his 2-year-old daughter's birthday Sunday. The judge was not happy.\n\n\"I'm a little surprised,\" Justice Timothy Fancourt said, noting he had directed Harry to be in court for the first day of his case.\n\nMirror Group Newspaper’s lawyer, Andrew Green, said he was \"deeply troubled\" by Harry's absence on the trial's opening day.\n\nPrince Harry's memoir 'Spare':His relationship with Prince William, more to know\n\nPrince Harry called British press the 'third party' in all his relationships\n\nSetting out the prince's case in court Monday, his lawyer, David Sherborne, said that from Harry's childhood, British newspapers used hacking and subterfuge to mine snippets of information that could be turned into front-page scoops.\n\nHe said that stories about Harry were big sellers for the newspapers, and around 2,500 articles had covered all facets of his life during the time period of the case – 1996 to 2011 – from injuries at school to experimenting with marijuana and cocaine to ups and downs with girlfriends.\n\n\"Nothing was sacrosanct or out of bounds\" for the tabloids, the lawyer said.\n\nIn a written witness statement published Tuesday, Harry said that he felt \"as though the tabloid press thought that they owned me absolutely.\"\n\n\"I genuinely feel that in every relationship that I’ve ever had – be that with friends, girlfriends, with family or with the army, there's always been a third party involved, namely the tabloid press,\" he said.\n\nHarry said in court documents that the royal family had assiduously avoided the courts to prevent testifying about matters that might be embarrassing.\n\nHis frustration and anger at the press, however, impelled him to buck convention by suing newspaper owners.\n\nThe Daily Mirror case is one of three Harry has brought alleging phone hacking and other invasions of his privacy, dating back to when he was a boy.\n\nTo the point:What actually happened during Prince Harry and Meghan's 'car chase'?\n\nHe described his relationship with the press as \"uneasy\" in court documents, but it runs much deeper than that. The prince blames paparazzi for causing the car crash that killed his mother.\n\nHe also cites harassment and intrusion by the British press and \"vicious, persistent attacks\" on his wife, Duchess Meghan, including racist articles, as the reason the couple left royal life and fled to the U.S. in 2020.\n\nNews that British journalists hacked phones for scoops first emerged in 2006 with the arrest of a private investigator and the royals reporter at the now-defunct News of the World. The two were jailed, and the reporter apologized for hacking phones used by aides of Harry, his older brother, Prince William, and their father.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/05/23/prince-harry-duchess-meghan-lawsuits-explained/70243873007/", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: Their various lawsuits explained", "text": "Prince Harry continues to find himself in court for an ongoing series of lawsuits that he and Duchess Meghan have brought against an intrusive media.\n\nOver the past few years, the couple has filed more than a half-dozen lawsuits in both the U.S. and England against various media entities, who they accuse of not just invading their privacy but also of putting their lives at risk.\n\nHarry has a particular grievance against the press, anchored in part to his contention that paparazzi were to blame for the 1997 death of his mother, Princess Diana, as she tried to flee photographers in Paris. On May 16, the duke and duchess said they experienced their own \"near catastrophic car chase\" in New York.\n\nHarry has five active lawsuits that are directly related to the safety and privacy of his family, which include the couple's two young children, Archie, 4, and Lilibet, 2.\n\nOne is related to reinstating his family's police protection; two others are against separate newspaper companies, Mirror Group Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, accusing them of illegal information gathering; and two suits against Associated Newspapers Ltd. accuse them of libel and illegal information gathering.\n\nHere are more details about Prince Harry's present and past lawsuits.\n\nHere's what to know:What actually happened during Prince Harry and Meghan's 'car chase'?\n\nMore:Security experts challenge details of Harry and Meghan's 'chaotic' chase with paparazzi\n\nPrince Harry is denied the right to pay for his own police protection in England\n\nWhat was it?

The High Court in London is currently hearing a case brought by Harry and other celebrities against Mirror Group Newspapers, owner of British tabloid Daily Mirror. The lawsuit, one of three similar suits filed by Harry against publishers accused of hacking the phones of celebrities, alleges that between 1996 and 2011 the Mirror as well as The Sun and Daily Mail hacked into phone voicemails in order to access private information.\n\nA decade ago, the phone hacking revelation caused a scandal, as British journalists and private eyes intercepted voicemails to snoop on members of the royal family, politicians, athletes, celebrities and even crime victims.\n\nStatus: The trial is underway. Harry is expected to testify on June 6.\n\nIn May, lawyers for the Daily Mirror acknowledged the phone hacking should never have occurred and agreed that some sort of compensation was due to the claimants.

Lawyers noted the payout agreement, which was said to have been authorized by the late Queen Elizabeth II, was aimed at preventing any future litigation from other royals.\n\nLawyers for the news organization deny there was a secret agreement, while Harry claims the arrangement was aimed at compensating members of the royal family without risking potential embarrassment on the witness stand.\n\nPrince Harry's 2 lawsuits against Mail on Sunday owner are ongoing\n\nWhat is it? In February 2022, Harry filed a suit in which he claimed that an article in the Mail on Sunday, sister paper to Daily Mail, both owned by Associated Newspapers Ltd., accused him of trying to mislead the public about a separate legal battle with the government over his police protection, which was stripped away when the couple announced they would no longer be working royals.\n\nStatus: A judge agreed Harry's lawsuit could proceed. On May 23, a judge ultimately ruled against Harry in the paid police protection case.\n\nIn July, a London judge ruled that the article was defamatory, which allows Harry to take another step towards taking the libel claim against Associated Newspapers Ltd. to trial.

The prince blames paparazzi for causing the car crash that killed his mother, the late Princess Diana.\n\nHe also cites harassment and intrusion by the British press and \"vicious, persistent attacks\" on his wife, Meghan, including racist articles, as the reason the couple left royal life and fled to the U.S. in 2020.\n\nNews that British journalists hacked phones for scoops first emerged in 2006 with the arrest of a private investigator and the royals reporter at the now-defunct News of the World. The two were jailed, and the reporter apologized for hacking phones used by aides of Harry, his older brother, Prince William, and their father.\n\nHere's what to know:What actually happened during Prince Harry and Meghan's 'car chase'?\n\nWho is Harry suing?\n\nThe duke is taking on three of Britain's best-known tabloid publishers.\n\nIn addition to Mirror Group Newspapers, he is suing Murdoch's News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and Associated Newspapers Ltd., which owns the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.\n\nThe claims are similar: that journalists and people they employed listened to phone messages and committed other unlawful acts to snoop on Harry and invade his privacy.\n\nWhat's the case against the Mirror Group about?\n\nAt the outset of the proceedings, Mirror Group appeared to fall on its sword, acknowledging instances when its newspapers unlawfully gathered information. It apologized in court papers and said Harry was due compensation.\n\nBut the admission involving Harry − the hiring of a private eye to dig up unspecified dirt for an article about his nightclubbing − wasn't among the nearly 150 articles between 1995 and 2011 for which he claimed Mirror Group reporters used phone hacking and other illegal methods to gather material. The trial is focusing on 33 of those stories.\n\nHarry's lawyer, David Sherborne, said unlawful acts by reporters and editors at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People were \"widespread and habitual\" and carried out on \"an industrial scale.\" He pointed the finger at management, in particular TV personality Piers Morgan, a former Daily Mirror editor.\n\nMorgan has publicly denied involvement in phone hacking, as has Mirror Group in its court submissions.\n\nMirror lawyer Andrew Green said a substantial proportion of the articles at issue involved a \"breathtaking level of triviality\" and that with the exception of a few instances of unlawful information gathering, the company's reporters had used public records and sources to legally obtain information.\n\nThe trial is a test case involving four claimants, including two members of Britain's longest-running soap opera, \"Coronation Street.\" But the verdict could determine the outcome of hacking claims also made against Mirror Group by the estate of the late singer George Michael, former Girls Aloud member Cheryl and former soccer player Ian Wright.\n\nThe case is broken into two parts: a generic case that lasted nearly three weeks in which Harry's lawyer laid out evidence of alleged skullduggery at the newspapers; the second part, starting Monday, with the four claimants testifying about specific acts targeting them.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/03/29/prince-harry-blames-royal-family-delay-london-tabloid-privacy-lawsuit/11564701002/", "title": "Prince Harry blames royal family for delay in tabloid privacy lawsuit", "text": "Brian Melley\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nLONDON — Prince Harry blamed the royal family for a delay in bringing a phone hacking lawsuit against the publisher of The Daily Mail as lawyers for the newspaper argued Wednesday that the case should be thrown out because he didn't file it soon enough.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex said \"the Institution\" – a term he has used in other contexts to refer to the inner workings of Buckingham Palace – had prevented him from learning sooner about the activity of The Daily Mail and related publications by withholding information about phone hacking by other tabloids.\n\n\"The Institution made it clear that we did not need to know anything about phone hacking, and it was made clear to me that the royal family did not sit in the witness box because that could open up a can of worms,\" Harry wrote in a witness statement for his lawsuit.\n\nThe privacy invasion lawsuits by Harry and six other claimants, including Elton John and actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, allege Associated Newspapers Ltd. commissioned the \"breaking and entry into private property\" by hiring private investigators to illegally bug homes and cars and record phone conversations.\n\nThe publisher denies the allegations.

They said they were misled when Associated Newspapers journalists falsely denied phone hacking and other means of gathering information for their articles.\n\nThe famous claimants said they learned of the unlawful activity after a journalist provided them with ledgers showing how much Associated Newspapers paid investigators. Some investigators have also come forward to admit hacking on behalf of The Daily Mail and related publications.\n\nPrince Harry criticized for tell-all, TV interviews.

He blames an overly aggressive press for the 1997 car crash death of his mother, Princess Diana, and has accused reporters and photographers of hounding his wife, Meghan.\n\n\"I have always had an uneasy relationship with the press,\" Harry wrote in his witness statement. \"However, as a member of the Institution, the policy was to 'never complain, never explain.' There was no alternative; I was conditioned to accept it.\"\n\nWhile he said he was aware of some news from the phone hacking scandal, he hadn't realized for years how friends and associates were targeted. His decision to take a more aggressive approach came \"in the wake of vicious persistent attacks on, harassment of and intrusive, sometimes racist articles concerning Meghan,\" he wrote.\n\nBeltrami, however, questioned how closely Harry was paying attention. He noted that the prince's best-selling memoir, \"Spare,\" describes taking a \"keen interest\" in the prosecution of News of the World journalists, which was the basis for the 2012 inquiry.\n\nPhysical attacks, drug use, Diana's death and more bombshells from Prince Harry's 'Spare'\n\nEvidence at a related trial showed they repeatedly hacked Harry's phone.\n\nHarry was \"overjoyed\" at the arrest of an editor and described his \"chipper mood\" at the \"death rattles coming from the most popular Sunday newspaper, (Rupert) Murdoch's News of the World. The leading culprit in the hacking scandal,\" Beltrami wrote in court papers.\n\nIn addition to seeking summary judgment, which would deliver a victory to Associated Newspapers without a trial, the publisher is also seeking to strike much of the evidence on which the claims are based.\n\nBeltrami has argued that the ledgers showing how much private investigators got paid were turned over by Associated Newspapers for the 2012 Leveson inquiry under a confidentiality agreement and therefore could not be used as evidence in court.\n\nAttorney David Sherborne, who represents Harry and the other famous claimants, argued that the documents were presumed to be public unless marked confidential. He said many of the documents had been used for investigative news articles about unlawful reporting practices by Associated Newspapers.\n\nMore:Will Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan attend King Charles III's coronation?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/uk/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-hearing-explainer-update-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Prince Andrew's sexual abuse lawsuit in the US: What to know | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nPrince Andrew is facing the prospect of a trial in a very public civil lawsuit for sexual abuse later this year, after losing his attempt to have Virginia Giuffre’s case against him thrown out.\n\nIt is an unprecedented situation for a senior British royal – the third child (and reportedly the favorite son) of Queen Elizabeth II – and sets up a dramatic series of legal proceedings that will attract attention around the world and could have major ramifications for Buckingham Palace.\n\nGiuffre alleges that she was trafficked by convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and forced to perform sex acts with the royal – claims that Andrew denies.\n\nGiuffre brought her case under the Child Victims Act, a state law enacted in New York in 2019 which expanded the statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases to give survivors more opportunities to seek justice. An attorney for Giuffre told CNN in August that filing the civil case was to show “all perpetrators of abuse should be held accountable.”\n\nShe is seeking damages “in an amount to be determined at trial,” as well as attorneys’ fees and other further relief “as the Court may deem just and proper,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nHis attorneys previously filed a motion to dismiss but that effort failed in early January.\n\nThe prince’s reputation has already been severely tarnished by his relationship with Epstein – and his friendship with Epstein’s former partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in December for her role in facilitating Epstein’s abuse.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the case, and what comes next.\n\nWhat are Giuffre’s claims?\n\nGiuffre, an alleged victim of Epstein, says she was forced to perform sex acts with Andrew. She says she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends – including the prince – at a time when she was underage (17) in the US.\n\nGiuffre says the assaults happened in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands, that Andrew was aware she was a minor at the time, and that she had been trafficked by Epstein.\n\nIn claims made prior to filing her lawsuit, Giuffre alleged that in 2001 Epstein brought her to London, where she was introduced to Prince Andrew and went dancing at a nightclub with Epstein, his then-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell and the prince.\n\nIn a BBC interview broadcast in 2019, Giuffre said she had been taken to the Tramp nightclub where, Giuffre alleged, Andrew asked her to dance and was “sweating all over me.”\n\nIn court filings, Virginia Giuffre's lawyers said she had suffered \"severe and lasting\" damage. Lifetime\n\nAndrew, 61, has consistently denied the claims, telling the BBC in 2019: “It didn’t happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.”\n\nHe claimed in the same interview that he could not sweat, due to a rare medical condition, and that on the night he is alleged to have had sex with Giuffre, he was in fact taking his daughter to a party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, southwest of London.\n\nGiuffre’s lawyers asked Andrew in court filings to provide documents proving both of those claims. But Andrew’s team responded that he was unable to do so, because he has no documents proving a medical condition that prevents sweating, and could not identity anyone he encountered at the pizza restaurant.\n\nWhere do things stand in the court case?\n\nWhen the lawsuit was filed in August, Giuffre’s lawyers said the damage from the alleged incidents was “severe and lasting.”\n\nAndrew’s legal team asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed, saying it violated the terms of a confidential settlement agreement Giuffre made with Epstein in 2009.\n\nThat settlement was unsealed on January 3; it shows that Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000 to drop the case without any admission of liability or fault, and that Giuffre agreed to “remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge” parties and “any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant.” It does not explicitly name Andrew or any others.\n\nAndrew lost that effort on Wednesday; Kaplan ruled that “the 2009 agreement cannot be said to demonstrate, clearly and unambiguously, the parties intended the instrument ‘directly,’ ‘primarily,’ or ‘substantially,’ to benefit Prince Andrew.”\n\nIt was not the first attempt by Andrew’s legal team to have the lawsuit dismissed; in September his lawyers claimed the papers had not been properly served and that the case should be thrown out as a result.\n\nFor many legal experts, the writing was on the wall well before both sides presented their arguments to Judge Kaplan. Georges Lederman, special counsel in the white-collar defense and investigations team at the international law firm Withers, told CNN in mid-January motions to dismiss are “rarely successful.”\n\nHe explained: “All that a plaintiff need demonstrate to defeat the motion is that she has satisfied all of the elements necessary to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. That is a low threshold, and, as Judge Kaplan wrote in his ruling, Giuffre in her complaint has indeed satisfied all of the elements necessary to state a claim for sexual abuse.”\n\nWhat are Andrew’s legal options?\n\nThe beleaguered royal is now locked into a protracted and embarrassing legal battle that will undoubtedly cast a dark shadow over his mother’s platinum jubilee year when she’ll be celebrating her 70 years on the throne.\n\nThe case could now move towards the discovery stage, where both sides could demand disclosure of documents and reports that are needed to establish their claims or defenses, Melissa Murray, professor of law at New York University, told CNN earlier this month.\n\nMurray explained that during discovery “the parties may also be asked to sit for depositions or to provide written answers to interrogatories.”\n\n“Much of the evidence produced during the discovery phase risks becoming part of a public record as the case proceeds to trial,” she added.\n\nNow Andrew has until July 14 to potentially answer questions about the case under oath, following a ruling made by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan last year. The scheduling order signed by the judge in New York means that if lawyers for Giuffre want to question Andrew, they must do so outside of court and submit the interview by that date.\n\nWednesday’s filing appears to suggest Andrew’s intention to fight the case out in court. CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said previously that this could be a risky strategy.\n\n“If he proceeds to trial, now the dirty laundry is aired,” Jackson said on January 12.\n\nThe other option is of course to settle, which is how most civil cases are resolved, according to experts.\n\nWhile it appears the duke hopes to clear his name and, in turn, restore his tarnished reputation, several legal analysts CNN has spoken to suggest an out-of-court settlement is the better option.\n\nWhat is Andrew’s legal defense?\n\nAndrew has denied the allegations against him, telling the BBC in 2019: It didn’t happen.”\n\n“Prince Andrew denies that he was a co-conspirator of Epstein or that Epstein trafficked girls to him,” his attorneys Andrew B. Brettler and Melissa Y. Lerner wrote.\n\nHe also denied he was a “close friend” of Maxwell and denied that he became a “frequent guest” in Epstein’s homes around the world. On other points, the attorneys write that the prince “lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations.”\n\nBut he did admit in the court filing that he met Epstein in 1999; that Epstein and Maxwell attended the prince’s 40th birthday party in 2000; and that Andrew was photographed with Epstein in Central Park and stayed at Epstein’s New York City mansion in 2010.\n\nAndrew’s attorneys have also attempted to shift the narrative, alleging in a blistering court filing in October that Giuffre’s claims are motivated by money. CNN contacted Giuffre’s lawyers in relation to the fresh claims; in their initial filings for the case, her attorneys said Andrew had inflicted “emotional distress” on Giuffre that was “severe and lasting.”\n\nHis legal team previously wrote in a blistering court filing in October that Giuffre’s claims are motivated by money. CNN contacted Giuffre’s lawyers in relation to the claims; in their initial filings for the case, her attorneys said Andrew had inflicted “emotional distress” on Giuffre that was “severe and lasting.”\n\n“Giuffre has initiated this baseless lawsuit against Prince Andrew to achieve another payday at his expense,” Andrew’s lawyers wrote in the documents filed on October 29 – the clearest sign yet that they are planning to go on the offensive as they battle to save the reputation of the Queen’s third child.\n\nThe documents acknowledge that Giuffre “may well be a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein … and nothing can excuse, nor fully capture, the abhorrence and gravity of Epstein’s monstrous behavior against Giuffre, if so.”\n\nBut the papers also seek to paint Giuffre as money-driven and accuse her of “willful recruitment and trafficking of young girls for sexual abuse.”\n\nThey allege that Giuffre “was trained to and did, in fact, recruit other young women into Epstein’s sex trafficking ring,” and has since “milked the publicity for all she could,” a dramatic escalation in the case that hinted at an unsavory round of legal battles ahead.\n\nGiuffre’s attorney David Boies said in a statement Wednesday they looked forward to a trial.\n\n“Prince Andrew’s answer continues his approach of denying any knowledge or information concerning the claims against him, and purporting to blame the victim of the abuse for somehow bringing it on herself,” he said. “We look forward to confronting Prince Andrew with his denials and attempts to blame Ms. Giuffre for her own abuse at his deposition and at trial.”\n\nIn her lawyers’ initial filing, Giuffre said she feared disobeying Epstein, Maxwell and Prince Andrew “due to their powerful connections, wealth and authority.”\n\nWill Andrew have to face questions himself?\n\nAndrew has previously been accused of not cooperating with attempts to interview him as part of the investigation into the alleged sex trafficking ring Epstein and Maxwell are alleged to have operated.\n\nA spokesman for the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York declined to comment.\n\nAs Giuffre’s court case continues, he will likely have to reckon with the mid-July deadline to answer questions under oath.\n\nUntil then, though, he is not scheduled to appear in court and is unlikely to speak to the media about the case.\n\nIf the case goes to trial stage, legal experts suggest the ongoing pandemic will likely prevent him from appearing in person. “Courts are authorized to take testimony by remote means, but doing so in this case will depend much more on the status of the pandemic than any other factor,” said Lederman.\n\nThe prince stepped back from public duties and has kept a relatively low public profile since a much-derided television interview with the BBC’s Newsnight program in November 2019.\n\nWhat does this mean for the royals?\n\nThe long-running allegations facing Andrew have dramatically tarnished his public standing. In their motion to dismiss the case, his lawyers acknowledge his “sullied reputation.”\n\nThe scandal has wider implications for the royal family, which was simultaneously been forced to weather criticism over Andrew’s case and claim of racism from Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex over the past year.\n\nBritish tabloids often refer to the duke as the Queen’s favorite child, so his lengthy association with Epstein and Giuffre’s allegations against him signal a hefty fall from grace.\n\nThe royal family have made moves to distance themselves from the Duke of York as he’s continued to fight the allegations. He has been stripped of his royal titles and is now the only one of his siblings no longer referred to as His (or Her) Royal Highness, Buckingham Palace announced in a remarkable statement two weeks ago.\n\nAnnouncing the Queen’s decision, the palace statement made clear that Andrew will no longer have any royal public duties and will be defending himself as a private citizen in the allegations made by Giuffre.\n\nA royal source told CNN that all Andrew’s titles – his military affiliations and other royal patronages – were returned to the Queen effective immediately and will be redistributed to other members of the family.\n\nAndrew retains his own Duke of York title and he is still a member of the royal family, but, like the Sussexes, he will no longer represent the Queen in an official capacity.\n\nWant more details on the case against Prince Andrew and what the ongoing legal battle could mean for the Windsor clan?

But, she added, “what matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create”.\n\nAssociated Newspapers appealed the High Court’s decision, arguing that Markle had written the letter with the knowledge that it could be leaked and pushed for the case to go to trial. However, the appeal was dismissed, with judges ruling that the Duchess of Sussex had a “reasonable expectation of privacy” in regards to the contents of the letter.\n\nIn 2021, a High Court judge issued a ruling in favour of Markle, saying the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online had violated the Duchess of Sussex’s privacy by publishing excerpts of the private letter. The judge said Markle had a “reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private”.\n\nBack in 2019, Markle sued Associated Newspapers over five articles published in 2019 that reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she had sent to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.\n\nThe number of lawsuits the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have launched against the UK press now total five in the past three years. Here’s what you need to know about each of them.\n\nThe news of Prince Harry’s claim against Associated Newspapers comes weeks after the closure of Meghan Markle’s three-year battle against the same publisher for printing a “personal and private” letter she sent to her father three months after her wedding.\n\nReports suggest his claim related to a Mail on Sunday article published on 20 February with the headline: “Revealed: How Harry tried to keep his legal fight over bodyguards secret.” The story referenced a separate legal battle the prince is having with the Home Office over his family’s private police protection.\n\nCourt documents show the Duke of Sussex launched a libel complaint against Associated Newspapers Limited on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe long-standing battle between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the British media ratcheted up this week, with Prince Harry now taking on the publisher of the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex was awarded a nominal sum of £1, but the publisher also agreed to pay a “confidential sum in damages for copyright infringement” and a “substantial part of Meghan’s legal costs”, said The Guardian.\n\nPrince Harry vs. News Group Newspapers and Reach\n\nThe same week in 2019 that Markle began legal action against Associated Newspapers, the Duke of Sussex launched a legal action against the owners of The Sun, the defunct News of the World and the Daily Mirror.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex’s claim related to alleged phone-hacking dating back to between January 1996 and December 2010, with Prince Harry claiming damages of more than £200,000, according to The Guardian.\n\nCourt papers said the illegal interception of Prince Harry’s voicemail messages by journalists “affected his relationships with friends and family” and impacted his relationship with Chelsy Davy, which ended in 2010.\n\nIn 2021, journalists at Newsweek obtained a court filing by lawyers for News Group Newspapers, the Rupert Murdoch-owned publisher of The Sun and formerly News of the World, which claimed that Prince Harry was “too late to sue” over alleged phone-hacking.\n\n“These [stories] were first published over 6 years prior to the issue of these proceedings and this claim is therefore statute-barred and it is denied that [Prince Harry] is entitled to any relief in relation to it,” the document read.\n\nA spokesperson for News Group Newspapers refused to comment on what it described as “historical allegations… many of which have been firmly rejected in proceedings over a number of years”. Reach, the owner of the Daily Mirror, has not commented on the allegations.\n\nThe Guardian expects this legal dispute to come to court this year, describing it as “another case that would pit one half of the Sussexes against powerful players in the tabloid press”.\n\nPrince Harry vs. the BBC\n\nPrince Harry complained to the BBC over the corporation’s decision to broadcast and publish online an image from a neo-Nazi social media site that called him a “race traitor” and depicted the royal with a gun pointed at his head.\n\nA spokesperson for Prince Harry told The Guardian in September 2019 that the image, first shared in August 2018, had “caused his family great distress specifically while his wife was nearly five months pregnant”.\n\nThe BBC internally and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom rejected the complaint, ruling that the image’s use was clearly in the public interest. But the BBC did apologise for failing to warn the Duke of Sussex ahead of broadcasting and publishing the image.\n\nPrince Harry vs. Associated Newspapers\n\nIn 2020, Prince Harry sued Associated Newspapers for libel over two “almost identical” articles published in the Mail on Sunday and on Mail Online which claimed he had “turned his back” on the Royal Marines after stepping away from frontline royal duties earlier that year.\n\nThe articles, published in October 2020, claimed he had “not been in touch by phone, letter nor email since his last appearance as an honorary Marine” in March, said the BBC.\n\nA remote hearing at the High Court in London on 1 February 2021 accepted the claims were “false”. The Duke of Sussex accepted an apology and “substantial damages” from the publisher. Jenny Afia, his lawyer, said he would donate the money to his Invictus Games Foundation for wounded warriors.\n\n“The baseless, false and defamatory stories published in the Mail on Sunday and on the website Mail Online constituted not only a personal attack upon the Duke’s character but also wrongly brought into question his service to this country,” said Afia.\n\nDuke and Duchess of Sussex vs. the BBC\n\nIn June 2021, the law firm Schillings issued a legal letter to some news broadcasters and publishers on behalf of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, accusing the BBC of “false and defamatory” reporting.\n\nThe accusation related to a June 2021 article by the BBC’s royal correspondent Jonny Dymond, which claimed that the couple had not asked the Queen about naming their daughter Lilibet.\n\nDymond quoted an unnamed Buckingham Palace source who “disputed reports in the wake of the announcement of the name that Prince Harry and Meghan had spoken to the Queen before the birth”.\n\nThe letter said the BBC report was “false and defamatory and should not be repeated”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/uk/royal-news-newsletter-05-06-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Harry and Meghan will be at the Queen's jubilee, but they're not ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the May 6 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family.

Harry and Meghan confirmed moments later that they will attend the festivities, giving the Queen a first chance to meet her granddaughter Lilibet.\n\n“Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are excited and honoured to attend The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this June with their children,” a spokesperson for the couple told CNN.\n\nHours earlier, CNN attended a media briefing at the palace on Friday to hear all the details for the jubilee. The celebrations have been eagerly awaited by royal fans worldwide, but we haven’t had a full picture of how they’ll unfold until now.\n\nHere’s everything we found out about the big day(s).\n\nHarry, Meghan and Prince Andrew won’t be on the balcony.\n\nSeveral members of the royal family will make an appearance on the famous Buckingham Palace balcony during the Trooping the Colour parade, which kicks off the celebration on the morning of Thursday, June 2.\n\nBut only royals carrying out official duties will be included, a royal spokesperson told CNN.\n\nThat means Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex won’t be present. The couple split from the royal family in 2020 and no longer take part in royal duties.\n\nIt also rules out Prince Andrew, who was stripped of royal duties and his HRH title in the wake of his civil sexual assault lawsuit. Andrew settled that suit out of court earlier this year, but his lengthy association with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein has tarnished his reputation and his involvement in the weekend posed awkward questions for organizers.\n\nPrince Andrew attended a memorial service for Prince Philip in March.

The wider family is traditionally invited to church services, like the one set for St. Paul’s Cathedral on the Friday.\n\nThe Queen’s attendance isn’t confirmed.\n\nHer Majesty is “looking forward” to the weekend and plans to take part in the celebrations, but “her presence will not be confirmed until much nearer the time or on the day itself,” a royal source told CNN.\n\nThe 96-year-old monarch has struggled with mobility problems in recent weeks and has been forced to miss several public appearances, including this month’s Buckingham Palace garden parties (more on that later…)\n\nShe’ll continue to play it safe for the jubilee and hasn’t confirmed whether she’ll be present at the various festivities.\n\nIt may be up to her family to represent her again, as they’ve been doing during recent engagements. Not getting a glimpse of the monarch may disappoint some of the fans in attendance, but it’s become a reality that the nonagenarian Queen has slimmed down her schedule.\n\nA party at the palace.\n\nWe already knew that a concert was planned for outside Buckingham Palace, following the jubilee tradition of hosting some big music stars on an impressive stage near the building.\n\nBut now we know what that stage will look like – and it’ll be quite something.\n\nImages of the stage outside Buckingham Palace were released on Friday. BBC Studio Events\n\nThe BBC has released an impression of the staging and it’s also been announced that 22,000 people will be able to attend. That includes 5,000 tickets reserved for key workers.\n\nTen years ago, the Queen watched from a royal box and made an appearance on stage as stars like Paul McCartney, Elton John and Stevie Wonder sang for the monarch.\n\nWe don’t yet know who will be performing this time around, but we’ll keep you updated as we hear.\n\nA flypast, a golden coach ride and a day at the races.\n\nA whole lot more is planned for the four-day weekend. It’s been confirmed that a Royal Air Force flypast will take place while the royals are waving to supporters on the Buckingham Palace balcony, a fitting climax to the Trooping the Colour ceremony.\n\nThen, on Saturday, the racecourse at Epsom will stage the 243rd edition of its famous horse race, the Derby. The Queen, a keen horse breeder herself, has been a regular spectator at the event and has presented the famous trophy in the past.\n\nOn Sunday, streets across the UK will stage their own jubilee lunches. The palace said 60,000 people have registered so far.\n\nAnd back in London, the weekend will be capped with the Platinum Jubilee Pageant on Sunday. It will feature a reappearance of the Gold State Coach, which has been used at major royal events since it was built in 1762.\n\nThe Queen rode in the coach during her jubilees in 1977 and 2002, but this time she won’t be inside – instead, film footage of the monarch during her coronation in 1952 will be played in the windows.\n\nAnd there are more announcements to come between now and June 2. Keep your eyes on Royal News for all the details in the coming weeks.\n\nIN THE ROYAL DIARY\n\nThe Queen won’t attend her traditional summer garden parties at Buckingham Palace this year, another series of events the monarch is skipping as she suffers mobility problems.\n\nThree events will take place in the grounds of the palace on May 11, 18 and 25, with a fourth in late June at Holyroodhouse in Scotland, it was announced on Thursday. Because of the pandemic, this will be the first time the parties have been held since 2019.\n\nThe 96-year-old Queen will be represented at the parties by other members of the family, though the palace hasn’t yet confirmed which royals will attend.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II at a garden party in 2018 Yui Mok/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nElizabeth has been forced to miss a number of events this year, including an Easter service last month.\n\nThe garden parties are a big part of the royal calendar, giving the monarch and her family the chance to meet with thousands of community leaders and celebrate their work.\n\nBut they do require long periods of standing and walking, and these are the kind of events that the Queen has had to skip in the past few months. She also hinted that she was left “exhausted” by Covid after catching the virus in February.\n\nThe Queen could still make it to next week’s state opening of Parliament, a ceremonial event in which the monarch unveils the government’s legislative agenda.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nNetflix drops Meghan’s animated series.\n\nNetflix has dropped Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s planned animated series “Pearl,” PA Media reported. The show was set to be produced in collaboration with Meghan and Prince Harry’s studio, Archewell Productions, but the streaming giant is understood to have dropped it as it cuts costs. According to a press release last year, “Pearl” was set to focus on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl, who is “inspired by a variety of influential women from history.” Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of this year and lost $50 billion in share value last month after those figures were announced. It has other projects from Harry and Meghan still in the pipeline, including a “Heart of Invictus” documentary that tracks participants in the sporting tournament Harry founded.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge took the picture of the birthday girl.

The shot, which shows a smiling Charlotte relaxing in a field of bluebells, was taken by her mother in Norfolk, eastern England last weekend, according to the family. Charlotte is William and Kate’s second child, and fourth in line to the throne – just after her older brother, George, who turns 9 in July.\n\nWilliam urges action on male suicide.\n\nPrince William said society is “not really tackling the problem” of male suicide “as fast as we need to,” PA Media reported. During a visit to London mental health charity James’ Place, William asked workers how they get the message across to men that “some support is necessary.” The prince has long been an advocate for mental health causes. In a 2019 BBC documentary, he said he felt “pain like no other” after his mother, Princess Diana, died. “Particularly in Britain … we are nervous about our emotions. We’re a bit embarrassed at times,” he added.\n\nHow to get help: In the US, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

Rob Munday\n\nThe Queen is one of the most photographed women in history. But rarely in formal photo shoots do we see her smiling, natural and unposed.\n\nWhen Buckingham Palace commissioned holographer Rob Munday to create the first official holographic portrait of Elizabeth in 2004, he snapped more than 8,000 pictures. That sitting produced a famous picture of the Queen, used on banknotes, postage stamps, and on the front cover of Time Magazine.\n\nBut it also included a more spontaneous shot, which sat unnoticed in his personal archives for almost 19 years.\n\nThe image shows a wry smile on the Queen’s face as she reacts to an amusing comment made by her friend and dresser, Angela Kelly, who was rearranging her clothing prior to the shoot.\n\nMunday rediscovered it while under lockdown in France and is now displaying it to the public for the first time.\n\n“I’ve completely forgotten about it. It’s lying on the hard drive for nearly 19 years.” Munday told CNN’s Robert Iddiols at the unveiling on London’s Park Lane. “But as I was thumbing through, right in the middle, there was just this one frame.”\n\nThe image was a happy accident, the result of test shots taken before the real thing.\n\n“My first thought was that it would make a beautiful image to commemorate the Platinum Jubilee,” Munday said.\n\n“I just loved it so much because it’s just a really, really natural portrait. I mean, a lot of people have told me that they’ve never seen a portrait quite like this of the Queen.”\n\nPHOTO OF THE WEEK\n\nAaron Chown/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nGo long!

The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.\"\n\nPrevious lawsuit coverage:Duchess Meghan's lawyers want to settle lawsuit against British newspaper ahead of trial\n\n\"The claimant had a reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private. The Mail articles interfered with that reasonable expectation,\" Warby said in his written ruling. \"Taken as a whole the disclosures were manifestly excessive and hence unlawful. There is no prospect that a different judgment would be reached after a trial.\"\n\nMeghan's lawyers argued that the Mail on Sunday and its publisher, Associated Newspapers, could not defend against her claims that the tabloid invaded her privacy and infringed on her copyright by publishing excerpts of her letter.\n\nShe is seeking damages for her claims, but that issue is still pending. She has said she will donate any money she receives to an anti-bullying charity.\n\nIt was another win for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their ongoing efforts to push back in civil courts against media coverage in Britain and in California (where they now live) that they consider invasive or abusive.\n\nIf the case had gone to trial, there was a strong possibility that Meghan, 39, would have to take the stand to testify, which could have been embarrassing for her and for the royal family, who rarely if ever testify in court.\n\nMoreover, her father, some of her friends and some former members of the Sussex staff in London were expected to be called to testify by the Mail on Sunday.\n\nMeghan issued a statement expressing gratitude to the courts for holding the tabloid \"to account for their illegal and dehumanizing practices.\" She said such tactics are not new and the world needs reliable, fact-checked news.\n\n\"What The Mail on Sunday and its partner publications do is the opposite. We all lose when misinformation sells more than truth, when moral exploitation sells more than decency, and when companies create their business model to profit from people’s pain,\" she said.\n\nMeghan said everyone has won from the result in her case.\n\n\"We now know, and hope it creates legal precedent, that you cannot take somebody’s privacy and exploit it in a privacy case, as the defendant has blatantly done over the past two years,\" she said. “I share this victory with each of you – because we all deserve justice and truth, and we all deserve better.\"\n\nAssociated Newspapers said it was surprised and disappointed by the ruling and is considering whether to appeal, according to the Associated Press.\n\nA lawyer for the tabloid, Antony White, argued in January at a hearing that Meghan had no reasonable expectation of privacy for her letter because “it’s to be inferred that the letter was written and sent by the claimant with a view to it being disclosed to third parties and read by the public.”\n\nMeghan’s lawyer, Justin Rushbrooke, argued that that the publisher had “no real prospect” of winning because “it’s a very straightforward case about the unlawful publication of a private letter” meant as a \"message of peace\" for her father alone.\n\nThe former American actress Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in May 2018 at Windsor Castle, a wedding watched by millions but not attended by her father, Thomas Markle, who said he was hospitalized for heart problems in California.\n\nAfter the wedding, Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, wrote to her father about their estrangement. This letter came to light when anonymous friends of the duchess mentioned it in a People magazine interview, and eventually the Mail obtained a copy from Thomas Markle and published parts of it in several stories in February 2019.\n\nShe filed her lawsuit in October 2019, arguing among other legal issues that publishing the letter without her permission violated long-established copyright law, which holds that the contents of a private letter belong to the writer, not to the recipient.\n\nAs the case moved through the British civil court, Meghan won some rulings and lost others. In May 2020, parts of her lawsuit were deleted in a ruling, leaving her the loser in an opening legal bout but keeping alive her core complaints of copyright and privacy infringement.\n\nThe issue of damages – who pays what to which team of lawyers and how much – will be resolved later.\n\nAlthough a trial is now off, revelations in case documents were eye-opening, including copies of messages between Harry and Thomas Markle prior to the wedding in which Harry urged Markle not to talk to the media. Other documents showed Meghan felt \"unprotected\" by the British monarchy during her pregnancy with baby Archie, born in May 2019.\n\nThe couple announced in January 2020 that they were stepping away from their senior royal roles and moving to North America to pursue more freedom, financial independence and privacy. They now live in Santa Barbara County as budding Hollywood producers, having signed deals with Netflix and Spotify to produce documentary and entertainment content.\n\n'Most epic experience': Harry and Meghan surprise young poets in online poetry workshop", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/11"}]}

She was surprised to see fans in the grandstands Thursday morning to watch first tee shot as a professional. Such is the humble mindset of a champion whose legendary status rose to another dimension on Sunday when she became the first player since Beverly Hanson in 1951 to win on the LPGA in her pro debut.\n\nHello world, indeed.\n\nZhang didn't make a birdie all day but stayed patient throughout a painstakingly long final round at Liberty National to win in a two-hole playoff against Jennifer Kupcho with the most important par of her life.\n\n\"What is happening?\" said Zhang as she held a bouquet of red roses. \"I just can't believe it.\"\n\nThirteen days removed from winning her second NCAA title, celebrating her 20th birthday and announcing her professional plans, Zhang took on the best players in the world and beat them all.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nThe player known as \"Rosie\" by her Stanford family, absolutely dazzled - whether the round came easy or required a persistent grind\n\nGOLF:Teenage phenom expects to turn heads at men's US Open qualifying final\n\nPGA TOURViktor Hovland uses late birdie, playoff to steal victory at Memorial\n\nA 12-time winner at Stanford, two-time USGA champion and the reigning Augusta National Women's Amateur champion, Zhang carried enormous expectations into the week as her accomplishments in the amateur game have been unmatched in the modern era. Zhang considers the expectations of others to be a compliment, and she embraces the challenge, knowing deep down the results don't define her.\n\nIt's a mature-beyond-her-years outlook that should translate into staying power at the top of the game.\n\nZhang's highlight reel for the week included a chip-in birdie on a 29-foot curler on the par-5 13th in her opening round; a tee shot she nearly aced on the drivable par-4 16th on Saturday; and a recovery shot from the rough on Sunday that looked so good she ran to see it.\n\nThe LPGA hadn't seen a more anticipated American pro debut since Michelle Wie West in 2005. Wie West happened to be the tournament host at Mizuho and joined fellow former prodigy Morgan Pressel in the Golf Channel booth Sunday during Zhang's back nine to talk about her sensational debut.\n\n\"I look up to her,\" said Wie West, \"she's just such an amazing player.\"\n\nZhang spent three hours with the media Tuesday and seems poised for whatever comes next.\n\nThe victory gives Zhang immediate LPGA status. She also receives the 500 CME points for the win, a rule that was changed in 2021 after the Sophia Popov uproar.\n\nZhang, who was playing the Mizuho on a sponsor exemption, became the eighth player since 1992 to win their first professional start on the LPGA, joining Hinako Shibuno (2019 AIG Women's Open) and Karrie Webb (1995 Weetabix Women's British Open).\n\nNow that she's an LPGA member, Zhang is also eligible for this year's Solheim Cup in Spain, captained by Stacy Lewis.\n\nZhang's historical debut carried plenty of drama down the stretch. After missing a birdie putt inside 5 feet on the 16th hole that would've given her a two-stroke lead, Zhang faced a 10-foot comebacker for par on the penultimate hole to maintain her advantage.

The Norwegian’s previous wins were in Mexico twice and Puerto Rico.\n\nIt was a crushing loss for McCarthy, one of the purest putters on the PGA Tour. He showed his touch by saving crucial pars and playing bogey-free on a day when the average score was just under 75. His only bogey came on the 18th hole — twice.\n\nRory McIlroy chipped in from below the fourth green for birdie and had the lead on the front nine, but he gave away far too many shots on the back — three bogeys in a row — for a 75 that took him out of the picture.\n\nScottie Scheffler closed with a 67 and finished third and missed the playoff by one shot, remarkable considering he made the cut on the number.

Herron fell back with a 72. Stricker, coming off his second straight major title this year at the Senior PGA Championship, played bogey-free for a 68.

(AP) — Rose Zhang lived up to all the pre-tournament hype as the next great women's golfer — at least in her first week as a pro.\n\nThe two-time NCAA champion became the first player in 72 years to win on the LPGA Tour in her pro debut, capturing the Mizuho Americas Open with a par on the second playoff hole against Jennifer Kupcho on Sunday.\n\nZhang arrived on the LPGA Tour with the most fanfare since Michelle Wie West in 2005, and she delivered in the shadow of the Big Apple.\n\n“I just can’t believe it,” Zhang said. “It was just last week when I won NCAAs with my teammates, and to turn pro and come out here, it’s just been amazing. I’ve enjoyed the journey.”\n\nThe span was actually 13 days.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nThe last female player to win as a pro in her debut was Beverly Hanson, who edged Babe Zaharias to take the Eastern Open in 1951.\n\nThe performance was so impressive it drew the attention of fellow Stanford product Tiger Wood.\n\n“Incredible few weeks for Rose Zhang, defends her NCAA title and then wins in her Pro debut. Go card!” Woods tweeted.\n\nZhang smiled broadly when told, adding she has not had a chance to look at her phone since the tournament ended.\n\n“My reaction says it all,” said Zhang, who said she did not look at a scoreboard until the 16th hole and did not know her position in the field.\n\nIt really never changed. She started in the lead and never lost it.\n\nSouth Korean rookie Hae Ran Ryu (70) was third at 8 under. Aditi Ashok of India, Ayaka Furue of Japan and Eun-Hee Ji of South Korea were at 7 under. Ashkeigh Buhai of South Africa, Leona Maguire of Ireland and Yuka Saso of Japan finished at 6 under, three shot behind the leaders.\n\nZhang shot a 2-over 74 in the final round and squandered a chance to win in regulation when she missed an 8-foot par putt after making at least a half-dozen clutch saves in a gritty final round performance.\n\nThe much-heralded 20-year-old from Stanford made a nearly identical 8-footer on No. 18 at Liberty National on the first playoff hole. Kupcho, who won an NCAA title at Wake Forest in 2018 and had a final round 69, also made a par.\n\nBoth players hit the fairway on No. 18 on the second playoff hole, but Zhang hit her approach from the fairway within 10 feet. Kupcho was short on her approach, her first putt went just over the back edge of the green and the second putt just missed. That left Zhang with two putts for the win.\n\nWhile disappointed to lose, Kupcho was happy with her performance.\n\n“On this grass I’m always the best,” Kupcho said. “We’re starting to hit in this type of grass going forward, so I’m excited to see where the season goes.”\n\nZhang held her face in disbelief after the winning putt fell as players celebrated with her by giving her red roses, similar to when she won the Augusta National Women's Amateur.\n\nZhang, who was playing on a sponsor exemption, did not have a birdie in her final round and finished at 9-under 279.\n\nZhang turned pro last week after the NCAAs and much was expected right away. She was the top-ranked women's amateur for 141 weeks and won every big women’s amateur event — the U.S. Women’s Amateur, the U.S. Junior Girls, the NCAAs and the Augusta National Women’s Amateur.\n\nThe victory was worth $412,500 and it also earned Zhang an automatic LPGA Tour membership, which she accepted — although she is skipping next week's event near Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/lpga/2023/05/26/rose-zhang-turns-pro-lpga-after-record-amateur-career-stanford/70261749007/", "title": "Rose Zhang turns pro, will make LPGA debut after record amateur ...", "text": "Rose Zhang is the winningest player in women's amateur golf history and, after outpacing Tiger Woods in her record-breaking career at Stanford, she will now take her talents to the big leagues.\n\nZhang, 20, announced Friday she will abandon her record 141 weeks as the top-ranked amateur in the world and officially turn pro. She will make her LPGA debut at the Mizuho Americas Open, which tees off Monday at Liberty National Golf Club in New York.\n\n\"Wow… it’s finally happening,\" Zhang, a sophomore, said with a melting face emoji on Instagram. \"The endless love, support and inspiration from so many people brought me to this point of my golf career.\n\n\"From my teammates to my coaches and trainers, to my friends and my family — you have all been integral in my journey, shaping me as a person and player while making sacrifices for my success.

The victory at Grayhawk Golf Club marked her eighth tournament win of the season, tied for the most in NCAA history, and came a month after she won the 2023 Augusta National Women's Amateur, completing the amateur grand slam.\n\n\"It's cliché to say, but I never dreamed of having the opportunity to coach the greatest female amateur of all time,\" Stanford coach Anne Walker said in a statement. \"Rose Zhang has led our team with class both on and off the golf course every day for two years. She's broken every record, won every championship and taken our team to the top of college golf.\n\n\"I'm quite certain I'll never coach anyone quite like Rose again — she's a generational player.

The Stanford sophomore won her second straight NCAA title and then 13 days later was awash in wonder when she won the Mizuho Americas Open in her professional debut.\n\nWomen's golf has not seen this level of anticipation since Michelle Wie West turned pro at age 15 equipped with blue-chip sponsors like Nike and Sony.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nZhang walked, talked and played like it was any other tournament. She is so comfortable with who she is that expectations are not part of the equation.\n\n“I honestly didn’t even expect to make the cut,” she said Sunday evening as she sat next to a trophy stuffed with a bouquet of roses. \"And the reason why I say this is because I don’t think about my expectations a lot. I think about playing the golf course. I think about trying to shoot the best score that I can. The expectation for me winning did not even cross my mind.\n\n“I was just playing my game. I was having a good time out there,” she said. \"This is the game that I love, and I’m so thankful to be a professional doing it now.”\n\nShe became an LPGA Tour member with the win, important because she could not be considered for the Solheim Cup in September otherwise. Now she might as well be penciled in for the American team.\n\nShe earned $412,500, though money is not motivation and doesn't compare to endorsements with the likes of Callaway, Adidas, Delta, Rolex, Beats by Dre.\n\nBesides, Zhang has more pressing issues.\n\nShe made an appearance on NBC's “Today” show on Monday, then it was back to Stanford to move out of her dorm and get through finals. She will be a full-time player and still intends to finish a communications degree, just as Wie West eventually did.\n\n“I have no idea what I'm going to do with that,” Zhang said with a laugh, mentioning an essay that was due for one class, another project for computer science that sounded as though it gives her more anxiety that a downhill putt with a foot of break.\n\n“I have a busy week ahead of me, and that's not golf-related,” she said.\n\nHer next appearance inside the ropes is back in New Jersey on an even bigger stage than Liberty National, the course across the Hudson River from Manhattan. Zhang already was given an invitation to the KPMG Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol.\n\nAlso on the horizon the first full week of July is Pebble Beach, where the U.S. Women's Open is being held for the first time. It already was the most anticipated event on the LPGA schedule this year because of the location. Now it has even greater appeal.\n\nMegha Ganne, who challenged for a U.S. Women's Open title at Olympic Club as a teenager, was Zhang's teammate at Stanford. She was asked earlier in the week what the golf world should expect from Zhang.\n\n“More of what she’s already shown us in the past few years,” Ganne said. “I don’t think there is any part of her game or personality or game that’s lacking. She’s so ready for this. I’m just really excited for her. I think it’s going to be a joy to watch.”\n\nThat she was.\n\nZhang's debut came against a field that featured seven of the top 10 in the world. She had to sleep on the 54-hole lead — never easy, even for more tested veterans — and never trailed on a tough Sunday in which she never made a birdie.\n\nMost impressive was a 10-foot par putt on the 17th hole that kept her in the lead. She missed an 8-footer on the 18th to win in regulation, and then faced a sudden-death playoff against Jennifer Kupcho — a former NCAA champion and Augusta National Women's Amateur champion, and now an LPGA major champion.\n\nThe winning shot effectively was a 4-hybrid from Zhang that settled 10 feet away from a back pin on the 18th green. Ultimately, she needed two putts for the win. What followed was a celebration already familiar to those who have seen Zhang.\n\nShe was handed a red rose, and then another, and then another. Before long, she walked off the 18th with enough for more than one bouquet.\n\nThere were a few tears, especially during her embrace with Wie West, the tournament host who can relate to a high level of hype. Wie thought outside the box, playing PGA Tour events when she was still in the eighth grade, dreaming of playing in men's majors.\n\nThe difference was the outcome. It took Wie West four years to win on the LPGA Tour, five more to capture her lone major in the U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nWie West played with Zhang at the Women's Open last year and has become somewhat of a mentor to her.\n\n“It looks easy for her when she plays,” Wie West said.\n\nZhang exudes humility and kindness, along with a calculated approach to golf that led to her Stanford-record 12 titles in just 20 tournaments. And now she's 1 for 1 as a pro.\n\nWhat next?\n\n“I want to continue trying to carve a path for young kids to just follow your dreams,” she said. \"I’m so thankful that the young kids enjoy me, enjoy my golf, and I’m just so thankful for the support. So I will continue to do what I’m doing. I’ll continue to fight. I’ll continue to work hard.\n\n“Hopefully everyone can follow along.”\n\nThat shouldn't be too difficult.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2023/06/05/rose-zhang-lpga-stanford-best-story/51543761/", "title": "Rose Zhang winning an LPGA title 13 days after a college ...", "text": "For The Win\n\nThis is The Morning Win.

(AP) — Two-time NCAA champion Rose Zhang made her professional debut Thursday on the LPGA Tour, a solid opening round in the Mizuho Americas Open.\n\nThe 20-year-old from Stanford who dominated the women's amateur rankings for more than two years shot a 2-under 70 at Liberty National in the shadow of New York. The Californian was five shots off the lead held by Lauren Hartlage, who shot a career-best 65.\n\nAditi Ashok, the first player from India on the tour, was at 67 in a tournament where the focus shifted to Zhang last weekend with her announcement she was turning pro.\n\nAtthaya Thitikul of Thailand and Stephanie Meadow of Northern Ireland had 68s.\n\nAyaka Furue, coming off a loss to Pajaree Anannarukarn on Sunday in final of the match play event in Las Vegas, was at 69 with Lydia Ko, Brooke Henderson, Emma Talley, Cheyenne Knight, Grace Kim and Yuka Saso.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nZhang didn't dominate in her first round as a pro but she showed enough, making five birdies and three bogeys on a day her putter didn't help her. She hit fairways and greens in a round on a course that features a par 3 played with the Statue of Liberty staring golfers in the face.\n\n“This was definitely a round that could have been better, and that kind of gets me excited to work on more and to develop my game even further,” said Zhang, who was among 14 players at 2 under. “I felt like I left a couple shots out there, and I think there is a lot of room for improvement.”\n\nThere were also some shots that were great. On the par-5 13th, she chipped in from 29 yards, coming from below the hole and having the ball cross the length of the green before falling in the hole.\n\nThe people following her group loved it. It was what they expected from the player who has won back-to-back Annika Awards as the best college player, and who won the Augusta National Women’s Amateur in April.\n\nHer eight wins this season tied Tiger Woods for the most by a Stanford player in school history, and her 12 wins in 20 college starts are a school record.\n\n\"I don’t really have to think about other people’s expectations,\" Zhang said. “Like I said before, I think of it as a compliment that they think I’m capable of more. But on the overall level, I think I have people that just want me to do the best I can and they push me to be better.”\n\nZhang will need to be better if Hartlage continues playing as well as she did on Thursday.\n\nStarting on par-5 10th, Hartlage ignited her career-best round by hitting her second shot to within a foot and making eagle. She added five more birdies over the final 17 holes, adding it was nice to play well after struggling in her last four events.\n\n“I feel like no one really expects me to be at the top, and it’s kind of fun just being able to just play with some of the best in the world and see how I rank,” said Hartlage, a 25-year-old who has two top-10 finishes since joining the tour last year.\n\nAshok, who has two top five finishes in her last three events, is two shots behind Hartlage after a bogey-free round.\n\n“I just know that if I play good four days, then I’ll have a pretty good chance,” Ashok said.\n\nThitikul has two wins and 21 top-10 finishes since joining the tour last year. The 20-year-old had five birdies and bogey and she was the only player in the top four who played in the afternoon, when the wind picked up.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/06/06/pga-tour-heads-north-to-canada-lpga-stays-in-new-jersey/70292750007/", "title": "PGA Tour heads north to Canada, LPGA stays in New Jersey", "text": "AP\n\nPGA TOUR\n\nRBC CANADIAN OPEN\n\nSite: Toronto.\n\nCourse: Oakdale Golf & CC.

It has canceled five flights to and from Honolulu, Southwest said.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration is “closely monitoring the volcanic eruption and will issue air traffic advisories once the size of the ash cloud is determined,” it said in a statement.\n\nRed hues from the eruption of Mauna Loa illuminated Monday's predawn sky. Courtesy David A. Higgins\n\nReports of lava overflowing into the southwest portion of the volcano’s caldera, or crater, have come in to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency tweeted late Monday morning.\n\nThere is no indication of a threat to nearby communities, and no evacuation orders have been issued, the agency tweeted. As a precaution, two shelters have opened, even as “roughly half” of recorded Mauna Loa eruptions remained in the summit area without threatening populated areas, according to another agency tweet.\n\nAshfall can damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems, and damage or kill vegetation, the weather service says, while abrasive volcanic ash can irritate eyes and lungs.\n\n“People with respiratory illnesses should remain indoors to avoid inhaling the ash particles and anyone outside should cover their mouth and nose with a mask or cloth,” the Honolulu office warned. “Possible harm to crops and animals. Minor equipment and infrastructure damage. Reduced visibility. Widespread clean-up may be necessary.”\n\nThe observatory said earlier that lava flows do not threaten downslope communities.\n\nAt about 4,000 square miles, Hawaii, or the Big Island, is the largest in size of the Hawaiian chain but has a population of just over 200,000 people, according to the US Census Bureau, or fewer than 50 people per square mile. Most of the population is in cities and communities around the coast.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa eruption can be very dynamic and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the observatory said, adding, “If the eruption remains in Moku’āweoweo, lava flows will most likely be confined within the caldera walls.\n\n“However, if the eruptive vents migrate outside its walls, lava flows may move rapidly downslope.”\n\nRed hues from the eruption illuminated Monday’s predawn sky, according to footage captured at the Kailua Bay & Pier by Matthew Liano, a resident of Kailua-Kona, along the Big Island’s west coast.\n\n“The glow is like nothing I’ve seen here living in Kona for most of my life,” Liano told CNN.\n\nThe eruption began in Moku’āweoweo, the summit caldera of Mauna Loa, on Sunday around 11:30 p.m. HST (4:30 a.m. ET Monday), according to the observatory.\n\nMauna Loa began erupting Sunday. USGS\n\nNearby Kilauea volcano erupting since 2021\n\nMauna Loa, which covers half the island of Hawaii, has erupted 33 times since 1843, the volcano’s first “well-documented historical eruption,” according to the US Geological Survey. It last erupted in 1984, making this prolonged quiet period the volcano’s longest in recorded history.\n\nMauna Loa’s summit crater sits about 21 miles west of Kilauea, a smaller volcano that has been erupting since 2021. Their simultaneous eruptions have created a rare dual-eruption event, according to the park.\n\nKilauea’s eruption is currently confined to its crater. When Kilauea erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nMauna Loa has been in a heightened state of unrest, per the agency, which pointed in an update late last month to elevated seismic activity and increased earthquake rates.\n\nEarthquake activity increased from five to 10 earthquakes a day since June 2022 to some 10 to 20 earthquakes a day in July and August, according to the US Geological Survey. Peak numbers of more than 100 earthquakes a day were recorded on September 23 and September 29, CNN has reported.\n\nThe increased activity prompted Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in October to close the Mauna Loa summit to all backcountry hikers until further notice, though the US National Park Service said the main section of the park has remained open.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the Eastern Time equivalents for the ashfall advisory and eruption.", "authors": ["Monica Garrett Dakin Andone", "Monica Garrett", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/us/mauna-loa-highway-kilauea-eruption-monday/index.html", "title": "As Mauna Loa's lava inches toward a key Hawaii highway, some ...", "text": "Mauna Loa, Hawaii CNN —\n\nFrom a deep fracture in Mauna Loa’s dark terrain, the volcano’s magnificent eruption sends geyser-like fountains of lava spraying into the sky.\n\nThe fissure – cracked open on the northeastern slope of the world’s largest active volcano – feeds a searing flow of molten rock that cuts through the contours of Hawaii’s Big Island. Plumes of volcanic gas, including sulfur dioxide, rise into the air, and delicate strands of volcanic glass, called Pele’s hair, float downwind.\n\nIn the week since Mauna Loa erupted, the stream of lava has coursed northeast, away from the volcano’s summit. Once a quick-moving stream, the flow has slowed significantly as it reaches more softly sloping inclines.\n\nThough no communities are at risk, the lava flow is inching closer to the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, a major artery that remains open, connecting two sides of this island, according to the US Geological Survey. The lava is flowing at an average rate of 25 feet per hour, the agency said Monday.\n\n“Though the advance rate has slowed over the past several days, the lava flow remains active with a continuous supply from the fissure 3 vent,” the release said.\n\nAdvance rates of the lava may be “highly variable” in the coming days and weeks with individual lobes advancing quickly and then stalling, the release said.\n\n“If the eruption continues, it might cover the highway. But at this stage, it’s still about 2.3 miles away from the highway. But it is advancing every day,” said Natalia Deligne, a volcanologist with the USGS at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. “We don’t know how long this eruption is going to last, and that will dictate whether or not the highway becomes more threatened.”\n\nIf it closes, residents’ commutes could grow by hours as they seek alternate routes, creating “a tremendous inconvenience,” Hawaii Gov. David Ige told CNN on Saturday.\n\nHawaii’s Defense Department activated 20 members of the state’s National Guard Monday as a result of the lava flow from Mauna Loa, a Hawaii Emergency Management Agency statement said. The National Guard members will “assist Hawai’i County with traffic control and other roles in the Mauna Loa eruption,” according to the statement.\n\nMauna Loa’s eruption has attracted waves of awestruck visitors, some making the pilgrimage in the middle of the night to avoid the crowds, bundled in jackets and hats to protect against the chilly night air.\n\nLava spews Sunday from a fissure on Mauna Loa, where heat rises and a sulfuric smell wafts a quarter-mile into the air. CNN\n\nAlso erupting now is nearby Kilauea, whose monthslong eruption in 2018 was one of the most destructive in recent Hawaii history, the USGS says.\n\nKilauea began erupting again in 2021 and hasn’t stopped. And though it poses no risk now to surrounding communities, Mauna Loa’s rare simultaneous eruption has rekindled memories of the pain and destruction Kilauea wrought four years ago, when it wiped out hundreds of homes and dozens of miles of road.\n\nMemories of past destruction resurface\n\nJust 21 miles east of Mauna Loa, Kilauea’s ongoing eruption is now confined to a lake of lava rippling at its summit. But the history of this volcano is painful for Hawaii’s Big Island.\n\nIts 2018 eruption spewed lava into the large Leilani Estates neighborhood, swallowing more than 700 homes and surrounding others with thick layers of volcanic rock, creating unreachable patches of green foliage in a sea of blackened destruction.\n\nDorothy Thrall can still walk to the spot where her community once stood, now blanketed with hardened lava. From the deck of her friend’s home, she can see the edge where the lava stopped and blackened into volcanic rock, still steaming years afterward.\n\nAn area wiped out during the 2018 Kilauea eruption is seen Sunday from the sky. CNN\n\nMauna Loa’s eruption has reopened some of the wounds she and her friends still have from 2018.\n\n“I thought I was doing pretty good,” Thrall said. “My neighbor called me Day 2 (of Mauna Loa’s eruption), and she was in tears. She says, ‘I have PTSD, and I didn’t even know it.’ And I started crying, too, and I said, ‘I guess I do, too.’”\n\nThrall has no desire to see Mauna Loa’s eruption, saying she has seen enough lava in her time. Still, though, she still appreciates the majestic beauty and importance of volcanic events.\n\n“Lava is beautiful. It’s Pele’s creation,” she said, referencing the ancient Hawaiian volcano deity. “That’s how the island was formed. That’s how the island was built.”\n\nFor many Native Hawaiians, the eruption of volcanoes, including Kilauea and Mauna Loa, holds incredible spiritual significance. Some have honored this week’s occasion by leaving offerings and participating in traditional chants near Mauna Loa.\n\nAs onlookers and tourists flock, officials urge caution and advise people not to venture into closed areas that could pose risk of lethal volcanic fumes, sudden collapses and hidden earth cracks, the National Park Service said.\n\nA spot for safe viewing is a one-way route is accessible through the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said, noting vehicles parked on the roadway could get ticketed or towed.\n\nThe eruption has also created a risk of low air quality in some places due to volcanic ash and vog, or air pollution caused by volcanic gases. Sensitive groups, including children, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions, are advised to reduce outdoor activities that cause heavy breathing and reduce exposure by staying indoors and closing windows and doors, according to the Hawaii Department of Health.", "authors": ["David Culver Anna-Maja Rappard Elizabeth Wolfe", "David Culver", "Anna-Maja Rappard", "Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/us/mauna-loa-highway-kilauea-eruption-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Hawaii volcano: State activates National Guard as unpredicatable ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe relentless eruption of the world’s largest active volcano has prompted Hawaii’s National Guard to step in as residents and tourists flock to see it.\n\nFor 10 days, Mauna Loa has been shooting jets of lava toward the sky and down the massive mountain. While officials say there’s still no immediate risk to communities on Hawaii’s Big Island, lava has now crept closer to Daniel K. Inouye highway – the main highway connecting the eastern and western halves of the Big Island.\n\n“Lava has approached within 1.75 miles of Old Saddle Road and within about 1.92 miles of the Daniel K. Inouye Highway,” said Mike Zoeller of the US Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nThe lava was advancing about 21 to 22 yards per hour, Zoeller said Tuesday.\n\nLava fissures flow from the north flank of the Mauna Loa volcano on December 7.

As residents and tourists rush to witness and honor the rare dual eruptions, officials have enlisted the help of the National Guard.\n\n“Gov. David Ige and Maj. General Kenneth Hara activated 20 Hawai’i National Guard service members on Monday and placed them on active duty to assist Hawai’i County with traffic control and other roles in the Mauna Loa eruption,” Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency said Monday.\n\nOfficials also created a safe viewing spot on a one-way route accessible through the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said.\n\nThe lava flow’s pace isn’t steady, so it’s challenging to predict exactly when lava might hit the major highway, also known as Saddle Road.\n\n“There are many variables at play and both the direction and timing of flow advances are expected to change over periods of hours to days, making it difficult to estimate when or if the flow will impact Daniel K. Inouye Highway,” the US Geological Survey said.\n\nThe last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984, when its lava reached about 4.5 miles from Hilo, the largest population center on the Big Island.\n\nIf or when lava from the current eruption reaches the critical highway largely depends on how long Mauna Loa erupts, a volcano expert said.\n\n“We don’t know how long this eruption is going to last, and that will dictate whether or not the highway becomes more threatened,” said Natalia Deligne, a volcanologist with the US Geological Survey at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nMauna Loa and Kilauea are in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which remains open as it urges spectators to view the dual eruptions safely.\n\n“Stepping into week two of the Mauna Loa eruption,” the park posted Monday on Facebook. “Two volcanoes, two eruptions, one park. It was another ‘glowrious’ morning today!”\n\nLava fountains and flows illuminate the sky Monday near Mauna Loa. Go Nakamura/Reuters\n\nHonoring the volcanoes’ spiritual power\n\nWhile some see the Big Island’s eruptions as a threat, for many Native Hawaiians, the eruptions have incredible spiritual significance.\n\nKu’ulei Vickery, a Native Hawaiian and a teacher at a nearby public school, was among those who witnessed the glowing orange molten rock flow Friday. She performed a traditional Hawaiian chant and left rosemary grown in her backyard as an offering.\n\n“As a native, I’m acknowledging the space that I am in. I’m acknowledging the goddess Pele, and the people who have come before me, my ancestors,” she said. “You don’t go to anyone’s house empty-handed. So this is what I brought.”\n\nOfficials urged anyone who wants to watch the dual eruptions to be aware of the possible health hazards in the air.\n\nVolcanic emissions include sulfur dioxide, which reacts with other elements in the atmosphere and can begin to form fine particles which cause vog, a type of volcanic air pollution known as volcanic smog.\n\n“Vog creates the potential for airborne health hazards to residents and visitors, damages agricultural crops and other plants, and affects livestock operations,” the USGS said.\n\nLava shoots up Monday from a fissure of the Mauna Loa volcano. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe National Park Service says vulnerable groups, typically including the elderly and children, to be careful when viewing the dual eruptions.\n\n“People with pre-existing respiratory conditions are especially sensitive to poor air quality and should check the air quality alert before visiting,” the park service said.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Holly Yan", "Aya Elamroussi", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/us/hawaii-mauna-loa-kilauea-eruption-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Lava spills toward a highway, but governor says it's safe to visit the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe world’s largest active volcano is shooting fountains of lava more than 100 feet high and sending a river of molten rock down toward the main highway of Hawaii’s Big Island.\n\nThe leading edge of the lava flow gushing out of Mauna Loa is about 3.6 miles away from Saddle Road, also known as Daniel K.

On Wednesday, the fountains were as high as 82 feet.\n\nThis video from today's morning overflight shows fissure 3, the dominant source of activity. Lava fountains are 20-25 meters in height (65-82 feet) and feed a lava flow moving to the northeast at ~130 meters per hour (0.08 miles per hour). #MaunaLoa https://t.co/dxPN2r2gaH pic.twitter.com/ZkIXuDAwRu — USGS Volcanoes🌋 (@USGSVolcanoes) November 30, 2022\n\nJust 21 miles away from Mauna Loa, another active volcano in Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park keeps erupting. While Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in 38 years this week, its neighbor Kilauea has been erupting since last year.\n\nDespite the dual eruptions, Gov. David Ige said it’s still safe to visit the Big Island.\n\n“We would encourage everyone who has plans to visit the island to continue,” Ige told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n“It is completely safe. The eruption site is high up the mountain, and it’s in a relatively isolated location,” he said.\n\nBut distracted drivers gawking at the lava flows could cause problems, Ige said.\n\n“We are concerned because visitors and residents are stopping along the highway, and sometimes drivers are not paying attention fully,” he said.\n\n“So we are concerned about traffic control on the highway.”\n\nParking along the road is prohibited between mile markers 16 to 31, and any vehicles left there could be towed.\n\nIf the highway is closed, commuters won’t have any pleasant options.\n\nEmmanuel Carrasco Escalante, a landscape worker, said he would then have to decide between the northside or southside coastal roadways to get from Hilo to Kona.\n\n“It’s a hassle to drive all the way around the island,” he told CNN. “If the road closes, that would add almost two hours, more gas, and more miles so hopefully it (lava) doesn’t cross that road.”\n\nCarrasco Escalante said he usually leaves for work at 3:30 a.m. to arrive at 5 a.m. but is worried rerouting even then will take him into traffic jams.\n\nThe state’s emergency management agency tweeted there are no evacuation orders in place and if it becomes necessary to close the highway, there will be time to alert the public in advance.\n\n‘The concern is about dangerous gases’\n\nWhile officials have said there’s no imminent threat to property, a spate of potential health hazards could linger in the air.\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of volcanic glass) could be carried downwind, the geological survey said. A field team has found Pele’s hairs across older lava flows, the agency said Wednesday, adding: “Hairs deposited many km (mi) from active vents by the windblown eruption plume.”\n\nState health officials have also warned about the possibility of vog, or volcanic smog.\n\nThe Hawaii health department warned residents and visitors about “vog conditions, ash in the air, and levels of sulfur dioxide to increase and fluctuate in various areas of the state.”\n\nChildren, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions should reduce outdoor activities that cause heavy breathing and reduce exposure by staying indoors and closing windows and doors if vog conditions develop, the health department said.\n\nThe governor acknowledged the potential for air hazards and said officials are tracking air quality monitors across the island.\n\n“The concern is about dangerous gases from the fissures.

David Ige to sign an emergency proclamation Tuesday. This allows the state’s director and administrator of emergency management to handle actions such as issuing alerts and warnings as well as facilitating mandatory evacuations where necessary.\n\nAt just 21 miles apart, Mauna Loa and Kilauea have not erupted together since 1984, when Mauna Loa last erupted.\n\nNeither volcano is threatening homes or nearby infrastructure, the national park said. But state health officials warned air quality could be worsened by hazards such as vog, or volcanic smog.\n\nThe rare dual-eruption event is expected to attract an influx of visitors eager to see the molten flows, the national park said in a Facebook post.\n\nFountains of lava as tall as 200 feet burst from Mauna Loa on Monday, the geological survey said. The eruption was concentrated in Mauna Loa’s Northeast Rift Zone, where lava is flowing from at least one split in the volcano, the geological survey said.\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of volcanic glass) could be carried downwind, the agency said.\n\nOfficials are keeping a careful eye on the site to monitor any developments.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa rift zone eruption can be very dynamic, and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the geological survey said in a Monday update.\n\nOnly one of three volcanic fissures that opened on Mauna Loa Monday was still emitting lava Tuesday morning, Hawaii emergency management said. A small, fourth fissure opened overnight and emitted a small amount of lava that cut both power and road access to the Mauna Loa Observatory facility, the agency said.\n\nThough there is no immediate risk to communities, Hawaii’s National Guard is on standby and the state Emergency Management Agency has activated its emergency operations center, Major General Ken Hara, adjutant general for the State of Hawaii Dept. of Defense said during a news conference.\n\nKilauea, a much smaller volcano sitting on Mauna Loa’s southeastern side, has been erupting since September 2021, though its lava is confined to its crater, according to the US Geological Survey. When the incredibly active volcano erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park remains open but cautions visitors hoping to witness the historic eruptions to be aware of the cultural significance the sites have for Native Hawaiians.\n\n“While an eruption is an exciting experience, keep in mind you are observing a sacred event.

MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nMauna Loa’s eruption and its subsequent lava flow are affecting the road used to access the Mauna Loa Observatory.\n\nIt has cut off power and access to the critical climate tool used to maintain the so-called “Keeling Curve,” which is the authoritative measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide and vital scientific evidence for the climate crisis.\n\nThe Keeling Curve graph is comprised of daily carbon dioxide concentration measurements taken at Mauna Loa since 1958.\n\n“It’s a big deal. This is the central record of the present understanding of the climate problem,” said Ralph Keeling, a geoscientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego and son of the Keeling Curve creator.\n\nResearchers are now scrambling to find an alternative location for the equipment.\n\nThere have only been a few times when the readings from the tool have been unavailable, including in 1984, when they were interrupted by the last Mauna Loa eruption. During that incident, researchers had to install a generator in the observatory to resume operations.\n\nThis time around, Keeling said the situation is “much worse” and the timeline is unclear.\n\nVolcanic ash impacts air quality, flights\n\nHawaii health officials are warning residents about the possibility of \"vog,\" or volcanic smog. Paradise Helicopter\n\nIge, the state’s governor, cautioned Monday that the wind could carry volcanic gas and ash and asked residents with respiratory sensitivities to take precautions to minimize exposure.\n\nA “trace to less than one quarter inch” of ashfall could accumulate on parts of the island, the National Weather Service in Honolulu said Monday.\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Health issued an alert Monday warning residents and visitors should prepare for impacts to air quality, saying the eruptions could cause “vog conditions, ash in the air, and levels of sulfur dioxide to increase and fluctuate in various areas of the state.”\n\nSensitive groups, including children, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions should reduce outdoor activities that cause heavy breathing and reduce exposure by staying indoors and closing windows and doors, should vog conditions develop, the health department said.\n\nVolcanic ash clouds can also pose a serious aviation risk, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail.\n\nSouthwest Airlines stopped operations from Hilo International Monday because of the eruption, the airline announced. It has canceled five flights to and from Honolulu, Southwest said.\n\n“Passengers with flights to Hilo International Airport (ITO) or the Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keahole (KOA) should check with their airline prior to heading to the airport due to the volcanic activity at Mauna Loa,” according to an advisory from the state Transportation Department.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration is “closely monitoring the volcanic eruption and will issue air traffic advisories once the size of the ash cloud is determined,” it said in a statement.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Holly Yan Elizabeth Wolfe", "Amir Vera", "Holly Yan", "Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/us/hawaii-mauna-loa-kilauea-eruption-thursday/index.html", "title": "Hawaii volcano: Lava flow from Mauna Loa is slowing.

It can display text and fine details in VR, making it possible to read even small type with ease. It can track your eyes and facial features, giving you a sense of connection with other people in virtual spaces: If you arch your eyebrows or they puff up their cheeks in real life, so too will the VR avatars. And it can be used as a mixed-reality headset, showing you a view of the world around you in color while letting you interact with digital objects — whether you’re painting on an ersatz easel or putting on a faux mini-golf course.\n\nBut the black headset, which Meta unveiled on Tuesday during an online event, is probably not in your price range. At $1,500 ($1,499.99, to be precise), it costs nearly four times that of the company’s cheapest Quest 2 headset. Its price, power, and potential are aimed more toward businesses — think architects and designers — with pockets deep enough to shell out for the headset, and some creative and die-hard VR users.\n\nBuyers can pre-order the Quest Pro as of Tuesday, and it will ship out on October 25. It can be purchased online directly from Meta, and in the United States it can also be bought at Best Buy stores, via Best Buy’s website, and through Amazon.\n\nMeta's latest VR headset, the Quest Pro, is aimed at business users and costs $1500. Meta\n\nThe capabilities of the Quest Pro mark an important milestone for Meta (and for CEO Mark Zuckerberg), which has spent years and billions of dollars steering toward a future where it believes people will spend more and more time in virtual spaces and mixing digital elements with the real world. The company’s VR unit, Reality Labs, is still tiny compared to its main business of selling ads on Facebook and Instagram, and costly: Meta said it lost $2.8 billion during the second quarter of this year because of Reality Labs.\n\nIt’s also a major strategy shift, showing the company is now pushing its best VR technology to business customers, hoping they’ll be eager to use VR and mixed-reality apps at work. It’s a plan that could be lucrative, though it risks alienating its consumer VR business (the company plans, from here on out, to have two Quest product lines and to use the higher-end one to decide which features to add to the less expensive one).\n\nThis shift may unnerve companies such as Microsoft and Magic Leap, which have been working for years to convince enterprise users that their pricier mixed-reality headsets represent the future of work. (Microsoft, maker of the mixed-reality HoloLens headset, is apparently hedging its bets by bringing its software to the Quest Pro and Quest 2, in a partnership announced Tuesday at Meta’s Connect event, which focuses on its latest advances in virtual reality and related technologies.)\n\nAnd it’s not clear whether — or how — this powerful device will help Meta popularize the so-called metaverse, which Zuckerberg believes so strongly in that he rechristened Facebook as Meta in 2021. Meta is the leader in the nascent VR headset market with its consumer-geared Quest 2 headset, but that market is still tiny compared to, say, console gaming.\n\nI spent several hours using the Quest Pro last week at a Meta office near San Francisco, coming away both impressed and flummoxed. It was quickly clear that it’s not intended to be a headset for the masses — a decision that will frustrate some Quest 2 owners waiting for an upgrade to the two-year-old headset. Yet it does offer a glimpse of what VR and mixed-reality experiences may be like in the coming years: better looking, more fun, and increasingly intuitive.\n\nEye and face tracking\n\nThe Quest Pro looks markedly different from the Quest 2, as Meta took the battery out of the main body of the headset, curved it, and moved it behind the wearer’s head. This, plus a dial on the back of the head strap that lets you adjust it precisely (making it much easier for those of us who wear glasses to keep them on in VR), gives it a layout reminiscent of HoloLens 2. The dial also makes it easier to get the headset on and off, especially if you have long hair.\n\nUnfortunately, this new layout may mean that some people find it less comfortable to wear, particularly over an extended period of time. With the increased weight behind my head and just a knob to adjust the single strap around my noggin, I had to keep adjusting it slightly. I wore multiple identical headsets over the course of roughly two hours; after six different demos, ranging from virtual painting to DJing, I left with a headache.\n\nThe Quest Pro comes with a charging dock that can power up the headset and controllers. Meta\n\nOne of the most noteworthy new features on the Quest Pro is its ability to track the wearer’s eyes and face — something that may make people feel more present when interacting with other avatars in virtual spaces. To do this, the headset uses five infrared sensors to capture details like where you gaze and whether you sneer, smile, frown, or raise an eyebrow. This tracking is turned off by default; Meta also said that it’s processing eye and face images on the headset and then deleting them, and that this will be the case even for developers who add this tracking to their apps.\n\nI tried this new tracking out while playing around with a demo of a green-faced alien character, named Aura, that Meta is making available to developers so they can get a feel for how it works. With the Quest Pro on my head, I could smile, sneer, wink, scrunch up my eyes, wiggle my nose, and so on, while Aura did the same, in real time (unfortunately, there is no tongue tracking). The responsiveness and specificity of Aura’s facial mimicry was impressive, even at this early stage.\n\nThis kind of tracking feels like a step in the direction of what Zuckerberg promised was coming after he was widely criticized online in August for a Facebook post featuring an image of his blocky, cartoon-like avatar in Meta’s flagship social app, Horizon Worlds. Upon its release, Quest Pro users will be able to use it in that app and Horizon Workrooms, Meta said, as well as in several developers’ apps such as painting app Painting VR and DJ app Tribe XR.\n\nUpdated hand controllers\n\nThe headset is also more of a mixed-reality headset than a VR headset, as it isn’t meant to block out all ambient light all the time. This is a big departure from Meta’s past focus on immersive VR, where your physical surroundings were typically more of an obstacle than an asset. Meta is including magnetic light-blocking panels that can pop on to the sides to cut out more light, and starting in late November, it will also sell a $50 accessory meant to fully block out ambient light.\n\nLetting some surrounding light in is part of the company’s effort to make headset wearers feel in touch with their physical surroundings. To build on this, the Quest Pro uses outward-facing cameras on the headset to let you see your surroundings in color (rather than black and white, as on the Quest 2), and continues Meta’s recent push toward getting apps to interact with the real world.\n\nThe Quest Pro headset has sensors that can track your eyes and facial expressions. Meta\n\nThis was on display during a demo in which I used Painting VR to paint on a virtual canvas, moving around a real-world space set up with a virtual brush and tool stand on one side of the canvas and a shelf of paint cans on the other. I could mix paints, grab brushes, and post my finished (and admittedly awful) painting on the actual wall behind me, all while seeing what was happening around me and getting advice from the app’s creator.\n\nThe hand controllers that accompany the Quest Pro will also play an important role in both VR and mixed-reality apps, and they’ve been vastly improved over the ones that come with the Quest 2. Now, rather than relying on the headset to help determine where the controllers are in space, each controller includes three sensors to shoulder the load. This means they can track 360 degrees of motion, which should make for smoother and better hand and arm tracking in all kinds of apps. (Sadly, they won’t track your legs in VR, but Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday that Meta will be using AI to bring full-body avatars into Horizon Worlds sometime in the future.)\n\nA pressure sensor on each controller enables more precise motions than with the current Quest 2 controllers. I tried this out with a demo in which I was able to pick up and toss around a variety of small objects like a teacup, blocks, and a garden gnome. I found that if I picked up the teacup gently, particularly by the handle, I wouldn’t harm it; if I grabbed it, however, I crushed it (I mostly crushed it).\n\nThe things the Quest Pro and these controllers can do without connecting to a powerful computer or setting up a slew of external sensors seemed impossibly far away when then-Facebook bought VR headset maker Oculus in 2014. At that time, most people didn’t even consider VR a mass-market technology; eight years and billions of dollars later, we know and expect more. The headset may deliver technologically, but it will be up to Meta’s customers to decide whether it’s worth the price.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/business/bpa-sports-bras/index.html", "title": "High levels of BPA found in sports bras, watchdog warns | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nNew testing on a variety of popular branded sports bras and athletic wear has revealed high levels of BPA, a chemical compound that’s used to make certain types of plastic and can lead to harmful health effects such as asthma, cardiovascular disease and obesity.\n\nSports bras sold by Athleta, PINK, Asics, The North Face, Brooks, All in Motion, Nike, and FILA were all tested for BPA in the past six months, and the results showed the clothing could expose wearers to up to 22 times the safe limit of BPA, based on standards set in California, according to the Center for Environmental Health. The CEH, which conducted the testing, is a non-profit consumer advocacy group focused on exposing the presence of toxic chemicals in consumer products.\n\nUnder California law — specifically Proposition 65, enacted in 1986 — the maximum allowable dose level for BPA via skin exposure is 3 micrograms per day.\n\nThe group also tested athletic shirts from brands that included The North Face, Brooks, Mizuno, Athleta, New Balance, and Reebok and found similar results.\n\nThe CEH said Wednesday it has sent legal notices to the companies, which will have 60 days to work with the center to remedy the violations before the group files a complaint in California state court requiring them to do so.\n\nTo date, the watchdog said its investigations have found BPA only in polyester-based clothing containing spandex. “We want brands to reformulate their products to remove all bisphenols including BPA. In the interim, we recommend limiting the time you spend in your activewear by changing after your workout,” the group said.\n\nAthleta, Nike, Reebok, The North Face and Victoria’s Secret (which owns PINK) did not immediately provide a comment.\n\nBPA (Bisphenol A) is found in a large number of everyday products, from water bottles and canned foods to toys and flooring. In adults, exposure to BPA has been linked to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity and erectile dysfunction.\n\nPremature death was also associated with BPA exposure, a 2020 study found. More recently, BPA has also been linked to asthma in school-age girls.\n\n“People are exposed to BPA through ingestion, from eating food or drinking water from containers that have leached BPA, or by absorption through skin,” Kaya Allan Sugerman, CEH’s illegal toxic threats program director, said in a statement.\n\n“Studies have shown that BPA can be absorbed through skin and end up in the bloodstream after handling receipt paper for seconds or a few minutes at a time. Sports bras and athletic shirts are worn for hours at a time, and you are meant to sweat in them, so it is concerning to be finding such high levels of BPA in our clothing,” Allan Sugerman said.\n\nOver the past year, the group has asked more than 90 companies, including Walgreens and socks and sleepwear brand Hypnotic Hats, to reformulate their products to remove all bisphenols, including BPA. Some have already agreed to do so.\n\n“Even low levels of exposure [to BPA] during pregnancy have been associated with a variety of health problems in offspring,” said Dr. Jimena Díaz Leiva, science director with CEH.\n\nAlthough CEH litigates under California’s Clean Drinking Water and Toxics Enforcement Act of 1986, it says the repercussions of its settlements extend beyond California “as it is most often economically infeasible for companies to reformulate for just the California market.”\n\n“Our legal action has been successful in pushing entire industries to remove certain chemicals from products like children’s candy or toys,” the group said in a statement to CNN Business. “These cases not only serve to protect California consumers but also consumers throughout the country.”\n\n– CNN’s Sandee LaMotte contributed to this story", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2016/10/31/microsoft-not-apple-hosted-must-see-tech-event/93013226/", "title": "Microsoft, not Apple, hosted must-see tech event", "text": "Jon Swartz, and Marco della Cava\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — A funny thing happened when Microsoft and Apple held dueling product events last week. Microsoft hosted the grabber.\n\nThe contrast between the two events was stark.\n\nIn Cupertino, Calif., the iPhone maker was making a small tweak to the way we work today with the unveiling of a slim interactive function bar to its MacBooks. In New York, the onetime software giant was unveiling tools for the way we will work that included a massive interactive drafting table and 3-D design software.\n\nAnomaly? Well, certainly not the norm considering Apple's reputation as a headline-grabbing event producer.\n\nBut evidence is mounting that the software giant, a foil to Apple for decades, is now the more compelling, innovative company with forays into virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Apple, by contrast, seems more of the cautious, incremental company, building on its mountainous cash pile ($237.6 billion) with refinements to existing products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has talked in interviews about the importance of mixed reality; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is wearing the company's vaunted HoloLens headset around his house.\n\n\"Microsoft was looking toward future products while Apple was updating older products,\" says Jack Gold, an independent tech analyst.\n\nThe notion seemed unlikely the past decade, as Apple pumped out iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and Apple Watch while Microsoft sifted through the debris of a crushing $7.2 billion merger with Nokia and bounced former CEO Steve Ballmer, now owner of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nTo briefly recap, Microsoft swooped into cosmopolitan New York City to unveil a suite of new hardware and software aimed at taking digital productivity to the next level.\n\n\n\nThe announcements included an ingenious new Surface desktop with elaborate hinges that transformed the monitor at the push of a finger into a futuristic drafting table. On the software side, Nadella was passionate about how the company would be enabling the creation of 3-D content for a new generation of workers.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Apple's event took place on its relatively modest Cupertino campus in a small auditorium whose lobby features two massive photos of Steve Jobs and one massive quote about the need to do something great at every turn.\n\nCook did not have the opportunity to showcase a new category of product, but instead introduced a new laptop that features a small screen where the function keys used to be. Although it does boast digital touch interactivity, many tech pundits groused that a small strip is nothing compared to Microsoft's full touch screen.\n\nNew Macs pricier than rivals now\n\nWhile Nadella has shown no hesitancy to make bold bets on the future, Cook has overseen a series of press events the past two years that were long on iPhone upgrades but remarkably short on long-term vision.\n\nThis was underscored by what his competitors — Google, Facebook and Microsoft — shared in public events that touched on their plans in AR, VR, AI, machine learning and car-related technology.\n\nThe diverging paths are reflected in the recent financial performances of both companies. Apple recorded its first year-over-year decline in annual revenue in more than a decade. Microsoft has been steadily pivoting to a cloud-first business model that has helped the company become second only to Amazon in the global cloud game.\n\nMicrosoft shares recently hit an all-time high of $60 after earnings results blasted by analyst expectations; Apple shares, which were nearing a 52-week high, have declined to $114 since its product announcement last week.\n\n\"Microsoft is discovering new energy in its role as a leading software vendor,\" says Charles King, a technology analyst at Pund-IT. \"As Microsoft is becoming increasing open and flexible, Apple is becoming more rigid. As Microsoft is breaking down traditional walls, Apple is building its own walls higher.\"\n\nCook no doubt is a brilliant operations guy who has led Apple to unprecedented economic and business success — a record cash pile, billions of dollars in quarterly profits and a market valuation of more than $600 billion, best in the world. Yet Apple appears to have narrowed its vision and become far less adventurous in spirit than it was under co-founder Jobs.\n\nNadella inherited the CEO mantle under far more difficult circumstances, and has not only righted Microsoft but steered it on an exciting new path. Those divergent trajectories were on full display last week in New York and Cupertino.\n\nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter and USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava @marcodellacava.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/10/03/samsung-unveils-499-virtual-reality-headset-microsoft-buys-altspace-vr/726108001/", "title": "Samsung to sell VR headset to rival Playstation; Microsoft buys ...", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Despite the fact that compelling virtual and augmented reality content remains in short supply, a number of pricey headsets are poised to hit this still-tepid market next month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Samsung took the wraps off a new high-end VR headset called the HMD Odyssey, which boasts built-in microphones, position sensors and AKG headphones.

As with most AR/VR headsets, it comes with hand controllers to enhance the experience. HMD Odyssey will run Microsoft's Mixed Reality platform.\n\nLast month, Microsoft announced that a number of new AR/VR headsets built by partner companies such as HP, Dell and Acer that are anchored to Windows Mixed Reality would be coming out around the holidays at around $400 each.\n\nIn all these cases, the headsets are powered by and connected to desktops or powerful laptops via a cable. Microsoft makes a cordless headset that can overlap holographic images over the real world, aptly called HoloLens, but it costs $3,000 and is still limited to developers.\n\nIn additional news that reflects the need for AR/VR companies to create use cases for the emerging technology that go beyond gaming, Alex Kipman, Microsoft's head of mixed reality programs, announced Microsoft's acquisition of AltSpaceVR.\n\nThe social platform, which allows people to meet up in VR in avatar form, announced in July that it was closing due to lack of funding. Then it was rescued by an unnamed party that turns out to be Microsoft. Kipman declined to comment on the price of the acquisition, saying only that most of AltSpaceVR's remaining staff would join Microsoft.\n\nAltSpaceVR is similar to Facebook Spaces, which the social networking company launched last April as part of its effort to broaden the appeal its Oculus Rift VR gear.

At Apple's recent iPhone 8 and iPhone X launch, CEO Tim Cook dedicated some of the presentation to explaining how iPhones can use AR to play games as well as enhance live sporting events.\n\nHMD Odyssey represents not only an effort to compete with Facebook-owned VR pioneers Oculus — which Samsung partnered with to develop its Gear VR headset — but also a conscious step toward Microsoft's burgeoning Mixed Reality software platform.\n\nMore:Get ready for thousands of augmented reality Apple apps\n\nMore:A Lightsaber comes with Lenovo's new augmented reality headset\n\nPrices are coming down on headsets while their technological refinements improve, including the ability to track a user's movements with positioning sensors inside the headset as opposed to relying on cameras mounted in the room.\n\nBut virtual and augmented reality has not taken off as some tech experts initially predicted due not only to initially high costs for headsets and computers alike, but also because content remains sparse and staying in a VR environment for long periods of time can be a challenge for users.\n\nGamers so far are the biggest fans and users of VR, but companies such as Oculus and Microsoft are banking on the tech being adopted not only by companies looking for teams to collaborate in virtual reality, but also by consumers who might want the thrill of a travel experience or another educational escape through a headset.\n\nMicrosoft recently announced that Ford Motor employees were using HoloLens to work together to create new automotive designs using a holographic template, while its rollout of partner headsets and its Mixed Reality platform is meant to spur developers to produce apps that might pull in consumers.\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech writer Marco della Cava on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/tech/google-pixel-launch-event/index.html", "title": "Google Pixel event: Tech giant unveils new smartphones and its first ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGoogle on Thursday unveiled its new Pixel 7 smartphone lineup and its first-ever Pixel smartwatch, packed with tracking and health features from its subsidiary Fitbit.\n\nAt a press event in New York City, Google showed off the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro devices, which largely look the same as the year prior but with new camera features, an improved screen and battery, and an updated Google Tensor processor.\n\nWhile many of the updates are iterative, the lineup will likely appeal to tech enthusiasts who want the latest version of Android and an alternative to Apple or Samsung smartphones, as well as those who haven’t upgraded their Pixel device in a few years.\n\nThe 6.3-inch Pixel 7 features a glass back, aluminum frame and a sleek band on the back with black cutouts for the camera system. Its always-on OLED display allows for quick checking of widgets that highlight useful information, such as baggage claim details at the airport or when packages are arriving (not unlike what’s been recently made available on the new iPhone 14 line with the lockscreen).\n\nGoogle (GOOG) said the Pixel 7’s screen is now 25% brighter for visibility indoors, and the device can go a full day on a single charge (or 72 hours when on extreme battery saver mode). It comes in three colors – obsidian, snow and lemongrass – and starts at $599, or $200 less than a baseline iPhone 14 with the same amount of storage.\n\n“We want people to give Pixel a try, so while phones in this tier typically start at $799, we’re starting the price at $599,” Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management, said on stage during the event.\n\nThe larger 6.7-inch Pixel Pro – which comes in a matte aluminum finish – features an always-on display, the same long-lasting battery as the Pixel 7 and a new triple rear camera system, which includes a 5x telephoto lens, 30x super resolution zoom and an upgraded ultrawide lens. The ultrawide lens comes with autofocus capabilities to support new features including Macro Focus that picks up on fine details.\n\nThe new Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro Google\n\nBoth models run on Google’s new Tensor G2 processor, which powers the device’s machine learning and speech recognition capabilities, and several camera features. With Night Sight, for example, the camera now processes photos twice as fast. The tech also drives Cinematic Blur, a new dramatic blurring effect for videos.\n\nA new accessibility feature called Guided Frame helps visually impaired users take better selfies by vocally instructing them to move the device in specific directions. Google also announced updates to making calls, including cutting down on background noise and the ability to transcribe audio messages into text messages.\n\nThe Pro model, which comes in obsidian, snow and hazel, starts at $899. Pre-orders start on Thursday for both models and the devices hit shelves on Thursday, October 13.\n\nGoogle’s Pixel line remains a niche product. Its global market share for smartphones has never surpassed 1% on an annual basis, according to data from IDC Research. Google also limits sales to only a handful of countries, so keeping the volume low has been strategic as Google remains predominantly a software company with many partners running Android. (Google said the Pixel 7 line, however, will launch in sevral new countries, including India, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.)\n\nGoogle won’t likely take much market share away from Apple with these Pixel updates, as iPhone owners are known to be brand-loyal. Other Android smartphone makers, however, such as Samsung or smaller Chinese manufacturers may feel the pressure from consumer interest in Google hardware, according to Ben Wood, an analyst with CC Insight. “But given the incremental updates, it’s possible there will be less excitement than there has been in the past,” he said.\n\nAt the event, Google also teased another early look at its upcoming Pixel tablet, which will feature the Tensor G2 processor, and is expected to launch in 2023.\n\nBut one area where Google could make a greater impact this year is with the introduction of the Pixel watch. It is Google’s first wearable that plays up Fitbit’s strengths in health, fitness and wellness since closing its $2.1 billion acquisition of the smartwatch company early last year. Until now, Google had been quiet about how the Fitbit brand would integrate with its Wear OS software.\n\nThe Google Pixel Watch Google\n\nThe new 41 mm Google Pixel Watch features a circular, domed-shaped Gorilla Glass display that’s scratch- and water-resistant. It promises up to 24 hours of battery life and is compatible with Android 8 and newer devices. Built with Fitbit’s tracking capabilities, the Pixel Watch can monitor a user’s heart rate and sleep quality, offers 40 workout modes, and learns user behavior over time.\n\nThe device also assists with emergency SOS and supports a handful of Google services, including Google Wallet, Gmail and calendar updates, as well as sending messages and talking over 4G. The Pixel Watch comes in black, gold and silver finishes. It will cost $349 for Bluetooth and $399 for 4G LTE.\n\n“Pixel Watch poses zero threat to the Apple Watch, but it has an important role to play in raising the awareness of smartwatches for Android smartphone owners,” Wood said. “Given the success of the Apple Watch, there has to be a bigger market for smartwatches in the Android segment and together with Samsung’s Galaxy Watch, the new Pixel Watch should be a key driver for growth.”\n\nIt may take the Pixel Watch a few generations to catch up to the Apple Watch in terms of usability, however, as Apple’s smartwatch is now in its ninth iteration. But coupled with the Fitbit acquisition and the formation of Wear OS in collaboration with Samsung, Google is showing its greater commitment to the smartwatch market and perhaps hoping the time may finally be right for it.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/joe-biden-student-loans/index.html", "title": "How an indecisive Joe Biden finally made his mind up on student ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt was early May and Rep. Pramila Jayapal was feeling optimistic.\n\nThe chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus felt almost certain that a major announcement from the White House was imminent.\n\n“Something is coming, and something is coming soon,” the Washington Democrat mused to CNN at the time. “I feel pretty good that something is going to come within weeks.”\n\nJayapal was referring to a long-awaited student loan debt cancellation decision from President Joe Biden – and she wasn’t alone. The President had said the previous week that he was “taking a hard look” at debt forgiveness, teasing an answer was coming in several weeks.\n\nWith graduation season just around the corner, the moment felt especially ripe: Some in Washington speculated about the fourth weekend of the month, when Biden was slated to give two back-to-back commencement speeches at the US Naval Academy and the University of Delaware. White House officials briefly considered unveiling their plan then.\n\nBut graduation season came and went with no announcement.\n\nIn fact, he would wait until the next school year had already started in some parts of the country to announce from the White House his decision to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans.\n\nEven for a famously indecisive President, the question of whether to use executive powers to forgive student loan debt appeared particularly long and drawn-out. Interviews with nearly a dozen people familiar with internal deliberations revealed a myriad of factors fueled the delay, none more than Biden’s concerns over inflation and his insistence that the forgiveness plan would not be seen as a handout to the wealthy.\n\n‘Tortured’\n\nAsked to describe the process, one Democrat who spoke to the White House repeatedly about the issue responded with a one-word text message: “Tortured.”\n\nComplicating matters as Biden settled into his first term in office was a myriad of national crises and international events that took up his energy and time – from the escalating war in Ukraine to the rising gas and consumer goods prices fueling economic pessimism.\n\nAt various points of the year, administration officials simply felt that “it was so much easier to just continue to delay,” one Washington Democrat said. They added bluntly: “There was sh-t going on.”\n\nBut outside distractions accounted for only part of the delay.\n\nBiden agonized over legal concerns, moral hang-ups and persistent questions about the plan’s fairness and its potential to exacerbate inflation – the biggest political liability for his party heading into the fall.\n\nAs he mulled over each of these concerns with advisers and lawmakers, the President made clear that he was looking to feel convinced that – on both the policy and political front – there was undeniable merit to taking action, sources said.\n\nThe decision he ultimately unveiled this week – canceling up to $10,000 in debt for people earning less than $125,000 and up to $20,000 for those who also received Pell grants – was both more than some Democrats expected and less than many had called for.\n\nBiden also announced a final extension of a moratorium on student loan repayments, providing more certainty to borrowers wondering whether those payments would resume next week.\n\nInside the White House, there was broad recognition the decision wasn’t likely to completely satisfy the spectrum of Democrats who have been loudly lobbying for debt relief. Some Democrats facing tough reelection battles this November distanced themselves from the move.\n\n“This was never going to be a total win for us,” one Democrat involved in the discussions said. “Drawing out the process the way Biden has gives an opening for anyone to come in and fill.”\n\nBut after months of internal deliberations and delayed decisions, Biden and his top aides recognized they could no longer put off one of the persistent unresolved matters looming over his presidency.\n\nBiden forgave $10K in student debt. People flooded TikTok with their reactions 02:08 - Source: CNN\n\n‘Bury it’\n\nFrom the opening weeks of the administration, it was clear there was no easy path on the issue for Biden. White House officials settled on a tried-and-true Washington strategy: Bump the issue from the President’s already-full plate in the opening months of the administration. They requested an extensive legal review by the Justice and Education Departments – and said little more beyond that.\n\nOne administration official, who was supportive of the idea of canceling debt, said it was viewed by some as a review that may never actually end.\n\n“Bury it,” the official said of how skeptical officials viewed the White House approach to the issue. “They were wrong in the end. But there were definitely moments when it felt that way.”\n\nThose who had spoken to Biden about the issue had their own reasons for skepticism. Unlike many in his party, Biden simply hadn’t embraced the idea that the White House had the authority.\n\nEven if it did, two people familiar with the matter said, Biden regularly raised concerns of fairness in discussions about the issue, wary it would benefit primarily borrowers with the means to pay their debt – or those who predominantly attended top academic institutions. And what about those who chose not to go to college at all?\n\nIn April, Biden announced another extension of the pandemic-era freeze on federal student loan repayments – something officials had signaled was unlikely after the prior extension. Even then, officials had no clear read on where Biden would land.\n\nBy then, the administration’s reviews had been conducted – and completed, officials said. Biden’s policy and legal teams, while far from unanimous on the merits of the idea, were prepared with potential options.\n\nPolitical peril\n\nThree weeks after Biden’s decision to extend the repayment freeze, the politics of the contentious policy and legal debate over forgiving student loans was laid bare in the Oval Office.\n\nBiden’s advisers have taken a position of dismissing public polling, but inside the West Wing there is a constant stream of internal numbers that factor into strategy and decision making. Some outside polling punctures the Oval Office as well, none more so than a poll of young voters conducted by one of Biden’s 2020 campaign hands.\n\nThe survey, conducted by Harvard’s Institute of Politics, showed just 41% of young Americans approved of Biden’s job performance. It marked an 18-point drop from the year prior. Biden delved into the details of the poll himself – with the very people who put it together – in a White House meeting with Harvard students and their faculty adviser.\n\nA few weeks later, John Della Volpe, the director of polling at Harvard’s IOP who became a trusted voice inside Biden’s inner circle, would advocate for student loan action with an unambiguous message.\n\n“Beyond the essential economic bottom line, this action will begin to materially rebuild the fractured relationship between the leader of the Democrats and a voting bloc that was integral to his party’s most recent successes,” Della Volpe wrote in a New York Times essay.\n\nThe politics laid out in the Harvard poll and others during the spring was not a singular driving force for the decision, officials say, but they acknowledge it resonated among some of Biden’s senior advisers, including White House chief of staff Ron Klain.\n\nIt resonated with Biden as well. A decision to move forward wasn’t just about the policy itself; it was also about delivering on a campaign promise and delivering action – two issues highlighted as critical in the Harvard polling.\n\nBut turning Biden’s openness to move forward into final policy was hardly a straight line.\n\n'Give me an f-ing break': Commentators debate Biden's student debt forgiveness plan 01:53 - Source: CNN\n\nDemocratic push\n\nIntensive lobbying from fellow Democrats, including in the hours before he made a final announcement, contributed to Biden taking his time to land on a final decision – even as that delay left millions of borrowers in a state of anxious uncertainty.\n\nWhen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus visited Biden at the White House in late March, the President pondered aloud about one of his biggest fixations – ensuring that wealthy families wouldn’t benefit from loan cancelation. Some lawmakers in the room pointed out that setting an income cap likely wouldn’t make a major difference, since high earners were far less likely to take out loans to attend school to begin with.\n\nHe and top White House officials were also on the receiving end of pitches from top senators, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had faced off against Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary and had famously made student loan debt cancelation a major pillar of her campaign.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat – who liked to drop a statistic about debt held by graduates from the University of Delaware – had begun lobbying Biden and his top aides on the issue as soon as the general election kicked into gear. The senator had dozens of phone calls with senior White House staff on the scope of potential debt forgiveness, as well as several direct conversations with Biden himself, according to sources familiar with those conversations.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was also among the handful of top Democrats who lobbied Biden for much of his term to cancel student debt.\n\nThe push even continued after the deadly massacre at a Buffalo supermarket, when Biden traveled to the city in May to meet the families of victims of the mass shooting. On Air Force One and on the way back to Washington on May 17, Schumer made the argument to Biden directly that canceling student loan debt was the “right thing to do economically and morally,” the source said.\n\nWarren, too, recently seized on rare face time with the President onboard Air Force One. Traveling with him to Somerset, Massachusetts, in July ahead of Biden’s major speech on climate change, the senator again pressed him on the urgency of the issue.\n\nIn recent months, Warren had begun pushing the White House to consider additional student loan cancelation on top of the baseline forgiveness that the administration was leaning toward for people making less than $125,000 per year, with the hope of raising the total amount of forgiveness that the lowest income Americans would be eligible for.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris routinely made the case for widespread student debt cancelation, a source familiar with discussions, told CNN, including directly to the President himself.\n\n“It wasn’t a secret that she was an advocate for debt cancellation,” the source said.\n\nIn the final announcement the White House released, forgiveness for Pell grant recipients mirrored a part of then-Sen. Harris’ 2019 student debt forgiveness plan — which included $20,000 in relief for Pell grant recipients who started small businesses in disadvantaged communities.\n\nJayapal, who said she had been in touch with White House officials in the days leading up to Biden’s announcement, said she sensed that that final number – $20,000 in maximum loan forgiveness for Pell grant recipients – was “in flux, until the very end.”\n\n“I think it’s been a journey for the President, let’s put it that way,” said Jayapal, who called Biden’s announcement this week a “huge victory.”\n\n“There are some things that are easier and some things that are harder, and I get the sense that maybe this was something that was a little bit harder. But I think he settled somewhere that he felt comfortable with.”", "authors": ["Mj Lee Kevin Liptak Phil Mattingly", "Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2016/09/08/what-apple-didnt-tell-us-iphone-7-launch/90002278/", "title": "What Apple didn't tell us at the iPhone 7 launch", "text": "Edward C. Baig\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — A company as famously tight-lipped as Apple will rarely, if ever, provide hints about what it is cooking up next.\n\nBut with some truth serum, here's what executives might have discussed:\n\nWhat we didn’t hear at Wednesday's iPhone 7 unveiling:\n\n*Virtual or augmented reality. The list of companies that have entered the virtual and/or augmented reality space reads like Who’s Who in the (Tech) Cast: Facebook, Google, Sony, Microsoft and Samsung. For now, Apple is an understudy, lest you factor in all the folks who got their first taste of AR playing Pokémon Go on an iPhone.\n\nIn fact, Apple holds numerous patents in VR, and has made some high profile hires in the field. And Tim Cook stated recently that the company is “high on AR in the long run.”\n\nWhat we don’t know is how long Apple is willing to play the long game. Or what mixed reality approach or approaches it might take. Quick primer: Virtual reality fully immerses a user into computer generated virtual world. Augmented reality overlays the virtual on top of the real physical world.\n\nApple could deliver a VR headset along the lines of Samsung’s Gear VR, which is infused with Facebook-owned Oculus DNA, and requires the use of a compatible smartphone. It could more ambitiously do a VR headset that connects to a computer like the Oculus Rift or HTV Vive. Or follow Microsoft's lead with HoloLens, more AR than VR.\n\nThen again, Apple might go the mobile VR route as Google is doing with the upcoming Daydream platform for compatible Android phones. The new iPhone 7 Plus handset announced yesterday has two rear cameras which suggests some interesting possibilities in the AR realm—we'll have to see. But if Apple chooses to engage in a full throttle mobile VR battle against Daydream, we might have to wait for next year’s iPhone. At this stage we have a lot more questions than answers.\n\nFirst look at iPhone 7: Features to please the Apple faithful\n\n*New Mac laptops. Apple announced that macOS Sierra, the latest version of its operating system for Macintosh computers, will be available to the public on Sept. 20. But while Sierra will let you spice up your current Mac, you'll have to wait a bit longer for new Mac hardware, including the next versions of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops. We could see these as soon as next month, though it is also possible that their introductions will slip into 2017.\n\nThe Mac lineup is getting tired, and seems primed to take advantage of the latest chip technology from Intel. Bloomberg has reported that a new thinner MacBook Pro is in the works, with a flatter keyboard and a new secondary digital function key display feature above the keyboard that will dynamically change depending on the task at hand. And yes, Apple is characteristically mum.\n\n*Apple Car. Tesla boss Elon Musk has called Apple’s electric vehicle an “open secret,” which seems to be the case given the hundreds of engineers reportedly working on the rumored project, including some apparently wooed away from Tesla. Assuming the rumors are true, we’re unlikely to see an Apple Car until 2021. Suffice it to say, Cook & Co. aren’t saying.\n\n*What was left out of the iPhone 7. Apple of course had plenty to say about the new iPhone 7. How it has all these new camera features and how it is now water and dust resistant. Apple also defended its controversial and self-proclaimed “courageous” decision to remove the standard headphone jack, something I for one am not thrilled with.\n\nBut while Apple also claims better battery life for the iPhone 7, it left out battery-related features that are already in use by Samsung on its Galaxy phones and on other competitive handsets. I’m speaking of fast charging batteries, which depending on the specs can get you at or near a full-charge in relatively short order. And batteries that can be charged wirelessly by placing them on a (typically optional) pad.\n\nOne reason for Apple’s reluctance in providing a fast-charging solution may have to do with a reduction in the battery’s longevity. Such a possibility hasn’t prevented Samsung et al from offering a feature that is not only convenient, but is a potential lifesaver if you need to juice up in a hurry before boarding an airplane.\n\nMaybe Apple will get there—on next year’s iPhones.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/business/yeezy-gap-balenciaga-launch/index.html", "title": "Yeezy Gap unveils Balenciaga collection that includes a $440 ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe wait has ended.

It shed 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, the company reported on Tuesday, adding that it expects to lose another two million in the second quarter. The service was expected to add 2.5 million subscribers in the first three months of the year.\n\nNetflix’s stock dropped 35% on Wednesday, instantly wiping $50 billion off the value of the company.\n\nNetflix’s first quarter profit was $1.6 billion, down from $1.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue jumped nearly 10%, to $7.9 billion.\n\nIt cannot be overstated just how bad of a report this is for the king of streaming. The company’s stock has fallen more than 40% year to date, and coming into the earnings there was a lot of concern from investors regarding its growth. The company hasn’t lost subscribers in more than a decade.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIn its letter to investors, the company said that since it launched streaming in 2007, the company has “operated under the firm belief that internet-delivered, on demand entertainment will supplant linear TV,” But, it added, in the near term “we’re not growing revenue as fast as we’d like.”\n\nNetflix said that the pandemic “clouded the picture by significantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021 was due to the Covid pull forward.”\n\nBut there are many different factors behind its subscriber stagnation, including competition from traditional media companies that have gotten into the streaming market in recent years, as well as widespread password sharing.\n\n“In addition to our 222 million paying households, we estimate that Netflix is being shared with over 100 million additional households, including over 30 million in the [United States/Canada] region,” the company said.\n\nThe company also blamed “macro factors” that are affecting many companies right now, such as “sluggish economic growth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from Covid are likely having an impact as well.”\n\nNetflix said that pulling out of Russia cost the company 700,000 subscribers.\n\nThe company’s bad report is likely to roil the streaming market given that so many other firms have changed their business strategies to compete with Netflix.\n\nDisney (DIS), for example — one of Netflix’s biggest rivals — was down roughly 5% Tuesday evening.\n\nWhat now?\n\nNetflix told investors Tuesday that it plans to turn the tide by doing what it’s always done: Improving the service.\n\n“Our plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix — in particular the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our members value most,” the company said.\n\nThe company added that it’s “doubling down on story development and creative excellence” and that it launched the “double thumbs up” tool that will allow members to “better express what they truly love versus simply like.”\n\nNetflix also said it will focus more on “how best to monetize sharing” in terms of passwords.\n\n“Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. And we’ve always tried to make sharing within a member’s household easy, with features like profiles and multiple streams,” the company said. “While these have been very popular, they’ve created confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared with other households.”\n\nThe company said last month that over the last year, it’s been working on ways to “enable members who share outside their household to do so easily and securely, while also paying a bit more.”\n\n“While we won’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity,” it said.\n\nAnother place that could help increase revenue and attract more subscribers for the service is advertising.\n\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings has always been allergic to the idea of having commercials on the platform, but on Tuesday’s call with analysts he mentioned that it could be a possibility in the future.\n\n“Those who have followed Netflix know that I’ve been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription. But as much as I’m a fan of that, I’m a bigger fan of consumer choice,” Hastings said on the post-earnings call. “And allowing consumers who like to have a lower price, and are advertising tolerant, get what they want makes a lot of sense.”\n\nHe added that the company is looking at that now and trying to figure it out “over the next year or two.”\n\n“Think of us quite open to offering even lower prices with advertising,” Hastings said.\n\nDespite the dramatic growth slowdown that puts its strategy into question, Netflix remained defiant.\n\n“This focus on continuous improvement has served us well over the past 25 years,” Netflix said. “It’s why we are now the largest subscription streaming service in the world on all key metrics: paid memberships, engagement, revenue and profit.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article included an incorrect reference to fourth quarter earnings and misstated profit and revenue.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/business/moderna-covid-vaccines-annual-booster-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Moderna CEO says Covid vaccines will evolve like 'an iPhone ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nForget taking two to three Covid shots a year.

And that’s exactly the same idea, which is you’ll get Covid and flu and RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] in your single dose.”\n\nHaving recorded breakneck growth during the pandemic, Moderna (MRNA) is now under pressure to identify its next big frontier.\n\nBancel believes the Covid-19 pandemic that helped the company rack up tens of billions of dollars in revenue and generate business in more than 70 markets globally could end as soon as this year.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the virus is going anywhere, he noted.\n\n“I think we are slowly moving — if not already in some countries — to a world where all the tools are available, and everybody can make their own decision based on their risk tolerance,” he explained, adding that he believed more people would choose to “live with the virus,” much like they do with the flu.\n\nThe approach, however, will continue to vary greatly, such as among people who are immunocompromised or in countries like Japan, where it was common to wear masks even before the pandemic, he acknowledged.\n\nAnd “there’s always a 20% probability that we get a very nasty variant that drives very severe disease that has a lot of mutation,” he added.\n\nThe next big thing\n\nStill, Moderna is determined not to become a one-hit wonder.\n\nThe company has more than 40 products in development, and is planning for life well beyond Covid-19, said Bancel.\n\nIn addition to an updated annual booster, it is continuing to develop a personalized cancer vaccine, for which new clinical data will drop later this year. Bancel said the product could go up for approval in roughly two years if all goes well.\n\nThe company is also exploring a potential monkeypox jab, which is “still in the lab today,” Bancel said. The World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of the illness a public health emergency of international concern last month.\n\nAnd Moderna is looking to catch up to competitors overseas.\n\nEarlier this year, it announced a push into 10 Asian and European markets, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Denmark and the Netherlands. The investments will cost “dozens of millions of dollars” and include hundreds of new hires, said Bancel.\n\nMembers of the public waiting in line at a vaccination facility administering the Moderna Covid-19 shot in Taipei, Taiwan in April.

Its stock rallied 434% in 2020 and 143% last year.\n\nBut now, like peers Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX), the firm’s stock has slumped, dropping more than 30% so far this year and 64% from its all-time high a year ago.\n\nLast week, the company revealed that it took a writedown of nearly $500 million in the second quarter, partly because of a sudden cancellation of orders from Covax, the international vaccination program for lower-income countries.\n\nThe reversal led to huge losses for the company, which had bought new machines to fulfill those orders, and more importantly, resulted in Covid vaccines being thrown in the trash, said Bancel.\n\n“We ended up destroying the vaccines,” he said. “It was really heartbreaking.”\n\nThe CEO said he wasn’t worried about that kind of slide in demand being repeated in richer countries, in part because governments had already shown commitments to use vaccines later this year to avoid reintroducing economic lockdowns.\n\nBut “on the low-income country side, yes, I am worried,” he said.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}]}

But “it’s getting to that stage where it’s something that we have to continue to monitor.”\n\nIn the United States, the Omicron subvariants XBB.1.5, BQ.1.1, BQ.1, BA.5 and XBB are causing almost all Covid-19 infections, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor this week, the CDC estimates that XBB.1.5 now causes 40.5% of cases in the US, followed by BQ.1.1 at 26.9%; BQ.1 at 18.3%; BA.5 at 3.7%; and XBB at 3.6%.\n\n“SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing and accumulating mutations in its genetic code over time. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge,” CDC researchers write in their data tracker. “Some variants will emerge and disappear, while others will emerge and continue to spread and may replace previous variants.”\n\nOmicron’s offshoots appear to dominate globally as well, but as the coronavirus continues to spread – especially in China after Beijing’s rapid easing of restrictions – there is now concern about where Covid-19 trends could be heading in 2023 and the risk of new variants emerging.\n\n“It is a worry,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “And that, of course, has led to the CDC’s very recent announcement that they are going to oblige people who come to this country from China to be tested and test negative before they can come into the country.”\n\nUS health officials announced Wednesday that, starting January 5, travelers from China will be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result before flying to the country. Passengers traveling to the US from China will need to get tested no more than two days before flying and present proof of the negative test to their airline before boarding.\n\nOfficials also announced that the CDC is expanding the traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program to airports in Seattle and Los Angeles, bringing the total number of airports participating to seven with about 500 weekly flights from at least 30 countries covered, including about 290 weekly flights from China and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Chinese government has not been sharing a lot of information about the genetic composition of the viruses that it’s seeing there, Schaffner said.\n\n“Because the Chinese government was not doing that, that was the main reason CDC put this new travel requirement in place. It’s certainly not to prevent simple transmission of Covid from China here. We’ve got plenty of Covid. That would be like telling people not to pour a bucket of water into a swimming pool,” he said. “This travel testing requirement is a way to buy us some time and help create somewhat of a buffer between ourselves and China, should a new variant suddenly appear in that country.”\n\nHe added that the US will need “as much time as possible” to update vaccines and antivirals to respond to a potential emerging variant of concern.\n\n‘It really is a bit of a black hole’\n\nThe US testing requirements for travelers will “buy some time,” but they won’t prevent new Covid-19 cases from coming to the United States or new variants from emerging, said Dr. Carlos Del Rio, the executive associate dean for the Emory School of Medicine and Grady Health System in Atlanta.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going to see much benefit, honestly,” he said of the travel requirements. “The most important thing we need right now is, we need the Chinese to have more transparency and tell us exactly what’s going on, and that is pretty much a diplomatic decision. This is about diplomacy.”\n\nIn terms of the genetic data on coronaviruses in China that is accessible to the public, “It really is a bit of a black hole,” Pekosz said. Almost 250 million people in China may have caught Covid-19 in the first 20 days of December, according to an internal estimate from the nation’s top health officials, Bloomberg News and the Financial Times reported last week.\n\n“To me, what’s really a concern is the ongoing infections and whether they’re producing more variants in China that might be of particular concern for us, and testing people before they get on a plane won’t answer that question,” Pekosz said.\n\n“What we really need is to do a much better job of sequencing the viruses from individuals who are traveling from China so that we can aid in terms of understanding what kinds of variants are circulating there,” he said, adding that throughout the pandemic, Chinese officials have not been very transparent about their data on variants.\n\nMore spread, more variants\n\nConstant spread of a virus is what can lead to the emergence of variants. The more a virus spreads, the more it mutates.\n\n“For a variant to emerge – and this is true not only for Covid, but for influenza and for a lot of other viruses – the most critical thing is, the more cases that you have, the more likely that the virus will start to accumulate mutations that might have the ability to evade immunity more effectively or to transmit more effectively,” Pekosz said.\n\n“So when you have a situation like what’s starting to turn out in China, where you’re going to have millions upon millions of infections, every one of those infections is just one additional opportunity for the virus to pick up a random mutation that might make it better at infecting people,” he said. “Combine that with the fact that the Chinese population has been using less-than-optimal vaccines and has apparently not been as good about putting boosters into their population as other countries have, that means that there’s probably a lower amount of immunity in the population.”\n\nHealth authorities in China have “noticeably increased” the number of coronavirus genome sequences and other related data they are submitting to the global database GISAID, an initiative that maintains databases for scientists around the world to share data on flu viruses and coronaviruses.\n\nBut many experts argue that it’s not enough.\n\nGISAID said in an email to CNN on Wednesday that China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and several regional centers in the country, “have noticeably increased the number of submissions of genome sequence and associated metadata from samples taken in recent days.”\n\nThe number of genome sequences from China grew to just shy of 1,000, as of Friday, according to GISAID.\n\nGISAID also confirmed that the sequences from China “all closely resemble known globally circulating variants seen in different parts of the world between July and December 2022,” compared with the 14.4 million genomes in its database.\n\n“These latest data provide a snapshot of the evolution of the Omicron variants and shows that these most recently shared sequences from China are closely related to variants that have been circulating for some time,” according to GISAID.\n\nWhat the future may hold\n\nCovid-19 is in a relatively “stable” state right now in the United States, but the nation still sees about 350 deaths related to the disease each day, said Dr. Jessica Justman, an associate professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and senior technical director of the global health program ICAP.\n\nWhile Covid-19 levels remain far below those of prior surges, trends are on the rise in parts of the US, new hospital admissions have jumped nearly 50% over the past month, and there is growing concern that case numbers could soar after the winter holidays.\n\nTo reduce the risk of increased Covid-19 spread, Justman said, it will be important for people in the new year to continue to stay up-to-date with their Covid-19 vaccinations.\n\nOnly 14.6% of the US population ages 5 and older has gotten their updated booster shot, according to CDC data.\n\n“So where are we going? That does take me to China,” Justman said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’m concerned that China right now is one giant incubator of SARS-CoV-2. There is the potential to have so many infections and with that, new variants,” she said.\n\n“I think we’re going to be looking at new variants of concern” in 2023, Justman said. “The question is: Will we go back to a point where we have a variant of concern that causes such severe illness that we don’t get the benefit of our protection from prior infections and from prior vaccinations? … I’m going to be optimistic and say I don’t think we’re going to go back to that point.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/health/rsv-hospitals-what-to-know-wellness/index.html", "title": "RSV is spreading at unusually high levels, overwhelming children's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Amber Sizemore and her family went out of state to celebrate her birthday last week, she had hoped her toddler daughter, Raegan, would try swimming. But the 15-month-old, normally energetic and adventurous, wasn’t herself on Saturday.\n\n“She hated it, and she normally loves water,” Sizemore said.\n\nBy Sunday, when the family was heading back to Ohio, the little girl was “coughing like crazy.”\n\n“She coughed so hard, she threw up,” Sizemore said. Raegan also stopped eating and developed a fever.\n\nWhen Tylenol didn’t help, Sizemore took her to urgent care and told them that RSV or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cold-like virus, was going around at Raegan’s day care, where Sizemore also works.\n\nThe test came back positive, and Raegan’s vital signs prompted the staffers at the urgent care to tell Sizemore to take her daughter to the hospital.\n\nAs soon as they saw her vitals, the staff at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital in Cleveland knew they had to admit Raegan, her mom said. She needed oxygen.\n\n“They’ve been great here and taken good care of her, but the scariest part is, had I not already known she was exposed to RSV, I may have just let her cough it out,” Sizemore said. “I’m glad I didn’t wait.”\n\nMost kids catch RSV at some point before they turn 2, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, and it’s usually mild. Symptoms may look like a common cold and include runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. They typically last a week or two, and clear up with rest and fluids.\n\nBut in some children, especially young infants, RSV can be dangerous, leading to dehydration, breathing trouble and more serious illnesses such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia.\n\nNow, there’s an “unprecedented” rise in RSV cases among children in the US, some doctors tell CNN.\n\nThe CDC does not track hospitalizations or deaths for RSV like it does for flu, but it said Thursday there has been a rise in RSV cases in many parts of the country. Several children’s hospitals told CNN that they’ve been “overwhelmed” with patients at a time of the year when it’s unusual to have a surge of RSV patients.\n\nOverall, pediatric hospital beds are more full now than they’ve been in the past two years, according to federal data.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services does not specify the reason for hospitalization, but about three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds available nationwide are being used now. By comparison, pediatric hospital beds were about two-thirds full on an average day over the past two years.\n\n‘Never seen this level of surge’\n\nWith the RSV surge, UH Rainbow Babies has had so many patients, it went on diversion for a couple of days in early October, meaning it couldn’t take external emergency admissions. It’s taking patients again now, but it’s still slammed with RSV cases.\n\nThere has been such such a dramatic increase in cases in Connecticut that Connecticut Children’s Hospital has been coordinating with the governor and public health commissioner to determine whether it should bring the National Guard in to expand its capacity to care for these young patients.\n\n“I’ve been doing this a long time. I’ve been at Connecticut Children’s for 25 years, and I’ve never seen this level of surge specifically for RSV coming into our hospital,” Dr. Juan Salazar, the hospital’s executive vice president and physician in chief, told CNN.\n\nIn Texas, where RSV cases usually spike in December or January, the emergency department at Cook Children’s in Fort Worth and its urgent cares are seeing a significant number of RSV cases. Nearly half the ICU is filled with RSV cases, hospital spokesperson Kim Brown said; between October 2 and 8, there were 210 RSV cases at Cook Children’s; a week later, there were 288.\n\nJeff and Zoey Green’s 4-month-old, Lindy, was admitted to Cook on Sunday.\n\nAt the hospital, Lindy’s fever was so high at one point they said they used ice packs to cool her down.\n\n“I don’t know how but she slept with those ice packs on top of her,” Zoey Green said, holding an exhausted Lindy at the hospital. She said they’re trying to keep her hydrated so she doesn’t have to go back on an IV.\n\n“We want her to be better, for sure.”\n\nDr. Mallory Davis, an infection preventionist at Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is also seeing an early surge.\n\n“We are very full, and our census numbers are pretty high as we work through kind of figuring out how to accommodate all of the sick kiddos in the community,” she said.\n\nChildren’s Hospital Colorado has seen an early uptick in RSV hospitalizations and is starting to see the first few flu cases of the season, said Dr. Kevin Messacar, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\n“We have been seeing increased patient volumes since the late summer, which started with rhinoviruses and enteroviruses as children returned to school, and now is being driven by RSV and parainfluenza,” he said. “With influenza season rapidly approaching with what appears to be an early start, we are concerned about the persistently increased volumes of sick children requiring hospitalization.”\n\nAt UH Rainbow Babies, staff are hoping things don’t get much worse. “I mean, I hope we’re peaking right now, because if we’re not, then holy hell,” said Dr. Amy Edwards, associate medical director for pediatric infection control.\n\nRSV cases can often fill hospitals, even in regular seasons, since there aren’t many treatments and it can require several days of supportive care in severe cases, Edwards said.\n\nIll children “need that oxygen support, so they can’t be at home,” she said.\n\nExperts think US cases may be spiking now because of the phase of the Covid-19 pandemic that we’re in.\n\nWhen everyone stayed home in 2020 and 2021 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, it seemed to change the typical RSV season. Case counts were low, and that created an “immunity gap.”\n\nKids who normally would have caught the virus in those years are instead catching it now.\n\nWho’s vulnerable to RSV\n\nThe CDC says most kids will catch RSV at some point before they turn 2. It’s a highly contagious virus that often doesn’t cause serious illness, except in adults who are elderly or have chronic heart or lung disease or a weakened immune system, and in some infants and children.\n\nThere’s no specific treatment for RSV and no vaccine. The symptoms usually last a week or two and clear up with plenty of fluids and rest.\n\nFor some kids, though, it can be a much more serious disease. RSV can be especially dangerous for preemies, newborns, children with weakened immune systems or neuromuscular disorders, and those under age 2 with chronic lung and heart conditions, the CDC says.\n\nRSV can turn into bronchiolitis, in which the small airways can become inflamed and congested, or pneumonia. A child may need to stay in the hospital so they can get extra oxygen or even mechanical ventilation to help them breathe.\n\nHow RSV spreads\n\nAn infected person can pass on RSV through a cough or sneeze. If the respiratory droplets land on a surface like a doorknob or desk and someone else touches it and then touches their face, they can get sick.\n\nRSV symptoms RSV is a common virus, but it can cause serious illness, especially in younger infants and older adults. Symptoms may appear in stages and not all at once, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSymptoms include: Runny nose Decrease in appetite Coughing and sneezing Fever Wheezing “In very young infants with RSV, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties,” according to the CDC.\n\nIt’s generally such a mild illness that adults often don’t realize they have it, or they think it’s nothing more than a cold or allergies and go on to interact with others.\n\n“It’s not a fatiguing virus the way influenza or Covid is, so you really do feel fine,” Edwards said. “And then what happens is, your neighbor has that beautiful baby, and you bring over a casserole, and you kiss that little baby because you feel fine. You don’t feel sick. And unfortunately, you pass it on to them, and sometimes they end up at the hospital.”\n\nOlder siblings can also pass the virus along to younger ones.\n\n“Babies slobber on toys and on each other and everything else, so day cares pass it along, too,” Edwards said.\n\nIf your child is coughing or lethargic, or if they just don’t seem like themselves, it’s a good idea to take them to their pediatrician. The doctor’s office will have the tests to figure out if it’s RSV, the flu, Covid-19 or strep.\n\nPediatricians say a trip to the ER may be necessary if a baby is dehydrated; if they have difficult, labored, shallow or rapid breathing; if they have a high fever or bluish skin; or if they become unresponsive. The CDC says most improve with supportive care and can often go home after a few days.\n\nHow to prevent RSV\n\nThe best ways to prevent RSV infections, doctors say, is to teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or into their elbows rather than their hands. Also try to keep frequently touched surfaces clean.\n\n“Hand hygiene is the single most important thing that we can do to keep ourselves and others safe,” said Davis, of the children’s hospital in Grand Rapids. She tells people to never touch their faces unless they recently washed their hands.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen kids or grownups are sick, they need to do one thing and one thing only, she said: “Stay home when you are sick so you won’t spread whatever respiratory illness you have.”\n\nSizemore, whose daughter is still in the hospital with RSV but seems to be getting better, also advises people to take the virus seriously.\n\n“I would like other parents to know they shouldn’t watch their child’s cough lightly and take symptoms seriously,” she said. “This could have been a much worse situation if we didn’t get Raegan help.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen Raenu Charles", "Jen Christensen", "Raenu Charles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/omicron-ba-5-variant-immunity-severity/index.html", "title": "Why the Omicron offshoot BA.5 is a big deal | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nOnce again, Covid-19 seems to be everywhere. If you feel caught off-guard, you aren’t alone.\n\nAfter the Omicron tidal wave washed over the United States in January and the smaller rise in cases in the spring caused by the BA.2 subvariant, it might have seemed like the coronavirus could be ignored for a while. After all, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in December that nearly all Americans had been vaccinated or have antibodies from a past infection. Surely all that immunity bought some breathing room.\n\nBut suddenly, many people who had recovered from Covid-19 as recently as March or April found themselves exhausted, coughing and staring at two red lines on a rapid test. How could this be happening again – and so soon?\n\nThe culprit this time is yet another Omicron offshoot, BA.5. It has three key mutations in its spike protein that make it both better at infecting our cells and more adept at slipping past our immune defenses.\n\nIn just over two months, BA.5 outcompeted its predecessors to become the dominant cause of Covid-19 in the United States. Last week, this subvariant caused almost 2 out of every 3 new Covid-19 infections in this country, according to the latest data from the CDC.\n\nLab studies of antibodies from the blood of people who’ve been vaccinated or recovered from recent Covid-19 infections have looked at how well they stand up to BA.5, and this subvariant can outmaneuver them. So people who’ve had Covid as recently as winter or even spring may again be vulnerable to the virus.\n\n“We do not know about the clinical severity of BA.4 and BA.5 in comparison to our other Omicron subvariants,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing Tuesday. “But we do know it to be more transmissible and more immune-evading. People with prior infection, even with BA.1 and BA.2, are likely still at risk for BA.4 or BA.5.”\n\nA ‘full-on’ wave\n\nThe result is that we’re getting sick in droves. As Americans have switched to more rapid at-home tests, official case counts – currently hovering around 110,000 new infections a day – reflect just a fraction of the true disease burden.\n\n“We estimate that for every reported case there are 7 unreported,” Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, wrote in an email.\n\nOther experts think the wave could be as much as 10 times higher than what’s being reported now.\n\n“We’re looking at probably close to a million new cases a day,” Dr. Peter Hotez said on CNN. “This is a full-on BA.5 wave that we’re experiencing this summer. It’s actually looking worse in the Southern states, just like 2020, just like 2021,” said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nThat puts us in the range of cases reported during the first Omicron wave, in January. Remember when it seemed like everyone everywhere got sick at the same time? That’s the situation in the United States again.\n\nIt may not seem like a very big deal, because vaccines and better treatments have dramatically cut the risk of death from Covid-19. Still, about 300 to 350 people are dying on average each day from Covid-19, enough to fill a large passenger jet.\n\n“That is unacceptable. It’s too high,” Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator for the White House Covid-19 Response Team, said at Tuesday’s briefing.\n\nDaily hospitalizations are also climbing in the United States. The fraction of patients needing intensive care is up by about 23% over the past two weeks. And other countries are experiencing BA.5 waves, too.\n\n“I am concerned that cases of Covid-19 continue to rise, putting further pressure on stretched health systems and health workers. I am also concerned about the increasing trend of deaths,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, at a news briefing Tuesday after the agency’s decision to maintain its emergency declaration for Covid-19.\n\nThe pandemic, he said, is “nowhere near over.”\n\nWhat’s at stake with continued spread\n\nThere are also more insidious health risks to consider. A recent preprint study that compared the health of people who’d been infected one or more times with Covid-19 found that the risk of new and sometimes lasting health problems rose with each subsequent infection, suggesting that reinfections are not necessarily benign.\n\nAlthough vaccination reduces the risk of getting long Covid, a certain percentage of people have lasting symptoms after a breakthrough infection.\n\nThat’s another reason why high numbers of Covid-19 cases are a big deal: Because the virus is still spreading wildly, it has every opportunity to mutate to make even fitter and more infectious versions of itself. It’s doing this faster than we can change our vaccines, leaving us stuck in the Covid-rinse-repeat period of the pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, pleaded with Americans to use all available tools to stop the spread of the virus, including masking, ventilation and social distancing.\n\n“We need to keep the levels of virus to the lowest possible level, and that is our best defense. If a virus is not very robustly replicating and spreading, it gives it less of a chance of a mutation, which gives it less of a chance of the evolving of another variant,” Fauci said in a news briefing.\n\nIn fact, this is already happening.\n\nMeet BA.2.75\n\nEven as the US comes to terms with BA.5, variant hunters around the world are closely watching another Omicron descendant, BA.2.75. It’s been detected in about 10 countries, including the United States, and seems to be growing quickly in India.\n\nBA.2.75 has nine changes in its spike region that distinguish it from BA.2 and about 11 changes compared with BA.5, according to Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSeveral of the mutations in BA.2.75 are in a region of the spike protein known to be an important place for antibodies to bind to stop the virus, said Ulrich Elling, a scientist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences who monitors coronavirus variants for that country.\n\nThere’s little information to go on: It’s still not known, for example, how BA.2.75 may compete against BA.5 or whether it causes more severe illness.

The CDC now estimates that there have been at least 2.8 million illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations and 1,300 deaths from influenza as of November 5.\n\nThe flu is notoriously hard to predict.\n\n“Among the people who study flu, there’s a little saying: ‘If you’ve seen one flu season, well, you’ve seen one flu season,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “The implication is that they’re all a little bit different from each other, and that’s certainly the case.”\n\nThis season, there have been about 5 flu hospitalizations for every 100,000 people, rates typically seen in December or January, CDC data shows. And in the most recent week, about 13% of lab tests – more than 1 in 8 – were positive for influenza, up from 9% the week before.\n\nAlthough the numbers are especially high for this time of year, experts say the trends are otherwise following an expected pattern, and the early arrival of flu season doesn’t necessarily mean it will last longer or be more severe.\n\n“The picture is pretty consistent across our different pieces of surveillance. There’s nothing there that makes me think that this virus is really different and causing more severe disease than we see typically with flu,” said Lynnette Brammer, an epidemiologist who leads the CDC’s domestic influenza surveillance team. “Flu can cause severe outcomes, but it’s not out of proportion this year compared to previous years. It’s not like we’re seeing a lot of hospitalizations without a lot of illness.”\n\nFlu activity has been highest in the South, CDC data shows. Data from Walgreens that tracks prescriptions for antiviral treatments such as Tamiflu suggests hotspots centered in Mississippi and Alabama, spreading from the Gulf Coast area, including Houston and New Orleans, up to Nashville.\n\nAs flu smolders in the South, RSV is showing early signs of slowing in the region, CDC data shows, even as it continues to ramp up in other parts of the country.\n\nNationwide, nearly 1 in 5 PCR tests for RSV were positive in the first week of November, reaching levels that the South saw a month ago. But in that region, fewer than 1 in 7 tests are now positive for RSV.\n\nRSV is a common respiratory virus that can cause serious illness, especially in younger infants, and it’s kept pediatric hospitals more full than usual in recent weeks.\n\nDespite the improvements in the South, overall burden on pediatric hospitals nationwide has not eased. More than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds and pediatric ICU beds have been in use for the past few weeks – up from an average of about two-thirds full over the past two years, according to federal data.\n\nOn Thursday, Dr. Brian Cummings, medical director of the Department of Pediatrics at Mass General for Children, said they’ve seen around 2,000 cases of RSV in October, and more than 1,000 in the first week of November.\n\n“It’s been escalating and been quite severe,” Cummings said during a news conference Thursday.\n\nMost infections have been treated in urgent care facilities and in the emergency department, and people are sent home, Cummings said. “But even if just 10 percent of those need hospitalization, it creates a lot of stress on health care facilities, and so what we are seeing is we’ve had over 250 hospitalizations for RSV alone on top of the other circulating viruses,” he said.\n\nThe pediatric ICU is full, Cummings said, and seven patients are waiting to be transferred in.\n\nAcross the country, the threat of Covid-19, while significantly less than it was a year ago, remains.\n\nNearly 25,000 people were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 in the first week of November, according to CDC data, a pace that’s forecast to hold steady for the next month, at least.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs multiple respiratory viruses continue to spread, experts emphasize the importance of vaccination, which is available for two of the three viruses in heavy circulation. But those numbers are lower than ideal.\n\nOne in 5 people still hasn’t gotten their first Covid-19 vaccine shot, CDC data shows, and less than 10% of the US population has gotten the updated Covid-19 booster.\n\nAnd millions fewer flu vaccines have been distributed this season than at this point in previous years.\n\n“You worry when you have an early season that people just haven’t had time to get vaccinated,” Brammer said. “But vaccine is the best tool that we have to prevent these severe outcomes.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/variants-covid-winter-surge/index.html", "title": "Quick and stealthy new Covid-19 variants are poised to drive a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA flurry of new Covid-19 variants appears to be gaining traction globally, raising fears of a winter surge.\n\nIn the United States, these are BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7, BA.4.6, BA.2.75 and BA.2.75.2. In other countries, the recombinant variant XBB has been rising quickly and appears to be fueling a new wave of cases in Singapore. Cases are also rising in Europe and the UK, where these variants have taken hold.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, says he thinks of them collectively as the Scrabble variants because they use letters that get high scores in the board game like Q, X and B.\n\nAs the US moves into the fall, Covid-19 cases are dropping. Normally, that would be a reason for hope that the nation could escape the surges of the past two pandemic winters. But virus experts fear that the downward trend may soon reverse itself, thanks to this gaggle of new variants.\n\nLumped together, the variants accounted for almost 1 in 3 new Covid-19 infections nationwide last week, according to the latest estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe updated bivalent booster vaccines and antiviral drugs like Paxlovid are expected to continue to be protective against severe outcomes from Covid-19 infections caused by the new variants.\n\nBut the new variants are particularly devastating for millions of Americans who have weakened immune systems. New research suggests that changes in these variants make them impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to help treat and prevent severe cases of Covid-19, and the US government has run out of money to incentivize the creation of new ones.\n\nA crowded field of rising variants\n\nIt’s not clear whether this gang of new variants will continue to run around together, each sharing a piece of the Covid-19 infection pie, or whether one will rise to outcompete the others, as has happened in previous surges.\n\nThough they each descend from slightly different branches of the Omicron family tree, these new offshoots have evolved to share many of the same mutations, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.\n\nSome experts think this convergence means we’ve entered a new phase of the evolution of the virus, one that will see circulation of several variants at the same time.\n\n“What is likely to happen is that we have several co-circulating, semi-dominate lineages going into the winter season,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\n“That’s because with convergent evolution, perhaps several different lineages can independently obtain similar transmissibility levels versus a single new variant taking over.\n\n“This is what predominantly happens for most pathogens, such as the flu and RSV,” Grubaugh wrote in an email. “Now that the virus has adapted pretty well to human transmission, most of what is circulating has high fitness.”\n\nMaria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 response technical lead for the World Health Organization, said Wednesday that the large mix of new variants was becoming more difficult for WHO to assess because countries were dialing back on their surveillance.\n\n“So we need to be prepared for this. Countries need to be in a position to conduct surveillance, to deal with increases in cases and perhaps deal with increases and hospitalizations. We don’t see a change in severity yet. And our vaccines remain effective, but we have to remain vigilant,” she said.\n\nInaction gives the virus an edge\n\nFor now, the Omicron subvariant BA.5 still holds the top spot in the US. According to CDC estimates, it caused about 68% of new infections in the US last week, but it is quickly being outcompeted by several new sublineages – notably BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nThe BQs each caused just 6% of new infections in the US last week, but in recent weeks, the share of new Covid-19 infections caused by these viruses has doubled every six to seven days – a rapid rate of growth against BA.5, which is already a highly fit virus, says Dr. Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nAnd these are just two of the new crop of Omicron descendants making a move.\n\n“The projections vary a little, but generally, most people feel somewhere in the middle of November that they’ll wind up being a substantial proportion and have bumped BA.5 off as the dominant variant,” Fauci told CNN.\n\nThese variants are different from BA.4 and BA.5, but they’re descended from those viruses, the result of genetic drift. So they share many parts of their genomes with that virus.\n\nTheir changes aren’t on the scale of what happened when the original Omicron arrived on the scene in November 2021. That strain of the virus, which is now long gone, came out of genetic left field, leaving researchers and public health officials scrambling to catch up.\n\nFauci says that this time, we are as ready as we could be for the latest batch of variants.\n\n“It isn’t that different from BA.5 that it would completely escape the protection that you would get from vaccine” – if people would just get the shot, Fauci said.\n\nThe bivalent booster vaccine, authorized in September, protects against the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\n“We have a BA.5 bivalent updated vaccine as a booster that we’re pushing people to do. It’s matched against the still-dominant variant, which is BA.5, and almost certainly will have a reasonably good degree of cross-protection against the BQ.1.1 and the others, and yet the uptake of these vaccines, as we are already in the middle of October, is disappointing,” he said.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the CDC, 14.8 million people have gotten an updated bivalent booster six weeks into the campaign promoting it. That’s less than 10% of the population that’s eligible to get one.\n\nThe poor uptake of the new boosters, combined with the immune evasiveness of the new variants and the waning of population immunity, is almost surely a recipe for rising cases and hospitalizations in the weeks ahead.\n\n“It’s probably going to be significantly bigger than the BA.5 wave, at least that’s what I expect,” said Mark Zeller, a project scientist who monitors variants at the Scripps Research Institute. But Zeller says he doesn’t expect this winter’s surge to reach heights of January’s Omicron wave.\n\nHotez says people shouldn’t panic about this news but should pay attention.\n\n“We’re underperforming as a nation with people getting their bivalent boosters,” Hotez said.\n\nThe genetic changes these variants share appear to help them escape the immunity created by vaccines and past infections – a recipe for reinfections and breakthrough infections, particularly for people who haven’t had an updated booster.\n\nCritical therapies could soon stop working\n\nCrucially, some of the variants also appear to be impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to ward off severe Covid-19 infections: an antibody treatment called bebtelovimab, which is made by Eli Lilly, and the combination of two long-acting antibodies in Evusheld, a shot made by AstraZeneca that helps keep people who are immunocompromised from getting sick in the first place.\n\nIf these antibodies stop working against the virus, the United States will still have Covid-19 antiviral drugs like Paxlovid, molnupiravir and remedsivir to help those at risk of severe complications.\n\nBut antibody therapies are particularly important for people with immune function that has been blunted by drugs, disease or age. These are the same people whose bodies don’t respond robustly to vaccines.\n\nThe antibodies are also needed to help people who can’t take antiviral therapies because of possible reactions with other medications.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha says the federal government has been spurring the development of new monoclonal antibodies during the pandemic by promising to purchase new therapies after they’re made.\n\nThe government can’t do that anymore, he said, because Congress has declined to pass additional funding for the Covid-19 response.\n\nAs a result, development of new antibodies – and other new therapeutics – is lagging.\n\n“So even if we got money today, it would take us many months to bring a monoclonal into the marketplace, and we don’t have the money today anyway,” Jha told CNN.\n\nJha said that means the nation is facing fall and winter with a smaller arsenal against the virus, just when it needs to expand its options.\n\n“There is not a monoclonal sitting ready to go tomorrow that we could just buy off the shelf,” he said.\n\nAntibodies are a losing proposition for companies because it takes millions of dollars of investment to make them and because the virus is evolving so fast, they might be effective for only a few months.\n\n“That is a terrible business model,” Jha said.\n\nThe administration has been thinking about ways to commercialize some parts of the Covid-19 response – to get out of the business of buying vaccines and therapies – ultimately passing the costs on to consumers and insurers. But Jha says the process has to be guided by “the needs on the ground and the realities of the virus.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe says current realities require that the government continue to incentivize the production of new therapies, and he expects that the Biden administration will again try to ask Congress to pass more funding to do that.\n\n“And the truth is that if we want monoclonals to protect high-risk people – which we do – then at this point, given the speed of viral evolution, the US government has to be a major player in that role,” Jha said. “The market cannot take care of it by itself.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/12/21/covid-omicron-not-march-2020/8967351002/", "title": "Omicron has overtaken delta in the US.

Back then, only a handful of people on Earth had been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Everyone's immune system was unprepared.\n\nToday, the majority of Americans have either contracted COVID-19 or been vaccinated once, twice or three times against it. That should – though there are no hard numbers to confirm it – provide people protection against severe disease and death.\n\n\"I think we should reassure people that if they've been vaccinated with two doses or naturally infected, they're likely protected against serious illness,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease expert and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nWhat's not clear is how people who have never been vaccinated or contracted COVID-19, or whose protection has waned, will fare if they catch omicron.\n\nAn experiment in hamsters, which should see results as soon as Tuesday, will provide the first indication of how people far from an infection or vaccination may fare if they are infected, said Galit Alter, an immunologist and virologist at Harvard Medical School and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard.\n\nMore vaccinated or previously infected people are contracting omicron than they did earlier variants, data shows. Vaccinated people, and perhaps those who've already been infected, are probably less likely to pass the virus to others.\n\nIt's still the unvaccinated and unprotected who are providing opportunity for the pandemic to continue, Offit said.\n\n\"You have a critical percentage of the population who are unvaccinated and shedding this virus,\" he said.\n\nSouth Africa's experience\n\nData out of South Africa, where omicron hit early and which has tracked cases carefully, is incomplete but encouraging.\n\nThere, hospitalization rates are much lower than in previous waves of infection, and the people hospitalized are not as sick as those infected with the beta or delta variants, said Salim Abdool Karim, a South African epidemiologist and infectious diseases specialist and member of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness.\n\nOnly 2% to 4% of infected people are ending up in hospitals, compared with about 20% during the beta and delta waves, Karim said. Before, two-thirds of those hospitalized had severe cases; now about one-quarter meet that criteria. Death rates are one-tenth as high as they were with previous variants.\n\n\"The clinical picture we are seeing is one of substantially less severe disease,\" he said.\n\nKarim said he doesn't have information on how many hospitalized patients had been previously infected or vaccinated, though he expects to get that soon.\n\nAnecdotally, Karim said, \"there's a preponderance of unvaccinated\" in hospitals, probably about 75% of patients. \"Is it more severe in that group? What's the picture? I can't tell at this point because I don't have that data.\"\n\nThe department of public health in South Africa decided people exposed to an infected person but not infected themselves do not have to quarantine.\n\nKarim said he recommended his government reinstitute mandates to minimize crowds. Officials didn't take his advice. But the general public has followed with their feet.\n\n\"Theaters are empty. Restaurants are half-empty with just a handful of people,\" he said. \"People have come to that conclusion themselves. … Indoor gatherings? No. No.\"\n\nOmicron is more contagious than other variants, he said: There were 35,000 to 45,000 cases in South Africa in the first month of the beta and delta waves and 133,000 cases in the first month of omicron.\n\nDenmark has seen similarly high rates of transmissibility and low rates of serious disease.\n\nUnlike other variants, which slowly made their way from country to country, omicron is exploding around the world simultaneously, said Jacob Lemieux, an infectious diseases staff physician at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\n\"In prior waves, we had a few weeks to watch what was happening in Western Europe and other places to know what we were in store for,\" he said. Not this time. \"We're not going to have the luxury of watching what's going to unfold in our country elsewhere in advance.\"\n\nThe US outbreak\n\nAlthough it's still early days in the American experience with omicron, the variant has overtaken delta in the USA. As of Saturday, the omicron variant accounted for 73.2 % of new COVID-19 infections in the nation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported, up from 12.6% the previous week.\n\n\"It's clear we're now waist-deep in the omicron wave,\" Lemieux said. \"The question is how severe is it going to be?\"\n\nIt may follow South Africa's pattern that the majority of people get nothing worse than a bad head cold. Or it may cause more hospitalizations, particularly among those who have waning or no protection, potentially overwhelming the health care system, which was already dealing with a wave of delta infections, he said.\n\nAt Texas Children’s Hospital, doctors are waiting to confirm how many cases are omicron versus delta, but pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization rates have more than doubled in four days, and the number of patients is in the double-digits.\n\nThe rate of positive tests jumped from well below 5% five days ago to 15% Monday, according to James Versalovic, co-chair of the Texas Children’s Hospital COVID-19 Command and the hospital’s pathologist-in-chief.\n\n“These are signals that tell us we have a surge beginning,” Versalovic said. “Every indication now is pointing in the same direction.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether children will react differently to omicron than they did to delta. Nor does the hospital know the vaccination status of the children over 5 (vaccinations are not authorized for those younger than 5), their parents’ vaccination status or whether any of the children was previously infected with COVID-19, he said.\n\nDr. Eric Topol, of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said he hears anecdotal descriptions that omicron infections differ from delta. People don't appear to be losing their smell or taste the way they did with earlier variants.\n\nIf true, that would be extremely good news, Topol said, because it would mean this variant isn't entering the brain and would take off the table the risk of neurological problems.\n\nOmicron appears not to get into the lung cells, according to studies from Hong Kong and the U.K. \"That was the most distinguishing feature (of COVID-19) until now,\" Topol said, and the reason it caused so much lung damage. \"I know of a few people who had really high fevers (with omicron),\" he said. \"No one's had pneumonia.\"\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWhat will happen with the virus remains uncertain.\n\n\"The virology community is kind of split 50-50 on whether this creature has big surprises in store for us or whether we've seen most of what it can do,\" Dr. Jeremy Luban, another member of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, said Monday.\n\nHe and others were surprised to see how many differences omicron has from its predecessor variants – without any obvious intermediate changes. \"The virus may be doing things that are not under our magnifying glass and we can't actually see,\" he said.\n\nIt may have given up some of its ability to cause harm when it became more transmissible, Luban said.\n\nEventually, a variant will become so dominant that no other will be able to outcompete it and the pace of change will slow down, Karim said. Some experts thought delta had reached that point. He expects there are several variants left to come.\n\nUntil then, and to combat the lingering uncertainties of omicron, everyone should get vaccinated and boosted, wear masks, open windows and avoid crowds, he and others said.\n\n\"We've learned the same lesson again and again,\" Luban said. \"The virus is transmitted in enclosed spaces with lots of people congregating. And masks work.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

This outbreak is mostly affecting people who live in Florida but has also affected some people who have traveled to Florida.”\n\nMeningococcal disease includes meningitis – infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord – and bloodstream infections. “Meningococcal disease can affect anyone and can be deadly,” the CDC said in its statement.\n\nThe bacteria is spread through sharing respiratory or throat secretions, such as saliva or spit. It normally takes close or lengthy contact, for example kissing or being close to someone who is coughing, to spread the bacteria.\n\nSymptoms include high fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea or vomiting or a dark purple rash, the CDC said.

Romero, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in the CDC news release. “Because of the outbreak in Florida, and the number of Pride events being held across the state in coming weeks, it’s important that gay and bisexual men who live in Florida get vaccinated, and those traveling to Florida talk to their healthcare provider about getting a MenACWY vaccine.”\n\nThe vaccine is offered at doctors’ offices, pharmacies, community health centers or local health departments, the CDC said, and insurance should cover the cost for people for whom the vaccine is recommended during an outbreak.

There were about 1,000 absences Wednesday, out of 2,600 students.\n\n“So far COVID tests have been negative but several students have tested positive for flu,” Naji said. “Typical signs and symptoms include cough, sore throat, runny nose, fever, and other upper respiratory infection symptoms. We are in close contact with San Diego County Public Health.”\n\nSan Diego County Public Health Services confirmed to CNN that it is investigating the large outbreak of respiratory and flu-like symptoms among students at Patrick Henry High School – as well as Del Norte High School in Poway, California.\n\n“Del Norte High School (in the Poway Unified School District) had nearly 400 students absent yesterday and Tuesday with cold and flu like symptoms,” Christine Paik, spokesperson at Poway Unified School District, told CNN on Wednesday. “Health officials have told us that the cold/flu season is definitely here and it’s hitting schools harder now that COVID restrictions are no longer in place.”\n\nSan Diego County Public Health Services announced Wednesday that “it is too early” to determine the cause of the outbreaks and that the county is evaluating.\n\n“We are coordinating with local school districts and are checking with other school campuses to try and figure out why so many students have been affected so suddenly,” Dr. Cameron Kaiser, the county’s deputy public health officer, said in an announcement Wednesday.\n\n“Unfortunately, we anticipated this would be a rough influenza season, and alongside COVID-19 other respiratory viruses are also making a rapid comeback,” Kaiser said. “If you haven’t already, now is the time to get your flu and COVID-19 shots to gain the extra protections afforded by the vaccines.”\n\nEarly increases in flu activity sweep the US\n\nAn early increase in seasonal flu activity has been reported in most of the United States, with the nation’s southeast and south-central areas reporting the highest levels of flu, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than a thousand patients have been hospitalized with flu this week, the agency said.\n\n“Nationally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories is increasing; however, activity varies by region,” CDC researchers wrote in the agency’s latest weekly flu report, published Friday.\n\nWhile current influenza activity is still overall low, the CDC’s report finds that activity is increasing in most of the country, with three jurisdictions experiencing moderate activity and six jurisdictions experiencing high or very high activity.\n\nThis week, 3.3% of respiratory specimens sent to clinical labs tested positive for influenza, according to the new report. That is a jump from the 0.1% of specimens that tested positive this time last year, and the 0.2% of specimens that tested positive this time in 2020.\n\nHowever, the new data suggest the nation might be returning to pre-Covid levels of flu, as around this time in 2019, 3.1% of specimens were reported as testing positive for flu.\n\nThe new CDC report also said that 1,322 patients were admitted to hospitals with influenza this week and there were three deaths in children this week associated with influenza.\n\nOverall, the most frequently reported flu viruses this week were influenza A (H3N2), according to the report, and 2.6% of outpatient visits to health care providers were for respiratory illnesses that included symptoms such as fever plus a cough or sore throat. That is above the national baseline, which is 2.5%.\n\n“An annual flu vaccine is the best way to protect against flu. Vaccination helps prevent infection and can also prevent serious outcomes in people who get vaccinated but still get sick with flu,” according to the report.\n\n“CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October. There are also prescription flu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness; those need to be started as early as possible.”\n\n‘It’s gathering speed already … about a month early’\n\nPredicting what influenza activity might look like in a particular year can be tricky, but doctors are bracing for “a very substantial” flu season, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\n“I’m concerned that we will have a very substantial influenza season coming up this year, very different from our two previous seasons,” he said.\n\nSigns of increased flu activity were first seen in the Southern Hemisphere this summer, and as more people in the Northern Hemisphere relax Covid-19 restrictions and return to socializing without masks and in large crowds, cases of flu are being reported. The widespread number of cases so early in the flu season is unusual.\n\n“Here we are in the middle of October – not the middle of November – we’re already seeing scattered influenza cases, even hospitalized influenza cases, around the country,” Schaffner, whose medical center at Vanderbilt University is part of a surveillance network that tracks hospitalized flu cases.\n\n“So we know that this virus is now spreading out in the community already. It’s gathering speed already. It looks to me to be about a month early,” Schaffner said.\n\nWhen people began isolating, social distancing and masking to slow the spread of Covid-19 in early 2020, flu all but disappeared in the US. As a result, most people haven’t been exposed to influenza for a few years, meaning immunity against flu viruses could be low and underscoring the need to get vaccinated.\n\nUS health officials are encouraging people to get their flu shots as soon as possible, said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“There’s definitely a push now to get flu vaccination to the top of people’s priority lists. We’re all concerned, having seen what’s going on in the Southern Hemisphere, in Australia, that this year’s flu season could be really, really rough, frankly,” Casalotti said.\n\nConcern has grown as officials also brace for possible surges this winter in Covid-19 and other common respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children.\n\nCasalotti said that the spread of influenza can have a significant effects on communities, especially since it can be hard to distinguish flu symptoms from those of Covid-19, common colds or allergies.\n\n“We’re already starting to see in some areas that flu is circulating,” Casalotti said. “Overall, flu activity is low nationwide, but it’s starting to tick up in the Southeast in particular.”\n\nA higher-dose flu shot for older adults\n\nIn August, as concern about the coming flu season grew, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices released a report updating its recommendations for the seasonal flu shot for this year.\n\nTypically, older adults get a higher dose of flu vaccine than younger adults, but in the latest update, ACIP recommended that adults 65 and older “preferentially receive” a higher dose or an adjuvanted flu vaccine.\n\n“There are three of the influenza vaccines that have been shown to work better in people aged 65 and older,” said Schaffner, who is a liaison representative to ACIP. “There is the high-dose vaccine, there’s another that has an adjuvant in it – an immune stimulant – and the third is a recombinant vaccine.” Recombinant flu vaccines do not involve the flu virus or chicken eggs in the manufacturing process.\n\n“If you look back at people aged 65 and older in previous seasons, already 80% of them were receiving one of these three vaccines,” he said. “What’s new this year is that the ACIP has made a distinctively preferential recommendation. They actually said if you’re vaccinating people aged 65 and older, preferentially use one of these three vaccines, and only if one of them is not available use the regular vaccine.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverall, the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine, especially people who could be pregnant – as the vaccine offers protection not only to them but to their baby, Schaffner said.\n\n“There’s an additional benefit,” he said. “Namely, the antibodies created in response to the vaccine, some of it crosses the placenta and goes into the newborn baby. So the newborn baby gets some of that protection during the first four to six months of its life, before we can actively vaccinate the baby.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/11/20/new-covid-omicron-variants-winter/10718706002/", "title": "New COVID variants BQ.1, BQ.1.1 dominate; what're omicron's ...", "text": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is bringing more variants our way, requiring a few changes to the fight against it.\n\nThe BA.5 variant of omicron, which has dominated the U.S. since early summer, is fading fast. According to data released Friday, half the cases in the U.S. are now due to two descendants of BA.5, called BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nNot much is known about those two variants, but the severity and duration of disease seem similar to the other omicrons, and milder than the original and delta variants.\n\nThe biggest challenge from the new variants will be for people who are immunocompromised because of disease or medications. Treatments designed to prevent and treat infection in the immunocompromised won't work against BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nGet weekly coronavirus updates in your inbox:Sign up for our newsletter now.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nWhat is the current COVID variant and what happened to omicron?\n\nThe omicron variant that caused so many infections last winter is still around, but it has split into many subvariants. The two subvariants – BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 – now account for half of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 now accounts for 24% of cases.\n\nAre the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 more dangerous?\n\nLab studies suggest the viral descendants of BA.5 and BA.2, which includes all the new dominant variants, might cause slightly more severe disease than BA.1 or the original omicron, said Jeremy Luban, a professor of molecular medicine, biochemistry and molecular biotechnology at UMass Chan Medical School.\n\nBut it's not clear whether that's true in the real world, he said, as lab studies can't capture factors like human behavior.\n\nThe new variants are clearly more transmissible because they are taking over and making people sick despite previous vaccinations and infections, he said in a Thursday news conference with other members of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness.\n\nWill vaccines and the bivalent booster still work against omicron variants?\n\nYes.\n\n\"Any kind of boost really reduces your chances of getting very sick from COVID,\" said Dr. Kathryn Stephenson, an infectious disease expert at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nPeople who got the bivalent booster will be more protected against a severe COVID-19 infection compared with those who are unvaccinated or got a vaccine long ago.\n\nIn a study posted Friday, Pfizer and its vaccine partner BioNTech say that the latest booster increases the level of neutralizing antibodies against both BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, which protect against infection.\n\nModerna reported similar results for its booster earlier in the week, and it said last week that its bivalent shot also showed “robust neutralizing activity” against the BQ.1.1 variant, suggesting it offers some protection against the newest strains.\n\nRead more about vaccines:\n\nWhat does BQ stand for?\n\nThe World Health Organization uses the Greek alphabet as a classification system to simplify understanding and avoid stigmatizing countries where strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 are identified.\n\nThe WHO named the original B.1.1.529 variant after the 15th letter, omicron. Within variants, the agency assigns numbers to sublineages.\n\nBA.5 was classified as an omicron variant but has mutations that distinguish it from other omicron subvariants, such as BA.1 and BA.2. BA.5 is the parental strain of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of the new omicron variants?\n\nThe symptoms of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 appear to be the same as for other COVID-19 variants. The most common symptoms include exhaustion, fever, a cough, congestion, shortness of breath, sore throat, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle aches or headache. Loss of smell, which originally characterized COVID-19 infections, is no longer as common.\n\nBefore you get sick:Have these essentials at home to ease cold, flu and COVID symptoms\n\nCan I get BQ.1 or BQ.1.1 if I've had BA.5?\n\nYes. Theoretically anyone is vulnerable if exposed to enough viral particles. But people who have been boosted or infected within the last three to six months are less likely to be infected again and certainly less likely to suffer severe disease, Stephenson said.\n\nWhat to do if I get infected by BQ.1 or BQ.1.1?\n\nIf you test positive for the coronavirus or feel sick with related symptoms, the CDC recommends:\n\nStay home for at least five days and isolate from other household members\n\nWear a well-fitted mask around others in the home\n\nIf you're fever-free for 24 hours and symptoms improve after the five days, the CDC says you can end isolation, but take precautions for five additional days. This includes wearing masks and avoiding travel.\n\nWhat if I have a compromised immune system?\n\nThis is a \"pretty scary\" time for people who don't have good working immune systems, either because of older age, diseases like cancer, or treatments that reduce immunity, Luban said.\n\nThe last two protective monoclonal antibodies don't work against the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 variants, said Jake Lemieux, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nThat includes Evusheld, which was used to prevent severely immunocompromised people from getting very sick with COVID-19. It's a big loss, he said: \"I do hope there will be a replacement drug for prophylaxis that retains activity against circulating variants.\"\n\nFlu, RSV and COVID: What to know about the 'tripledemic'\n\nDoctors are saying we're currently in a \"tripledemic\" with three respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, flu and RSV circulating simultaneously.\n\nVaccinating against both flu and COVID-19 will help limit severe infections, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\nThere are currently no vaccines or specific treatment for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, which can infect people repeatedly and are particularly dangerous for the very young and very old, he said.\n\nIt's not clear why, but both flu and RSV are circulating much earlier this year than they did before the pandemic, said Dr. Tina Tan, vice president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which held a news conference Friday that included her and Schaffner.\n\n\"Whether or not these will go back to normal (in future years), nobody knows,\" she said.\n\nTan, a pediatrician at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, said she knows everyone is ready for a \"new normal,\" but she worries that not enough people are getting COVID-19 boosters and annual flu shots, and that children and adults have fallen behind on other routine vaccinations as well.\n\n\"Vaccines need to be part of that new normal to prevent individuals from becoming ill with the viruses and bacteria that are circulating,\" she said. \"That is the new normal.\"\n\nRead more about this topic:\n\nCan we have a COVID-free Thanksgiving? Here are some tips.\n\nExtreme precautions are no longer needed, experts say. But Lemieux said people should be careful if they have very young, very old or immunocompromised people at their holiday gatherings.\n\nHe suggests guests use a home COVID-19 test before sitting down together in an enclosed space and that people who are sick shouldn't go at all.\n\n\"I don't want to say 'cancel Thanksgiving,' but I also don't want to say 'don't worry about respiratory viruses,'\" said Lemieux, who also worries about the flu and RSV getting passed around along with the turkey.\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n\n►If you develop cold symptoms, get tested for COVID-19: Take a test right away because the antiviral Paxlovid, which can help prevent severe disease in high-risk people, works only if given within five days of infection.\n\n►If you're traveling, wear a mask: Masking while traveling to celebrations also makes sense, said Dr. Lael Yonker, a pediatrician at Massachusetts General Hospital. She's had her children wear masks leading up to the holiday.\n\n►Get vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19: For Schaffner's family gathering, everyone must be vaccinated against flu and boosted against COVID-19, he said. \"No one wants to be a dreaded spreader,\" he said.\n\nWhen can we stop worrying about new variants?\n\nExperts have been waiting for the virus that causes COVID-19 to settle into a seasonal pattern and stop mutating so much, but it hasn't happened yet. While current vaccines are considered safe and very effective against severe disease, they do not prevent all infections.\n\nNext-generation vaccines, currently under development, could provide broader or longer-term protection against COVID-19. Companies are also exploring delivering the vaccine through the nose rather than by shots, which might provide more protection against infection.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech announced Wednesday that they have started a 180-person early-stage trial of a new candidate vaccine they hope will broaden and extend protection against the virus. The new vaccine will target the \"spike\" protein on the surface of the original virus plus the version of spike on the BA.5 variant, as well as a nonspike protein that doesn't seem to be mutating as much.\n\nThe trial will include three different doses and variations to see if the candidate vaccine is better than the current one.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}]}

Passed in the wake of the horrific 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, the state law provides police a path to ask a judge to temporarily bar dangerous individuals from possessing or purchasing a firearm. Since its creation, Florida judges have acted more than 8,000 times to keep guns out of the hands of people authorities deemed a risk to themselves or others, according to data maintained by the Office of the State Courts Administrator.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pomponio added another one to the list: A man accused of pointing two guns at his stepfather.\n\n“He was enjoying the whole thing,” the stepfather told the courtroom. His stepson’s wife even filmed the encounter, he said. “He said he wanted to eff me up.” One of the guns was later found in the bed of the stepson’s 11-year-old brother, a sheriff’s deputy told the courtroom.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent massacres in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, those looking to change the country’s gun laws see in Florida a blueprint to move forward – not only because leaders moved to restrict firearms, but because it emerged out of a Republican stronghold unofficially known as the “Gunshine State.”\n\n“The Florida law is a good law, and it’s a signal of what’s possible,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the most vocal advocates in Congress for gun control, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nIn Florida, a red flag policy, also known as risk protection orders, was one piece of a sprawling gun reform package that then-Gov. Rick Scott signed into law just three weeks after a teenage gunman killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It included $400 million in new spending for priorities like school security and mental health resources, and allowed trained school staff to carry firearms for the first time. Republican lawmakers also agreed to raise the age to own a gun to 21 and implemented a three-day waiting period to purchase most rifles.\n\n“I knew the time for thoughts and prayers, although necessary, was not enough,” said Bill Galvano, a Republican and the former state senator who sponsored the legislation.\n\nGalvano told CNN he began drafting the bill at his kitchen table after a tour of the carnage in Parkland. He incorporated ideas he had picked up from interviewing teachers and staff at the school. He was intent on including some gun safety reforms and focused on what he thought could pass. He was still learning how red flag laws worked when it was added to the draft.\n\nLooking at the data on the people who had guns taken away in Florida, Galvano says, “You have to believe that makes a difference.”\n\nResearch suggests red flags have made a difference where they’ve been implemented. One analysis of Connecticut’s red flag law, in place since 1999, found that for every 10 to 20 guns removed by a risk protection order led to one averted suicide. Another study found intimate partner homicides dropped in states where authorities can prohibit people convicted of “nonspecific violent misdemeanors” from possessing firearms.\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its Florida lobbyist, Marion Hammer, fiercely opposed the 2018 gun safety legislation. The organization’s influential scorecards loomed over the head of most Republican lawmakers. Hammer, a towering figure in Florida politics for decades, called GOP supporters “turncoat Republicans” and the organization urged its members to pressure lawmakers into abandoning the legislation. Galvano acknowledged that some of his colleagues were concerned the NRA would mount primary challenges against them in the coming elections.\n\nFormer state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, recounted the headwinds they faced with Republicans in power and the NRA throwing arounds its weight.\n\n“Yet, we rolled the NRA,” Moskowitz said, adding: “Not one Republican who voted for that bill in Florida has paid a political price for protecting kids and doing the right thing.”\n\nThe NRA responded by docking the scorecards of anyone who voted for the bill, and it knocked Scott from an A+ to a C. The organization also filed a lawsuit against the state over the new legislation. The case remains in court under appeal.\n\nHammer did not respond to an email for comment.\n\nStill, the law has survived as the legislature has grown more conservative and through the first term of Gov. Ron DeSantis. As a candidate in 2018, DeSantis said he opposed the gun restrictions in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act, telling one Florida newspaper he would have vetoed it.\n\nDeSantis has not publicly commented on the shooting in Uvalde and his office did not respond when asked if the governor supports Florida’s red flag law. He recently promised Florida would join other states that no longer require training or a permit to carry a firearm in public, like Texas.\n\nRepublicans lukewarm\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell previously told CNN he has encouraged Texas Sen. John Cornyn to work with Murphy on a middle-ground solution in response to the massacre inside the Uvalde elementary school.\n\nHowever, support for adopting risk protection orders like Florida’s appeared tepid as senators headed into the Memorial Day recess.\n\nEven Scott, who once called Florida’s response to the Parkland massacre “an example to the entire country that government can and must move fast,” now seems uncertain about a national risk protection policy. Scott, elected in 2018 to the US Senate, told The Washington Post: “It ought to be done at the state level.”\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of red flag laws have grown increasingly vocal as gun reform advocates hone in on the proposal.\n\n“What you’re essentially trying to do with the red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken. And it’s a really difficult thing to do, it’s difficult to assess whether somebody is a threat,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas. “Now if they are such a threat that they’re threatening somebody with a weapon already, well, then they’ve already broken the law. So why do you need this other law?”\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd defended Florida’s red flag law against Crenshaw’s characterization. Polk is a conservative county between Tampa and Orlando that former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by 14 points, and it is also the county that has issued more risk protection orders than any other in the state.\n\n“Let me tell Rep. Crenshaw, if that were so, then Florida, which is dominated by conservatives, the Republicans wouldn’t have passed (risk protection orders),” Judd said.\n\nJudd – who simultaneously describes himself as a law-and-order sheriff and a “Second Amendment guy” – defined a risk protection order as a “cooling off period” for people who have displayed dangerous behaviors. Some are experiencing a mental health episode or expressed a desire to hurt themselves. Others have made threats that may not rise to an arrest, or they are charged with a crime that won’t result in a loss of gun charges. The risk protection orders, he said, allows law enforcement to focus on prevention instead of reacting to an active shooter when “it’s too late.”\n\nIn a Polk courtroom last week, a young woman described her boyfriend putting a loaded gun to his head in front of her and his mother. In another case, a prosecutor told the judge that a woman named Carol “threatened to burn down her house and shoot any responders that would get there.” In both instances, the judge took away their ability to have a firearm.\n\nDavid Carmichael, an attorney who represents local police departments in Polk County in these cases, says in his experience, about half of the people facing risk protection orders willingly give up their right to a weapon without having to go through a hearing.\n\n“They don’t have an objection,” he said. “They say, ‘I’m in a bad place. I fully understand it’s a good idea.’ I expected more people to aggressively defend themselves.”\n\nRisk protection orders\n\nIn Florida, orders last for one year, and can be extended for another 12 months. At the time of the shooting in Uvalde, there were 2,845 people under risk protection orders in Florida, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nJudges may require someone to undergo a mental health or substance abuse treatment before the order is lifted. However, unless convicted of a felony, most people are likely to get their firearms returned after a year.\n\nTampa city attorney Michael Schmid described an individual under the influence of a drug who was acting strange in public and making people uncomfortable. Police confronted him and found guns in every part of his car. They later searched his home and found an arsenal of 100 guns “if not more,” Schmid said, with some hidden in stuffed animals and a cat scratch post. A sign in the house said, “If they ever come in my house, I’m not going easy.”\n\n“I hope he accomplished something during the cooling off period and having him evaluated helped,” Schmid said. “But at the end of the day, he will get his guns back.”\n\nAs it is, some activists don’t see red flag laws as going far enough to curb gun violence. Many Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for the 2018 legislation to include a ban on the AR-15, the weapon used in the vast majority of mass shootings, and other semiautomatic long guns.\n\nIn a news conference with Florida Democrats in response to the Uvalde tragedy, state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando noted some states allow loved ones and family members to petition the courts for a risk protection order. Those are the people “who know the person best,” he said. Florida limits petitions to law enforcement.\n\n“That’s why it’s important in Florida that we expand on the good move we made in enacting the red flag law in the first place, to make sure we can continue to prevent these instances of gun violence,” Smith said.\n\nMoskowitz, now running to represent Parkland in the US House of Representatives, said moving the ball 20 yards is still a victory. “And you come back and you move the ball another 20 yards.”\n\nGalvano said Florida was able to act because the legislation “had aspects that both parties wanted and liked and aspects that both parties did not support.”\n\n“Look at the politics and understand we are a conservative state,” Galvano said. “We’re red by all accounts. And we were still able to make some reforms that were not traditional.”\n\n‘It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect’\n\nTony Montalto’s daughter Gina was killed inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. Within days of the massacre, he and other Parkland parents became a unified force in pressuring Florida lawmakers to take meaningful action.\n\nMontalto, as president of Stand with Parkland, has spent the last four years urging more states to follow Florida’s lead in hopes no parents would have to experience his pain. There are 19 states plus the District of Columbia with red flag laws, and 14 were passed after Parkland.\n\nIt’s a legacy that makes Montalto proud, but makes it all the more difficult to watch a similar tragedy unfold in Texas.\n\n“They would’ve been a lot safer had they taken advantage of simple things, such as red flags that we passed in Florida. This is simple stuff that keeps the majority of people safe,” Montalto said. “We heard extremists say this was a gun grab and all these bad things would happen. But the sky has not fallen. People still own guns. People still hunt. People still protect themselves. And yet, thousands of people in Florida have had their guns taken away to protect the majority of people.”\n\n“We had President Trump support red flag laws. We’ve seen President Biden support red flag laws. How come Congress has not acted?”\n\nShannon Frattaroli, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, is reviewing risk protection cases in six states, including Florida. Her research has found hundreds of examples of police using red flag laws to remove weapons from people who have threatened mass violence.\n\n“If even 1% of the orders that are issued in response to a threat of mass violence makes a difference, that’s pretty powerful,” Frattaroli said. “It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno Leyla Santiago Denise Royal", "Steve Contorno", "Leyla Santiago", "Denise Royal"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/us/mexico-border-encounter-data-analysis-cec/index.html", "title": "A 'radical shift' at the border is making things tougher for Biden | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s a major detail missing from many conversations about the rising number of migrants coming to the US-Mexico border.\n\nDecades ago, the vast majority of migrants attempting to cross the border between ports of entry were Mexican. A few years ago, most came from the Central American countries known as the Northern Triangle: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nBut now, according to Border Patrol statistics, the number of people coming from outside those places – from countries such as Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela – is growing fast.\n\nDavid Bier calls it a “radical shift” and a “new phenomenon that no one is talking about.” Bier, the associate director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, pointed out this change in a recent thread on Twitter. It’s a telling detail, he says, that reveals a lot about what the Biden administration is facing at the border, and why the situation has been so difficult to solve.\n\nTo better understand this trend, CNN dove into the data. Here’s a look at what we’re seeing, why this change is so significant, why it’s happening, what this looks like on the ground and what could happen next.\n\nWhat we’re seeing: There’s a big change in who’s coming to the US-Mexico border. A large number of migrants from Mexico and the Northern Triangle are still making the journey. But the number of migrants from other countries, represented here in purple, has significantly increased.\n\nBack in 2007, the number of migrants in this “other” category was negligible. But since then, it’s grown dramatically — 11,000% — with the sharpest increase in just the past two years.\n\nUS Border Patrol encounters still show more migrants from Mexico attempting to cross the Southwest border in July than from any other individual country. But so far this fiscal year, for the first time, encounters with migrants from outside Mexico and the Northern Triangle are outpacing encounters with migrants from either of those regions.\n\nA handful of countries make up a large portion of this growing group at the border. The number of times US Border Patrol officials at the Southwest border encountered migrants from Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela has increased dramatically over the past two years.\n\nOne word of caution about the numbers: For this analysis, we used US Customs and Border Protection statistics on Border Patrol encounters – which include both migrants who are apprehended and detained, at least temporarily, at the border, and migrants who are immediately expelled to their home countries and Mexico. This data gives us the best overall picture of who is arriving and what’s happening at the border.\n\nBut officials have acknowledged the numbers can be inflated, because they include some migrants who were turned back under the “Title 42” public health policy, then tried to cross again. In other words, the same people can be counted multiple times.\n\nThis is an issue that mostly affects migrants from Mexico and the Northern Triangle, who are more likely to be subjected to Title 42 restrictions than migrants from other countries.\n\nWhy this is significant: Doris Meissner, who directs US immigration policy work at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington, says the rise in additional nationalities at the border “makes border enforcement all the more complicated.”\n\nFor decades, many border policies have been designed with Mexican migrants in mind, she says, but it’s much more difficult to deport people to other countries. There are limits to which nationalities can be turned back under Title 42, for example. And frosty diplomatic relations can affect deportations, too.\n\n“These populations … require different kinds of responses,” Meissner says. “We have not established an asylum system that is in any way up to the level of the challenge that this change brought about.”\n\nBier says the groundwork for the trend was laid during the Trump administration. But the situation President Joe Biden is facing at the border is different from anything previous administrations have encountered.\n\n“What he’s dealing with, in terms of trying to restrict entry to the country, is completely different than what any other president has had to deal with,” Bier says. “Those realities are not really reflected in just the overall numbers. Looking at the number of people crossing, it’s just not representative of the unique circumstances of having to handle flows from so many different countries and many countries outside of this continent.”\n\nAdministration officials argue they’re working hard to address the root causes of migration. And Biden has described it as a “hemispheric challenge.”\n\nBut Bier says officials aren’t doing enough.\n\n“The Biden administration can’t respond to this new reality with the same old playbook,” he said on Twitter. He told CNN that’s exactly what the administration seems to be doing. “It’s a lot of the same types of responses,” he says.\n\nWhy it’s happening: There’s no simple reason why this is occurring, Bier says.\n\n“There are as many answers,” he says, “as there are countries represented in that group.”\n\nCBP Commissioner Chris Magnus recently told CBS News it’s impossible to pinpoint all the factors driving migrants to make the journey, given how complicated situations are in their home countries. “It’s a very complex set of dynamics,” he said.\n\nMeissner, who served as commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993-2000, says the pandemic has played a major role by intensifying economic pressures.\n\nOther factors are also at play. An increase in Cubans making their way to the US, Meissner says, can be partially attributed to a new air route between Cuba and Nicaragua. CNN’s Patrick Oppmann reported that after Nicaragua dropped its visa requirements for Cubans, people began posting online ads selling their homes with “everything inside” to pay for the expensive airfare.\n\nDeteriorating economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care are increasingly pushing Venezuelans to leave, and a growing Venezuelan community in the United States is also a draw, Meissner says.\n\nFor Colombians and Nicaraguans, economic instability – compounded by the pandemic — has been the main driver of migration, she says, but politics are also playing a role.\n\n“Rising repression under the Ortega regime, especially during the recent presidential election, has cemented the belief among many Nicaraguans that the country’s political turmoil will not be resolved in the short term,” Meissner says.\n\nAnd those who previously saw neighboring Costa Rica as a destination, she says, are more likely to look elsewhere due to decreasing job prospects there.\n\nRising inflation and unemployment in Colombia are fueling more migration, Meissner says. Social unrest after a wave of protests in 2021 and political divisions that intensified during the recent presidential election are also likely influencing migrants’ decisions, she says.\n\nWhat this looks like on the ground: This isn’t just something we can see with statistics. Both migrants and Border Patrol officials say they’re noticing the shift.\n\nMore Cubans than ever are leaving the island. See where they're going 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nYuma Border Patrol Sector Chief Chris Clem told CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez last month that the large number of nationalities crossing the border was straining his agents.\n\n“The countries we’re receiving now — those nationalities are flying in, arriving to the border, and they’re having to be processed and there’s just so many of them that it is posing a challenge to the workforce,” he said.\n\nSpeaking to CNN earlier this year, one Cuban migrant described a house in the Mexican desert where she’d waiting with others to cross the border.\n\nOne room was packed with Cubans, she said. And another was full of people from different countries.\n\n“There were Colombians, Bangladeshis, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Haitians,” she said. “It felt like the whole world was in there.”\n\nWhat could happen next: Like everything connected with the border, there’s a lot of debate about what officials should do about this.\n\nBiden administration officials have repeatedly emphasized that the border is not open. But those who favor increasing immigration restrictions argue that administration policies have incentivized more people to try their luck at crossing the border illegally. Some – including more than 50% of Republicans, according to a recent NPR-Ipsos poll – say they believe it’s completely true that the “US is experiencing an invasion at the southern border.” And some Republican candidates are emphasizing this message as midterm elections loom, pledging they’ll do more if elected to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nBier and Meissner say the changing makeup of migrants at the border shows how badly the US immigration system needs an overhaul.\n\n“Many, if not most, of these people are not likely to be eligible for asylum, even though they’re fleeing very difficult conditions,” Meissner says. “We desperately need to have Congress address the immigration laws and make it possible for there to be other legal pathways to come to the US.”\n\nAnd countries across the Western Hemisphere need to work together and address migration as a shared responsibility, she says.\n\nSo far, there’s no sign this trend is slowing down. And Bier and Meissner say they don’t expect it will.\n\n“It’s entirely plausible to think that this could continue for many years,” Bier says, “because we don’t have the infrastructure to expel people as fast as they come in.”", "authors": ["Catherine E.

Visitors, homeless people and commuters clutching cups of iced coffee crammed the street. Nearby, pedestrians dodged yellow cabs, double-decker tour buses and electric bicycles.\n\n“Where did all these people come from?” Flores, a 27-year-old undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, remembered thinking last month upon seeing New York up close for the first time. “It was different from everything we saw on the way here.”\n\nIndeed, a wave of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers arriving in New York in recent months – fleeing economic insecurity and political upheaval in Central and South America – have seen much during their months-long journey across more than a half dozen countries. They have traversed a remote, lawless jungle and rugged mountains, at times passing the corpses of others who perished along the way. They described roadblocks manned by rogue police officials or members of criminal and paramilitary groups who extorted money from them.\n\nAsylum seekers arrived to New York City's Port Authority station by the busload last month. NYC Immigrant Affairs\n\nHungry and tired, they reached the southern border and crossed into the United States, in Texas and other states on the Mexican frontier. After processing and receiving dates for asylum hearings, they were released by immigration officials to local charities and, in some cases, offered free trips to New York.\n\nThousands have chosen the Texas-chartered buses to New York City and the nation’s capital – where they have no connections or know where to turn for help. Many, like Flores and her family, ended up in New York’s overburdened shelter system, embarking on yet another uncertain odyssey as the newest members of the ever burgeoning homeless population.\n\n“A social worker at a Texas shelter told us there were free buses to New York,” Flores said on the phone from a city-run shelter for families in the Bronx. “We got on the next one and here we are.”\n\nNYC makes new arrivals ‘our priority’\n\nBy the last week in August, Texas had bused nearly 9,000 migrants to New York City and Washington, DC, as Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has sought to highlight what he said is the Biden administration’s failure to secure the border.\n\nTexas reported on August 26 that more than 7,400 migrants had been transported by the state to DC since April, and more than 1,500 to New York City since August 5, providing what Abbott’s office termed “much-needed relief to our overwhelmed border communities.”\n\nAbbott’s office did not immediately reply to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nOn Friday morning, three buses from Texas delivered another 110 migrants to New York, city officials said.\n\nTexas has spent more than $12 million busing migrants to Washington and New York as of August 9, according to figures from the Texas Division of Emergency Management. Abbott’s office has said migrants are transported out of state only with their written permission but it’s unclear whether they’re given other options.\n\nAbbott and others who favor increasing immigration restrictions argue that Biden administration policies have provided an incentive for more people to cross the border illegally. Some Republican candidates have pushed the narrative of a migrant invasion as midterm elections approach, pledging they’ll do more to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nOn Wednesday, Abbott added Chicago to the list of cities where his administration is busing migrants.\n\n“President Biden’s inaction at our southern border continues putting the lives of Texans — and Americans — at risk and is overwhelming our communities,” Abbott said in a statement.\n\nChicago received 75 Venezuelan migrants from Texas – who were dropped off at Union Station Wednesday night, according to Mayor Lori Lightfoot. She called Abbott “a man without any morals, humanity or shame.”\n\n“This is not something that we budgeted for, but it’s something that we must do. So we will figure out the finances,” Lightfoot said Thursday, adding that more buses were expected.\n\nManuel Castro greets migrants exiting a bus from Texas at the Port Authority on August 30. Castro himself crossed the US-Mexico border with his mother when he was 5. Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nNew York City has processed about 8,800 migrants in its shelter system since April, with about 6,700 still in shelters, a city official told CNN Thursday. City officials had said the figure included more than 1,000 children. Many migrants come to New York on their own with the financial assistance of nonprofits.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Abbott’s actions are throwing the federal system for processing migrants “out of whack” and criticized the governor for not coordinating with federal authorities.\n\nGenerally, migrants are processed by authorities, released and allowed to move throughout the US while they await immigration court proceedings. They are often released in Texas and other border states, and make their way to other parts of the country.\n\nThe busing campaign has led to sparring between Abbott and New York Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat whose administration has accused the governor of using human beings as political pawns and whose city has been long considered a sanctuary for migrants. The mayor has asked the federal government for more resources, including housing assistance. The White House said it is in touch with Adams and committed to FEMA funding and other support.\n\n“These individuals and families arrive hungry, thirsty and some need medical attention,” Manuel Castro, Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, told CNN Tuesday. “So that is our priority – to make sure that these people are being supported and in comfort because what they’ve been through is just so devastating.”\n\nCastro himself crossed the US-Mexico border with his mother when he was 5. He has been greeting migrants at the much maligned Port Authority terminal, a notorious commuter gateway once called “a hall of unfathomable nightmares” by the website Failed Architecture.\n\nA quest to give them their ‘humanity back’\n\nWhile city officials say they were initially caught off guard with the almost daily, unannounced arrival of charters, they mobilized – with the help of nonprofits – to set up a sectioned-off receiving area at the terminal. The migrants receive medical attention and rapid Covid-19 tests, food, clothing, prepaid phones, toiletries, legal assistance and transportation to temporary shelter. Many arrive without money, with just the clothes on their backs.\n\n“We know the trauma these families are going through but this is extra what’s happening here,” said Jose Lopez, co-executive director of the immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New York.\n\nThe nonprofit has volunteers at the terminal, distributing phones and cash assistance at tables set up in the receiving area.\n\n“Many of these families from Venezuela have traveled months on their feet and across the Rio Grande to get here. That is a treacherous trip. And imagine doing that with a three-year-old,” Lopez said.\n\n“I have a two-year-old and a five-year-old at home and the first family I met had a three-year-old girl who just looked around and had no understanding of what was happening. I needed to step away from the table for a minute. Her family was asking for resources. I asked the little girl what she had picked up from the tables. She said, ‘I just have Mami and Papi.’ ”\n\nLast week, at 6:45 a.m. on Thursday, the first two buses of the day pulled up alongside the terminal, one block west of Times Square, the so-called “Crossroads of the World.” Castro and community activists greeted passengers outside the buses with handshakes and applause – a procession of children covered in blankets, mothers clutching toddlers, and young men carrying backpacks and wearing flip flops. One man needed a wheelchair to get inside. Another migrant was taken away in an ambulance.\n\n“Dozens of volunteers … show up early in the morning and try to give those asylum seekers their humanity back,” said Alexander Rapaport, a founder of Masbia, a Jewish nonprofit that provides meals for the new arrivals.\n\nMost migrants end up in the city’s overcrowded homeless shelter system, which housed more than 50,000 people as of Thursday night, according to the nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless, which monitors shelter census reports. Some wait hours to be reunited with relatives who live in the area. Others, looking confused and disappointed, tell volunteers they believed they were headed to another city or state. New York is using 17 hotels as emergency shelters, a city official told CNN.\n\nFor now, the migrants will have to rely on a vast, longstanding social safety net created by nonprofits and city agencies, easing access to government resources and benefits for housing, healthcare and food.\n\n‘We could not stay there’\n\nA bus carrying migrants who crossed the border from Mexico into Texas arrives at the Port Authority bus station in Manhattan on August 25. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nFlores and her family have been staying at a crowded family shelter in the Bronx, where, she said, the language barrier makes it difficult to communicate with staff and residents.\n\nWhen they arrived in Texas last month, she said, they were released without money and no place to go. A social worker at a church-run shelter offered them free bus tickets to New York.\n\nThe family left Maracaibo, on Venezuela’s northwest coast, on May 18.\n\n“We were going hungry,” she said. “We could not stay there. There is nothing. If you get sick, you die… There is no future there. The future is here.”\n\nFlores and other migrants described the days it took to cross the Darién Gap, the more than 60 miles of dense rain forest, steep mountains and swamps along the Colombia-Panama border. It is one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world.\n\n“We spent seven days in the jungle with another family,” Flores said. “A guide abandoned us but we were fortunate to make our way out.”\n\nBy the time Flores’ family reached the northern Mexican city of Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, she said they were exhausted, hungry and penniless – having paid hundreds of dollars at roadblocks from Guatemala to Mexico.\n\nLast Thursday, Venezuelan asylum seekers Manaure Fernandez, 25, and Wilber Salvatierra, 23, emerged from the bus terminal with plastic bags after stepping off a Greyhound bus from San Antonio. A charity had paid for the $270 bus fare, they said.\n\nMigrants wait in line last month outside the Port Authority after arriving from Texas. Yuki Iwamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFernandez said he left Venezuela in late May. He was robbed of all his money in the Darién Gap – about $800 – by three masked armed with rifles. The men told the migrants said they were part of a paramilitary group. Fernandez said he walked most of the way to the US border – a journey of roughly 2,500 miles over Central America alone.\n\n“On foot I crossed Costa Rica, Nicaragua, parts of Guatemala and parts of México,” he said. “Sometimes people helped with food and cash.”\n\n“There were many good people along the way,” said Salvatierra. “In Panama, people stopped on the road and gave us food and water. They said they could not take us because they could be jailed for transporting migrants.”\n\nSalvatierra said he had migrated to Chile in 2018, supporting himself as well as his parents back home by working construction jobs. He raised about $1,400 and decided to head north in late June.\n\n“The money ran out by the time I got to Guatemala,” said Salvatierra, who clutched a miniature copy of the New Testament.\n\n“It was always in my hand,” he said the small book. “I’m not religious but I have faith. I carried it from Chile to Peru, from Ecuador to Colombia, across the Darien and Panama, from Costa Rica to Nicaragua, from Honduras to Guatemala and Mexico.”\n\nThe two migrants, who met in Texas, and others said they encountered bodies along desolate stretches of the Darién Gap. Those who were injured or ill were usually left behind to die, they said.\n\n“We embarked across the Darién with a total 339 people,” Salvatierra said. “About 230 reached Panama. Many died. We saw bodies … on the side of rivers. A friend traveling with his young son said he could not stop thinking of a dead child he saw.”\n\nFernandez and Salvatierra, standing under the glittering billboards near Times Square, asked a stranger if he knew of available jobs in the city. They’re staying at the intake shelter for single adult men in Manhattan until beds can be found in a longer-term facility.\n\n“We’re fortunate to have made it this far,” said Salvatierra, clutching his New Testament and court papers for his first immigration hearing next month, “even if we don’t have anyone here.”", "authors": ["Ray Sanchez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/04/americas/chile-rising-violence-drugs-intl-latam-cmd/index.html", "title": "As drug cartels expand their reach across Latin America, Chile takes ...", "text": "Santiago, Chile CNN —\n\nOn May 1, Francisca Sandoval, a young Chilean reporter, traveled to a commercial district of the capital, Santiago, to cover a union rally commemorating International Workers’ Day. It would be her final report.\n\nDuring the demonstration, violent clashes broke out between local gangs, protesters, and the police. A group of armed gang members fired shots, leaving three people injured, including Sandoval. The 29-year-old journalist died 12 days later.\n\nSandoval’s death has shed a spotlight on an astronomical rise in lethal violence recorded in the country. Similar incidents have long plagued countries such as Colombia and Brazil, but in Chile it’s a fairly new phenomenon. Data ranges across Chile’s public entities, however all present alarming figures. Between 2016 and 2021, homicides rose by 40%, according to Chile’s Department of Crime Prevention. Meanwhile, the National Prosecutor’s office found that murders rose by 66% from 2016-2020.\n\nAs homicides – and the use of firearms – continue to multiply, public safety has become one of newly elected President Gabriel Boric and his government’s top challenges. He is battling both a powerful influx of drug trade-related criminal activity in cities as well as drug traffickers who are exploiting historic tensions between the state and indigenous communities in the south – and who are now gaining control of territory amid an outbreak of violence.\n\nPolitically and economically stable, the country has long registered low crime rates compared to the rest of the region. Chile’s homicide rate stands at 3.6 per 100,000 people as of 2021, according to Insight Crime, a think-tank that provides information about organized crime in the Americas. Compared with Venezuela, at 40.9 per 100,000 people; Colombia, at 26.8 per 100,000; and Brazil, at 18.5, Chile still ranks low in comparison regionally, according to the organization’s annual “Homicide Round-Up” report. In the United States, the murder rate reached 7.8 per 100,000 in 2020, marking the highest annual increase in the rate of homicides in 100 years, according to CDC data.\n\nChileans call for justice at a vigil for the late journalist Francisca Sandoval in Santiago on May 13. Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, the Insight Crime report also states that “while Chile long avoided the type of criminal activity and gangs that plagued other countries, that no longer appears to be the case.”\n\nChile´s Department of Crime Prevention reported that homicides increased by nearly 30% between 2019 and 2020, with police attributing the rise to the pandemic, economic slowdown, and a resulting increase in illicit trade. While homicides dropped by 21.8% between 2020 and 2021, cumulative figures since 2017 show an overall uptick in the murder rate.\n\n“Chile’s situation is worrisome,” Juan Pablo Luna, a political scientist at the Institute of Political Science of the Catholic University of Chile told CNN, adding that it is not alone as it descends into violence.\n\n“Countries where the state is relatively strong and with solid democracies were supposed to be immune to this kind of scenario, but now we see that it was an illusion,” Luna said.\n\nHe pointed to Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Ecuador, among others in the region, who have also been confronted with rising crime.\n\nEcuador’s statistics are particularly striking, with homicides climbing by 84.4% in the past year, according to the country’s National Institute of Statistics and Census. In Uruguay, the Ministry of Interior recently said there had been more than a 33% increase within a year. In Peru, the government declared a state of emergency in Lima and the region of Callao earlier this year to fight crime, targeting mostly contract killings. And in Paraguay, murders by hitmen also rose significantly last year, according to Insight Crime.\n\nExperts attribute the rise in violence across the region to the expanding reach of global crime networks.\n\nAlejandra Mohor, a sociologist at the Center for Public Safety Studies of the Public Affairs Institute at the Universidad de Chile told CNN that “we are witnessing a higher infiltration of international organized crime in these countries.”\n\n“Because of globalization, the type of crimes we see have changed. In extremely violent countries like Colombia or Venezuela, you may not notice it, but in Chile, Ecuador Peru, Bolivia and probably Argentina, the level of specialization of this criminal business is having a huge impact because it´s new,” Mohor said.\n\nHowever, this expansion in Chile hasn’t happened overnight.\n\nA police officer patrols Santiago's Yungay neighborhood in April. Tamara Merino/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nNew criminal strategies have progressively developed over the past decade, but authorities failed at anticipating how seriously it would affect society, experts say.\n\nIn 2011, for example, Santiago Metropolitan Region’s Coroner Services warned in a report that gun-related murders were trending upwards. “The increase in deaths by firearms among young people in our country is a phenomenon that should draw our attention,” the report stated.\n\nBut it didn´t gain much traction with law enforcement or city officials, Mohor said. As violence grew, public policies implemented by the successive governments failed to address the basic needs of many low-income neighborhoods, which in turn, provided fertile ground for criminal groups to settle – and for the drug trade to proliferate.\n\n“We have people living in segregated areas, far from their workplace, with no good public transportation, and no schools or health services available. And when the state is absent, organized crime starts to fill that void,” she said.\n\nIn a 2021 article from the Urban Violence Research Network, researchers said that inequality in Latin America felt by the poor and working class with “few other options for survival” made them “easy recruits into the drug trade.”\n\n“The cocaine trade integrates marginalized territories that have been abandoned by the state into global markets and acts as a driver of development,” the organization said.\n\nParadoxically, prosperity is also considered a cause of the rising violence. More money means more drugs, according to Luna, and the commodities boom that favored South America until 2014 helped illicit businesses to thrive. Higher drug consumption also followed the increase of purchasing power, attracting new actors to the illegal economy, and consolidating southern drug trafficking routes.\n\nAll these factors triggered new territorial disputes between gangs and more violence in Chile, as well as in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Ecuador.\n\n‘Surrounded by drug dealers’\n\nN. G., who CNN is not identifying fully for safety concerns, lives in Santiago’s impoverished El Bosque neighborhood and has felt that transformation first-hand. The 28-year-old has lived with her mother in the same house since she was born – but now barely recognizes their block.\n\n“When I was a child, my main worry was that my mother would find me playing in the street instead of doing my homework when she got back home. Now I barely go out,” she said. “We live surrounded by drug dealers.”\n\nMost of the time, she says she is scared.\n\n“Every day we hear fireworks, because dealers use them as a signal that drug loads arrived, because there is a narco-funeral, or just to cover the noise of the shootings. We seldom see the police – we can’t live in peace,” she said.\n\nN. G. said that such insecurity has gotten worse since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Experts explain that the economic crisis, a rise in migrant smuggling along the Bolivian-Chilean border and police corruption have only exacerbated the problem, allowing organized crime to take on a whole new dimension.\n\nChilean police oversee a large seize of drugs, including cocaine and cannabis, in April. Patricio Cortes B./MinInter/ULA/Reuters\n\nLast September, the Chilean Observatory on Drugs warned about the rise of two Mexican cartels (the Sinaloa and the Jalisco New Generation) and a Colombian cartel (Cartel del Golfo) in Chile. Mexican cartels have also increased their operations in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, according to Ernesto López Portillo, coordinator of the public safety program at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City.\n\nAnother notorious cartel that’s also now made their mark in Chile is the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua, one of the continent’s most dangerous criminal organizations, according to Insight Crime and Ximena Chong, a chief prosecutor in Santiago. Its leaders have taken advantage of the migration crisis in the north to tighten their grip on new territories, according to Insight Crime.\n\nTo cement their hold, transnational criminal groups are adapting to each new country by making new alliances with local gangs, Mohor explained.\n\n“We are not talking about drug trafficking or micro trafficking anymore,” Chong told CNN. “These are organizations that work like holdings, with a diversity of illicit activities: murder for hire, illicit firearms trafficking, extorsion, human trafficking, sexual exploitation and more.”\n\nIn this context, many South American countries don´t have the means to properly address the issue, Chong said, as the criminal groups’ tactics are evolving quicker than many country’s abilities to investigate them. Chile, for example, is lacking in specialized police forces, innovative police technologies, and of adequate witness protection programs. All this coupled with corruption represents huge obstacles to prosecuting and sanctioning criminal groups, Chong added.\n\n“We need to develop new prosecution strategies that go beyond specific criminal events, above all considering that, internationally, we are seeing criminal organizations permeating public services,” she said.\n\nThe day after Sandoval, the Chilean journalist, was shot, a man with previous criminal record for drug-dealing was arrested and has since been charged with her killing, Chilean media reported. The weapon he allegedly used has not yet been found, however authorities have established that the bullet was a calibre 40. The presidential delegate for Santiago’s Metropolitan Region said the shooting was connected to organized crime and lax gun control, two issues the government are set to tackle.\n\n“States are completely incapable of dismantling transnational organized crime,” López Portillo said.\n\n“This is affecting the health of democracies and weakening the already fragile rule of law. And the countries that had less violence are not exempt from this reality because criminal markets have no frontiers and never will.”", "authors": ["Daniela Mohor W.

Stop your engines!”, an officer screams. Powerful flashlights reveal a 32-foot, single-engine boat, crowded with immigrants — some of them small children — lying on the floor of the vessel. They are Venezuelan nationals, the Coast Guard later establishes. The footage was provided to CNN by the Colombian government.\n\nThis scene has been repeating itself with regularity around the Colombian San Andres Archipelago, located 775 kilometers (482 miles) northwest of mainland Colombia where the Colombian Coast Guard routinely intercepts boats loaded with migrants who pay smugglers to take them across the Caribbean.\n\nArriving in Central American countries like Nicaragua, the trip allows the migrants to avoid the perilous Darien Gap, a jungle region in Panama at the Colombian border that is also used by migrants trekking north with the hope of eventually reaching the United States.\n\nColombian Marine Corps Captain Octavio Gutiérrez, who serves in the San Andrés Archipelago, says migrants fly into the islands where they spend a night or two as they try to get in touch with smugglers.\n\n“Originally, [the smugglers] were charging between 1,000 and 1,500 dollars. Now we’re getting testimonies of people who have paid the smugglers as much as 4,000 dollars per person to be transported from San Andrés to Central America,” the captain said.\n\nVenezuelan migrants arrive at Canaan Membrillo village, the first border control of the Darien Province in Panama, on October 13, 2022. Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGutiérrez says that, during the month of September, the Coast Guard confiscated 35 boats while conducting 29 operations targeting smugglers in the zone.\n\nFrom the beginning of the year through the end of September, the Coast Guard has detained 14 smugglers transporting 526 migrants, including children. And the number of migrants trying to reach Central America has been steadily increasing.\n\nFrom South America to the United States, trying to stop yet another wave of migrants seems to be a losing battle. As CNN reported last month, US Customs and Border Protection encounters along the US-Mexico border have already topped 2 million so far this fiscal year, according to newly released agency data, with migration from authoritarian nations Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba driving numbers up.\n\nAnd many migrants’ testimonies suggest, more than ever, they are willing to face any risk and pay ever increasing amounts of money to reach their American dream.\n\n‘I’m making this sacrifice to give my children a better life’\n\nIn the span of just one week at the end of September, the Colombian Coast Guard detained 131 migrants, it told CNN. Though there were citizens from Cuba, Peru and Ecuador, most were Venezuelans, it said — an observation echoed by migration officials in other transit countries, like Panama and Guatemala.\n\nMany are young men like Mario Mosquera and Jefferson Lozada, two Venezuelan cousins, whom CNN found walking along a highway in eastern Guatemala, told CNN that the country’s crushing economic conditions had forced them out.\n\n“Venezuela is unlivable. The economic crisis has been very hard, and the truth is that I’m making this sacrifice to give my children a better life,” Mosquera, a married father of three, said.\n\n“Minimum wage [in Venezuela] is not even enough for food. I left my country in search of a better future for me, for my mother and my siblings,” Lozada said.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the New York-based humanitarian NGO International Rescue Committee, an estimated one-third of the population —over 9 million people — faced hunger in 2019. “While data in Venezuela is often limited or missing entirely, this figure is likely growing; 14% of all children under age 5 in Venezuela suffer from global acute malnutrition; 57% of pregnant women are malnourished,” it said.\n\nMario Mosquera and Jefferson Lozada, two Venezuelan cousins, walk along a highway in eastern Guatemala. CNN\n\nThe number of Venezuelans who have fled their country has already surpassed 7.1 million, according to the United Nations refugee agency. It surpasses countries like Ukraine (6.8 million) and Syria (6.6 million). These figures are striking because, unlike the other two nations, the South American country is not at war.\n\nIn Caracas, CNN spoke with another man who says he’s desperate to get out of Venezuela and has already decided he will leave his country for the United States. He declined to reveal his identity because he works for the government of Venezuela.\n\nHis government job pays about five dollars a week, which forces him to hold two other jobs to make ends meet, he said.\n\n“The real question is how to get to the United States,” the 38-year-old added, saying that he has no visa for the United States, Mexico, or the Central American countries he would have to travel through.\n\nA man pushes a cart with pumpkins outside a public market in San Cristobal, Venezuela, April 7, 2022.

What to ...", "text": "As health officials continue to track and manage one of the largest bird flu outbreaks in recorded history, the virus is beginning to spill over into mammals – including humans.\n\nWhile human infections are still few and far between, health experts say it only takes one perfect combination of mutations for the virus to cause widespread transmission among the human population.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what is currently happening with bird flu and what might happen in the future,” said Dr. Jay Varma, director of Cornell University’s Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response.\n\nWill avian influenza be the next human pandemic, and is the world ready? Here's what we know.\n\nAvian influenza:What to know about bird flu symptoms in humans\n\nWhy are eggs so expensive? Here's what to know.\n\nTracking avian influenza: How widespread is it?\n\nBird flu has been on officials’ radar since the late 1990s, health experts say.\n\nThe strains causing widespread outbreak now – avian influenza A (H5N1) 2.3.4.4b viruses – first arose in 2020 and spread via migratory birds to Africa, Asia and Europe, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIn late 2021, the H5N1 strains crossed to North America. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports over 58 million chickens have been affected in 47 states. Nearly 6,200 wild birds have been infected including eagles, hawks, geese and ducks, as of this week.\n\n“It seems like it spreads very easily among different bird species. You have so many different bird species that die off so rapidly from it,” said Varma, who is also the chief medical adviser at Kroll, a risk consulting firm.\n\nHealth experts, however, are more concerned with how the virus is affecting mammals. The USDA has detected H5N1 in various animals all over the country including skunks, foxes, raccoons, bears, mountain lions and dolphins, among others.\n\nMost of these infections appear to be individual cases where the animal may have gotten sick from eating an infected bird, experts say.\n\nMammalian transmission: Why experts are concerned\n\nHowever, two instances of possible mammalian transmission have rung alarm bells for health experts.\n\nBetween June and mid-July, over 150 dead seals in Maine were attributed to the bird flu, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Although it’s possible the seals could have eaten infected birds, health experts say the large number of dead seals and their proximity to one another suggests mammal-to-mammal transmission.\n\nAnother outbreak on a Spanish mink farm suggests the virus may have adapted to mammal transmission. Scientific investigators were called when minks began showing signs of infection including loss of appetite, hypersalivation, depression, bloody snout and tremors.\n\nAfter swabbing two infected animals, they determined the rest of the sickened minks had bird flu. It’s unclear exactly how many minks were infected, but researchers noted the animals began dying a few days after exhibiting symptoms.\n\nMore than 51,000 minks were killed to prevent further spread. Post-mortem examination of infected minks found pneumonia in their lungs. This also sounded the alarm for health experts, who say a mink's respiratory tract is closer to that of a human than bird.\n\n\"Ferrets, which are close relatives of mink, are our best animal model for human influenza infection,\" said Stephen Morse, a professor epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \"So, finding natural infection in mink seems a step closer to potentially infecting humans.\"\n\nAfter sequencing the offending strain, researchers discovered the H5N1 had a slight mutation that doesn't exist in strain affecting birds. This \"uncommon\" mutation – T271A in the PB2 gene – was also seen in the swine flu H1N1 virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic that the CDC estimates caused more than 12,000 deaths in the U.S.\n\n“We worry that this might be the prelude to the virus mutating in such a way that becomes a human epidemic,\" Varma said.\n\nWhat is Valley fever?Fungal infection from the Southwest may spread with climate change.\n\nCan humans get bird flu? How does it spread to humans?\n\nAs of December, the WHO has reported six human infections from the circulating bird flu strains in China, Spain, the U.K., the U.S. and Vietnam.\n\nAll four cases in the U.S. and Europe were asymptomatic or mild infections, with fatigue reported as the only symptom. The patient in Vietnam developed severe disease but recovered, while the patient in China died.\n\n“So far, the virus is difficult to transmit between people and the overwhelming majority of cases have been in people who have in direct and close contact with birds,” said Dr. Hana El Sahly, professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nBird flu tends to infect the lower respiratory tract, showing “it has a preference” in the lungs, said Dr. Katherine Baumgarten, medical director for infection control and prevention at Ochsner Health.\n\nThis suggests it could be less transmissible between humans because not as many viral particles are concentrated in the upper respiratory tract, like the nose or mouth, she said. But it also suggests the virus may be more capable of causing severe disease.\n\nCan avian influenza cause a human pandemic?\n\nAlthough researchers have identified certain mutations that may be associated with mammalian adaptation, health experts say these genes don’t seem to support widespread transmission between animals.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it can’t happen. The more virus spreads, the more opportunities it gets to mutate and adapt.\n\n“Flu viruses are always evolving, making them very unpredictable,” Morse said. “Could it spill over to the human population, and could it eventually become a pandemic? We really can’t say. It’s possible, but we don’t know how likely or, if it happens, when.”\n\nGovernment agencies and international organizations track and study cases among birds, mammals and humans to detect any abnormalities that would be a cause for concern.\n\nHealth experts say it’s important to prepare for the possibility of an H5N1 pandemic because humans don’t have any immunity to the virus and it’s likely to cause severe disease.\n\nIs the US ready for a bird flu pandemic?\n\nIn addition to surveillance, health experts say the U.S. needs vaccines, treatments and personal protective equipment to prevent spread.\n\nThe United States has antivirals for the seasonal influenza virus – the most widely used is known by its brand name Tamiflu – but health experts say it’s unclear if those will work against the circulating H5N1 strains.\n\nA vaccine for H5N1 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people 18 through 64 years who are at increased risk of exposure, according to an agency spokesperson.\n\nThe country has a small supply of vaccine, a spokesperson from the Health and Human Services told USA TODAY. The vaccine can be used to match against strains with pandemic potential and scale-up as needed, which health experts estimate could take up to six months.\n\nAbout 100 public health laboratories across the country are also equipped with testing that can detect H5 viruses or novel influenza A viruses, according to the CDC.\n\nEven if testing wasn't available, a CDC spokesperson told USA TODAY that most commercial testing for the seasonal flu would be able to detect a new influenza A virus should an outbreak occur.\n\nHow to protect yourself against the bird flu\n\nTo prevent infection, the CDC recommends avoiding unprotected contact with wild or domesticated birds that may look sick or have died. If contact can't be avoided, the agency recommends:\n\nWearing personal protective equipment, like disposable gloves, boots, an N95 mask and eye protection.\n\nAvoid touching your mouth, nose or eyes during and after contact with birds or contaminated surfaces.\n\nWash your hands with soap and water.\n\nChange your clothes after contact.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

He was a Boy Scout who enjoyed getting outdoors and camping. He played with Legos and liked to skateboard. He slept with a stuffed Iron Man figure and still snuggled with a teddy bear he’d had since he was much younger.\n\nBut about a year and a half ago, the middle schooler confessed to his parents about a very adult problem: He was experimenting with oxycodone, a prescription painkiller.\n\nHe had no idea that the pills he was taking were actually prescription knockoffs laced with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. Just a few milligrams of fentanyl can be a fatal dose.\n\nOne morning in June 2020, his mother, Amy, found him dead in his bedroom.\n\n“I went to his room, and he was blue, just laying on his beanbag chair. Just like he had gone to bed, you know, just like he had fallen asleep there,” she said.\n\nDrug deaths more than double\n\nThough still rare, drug deaths among children ages 10 to 14 more than tripled from 2019 to 2020, according to an analysis done for CNN by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUnintentional drug overdoses led to 200,000 years of lost life for US preteens and teens who died between 2015 and 2019, a January study found. And experts suspect that the problem has gotten worse during the pandemic, research shows.\n\nThe trend among adolescents follows a wider one.\n\nAnnual drug overdose deaths have reached another record high in the United States, with an estimated 104,288 in the 12-month period ending September 2021, according to provisional data published Wednesday by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nThat’s double the number from six years prior; there were an estimated 52,000 drug overdose deaths annually in September 2015.\n\nThe fentanyl factor\n\nAlexander Neville had gone to his parents to ask them for help just two days before he died. He told them he had started on the pills, in large part, because he was curious.\n\n“He said, ‘I got to tell you something. I wanted to experiment with oxy – oxycodone. I looked up how much to take for my size, so I wouldn’t get addicted. But it really has got a hold on me. And I don’t know why,’ ” his mother said.\n\nHis parents immediately made calls to get him into treatment.\n\n“He really wanted to stop completely,” Alexander’s father, Aaron, recalled.\n\nAmy remembered, “He wanted to be done. He’s like, ‘I’m done. I thought this stuff was going to be fun, but it’s not.’ “\n\nBut Alexander took that one last pill, unaware it was actually a deadly fake.\n\nTests later showed that the pill had enough fentanyl in it to kill at least four people, according to a toxicology report that his parents obtained.\n\nFentanyl is a drug intended to help people like cancer patients manage severe pain. It’s 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. But most overdose deaths aren’t from using it legitimately; rather, they are linked to fentanyl made illegally. Four out of every 10 fake pills with fentanyl contain a potentially deadly dose, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nSince 2013, a rise in opioid deaths involved illicitly made fentanyl, according to the CDC. The agency says dealers combine it with counterfeit prescription pills, cocaine and heroin.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the spike in deaths has increased significantly. From May 2020 through April 2021, more than 100,000 people of all ages died from drug overdoses in the US, according to the CDC. That’s a record – a near-30% rise from a year earlier and a near doubling over the past five years. Synthetic opioids like fentanyl accounted for the bulk of those deaths – around 64,000.\n\n“We’re dealing with a different drug threat. Fentanyl has changed the game,” DEA Special Agent Robert Murphy said. “I’ve been in law enforcement my entire adult life – so it’s 31 years now. And I’ve never seen a threat of the drug threat like the one we’re dealing with now. It’s frightening.”\n\nSocial media makes drug deals easy\n\nSocial media may also contribute to the problem. Drug dealers no longer have to stand on streetcorners. They can now connect with kids online through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, Murphy said.\n\nAlexander’s parents believe that he got his fake pills through Snapchat. Another parent in the area got in touch to tell them that her son died two weeks after Alexander did, and she had screengrabs of a conversation believed to be with a drug dealer through Snapchat. There’s still an investigation underway.\n\n“The fentanyl epidemic has had a devastating effect on the lives of too many Americans, and our hearts go out to the families who have suffered unimaginable losses,” a Snap spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“We share their outrage over how drug dealers have abused online platforms, including Snapchat, and are working tirelessly to eradicate them from our platform. We use tools to proactively detect drug-dealing activity and shut down dealers. To help inform our ongoing strategy and efforts, we work closely with a wide range of experts in counternarcotics, the law enforcement community, and government agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Agency, as well as with families. We are committed to bringing every resource to bear to fight this national crisis both on Snapchat and across the tech industry, particularly by raising awareness about the dangers of counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl.”\n\nBuying drugs is as easy as planting a string of emojis on a social media platform to signal the interest in a sale, Murphy said. The DEA says drug traffickers and the criminal networks are there waiting for you.\n\nDealers may reassure people that their pills are fentanyl-free, but there’s no easy way to tell by looking at them, nor is it easy to know how much fentanyl is in them.\n\n“That’s why it could be a ‘one pill kill,’ because we don’t know the dose,” said Dr. Robert Bassett, assistant associate director of the Poison Control Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “It’s like driving at night with your headlights off.”\n\nThe opioid overdose antidote\n\nFentanyl has become such a big problem among young people that some schools have started keeping naloxone, an antidote to opioid overdoses that’s available under the brand name Narcan, on hand.\n\nHartford, Connecticut, is one example. In January, a 13-year-old boy died after collapsing in gym class at a Hartford school. Two other seventh-graders were taken to Connecticut Children’s for treatment and evaluation. Police found 40 bags of fentanyl at the school and 100 bags in boy’s bedroom.\n\nOn Tuesday, the American Medical Association encouraged the Biden administration to remove the prescription status of naloxone to make it more easily available over the counter.\n\nAll 50 states and the District of Columbia have some form of naloxone access laws that allow for the prescribing and dispensing of the treatment to substance users vulnerable to overdose and to nonmedical first responders like family and friends, according to the Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association. As of 2020, at least 20 states allow schools to possess naloxone and administer it, but they are not required to do so.\n\nHow to get help\n\nThough the experts say there are not enough counselors and treatment programs for preteens and teens, there are treatment programs that work for adolescents.\n\nThe first step in successful treatment is recognition. Parents need to stay vigilant for changes in a child’s behavior, which may be an early sign that they’re using drugs.\n\nThe changes can be subtle at first, Bassett said. They may not hang out with the same friends or may stop showing interest in favorite activities. They may be angry or sleep more. But parents need to talk to their kids about it – even middle schoolers – and do it more than once.\n\n“This is not a ‘one conversation and forget it.’ This is something you’re going to have to just pound in terms of every night at the kitchen table,” Murphy said.\n\nChildren’s brains aren’t fully formed, and their risk-reward centers may not help them make the right choices all the time. “They’re the perfect, most vulnerable population,” Bassett said.\n\nBassett recommends that parents check with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for resources. They can also call Poison Control at (800) 222-1222 for free inforrmation.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMedication-assisted treatment is considered more effective than abstinence, Bassett said. Wraparound services, individualized treatment to help the child and family, can include peer counseling and drug rehabilitation. And, Bassett said, it may be important to address underlying issues that lead the child to experiment with the drugs in the first place.\n\n“There may be unmet psychological conditions that force people into self-medicating,” Bassett said. “They’re just looking not to suffer.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/15/wolves-oregon-northern-cascade-mountains/10387136002/", "title": "Wolves spotted in federally-protected Cascade Mountains amid ...", "text": "Claire Rush\n\nAssociated Press/Report for America\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. — Oregon wildlife officials said Tuesday they have identified a new family of wolves in the northern Cascade Mountains, bringing the total number of known wolf groups in the region to three.\n\nThe state Department of Fish and Wildlife confirmed the new family of wolves with two adults and two pups.

Per the International Wolf Center, there are approximately 30 red wolves in the wild and 200 in captivity.\n\nIn Alaska, there are currently over 8,000 wolves, and Alaska is the only U.S. state where wolves have never made the Endangered Species List, according to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center.\n\nEnvironmental groups welcomed the Oregon announcement.\n\n\"I hope this will be an exciting new chapter in the story of wolf recovery in the state, which is seeing wolves dispersing into territory where they haven't lived for decades,\" Amaroq Weiss, senior wolf advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.\n\nWolves once ranged across most of the U.S. but were nearly wiped out by the 1930s under government-sponsored poisoning and trapping campaigns.\n\nThe Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife counted at least 175 wolves in the state in 2021, an increase of just two from the previous year. It was the slowest rate of wolf growth since 2016, although agency officials did add that wolves expanded their range into four new areas of activity in rural areas in Jefferson, Klamath, Grant and Union counties.\n\nThe number of documented packs in 2021 decreased from 22 to 21 after an entire pack was killed by poisoning in eastern Oregon.

However, wolves remain absent across most of their historical range.\n\nIn 2011, an Oregon wolf known as OR-7 became the first confirmed wolf west of the Cascades in more than 60 years. He then traveled down into California and became that state's first confirmed wolf in nearly a century.

He was taken to the hospital twice for checks on his prostate and was scheduled to undergo the biopsy on July 10, he said. But when he arrived for the procedure, he was told it would have to be rescheduled because he hadn't been given the required antibiotics at the jail, which had to be taken two days before the procedure. The medical staff had given him the antibiotics two weeks prior.\n\n“They are taking too long; it hurts me too much,’’ said Perdomo, who is from Colombia. “It’s like I’m an animal.”\n\nHudson Correctional has come under scrutiny over the care it provides to detainees after allegations of medical neglect in the June death of a 44-year-old immigrant from El Salvador who was being held at the jail. After several months of not receiving all the medication he needed for his ailments, according to the man's family and his attorney, he suffered from internal bleeding and died two days later. His death is being investigated by the county; two members of the jail's medical staff have been dismissed.\n\nINVESTIGATION:Hudson County jail has a history of complaints\n\nDETAINEE DEATH:A case of mistaken identity, then a death\n\nAdvocates who help immigrant detainees said they have been receiving calls for years from people at the jail who say they are not receiving adequate medical care. Rosa Santana, volunteer coordinator for First Friends of New Jersey and New York, an organization that sends volunteers to visit detainees, said the medical complaints the organization has received vary from people not getting help for migraines to those suffering from infections they claim are going untreated.\n\n“They are getting a lot of money, so these people shouldn’t be treated the way they are being treated and not given the correct medical care,’’ Santana said. “What we are fighting for is for them to have the care that they need. Not meeting those needs is a human rights violation.”\n\nSince he has been detained at the jail, Henry Medrano said, he has seen a varicose vein on his right leg grow and become more painful. The 31-year-old Medrano, who said he is a cousin of the detainee who recently died, said he notified staff at the jail, but hasn’t gotten the help he needs to deal with the searing pain and discomfort that make standing up a challenge at times.\n\n“I feel pain on the bottom of my foot, and it’s something that is hurting me,’’ he said in Spanish, noting that a doctor who saw him at the facility three months ago said he might have a blockage. “Maybe one day I’m not going to be able to stand up.”\n\nAbout two months ago, he was taken to a specialist outside the jail, but the doctor looked at his leg and said he wasn't the right specialist for the issue.\n\n“The doctor entered and said ‘I don’t know why they brought you here, since I don’t work on that,' ’’ he recalled. “They made an appointment with a specialist that had nothing to do with what I needed.”\n\nHe said he has been asking for weeks to see the right specialist.\n\nAl Campana, CEO of CFG Health Systems, which provides medical services at Hudson, said that overall if detainees have problems, they should share them with medical staff or submit formal grievances so they can get help. He said the medical director makes regular rounds and asks individuals if they have issues with their care.\n\n“We’re not here to hide anything. We’re here to take care of people,” he said.\n\nCampana said advocates should let him know if any detainee has shared medical complaints or concerns with them. Often, detainees are more comfortable sharing with advocates than medical staff, but the advocates haven’t brought any cases to his attention during monthly meetings, he said.\n\nSantana, however, said that when her group is notified about a medical issue, they reach out to the jail and convey the detainee’s medical concerns and needs to a supervisor. “We document things that are going on in the jail and we try to address them,’’ she said.\n\nIn the cases of Perdomo and Medrano, Campana said that both men had seen specialists and they both have follow-up plans for their health care. Perdomo had said his biopsy had been scheduled for July 31.\n\nPerdomo, who came to the United States in 1974, said that besides his need for a biopsy, he has chronic back, neck and shoulder pain from a 2001 accident when he was hit by a car as he worked as a bike messenger. The accident led to multiple operations, said his attorney, Mia Unger.\n\n“He really has extensive medical needs with regards to his disability from this accident, and he has been declared completely physically disabled as a result of that accident,’’ she said.\n\nBefore he was taken to the jail, Perdomo received physical therapy, a few times a week, and cortisone shots in his right shoulder and left knee, and he said he took Percocet for stronger pain. In jail, his only treatment has been Motrin and Tylenol.\n\n“I do not know how I stand this pain; with the help of God I'm enduring it,’’ he said in Spanish.\n\nPerdomo has to go up and down six flights of steps to see a doctor or meet with his lawyer and family when they visit, a painful task, he said. Unger and Perdomo said he has asked for an elevator pass for months, with no success.\n\n“It’s pretty outrageous. He has really complex medical needs, and this is civil detention, and to me it’s heartbreaking to have a client who is confined in civil detention and going through these type of problems,’’ his lawyer said.\n\nNelson Fernandez, 47, says he, too, knows what it’s like to be sick and detained at the Hudson County jail waiting to be treated. Just days after he was taken into custody, Fernandez, who has a rare autoimmune disease, found himself in the hospital with internal bleeding.\n\nAt the jail he didn't pay attention to the medication they were giving him. At home, he said, he was taking blood thinners to prevent blood clots caused by Behcet’s disease, a disorder that causes blood vessel inflammation throughout the body.\n\n“They started giving me six, seven different medications, some pills I never saw in my life,’’ Fernandez said in a telephone interview from the Dominican Republic, to which he was deported in 2014 and where he currently lives. “One of those medications that they were giving me made my blood so thin that I started to bleed internally.”\n\nHe said he told medical staff about the bleeding and it took several days before he was taken to East Orange Hospital. “It took them a while for them to notice I was really sick,’’ he said.\n\nAn evaluation of health services provided to the immigrant detainee population housed at the correctional center done by a committee appointed by the county later reviewed the treatment given to Fernandez.\n\n“Upon review of Mr. Fernandez’s medical chart, it appears that all of his medical care was appropriately and timely provided,\" the report noted.\n\nFernandez disputed several details of the report.\n\n“They didn’t give me the right medicine; they didn’t treat me and didn’t give me the blood tests I needed,’’ he said. “So that’s not true. They are not saying the truth.”\n\nHe said that after he was discharged from the hospital and sent back to the jail, it took a few days to get his regular prescriptions — and his daughter had to make several calls to help him get them.\n\n“It was hard for me, and I speak the language, and I explained to the doctor what condition I was in, and it was hard for me to get my medication,’’ he said. “I imagine for other people who don’t speak the language or who don’t have somebody outside doing something for them it’s harder.”\n\nStaff Writer Hannan Adely contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/27"}]}

The action will then resume on Boxing Day, just a week after the World Cup final in Qatar. The Premier League’s final round of matches are scheduled for 28 May.\n\nManchester City come into the new season looking to win the title for the third time in succession. Pep Guardiola’s side edged out rivals Liverpool by just one point on a wild final day of last season.

Given Manchester City have won four of the last five titles, “it’s hardly a bold prediction” they will win again, said Ben Gray on 101GreatGoals.com. Pep Guardiola has won ten league titles in 13 attempts and, “while he remains in place in Manchester, this tally is only likely to rise”. The analysts from FiveThirtyEight have crunched the numbers ahead of the new top-flight campaign. According to the data, champions Man City have a 46% chance of winning the title ahead of Liverpool (30%) and Chelsea (11%). City “look in very good shape” to become the only team alongside neighbours United to win three Premier Leagues in a row and five in six seasons, said Dom Farrell on SportingNews.com. “It is hard once again to look past Guardiola’s champions.” ESPN commentator Ian Darke has made his Premier League predictions for 2022-2023 and there’s “nothing that original” there. “It’s going to be another close race between Manchester City and Liverpool,” he said. “Tottenham you’d think with the way they’ve strengthened might put in a much stronger run than what we’ve seen from them. They could make third place.” Football analyst Statman Dave has published his predictions. He probably has “a better shout at getting things right” compared to, say, “the bloke in the corner of your local crying into his pint, AKA, yours truly”, said Kobe Tong on GiveMeSport. In a YouTube video the statman predicts the entire Premier League table, with “frightening” Man City lifting the trophy ahead of Liverpool, Spurs and Arsenal, who complete the top four.\n\nRelegation predictions: which teams will go down? Dom Farrell on SportingNews.com picks Bournemouth and Fulham, “two of the three newboys”, to go down. So, “who of the established names” will join them? “If Southampton get into a spiral this season, that might be allowed to go too far downward before corrective measures are applied, meaning the Championship beckons.” FiveThirtyEight’s data revealed that Nottingham Forest have a 45% chance of being relegated this season. Bournemouth (44%) and Fulham (41%) are also expected to struggle. Statman Dave predicts that Everton will join Fulham and Bournemouth in the drop zone at the end of the season. “Consistently bad decisions” have left Everton in “serious trouble”, he said. “Their squad doesn’t have an identity and is filled with players whose best days are behind them.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/football/lionel-messi-argentina-saudi-arabia-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Saudi Arabia vs Argentina: Lionel Messi's team in one of the biggest ...", "text": "Lusail, Qatar CNN —\n\nSaudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.\n\nMany had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.\n\nAll the pre-match talk focused on Messi, one of the greatest players ever who is playing in what is likely to be his last World Cup. The Argentina captain scored an early penalty to put his side in the lead, but two second-half goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al Dawsari turned the game on its head.\n\nThe thousands of Saudi fans inside the Lusail Stadium couldn’t believe what they were watching as they celebrated their unexpected victory.\n\nSuch a comeback hadn’t looked remotely possible for much of the match. Argentina controlled the game after taking the lead but whatever Saudi manger Hervé Renard said at halftime worked. His team came out with a new-found belief and stood toe-to-toe with Argentina’s world-class team.\n\nSaudi Arabia players celebrate their shock win. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nAl Dawsari’s incredible winner from distance – and subsequent acrobatic celebration – will become one of the moments of this or any World Cup and undoubtedly, in time, an ‘I-was-there’ moment for fans.\n\nAs full-time neared, fans cheered every tackle and save as if they were goals and, when the match did indeed end, Saudi Arabia fans reacted with frenzy.\n\nBoth sets of players sunk to their knees, from disbelief and exhaustion. Messi, who so many had come see play, looked distraught as he walked off with Saudi fans cheering his name ironically.\n\nAccording to sports data group Gracenote, which is a Nielsen company, Tuesday’s result was the biggest upset in the history of the competition.\n\n“The most surprising World Cup win ever according to Gracenote was USA’s victory over England in 1950 with a 9.5% chance of victory for the US team but Saudi Arabia’s chance of victory today was estimated at 8.7% so takes over at number one,” it said in a statement.\n\nAs much as this was a historic win for Saudi Arabia, it was a humiliating defeat for Argentina who capitulated on the biggest stage.\n\nSaudi players smiled and laughed with reporters as they left the stadium, a stark contrast to the Argentine squad who walked with their heads down onto the team bus.

The team was held comfortably by Morocco in the group stages, was very lucky to draw with Belgium and had to rely on penalties to beat Japan in the last 16..\n\nFor any other team, that would be a worry. But Croatia has shown that it is the master of navigating matches that go down to the wire. All three of its knockout games in 2018 went to extra-time or penalties, but in every one of those, the Croatians looked like the side in control.\n\nThat experience was on show against Japan. Like its semifinal victory over England four years ago, this was a game in which Croatia looked stronger and stronger as the game went on.

The five-time world champion comfortably beat stubborn European opponent, Serbia, before giving the first team a rest against Cameroon. But against South Korea, the world saw what this team is truly capable of.\n\nWithin the first seven minutes, Brazil had already won the match and brought jogo bonito (the beautiful game) back to the World Cup, scoring for fun. Neymar – after missing the final two group stage matches through injury – was back again and playing with a freedom that the star has rarely been able to exhibit in the green and gold shirt.\n\nBrazil will once again be heavy favorite as it faces Croatia, but manager Tite and his team will not be underestimating its opponent. For the last 16 years, Brazil has come to tournaments with hype before crashing out against European opponents in the knockout stages.

But that did not stop it from scoring one of the goals of the tournament against the US. The team strung 20 passes together in a picturesque advertisement of the beautiful game before Memphis Depay stroked the ball home.\n\nThe Netherlands had arguably the easiest path to the quarterfinal stage, and their resilience will be tested as they play a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina.\n\nGroup Stage:\n\nSenegal 0-2 Netherlands\n\nNetherlands 1-1 Ecuador\n\nNetherlands 2-0 Qatar\n\nRound of 16:\n\nNetherlands 3-1 United States\n\nAccording to Opta, Argentina has a 17.4% chance of winning the World Cup.

But since then, La Albiceleste has kicked into gear, comfortably winning its last three games.\n\nIn what is likely his final World Cup, Messi has slowly grown into the tournament, but against Australia he showed glimpses of why he is widely considered to be the best to grace the game. He scored a trademark goal against Australia, curling home a finish with irresistible ease, and was at his creative best as time and time again he created chances for his teammates.\n\nThis is arguably the least glamorous Argentina squad of the 21st century, but Lionel Scaloni’s side has a functional system that has served the team well.

But against Senegal, fans were treated to a glimpse of what this England attack can do when given the space and opportunity.\n\nWith the addition of Jude Bellingham to the midfield, England is now playing like one of the best teams in the world, adding goals to a staunch defense. The one criticism of arguably England’s best ever manager is that Southgate struggles against superior opponents.

And let’s not forget players such as Erling Haaland, who failed to qualify for the tournament with Norway, but who promises to challenge Mbappé for accolades.\n\nBut, with this being Messi’s final World Cup, former France international and current Bordeaux coach Rio Mavuba says this tournament has seen the baton of greatness passed onto Mbappé.\n\n“In this World Cup, it’s been the transfer of power from Messi to Mbappé,” he told CNN, ahead of the pair’s showdown in the World Cup final on Sunday.\n\n“Messi is still one of the greatest, maybe the best player of all time, but, at this point, Mbappé can eat at the same table as Messi.\n\n“When he’s focused, he’s probably the best player in the world.”\n\nMessi and Mbappé both play for French club Paris-Saint Germain. GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMavuba made 13 appearances for France and was included in Didier Deschamps’ squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\n\nHe’s watched from afar as a young Mbappé has matured quickly into France’s most important player and says the attacker’s pace and finishing prowess makes him “unstoppable” at times.\n\nMbappé was born and raised in Bondy, a suburb of Paris 11 kilometers from the city center and, aside from a two-year spell playing for Monaco, has lived in the French capital his entire life.\n\nHis spell at Monaco, where he won his first league title, caught the world’s attention and the teenage sensation moved to PSG in 2017, initially on loan for the first year.\n\nThe deal was reported to be worth $214 million but Mbappé seemed to take it all in his stride.\n\nDespite all the trophies he’s won and goals he’s scored, Mavuba says the forward is only now coming into his prime.\n\n“For sure, he’s got a lot of speed but I think the best skill is he can do a lot of things. He can run fast, he can dribble, he can score, this is why it’s very difficult to catch him,” he said.\n\n‘He’s been gifted’\n\nWhile Mbappé’s physical attributes are undeniable, it’s his ability to cope with such intense pressure that separates him from the others, according to former Paris Saint-Germain captain Didier Domi.\n\nDomi, who played over 100 games for PSG and who now works for the club’s academy in Qatar, says Mbappé holds the weight of a nation on his shoulders but it seems his value reaches beyond just his performances on the pitch, and into the political arena.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron intervened earlier this year to implore the young star to stay at PSG amid a transfer saga involving Spanish giant Real Madrid.\n\nBut despite all the pressure that comes both on and off the field, Mbappé continues to produce the goods.\n\n“His game is so unbelievable but the way he lifts the team, this is what has impressed me the most, mentally,” Domi told CNN.\n\n“We know his qualities with his feet but mentally he’s staying in that zone, as a leader, always being crucial for the team. It’s impressive.\n\n“He’s got a talent, of course, but he’s got a talent in his head as well. He controls his nerves and that’s part of the game.\n\n“It’s unbelievable, he doesn’t feel pressure. He’s been gifted.”\n\nMbappé has torn defenses apart with his pace at Qatar 2022. Francois Nel/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhile Mbappé has likely over a decade left to play at the top level, Qatar 2022 also marks the end of arguably the greatest rivalry in football history – with it being the last time we see Ronaldo and Messi play at a World Cup.\n\nBut as that chapter closes, Mbappé has the chance to take center stage.\n\n“He [Mbappé] will be the legacy of Messi and Ronaldo, maybe he’s already the best player in the world,” Domi added.\n\n“He doesn’t have the vision of Messi but, at his best, Mbappé is the best player in the world. He can make a difference at every moment.”\n\nBetter than Zidane?\n\nMbappé has scored five goals in Qatar – level as top goalscorer with Messi – bringing his World Cup total to nine from just two tournaments.\n\nJust Fontaine is the only Frenchman to score more World Cup goals – netting all 13 of his efforts in 1958.\n\nMore importantly, Mbappé is on the verge of winning his second successive World Cup, something that would make him potentially the greatest French player in history, according to Mavuba.\n\n“If he won the second World Cup, he’d probably be the best French player,” Mavuba said.\n\n“I love [Zinedine] Zidane but imagine, 23 years old, two World Cups, he’d be the best.”\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters The best photos of the 2022 World Cup Prev Next\n\nDefender Yuto Nagatomo said memories of the defeat by Belgium four years ago, when Japan let a 2-0 lead slip and lost to a stoppage-time goal, will drive the players on this time.\n\n“I have never forgotten about that battle against Belgium. Sometimes, scenes from the match suddenly come back to me and the last four years have been very tough,” the full back told reporters Sunday.\n\n“But I think we have grown mentally as well as physically and … as far as I can see, this team is the best and the strongest that has ever competed for Japan at the World Cup.”\n\nHead-to-head\n\nCan previous meetings between these two countries help give us a sense of what may happen on Monday? Perhaps not. Since 1997, they have played each other three times, with Japan winning a friendly 4-3, but losing to Croatia in the group stage at France 1998. At the 2006 World Cup in Germany, the two teams played out a 0-0 draw.\n\nAccording to sports data company Gracenote, Croatia has a 58% chance of winning this match, while Japan’s chances stand at 42%.\n\nBut Croatia is a possession-based team, which might suit Japan given it beat Germany and Spain with 17.7% and 26.1% possession respectively.\n\nDalić added: “They will apply the samurai warrior philosophy. So will we. If we want to go further, we must apply that same attitude, do our best and never underestimate anyone.\n\n“Japan have the least ball possession in the world, but they make great transition. This is the most perseverant, persistent opponent. They simply do not give up. We have a similar mentality, Japan and Croatia. We stand on equal ground.”\n\nInjury-hit Brazil still favorite\n\nNeymar injured his ankle against Serbia. Lars Baron/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nOn paper, the day’s other knockout match is easier to predict as five-time champion Brazil takes on South Korea at Stadium 974 in Doha.\n\nThough Brazil lost to Cameroon 1-0 in its last group match, it is still the overwhelming favorite to progress to the quarterfinals, where either Japan or Croatia will await.\n\nWith progress to the knockout stages already secured, manager Tite made nine changes to the team that won 1-0 against Switzerland, which could account for the country’s first loss to an African nation in a World Cup. Though that should not take anything away from Cameroon’s performance.\n\nA dramatic 2-1 comeback win over Portugal, with Hwang Hee-chan scoring the added-time winner, secured South Korea’s spot in the last 16. Prior to that match, the Taegeuk Warriors had only won one of their previous 11 World Cup matches.\n\nVictory for South Korea this time, however, would be monumental, especially as it seems likely star forward Neymar will be fit to play after recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nSon Heung-min celebrates victory over Portugal. ODD ANDERSEN/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut the tournament favorite has suffered a number of injuries to key players in Qatar, with Alex Telles’ knee injury against Cameroon leaving Brazil short of full backs. Telles and forward Gabriel Jesus were ruled out for the rest of the tournament by the Brazilian FA on Saturday, while it is unclear when usual starting full backs Danilo and Alex Sandro will recover from their injuries.\n\nThe two countries have never played each other at a World Cup, but have met seven times – Brazil winning six times and South Korea winning once in 1999. Their most recent encounter was in June in Seoul, which Brazil won 5-1.\n\nBut as the only Asian country to have reached a World Cup semifinal, South Korea has pedigree – and it also has Tottenham star Son Heung-min, its talisman and one of best players in the English Premier League.\n\nSouth Korea’s Portuguese coach Paulo Bento told reporters Sunday: “We’re up against world-class players, we are not intimidated. In our squad, we have world-class players.\n\n“One match, it’s not an entire tournament, we have one chance … Most important is we show we are a team that wants to win, wants to compete and fight until the last whistle.”\n\nWhen and where\n\nJapan vs. Croatia: 10 a.m. ET at the Al Janoub Stadium\n\nBrazil vs. South Korea: 2 p.m. ET at the Stadium 974, Doha\n\nHow to watch\n\nUS: Fox Sports\n\nUK: BBC or ITV\n\nAustralia: SBS\n\nBrazil: SportTV\n\nGermany: ARD, ZDF, Deutsche Telekom\n\nCanada: Bell Media\n\nSouth Africa: SABC", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/football/argentina-france-best-world-cup-final-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Argentina's win over France was the greatest World Cup final ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt seems only yesterday that Enner Valencia was swatting aside Qatar in the 2022 World Cup’s curtain raiser.\n\nAs the dust settles on an enthralling month of soccer action, fans have been treated to arguably one of the greatest ever World Cup tournaments in the sport’s history.\n\nIn fitting fashion, Sunday’s final exploded like a firework display to provide the ultimate conclusion to Qatar 2022.\n\nThis was a final that had superstar rivalries, penalties, iconic goals and goalkeeping masterclasses, culminating in Lionel Messi’s crowning as world champion after Argentina beat France on penalties.\n\nThe pièce de resistance, a moment that will live long in the memory like an impressionistic masterpiece, is that iconic image of Messi – lifted aloft on his teammates’ shoulders – with the World Cup trophy finally in his hands.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters The best photos of the 2022 World Cup Prev Next\n\nThe clashing of two stars\n\nThis match had been billed as Kylian Mbappé vs. Messi – the 23-year-old French star ready to assume the mantle of the world’s greatest player from his 35-year-old Paris Saint-Germain teammate.\n\nMbappé was defending France’s 2018 win at the tournament in Russia, Messi was playing in his final World Cup match, looking to claim the trophy which has eluded him for so long and which would enable him to match Diego Maradona’s achievement of winning the 1986 competition.\n\nThe opening 79 minutes was all about Messi. Argentina’s captain converted the penalty to give Argentina the lead. Next, his deft touch was key in springing the move which led to La Albiceleste’s second.\n\nThen in the closing stages of normal time, Mbappé single-handedly took a grip of the game, scoring two goals in two minutes and sending the final to extra time.\n\nMessi looked shot and Mbappé looked like he was just getting going.\n\nExcept it was the diminutive Argentine who next popped up to score his second goal of the match and restore his team’s lead in the 109th minute.\n\nRefusing to accept defeat, Mbappé roused his teammates, scoring a second penalty to grab his hat-trick and take the final to a penalty shootout.\n\nBoth Mbappé and Messi scored in the shootout but in the end – with France missing two penalties – it was the Argentina captain who was mobbed by his teammates as his World Cup dream was lived out in real time.\n\nOver two hours of soccer, these was two players – at two different points of their careers – demonstrating the beautiful game in vivid, glorious technicolor.\n\nMbappé sits on the bench at the end of the World Cup final. Manu Fernandez/AP\n\nFrom the spot\n\nThe last time a World Cup final went to penalties was in 2006 when France was once again beaten, this time by Italy.\n\nSometimes, it feels unfair to settle a game in a shootout, a series of actions between the penalty taker and the goalkeeper.\n\nHowever, at the Lusail Stadium on Sunday, the abundance of penalties seemed to ratchet up the pressure and tension.\n\nMessi’s penalty in the first half gave him his first World Cup final goal, while his spot kick in the shootout was coolness personified.\n\nMbappé’s ability to not once, not twice, but three times successfully convert from the spot in one game showed extreme gumption.\n\nMbappé scores France's third goal against Argentina in the World Cup final. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nPreviously at Qatar 2022, one team had already experienced the intensity of that pressure cooker atmosphere and emerged the other side, and one which had not.\n\nArgentina got the better of the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in an epic which culminated in a penalty shootout, and one which saw the South American team display distraction and delaying tactics to arguably mentally monster their opponents.\n\nIn Sunday’s final, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez showing his ability to distract the French takers, throwing the ball away before Aurélien Tchouaméni attempt, which flew wide. France’s previous attempt – from Kingsley Coman – had been saved by Martinez.\n\nA penalty shootout is arguably unlike anything else in sports – it’s a modern day duel and a World Cup final with so much at stake only heightens the tension and drama.\n\nMartínez saves the penalty from Kingsley Coman of France in the World Cup final. Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nGreat goals\n\nWorld Cup finals are often tight and cagey affairs, with goals at a premium.\n\nArgentina and France threw away that playbook – delivering six goals, two of which were of the highest quality.\n\nArgentina’s second was arguably as good as Carlos Alberto’s breathtaking goal in the 1970 World Cup final in Brazil’s 4-1 win over Italy.\n\nIt was in the 35th minute, when a flick round the corner from Alexis Mac Allister to Messi, relieved some pressure on the Argentina defense as France pushed for an equalizer.\n\nAfter Messi’s deft touch to Julián Álvarez and the Manchester City forward’s excellently weighted pass to Mac Allister, who had continued his run, Argentina was in on goal.\n\nUnselfishly, Mac Allister had the presence of mind to square the ball to Ángel Di María who finished off a brilliant sweeping counterattack to put Argentina 2-0 up.\n\nDi María celebrates after he scored Argentina's second goal against France in the World Cup final. Stefan Matzke/sampics/Corbis Sport/Getty Images\n\nAt that point, it looked to be the crowning moment of a dominant Argentina victory, until Mbappé stepped up.\n\nAfter his penalty reduced the deficit to 2-1, a neat one-two with Marcus Thuram had the ball falling to the PSG star out of the sky on the edge of Argentina’s penalty area.\n\nWith seemingly all the time in the world, Mbappé produced a wonderful display of technique and timing to thunder the ball past a despairing Martínez.\n\nThese are the moments that capture imaginations and the moments that came to define the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nIt will be remembered for so many reasons – Messi’s moment of history, Mbappé’s hat-trick in defeat, the seesaw nature of the game that oscillated from end to end and never ceased to tug on gobsmacked watchers’ emotions.\n\nOther great World Cup finals\n\nOf course, there’s plenty of competition for the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’\n\nIn 1950, Uruguay upset Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, while four years later, West Germany provided another huge surprise, beating Hungary’s Magical Magyars, earning the country its first World Cup title.\n\nGeoff Hurst scored the first World Cup final hat-trick in the 1966 final between England and West Germany. Hurst’s second goal is still talked about 56 years later – had the ball crossed the line? It did, according to the game’s officials and England won 4-2.\n\nThe 1970 final marked Pelé’s last World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil’s swashbuckling victory over Italy.\n\nFour years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded Netherlands team – made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens – to win its second World Cup.\n\nMuch like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final.\n\nIn 1998, France hosted and won its first World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a formidable Brazil side, composed of Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cafu, Bebeto and Roberto Carlos.\n\nHowever, with its multiples story lines and the drama and artistry on display, surely the 2022 showpiece now owns the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/football/usmnt-wales-timothy-weah-gareth-bale-world-cup-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Gareth Bale saves Wales to frustrate USMNT | CNN", "text": "Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, Al Rayyan, Qatar CNN —\n\nThere was frustration for the United States Men’s National Team (USMNT) in its opening game of Qatar 2022 as Gareth Bale scored a late penalty for Wales.\n\nThe USMNT was dominant for much of the match, but as has so often been the case, it was LAFC star Bale who dug Wales out of a sticky situation as this Group B game ended 1-1.\n\nThe 22-year-old Timothy Weah, son of soccer great George Weah, had put the US ahead in the first-half with a fine finish but this young US side – with an average age of 25 years and 175 days – was unable to maintain its dominance and allowed Wales to snatch a draw.\n\nThere was no shortage of American fans inside the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium on Monday and they made their voices heard, exchanging songs with the Welsh contingent behind the opposite goal.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

For much of the match, it looked as though those fans would be celebrating a much deserved win.\n\nBut just as all hope looked to have disappeared for Wales, Bale was clumsily brought down by Walker Zimmerman in the US box.\n\nThere was then no doubt as Bale stepped up to fire his spot-kick into the top corner of the net.\n\nIt sent the Welsh fans behind the goal into a frenzy and it was Bale’s name being sung the loudest at the final whistle.\n\n“He has never let us down,” Wales manager Rob Paige said of Bale after the game.\n\nThe moment Bale was brought down by Walker Zimmerman. Pedro Nunes/Reuters\n\nWales, playing in its first World Cup match since 1958, seemed to struggle with the occasion in the first half and even Bale had looked off the pace until his goal.\n\nBut the USMNT’s so-called ‘golden generation’ showed a touch of naivety.\n\nThe team has a real opportunity to shine in Qatar 2022 but will need to quickly learn the lessons from this match before facing a much sterner test against England on Friday.\n\nWhat was most surprising was its drop-off in performance after the halftime interval. The US pressed with intensity in the opening 45 minutes and limited Wales to a few wasteful balls into the channels.\n\nUS star Christian Pulisic looked lively and Weah, who was living his father’s dream by playing in a World Cup, looked to have scored the winner with a delicate finish with the outside of his boot.\n\nBut a change of shape from Wales seemed to surprise the young US players who weren’t able to adapt to a more direct approach from their experienced opponents.\n\n“Walking into the locker room after the game you could see the disappointment on their faces,” US head coach Gregg Berhalter told reporters after the game. “We got a bit sloppy with the ball in the second half, we had control in the first half.”\n\nHe added: “Even when we’re winning, we’re thinking about how we could close out the game, but it didn’t happen. Players were disappointed, staff were disappointed.”\n\nA draw, for both teams, is not the end of the world and still leaves qualification into the knockout stages a real possibility.\n\nMeanwhile in Group A, late goals from Cody Gakpo and Davy Klaassen gave Holland a 2-0 win over Senegal at the Al Thumama Stadium.\n\nHolland’s win puts Louis van Gaal’s team joint top of the group with Ecuador, who beat Qatar 2-0 on Sunday.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/middleeast/why-arabs-are-furious-world-cup-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Arabs and Muslims feel stung by coverage of the Qatar World ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\n“Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker,” FIFA chief Gianni Infantino said in a fiery tirade on Saturday, comparing his own plight as a redhead son of migrants to that of marginalized communities.\n\nHis ostensible empathy with Qatar was due to the barrage of criticism the nation has faced in Western media for hosting the tournament.\n\nBut it’s hypocritical of the West to be giving lessons in morality to others, he said.\n\nThose statements on the eve of the World Cup went viral, inviting much anger and ridicule. But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.\n\nUS actor Morgan Freeman (2nd L), Qatari singer Dana al-Fardan (2nd R), and Qatari YouTuber Ghanim al Muftah (R) perform during the Qatar 2022 World Cup opening ceremony on Sunday. Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOmar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized “from a Western point of view” what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.\n\nIn the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation’s treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain’s public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.\n\nThis year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.\n\nThe Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into “nations and tribes” so they can get to know each other.\n\nAccording to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.\n\nQatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nBut in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nThe visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn’t escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.\n\nWestern news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.\n\nThe Times of London on Monday said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country’s population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.\n\n“I think that the Western media is biased because they don’t want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],” Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.\n\nBut some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar’s Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows “the depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.”\n\nThe Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar’s right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was “laced with hypocrisy.”\n\n“I always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,” said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.\n\n“Scrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,” Al Hussein told CNN.\n\n“Especially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.”\n\nJames Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been “fair and proportionate.”\n\n“It’s absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,” he said.\n\nWorkers in the country continue to “face harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,” he said, adding that Qatar’s women and LGBTQ people “face serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.”\n\nCritics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn’t receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.\n\n“At the risk of engaging in whataboutism… Qatar’s human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,” said Al Hussein. “Qatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.”\n\nMaryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.\n\n“This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” she said. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”\n\nShe noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country’s human rights shortcomings.\n\n“Many of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,” she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn’t help the cause of Qatar’s migrant workers.\n\n“The plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN. “It shouldn’t be about whataboutism.”\n\nWith additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha\n\nIran protests\n\nCNN hears testimony from women who say they experienced sexual violence by Iranian regime 06:31 - Source: CNN\n\nSocial media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.\n\nWith media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq’s border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who’d left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.\n\nThe covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.\n\nUS Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is “a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.”\n\nRead the article here.\n\nHere’s the latest on the protests in Iran:\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Tuesday that the rising number of protest-related deaths highlights the “critical” nature of the situation in the country. The UN said its sources had reported over 40 deaths “in mainly Kurdish cities in the past week.”\n\nForty foreign nationals “affiliated in riots” have been arrested in Iran since protests started in September, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Masood Satayshi said without revealing their nationalities.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday the US is taking steps to “push back against actions Iran is taking to repress its own people.”\n\nMobile internet was restored in Iran after a major disruption on Monday, according to internet watchdog NetBlocks, which said that cellular data was down for about 3.5 hours as security forces cracked down on protesters in the Kurdish region of Iran.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nSaudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.\n\nMany had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.\n\nWatch CNN’s Becky Anderson speak to celebrating fans of the Saudi team:\n\nAlso read:\n\nThe digest\n\nTeenage student dies in twin explosions in Jerusalem\n\nTwo explosions shook Jerusalem early Wednesday, killing one person and injuring 18 others in a suspected “combined terror attack,” according to an Israeli police spokesperson. The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.\n\nBackground: The attack brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side of the conflict to at least 29 this year. This year has also been the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015.\n\nWhy it matters: Jerusalem has not seen a double bombing like this one in many years. Prime Minister Yair Lapid said after participating in a situation assessment with security officials that the incident was “different from what we have seen in recent years.” The explosions come after months of tensions in the occupied West Bank.\n\nRussia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says\n\nIran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.\n\nBackground: US officials have said that Russia has received hundreds of drones from Tehran which have had a deadly effect in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy it matters: The move would further cement the partnership between Tehran and Moscow and likely provoke significant anger from Ukraine and its western allies including the US. Sources explained that the goal is for Russia to produce thousands of new attack drones using Iranian components and blueprints.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market\n\nOil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China’s rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.\n\nBackground: The Wall Street Journal earlier on Monday reported an output increase of 500,000 barrels per day was under discussion for the next meeting of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on December 4. The report cited unidentified OPEC delegates. The report sent oil prices plunging by more than 5%.\n\nWhy it matters: The oil cartel last month cut production by 2 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the market “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” The oil cut was made despite strong US pressure against it. Potential further cuts could exacerbate already tense relations between the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/02/football/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Liverpool vs. Chelsea: Sadio Mane at the center of helter-skelter ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChelsea and Liverpool shared a pulsating 2-2 draw on Sunday to leave both teams struggling to keep pace with defending champion Manchester City in the Premier League title race.\n\nAll four goals came in a frenetic first half, with Sadio Mane capitalizing on Trevoh Chalobah’s error and Mo Salah extending Liverpool’s lead with a sublime finish.\n\nChelsea stormed back into the game thanks to Mateo Kovačić’s stunning volley and then Christian Pulisic thumped the ball home after he was set free by N’Golo Kanté’s pass.\n\nThe second half was equally frenetic with both teams having chances to win the game.

It is a clear red card. We are getting these decisions against us and it can change the way of the game.\n\n“I watched the replay but I didn’t need this because live I knew it was a red.\n\n“We had to fight our way back,” Azpilicueta. “We left everything on the pitch but it was not enough.”\n\n“Both teams had their moments.

The research is in the final draft stages and has not been submitted for publication in a medical journal.\n\nResearchers used nearly 150,000 chest X-rays to train an artificial intelligence program to identify patterns in the images associated with risk from major cardiovascular disease events. They tested the program on a separate group of about 11,000 people and found “significant association” between the risk level predicted by the AI and the actual occurrence of a major cardiovascular disease event.\n\nThe clinical standard for analyzing risk from cardiovascular disease is the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score, a calculator that weights various patient data points that have been found to have a high association with adverse cardiovascular events, including age, blood pressure and history of smoking.\n\nStatin medication is recommended for people with a 10-year risk of 7.5% or higher. The AI model uses the same risk thresholds as the established risk calculator, and early findings suggest that it works just as well.\n\n“We’ve long recognized that X-rays capture information beyond traditional diagnostic findings, but we haven’t used this data because we haven’t had robust, reliable methods,” said Dr. Jakob Weiss, the lead researcher and a radiologist affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital and the AI in Medicine program at Harvard Medical School’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n\nSometimes, the AI findings align with a traditional radiology reading, but other times, it picks up on things that may have been missed, he said.\n\n“Part of it is anatomical alterations that we would also pick up with our naked eye and that make physiological sense. Let’s say there’s increased blood pressure or cardiac failure – these are findings that we can pick up in a normal chest radiograph as well. But I think a lot of the information captured or extracted is somewhere embedded in the scan, but we can’t make sense of it as traditionally trained radiologists as of now,” Weiss said.\n\n“It has this black box character to it,” he said, which can sometimes make it hard to communicate risk to patients without an explanation to pinpoint.\n\nDr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, chair of preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and former president of the American Heart Association, was co-chair of the risk assessment panel when the ASCVD risk calculator was created in 2013 and a key player in 2018 when the guidelines were updated to emphasize the relationship between the risk score and personal medical history.\n\nHe was not involved in the new AI research but says it’s important to keep the field moving forward.\n\n“This is exactly the kind of application that artificial intelligence is best for,” he said. “So we need to continue to do things like this to really understand if we can find, particularly, patients who would otherwise slip through the cracks. I think that’s where it may be most useful.”\n\nBut collecting all of the patient data points that go into the established risk calculator is still critical – because they’re actionable. And whether risk is calculated using a statistical formula or an AI model, the most successful outcomes will still require personalized patient assessments.\n\n“We don’t cure smoking by a chest X-ray. We actually need to work with the patient to find ways to get them to stop smoking,” Lloyd-Jones said. “The risk calculator is one part of risk assessment, but it’s not the only part. It’s a process that involves both the patient and the doctor in a discussion about what is the patient’s risk and how much we think a statin would help them.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor their research, Weiss and co-authors trained the AI using chest X-rays from participants in the National Cancer Institute’s Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.

They also had higher risks for lung and heart problems, fatigue, digestive and kidney disorders, diabetes and neurologic problems.\n\nThe findings come as a fresh wave of coronavirus variants, notably Omicron’s BA.5, have become dominant in the United States and Europe, causing cases and hospitalizations to rise once again. BA.5 caused about 54% of cases nationwide last week, doubling its share of Covid-19 transmission over the past two weeks, according to data posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by both vaccines and prior infection, leaving many people vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nDr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, led the research, which was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review. He said he decided to do it after watching reinfections become more and more common among his own patients.\n\n“If you asked me about reinfection maybe a year and a half ago, I would tell you that maybe I have a patient here or there, but it’s really, really rare,” Al-Aly said. That’s not true anymore, though.\n\n“So we asked a simple question that if you got Covid before and now you’re on your second infection, does this really add risk? And the simple answer is that it does.”\n\nTallying the risks of reinfections\n\nAl-Aly and his team compared the health records of more than 250,000 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 one time with records from 38,000 others who had two or more Covid-19 infections documented in their medical records. More than 5.3 million people with no record of a Covid-19 infection were used as the control group.\n\nAmong those with reinfections, 36,000 people had two Covid-19 infections, roughly 2,200 had caught Covid-19 three times, and 246 had been infected four times.\n\nCommon new diagnoses after reinfections included chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, inflammation of the heart muscle or the sac around the heart, heart failure and blood clots. Common lung issues included shortness of breath, low blood oxygen, lung disease, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of a new health problem was highest around the time of a Covid-19 reinfection, but it also persisted for at least six months. The increased risk was present whether or not someone had been vaccinated, and it was graded – meaning it increased with each subsequent infection.\n\nAl-Aly said that’s not what people really think will happen when they get Covid a second or third time.\n\n“There is this idea that if you had Covid before, your immune system is trained to recognize it and is more equipped to fight it, and if you’re getting it again, maybe it doesn’t affect you that much, but that’s not really true,” he said.\n\nAl-Aly said that doesn’t mean there aren’t people who have had Covid and done just fine; there are lots of them. Rather, what his study shows is that each infection brings new risk, and that risk adds up over time, he said.\n\nEven if a person has half the risk of developing lasting health problems during a second infection than they did during their first infection, he said, they still wind up with 50% more risk of problems than someone who didn’t get Covid-19 a second time.\n\nThe study has some important caveats. Al-Aly says it was more common to see reinfections among people who had existing risks because of their age or underlying health. That shows that reinfection may not be random, and it could be that the health risks linked to reinfections aren’t, either.\n\n“It is possible that sicker individuals or people with immune dysfunction are at higher risk of reinfection and adverse health outcomes after reinfection,” Al-Aly said.\n\nHe wasn’t interested in trying to isolate the pure effects of reinfection but wanted to understand how repeated infections are affecting the people who get them.\n\n“The most relevant question to people’s lives is, if you get reinfected, does it add to your risk of acute complications and long Covid, and the answer is a clear yes and yes,” he said.\n\nThe study is observational, which means it can’t determine cause and effect.\n\nAl-Aly says the researchers saw these increased risks even after they weighted the data to account for the effects of age, sex, medication use and the person’s underlying health before they got Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 continues to surprise\n\nExperts who were not involved in the research say it is compelling.\n\n“There is this idea that I think a lot of people have that ‘if I survived my first infection, that I’m really going to be just fine the second time. There really shouldn’t be any problem,’ ” said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\n\n“The popular wisdom, right, is that reinfections are mild, nothing to worry about, nothing to see here,” Griffin said of the study on the podcast “This Week in Virology.” But that’s not really being borne out, he said.\n\nThis is not how it’s supposed to work. Even when viruses shape-shift – as influenza does – our immune system generally retains its memory of how to recognize and fight off some part of them. They may still make us ill, but the idea is that our prior immunity is there to mount some of kind of defense and keep us from serious harm.\n\nWith coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, the hits just keep on coming.\n\n“A year later, you can get reinfected with the same coronavirus the second time. It is not clear that that second infection can be more mild, because coronaviruses intrinsically have the ability to interfere with long-lasting lifetime immunity,” Griffin told CNN.\n\nGriffin says he’s seen Covid-19 reinfections go both ways. Sometimes, the second or third is milder for his patients, but sometimes it’s not.\n\nHow does that compare with other respiratory infections?\n\nEarly in the pandemic, people would get Covid, and three months would go by when they were pretty well protected, he said. But now, those reinfections are happening more frequently, no doubt because of the rapid changes to the virus. He says he’s seen some people infected four times in the past two years.\n\n“We don’t really see much of that with the flu,” Griffin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs for what people should be doing now with regard to this risk, Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says Americans are really done with the pandemic.

For all other causes, it’s harmful at all levels of consumption.”\n\nIndeed, the study found no protective effect for diseases such as tuberculosis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, liver disease, epilepsy, pancreatitis and many cancers.\n\n“Alcohol guidelines, both global ones and national ones, have typically emphasized the difference between consumption level for men compared to women,” Gakidou said. “What our work suggests is that global guidelines, national guidelines and local guidelines would be more effective if they emphasize age as opposed to sex.”\n\nThe findings underscore “the importance of alcohol recommendations that are tailored to specific regions and populations,” Amanda Berger, vice president of science and health for the trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, told CNN in an email.\n\n“Importantly, no one should drink alcohol to obtain potential health benefits, and some individuals should not drink at all.”\n\nYounger than 40 found at highest risk\n\nThe report, released Thursday in the journal Lancet, is the first to report alcohol risk by global geographical region, age, sex and year, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which prepared the study.\n\nThe analysis looked at 30 years of data on people ages 15 to 95 from 204 countries and territories gathered by the institute’s Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, which tracks premature death and disability from over 300 diseases.\n\nThe analysis estimated that 1.34 billion people around the world consumed harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020. More than 59% of the people who drank unsafe amounts of alcohol were between 15 and 39. Over two-thirds were men.\n\nIn every geographic region, the study found drinking alcohol does not provide any health benefits to people under age 40 but does raise the risk of injury, such as motor vehicle accidents, suicides and homicides.\n\nThe study defined a standard drink as 10 grams of pure alcohol, which might be a small 3.4-fluid ounce (100 milliliters) glass of red wine, a 12-fluid ounce (355 milliliters) standard can or bottle of beer (3.5% alcohol) or a 1-fluid ounce shot of spirits (30 milliliters) that is 40% alcohol by volume.\n\nConclusions criticized\n\nWhile praising the analysis as well-conducted, some experts not involved with the research expressed concern about the study’s conclusions.\n\nStatistics show there are “over 14 times as many alcohol-attributable deaths in the UK among 70-74 year-olds than 20-24 year olds,” said Colin Angus, a senior research fellow at the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the UK’s University of Sheffield, in a statement. The data “contradicts the assertion in this new study that we should focus on the drinking of younger age groups,” Angus said.\n\n“The elephant in the room with this study is the interpretation of risk based on outcomes for cardiovascular disease – particularly in older people,” said Dr. Tony Rao, visiting clinical research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London.\n\n“We know that any purported health benefits from alcohol on the heart and circulation are balanced out by the increased risk from other conditions such as cancer, liver disease and mental disorders such as depression and dementia,” Rao said in a statement.\n\nA study published in March found just one pint of beer or glass of wine a day can shrink the overall volume of the brain, with the damage increasing as the number of daily drinks rises. On average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank half of a beer.\n\nResearch in the US has shown drinking among adults rose during pandemic, particularly among women, with “a 41% increase in heavy drinking days,” said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nA study published in June found many moderate drinkers over age 30 binge on the weekend – defined as five or more drinks in a row or within a short period of time. Drinking an average of more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men – or five or more drinks on the same occasion – was linked to alcohol problems nine years later.\n\nWomen are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAA. Alcohol-related problems appear sooner and at lower drinking levels than in men, it said.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to alcohol-related brain damage and heart disease than men, and studies show women who have one drink a day increase their risk of breast cancer by 5% to 9% compared with those who abstain.\n\n“The recommendation that those under 40 should not drink at all is totally unrealistic,” Matt Lambert, CEO of the Portman Group, an industry-funded group that regulates alcohol marketing in the UK, said in an email.\n\nGakidou, the study’s senior author, admitted that “it’s not realistic to think young adults will stop drinking. Still, we think it’s important to communicate the latest evidence so that everyone can make informed decisions about their health.”\n\nFor those over age 65, any increase in drinking is worrisome because many older adults “use medications that can interact with alcohol, have health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, and may be more susceptible to alcohol-related falls and other accidental injuries,” the NIAA said.\n\n“There is a high threshold for being able to say that alcohol is an effective prevention therapy, and the studies so far do not reach that threshold. If they did, then you can be sure that the drinks industry would be applying to the FDA for a license,” said Dr. Nick Sheron, a professor in the hepatology department at the UK’s University of Southampton.\n\n‘A more detailed and nuanced analysis’\n\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation last published a report on alcohol four years ago when it analyzed 2016 Global Burden of Disease data on people 15 to 49, finding no amount of liquor, wine or beer was safe for overall health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“What we have done in this new study is a more detailed and nuanced analysis of 21 different world regions,” Gakidou said. “What we’ve been able to do now is break it down: Who is alcohol harmful for? Who is alcohol beneficial to? That’s why the message is coming across as different, but it is actually consistent with what we said before.\n\n“If you ask me, ‘Will the message be different in 10 years?’ Maybe.

Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/health/coffee-live-longer-wellness/index.html", "title": "Coffee lowers risk of heart problems and early death, study says ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDrinking two to three cups a day of most types of coffee may protect you from cardiovascular disease and an early death, a new study found.\n\n“The results suggest that mild to moderate intake of ground, instant and decaffeinated coffee should be considered part of a healthy lifestyle,” said study author Peter Kistler, head of clinical electrophysiology research at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute and head of electrophysiology at Alfred Hospital in Melbourne.\n\nResearchers found “significant reductions” in the risk for coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and stroke for all three types of coffee. However, only ground and instant coffee with caffeine reduced the risk for an irregular heartbeat called arrhythmia. Decaffeinated coffee did not lower that risk, according to the study published Wednesday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\n\nPrior studies have also found moderate amounts of black coffee — between 3 and 5 cups daily — has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, as well as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, liver disease and prostate cancer.\n\n“This manuscript adds to the body of evidence from observational trials associating moderate coffee consumption with cardioprotection, which looks promising,” said Charlotte Mills, a lecturer in nutritional sciences at the University of Reading in the UK, in a statement.\n\nHowever, this study, like many in the past, was only observational in nature and therefore cannot prove a direct cause and effect, added Mills, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“Does coffee make you healthy or do inherently healthier people consume coffee?” she asked. “Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove the relationship between coffee and cardiovascular health.”\n\nGround, caffeinated coffee lowered risk the most\n\nThe study used data from the UK Biobank, a research database which contained coffee consumption preferences on nearly 450,000 adults who were free of arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. They were divided into four groups: those who enjoyed caffeinated ground coffee, those who chose decaffeinated coffee, those who preferred caffeinated instant coffee, and those who did not drink coffee at all.\n\nAfter an average of 12.5 years, researchers looked at medical and death records for reports of arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease, stroke and death. After adjusting for age, diabetes, ethnicity, high blood pressure, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sex, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption, researchers found all types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause.\n\nThe fact that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was beneficial “might suggest that it is not simply the caffeine which could potentially explain any associated reduction in risk,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University Medical School in Birmingham in the UK, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components,” said Kistler, who holds joint appointments as professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and Monash University.\n\n“It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival,” Kistler said.\n\nDrinking two to three cups of coffee a day was linked to the largest reduction in early death, compared to people who drank no coffee, according to the statement. Ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of death by 27%, followed by 14% for decaffeinated, and 11% for instant caffeinated coffee.\n\nThe link between coffee and a lowered risk for heart disease and stroke was not as robust: Drinking two to three cups a day of ground coffee lowered risk by 20%, while the same amount of decaf coffee reduced risk by 6% and instant by 9%.\n\nThe data changed when it came to coffee’s impact on irregular heartbeat: Four to five cups a day of caffeinated ground coffee lowered risk by 17% while two to three cups a day of instant coffee reduced the likelihood of arrhythmia by 12%, the statement said.\n\nMore study needed\n\nA limitation of the study was that coffee consumption was self-reported at a single point in time, said Annette Creedon, a nutritional scientist and manager at the British Nutrition Foundation, which is partially funded by food producers, retailers and food service companies.\n\n“This study had a median follow-up period of 12.5 years during which many aspects of the participants diet and lifestyle may have changed,” said Creedon in a statement. She was not part of the research.\n\nIn addition, coffee can produce negative side effects in some people, she added. People with sleep issues or uncontrolled diabetes, for example, should check with a doctor before adding caffeine to their diets.\n\nThese negative side effects “can be particularly relevant to individuals who are sensitive to the effects of caffeine,” Creedon said. “Hence, the findings of this study do not indicate that people should start drinking coffee if they do not already drink it or that they should increase their consumption.”\n\nMost studies are focused on the health benefits of black coffee, and do not take into account the extra sugars, creams, milks and processed additives that many people use in coffee.\n\n“A simple cup of coffee perhaps with a little milk is very different to a large latte flavoured with a syrup and added cream,” Mellor said.\n\nAdding sugars and dairy fats to coffee can reduce their health benefits, experts say.

Cafestol can increase bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoproteins).\n\nHowever, using a French press, Turkish coffee maker or boiling coffee (as is often done in Scandinavian countries), does not remove cafestol.\n\nAnd, finally, coffee’s benefits do not apply to children – even adolescents should not drink colas, coffees, energy drinks or other beverages with any amount of caffeine, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/health/adhd-autism-early-death-risk-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "People with autism or ADHD are more likely to die early, review says", "text": "CNN —\n\nHaving autism or ADHD could come with a higher risk of dying earlier than normal, according to new research.\n\nSeveral previous studies have suggested these neurodevelopmental disorders might be linked with a higher risk of premature death, but findings were inconsistent, according to a new meta-analysis, or review of data from many previous studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The meta-analysis examined 27 studies that were based in North America and Europe and published between 1988 and 2021, amounting to more than 642,000 participants.\n\nThe new research found that early mortality – which, in the meta-analysis, was usually death in childhood or by midlife – from natural and unnatural causes was more than two times more likely for both people with autism and those with ADHD than for the general population, said the review’s lead author Ferrán Catalá-López, via email. Natural causes included cardiac events and seizures; unnatural causes included unintentional injuries, suicide and homicide.\n\nAmong those with ADHD, the number of premature deaths from unnatural causes (847) was higher than expected, but their risk of early death from natural causes wasn’t as significant as that of people with autism, according to the meta-analysis. But Catalá-López, a scientist at the National School of Public Health and Network Centre for Biomedical Research in Mental Health – both at the Institute of Health Carlos III in Madrid – said the findings shouldn’t be viewed as a death sentence.\n\n“The results of our study should not be interpreted as that having any of these disorders means that people who suffer from them will (necessarily) die prematurely due to traffic accidents, poisoning or suicide,” he said via email.\n\nIn a commentary on the meta-analysis, neurodevelopment experts Russell A. Barkley and Geraldine Dawson – who weren’t involved in the research – also highlighted how preventive health care can make a difference.\n\n“After all, ELE (estimated life expectancy) is malleable,” wrote Barkley and Dawson, a former clinical professor of psychiatry at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center and the William Cleland Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University, respectively. “Change the adverse health and lifestyle factors affecting it, and one can improve quality of life, as well as life expectancy.”\n\nPeople with autism or ADHD “frequently die of preventable natural causes,” they also wrote. “This knowledge demands widespread recognition and the implementation of systematic screening and preventive approaches.”\n\nFactors raising early death rate\n\nThe authors of the meta-analysis didn’t have details on participants’ lifestyles, socioeconomic factors or specific causes of death. But prior research has highlighted several factors that could explain the higher early death rate among children and young people with autism or ADHD, the authors wrote.\n\nAround 1% of people worldwide have autism, while roughly 5% of people have ADHD, according to the Autism Society and World Health Organization surveys, respectively. People with ADHD or autism have been found to be at higher risk for coexisting mental disorders and neurological conditions such as depression, anxiety, substance misuse or abuse, eating disorders, epilepsy, or conduct or tic disorders.\n\nThese groups have also been linked with higher rates of obesity; dental trauma or decay; sedentary behavior or low exercise participation; sleeping problems; migraines; heart disease; and less involvement in preventive practices concerning health, nutrition and dental hygiene, Barkley and Dawson wrote.\n\nImpulsive or inattentive behaviors that are characteristic of these disorders can be contributing factors for injuries and unintentional incidents, according to the meta-analysis.\n\nThe editorial’s authors suggested that early mortality could explain something that has stumped clinical researchers for decades: the decline in the prevalence of ADHD with age. About 5% to 8% of children might meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD while that figure falls to up to 5% of adults and nearly 3% of older adults.\n\nSome researchers have thought this declining prevalence might be due to people experiencing fewer ADHD symptoms as they age or not getting rediagnosed. But the findings “make plain that another explanation is the greater loss of individuals with these conditions from the population over time owing to heightened mortality compared with typical peers,” Barkley and Dawson wrote.\n\nWhat people with autism or ADHD need\n\nAddressing the issue of premature mortality in people with ADHD and autism is challenging and starts with health care providers, both the meta-analysis and editorial authors said.\n\n“Clinicians and health care professionals can be encouraged to routinely collect information on behavioral, medical conditions and health outcomes related to ASD (autism spectrum disorder)/ADHD, emphasizing the need to recognize and address modifiable vulnerability factors and prevent delays in health care provision,” the meta-analysis authors wrote.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“This approach is imperative for individuals with ADHD (or ASD) as the higher risk for mortality reported in this review could be reduced by doing so,” according to Barkley and Dawson’s editorial.\n\nSome organizations have resources for how children and adults with autism or ADHD can increase their chances of doing things that could help their quality of life or life expectancy, including exercise, dental care and sleep.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/health/statin-stroke-study/index.html", "title": "Statins lower the risk of one of the deadliest kinds of strokes, study ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDoctors know that drugs called statins lower a person’s risk of a stroke due to a blood clot. But a new study shows that the inexpensive medications can also decrease the risk of a first stroke as a result of an intracerebral hemorrhage, the deadliest kind.\n\nAn intracerebral hemorrhage is when blood from an artery suddenly begins to bleed into the brain. It’s the second most common cause of a stroke after a blood clot, which is called an ischemic stroke.\n\nStroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Many can be prevented through lifestyle changes such as eating healthy, getting exercise and quitting smoking.\n\nStatins are another powerful tool for stroke prevention. They work by reducing fatty deposits in the arteries and keeping them from building up to cut off blood to the brain. Globally, hundreds of millions of people take them to prevent heart problems or stroke.\n\nThere has been conflicting research on whether a statin can reduce a person’s risk of a first intracerebral hemorrhage. The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, seems to put a cap on some of that debate.\n\nThe researchers used prescription data and the health records of more than 88,000 people in Denmark who did not have a history of stroke. During the study period, 989 people (with an average age of 76) had a first bleeding stroke in the lobe area of the brain, and 1,175 (with an average age of 75) had one in the other parts of the brain.\n\nThe researchers distinguished between lobar vs. nonlobar strokes so they could look for differences in strokes in different parts of the brain; nonlobar strokes are often caused by high blood pressure.\n\nThe research was partially funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk makes drugs for the treatment of stroke, but the foundation was not involved in the study design or interpretation of the data, the researchers say.\n\nPeople in the study who used statins for any period of time had a 17% lower risk of a stroke in the lobe areas of the brain and a 16% lower risk of a stroke in the non-lobe areas of the brain. When they used a statin for more than five years, they had a 33% lower risk of a bleeding stroke in the lobe areas and a 38% lower risk in the non-lobe areas.\n\n“It’s reassuring news for people taking statins that these medications seem to reduce the risk of bleeding stroke as well as the risk of stroke from blood clots,” said study co-author Dr. David Gaist, a professor of the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.\n\nThe study has some limitations, however. It lacked data on potentially important underlying conditions that could lead to a stroke and other information about behaviors that could raise a person’s risk, such as smoking or alcohol use. There would also need to be additional research to determine whether the results would be the same in non-European populations.\n\nA large ongoing trial funded by the US National Institutes of Health is trying to determine whether people who have been on statins and are admitted to a hospital with a hemorrhagic stroke should keep using the drug or stop taking it.\n\nSome research has suggested that people who have a history of stroke due to a blood clot, called an ischemic stroke, may have a higher risk of a hemorrhagic stroke if they take a statin.\n\n“There were these small exploratory studies off of randomized trials that suggested the possibility there was an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke if there had been a history of ischemic stroke.

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you prefer to go to bed and get up later – a sleep chronotype known as being a night owl – you may be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes and heart disease, a new study found.\n\nNight owls were more sedentary, had lower aerobic fitness levels and burned less fat at rest and while active than early birds in the study. Night owls were also more likely to be insulin-resistant, meaning their muscles required more insulin to be able to get the energy they need, according to the study published Monday in the journal Experimental Physiology.\n\n“Insulin tells the muscles to be a sponge and absorb the glucose in the blood,” said senior study author Steven Malin, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology and health at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\n\n“Think about it like water from a water faucet: You turn the water on and a drop touches the sponge and is immediately absorbed,” Malin said. “But if you’re not exercising, engaging those muscles, it’s like if that sponge was to sit for a couple days and get rock hard. A drop of water isn’t going to make it soft again.”\n\nIf sleep chronotype is affecting how our bodies use insulin and impacting metabolism, then being a night owl might be useful in predicting a person’s risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes, Malin added.\n\n“The study adds to what we know,” said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who was not involved with the research.\n\n“There is good evidence that being a late sleeper has been linked to a higher risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease,” said Zee, who is also a professor of neurology. “Several mechanisms have been proposed: sleep loss, circadian misalignment, eating later in the day and being exposed to less morning light and more evening light, which have all been shown to affect insulin sensitivity.”\n\nBody clock and chronotype\n\nAll humans have a circadian rhythm – an internal 24-hour body clock that regulates the release of the hormone melatonin to promote sleep and ceases production so that we wake. Our body clock also directs when we get hungry, when we feel most sluggish, and when we feel peppy enough to exercise, among many other bodily functions.\n\nBeing a night owl may result in lower activity levels during the day, the study found. PR Image Factory/Adobe Stock\n\nTraditionally, sunrise and nightfall regulated the human sleep-wake cycle. Daylight enters the eyes, travels to the brain and sets off a signal that suppresses melatonin production. When the sun goes down, the body clock turns melatonin production back on, and a few hours later sleep arrives.\n\nYour personal sleep chronotype, thought to be inherited, may alter that natural rhythm. If you’re an innate early bird, your circadian rhythm releases melatonin much earlier than the norm, energizing you to become most active in the morning. In night owls, however, the internal body clock secretes melatonin much later, making early mornings sluggish and pushing peak activity and alertness later into the afternoon and evening.\n\nSleep chronotype can have profound effects on productivity, school performance, social functioning and lifestyle habits, experts say. Early birds tend to perform better in school, and are more active throughout the day, which may partly explain why studies have found they have less risk of cardiovascular disease, Malin said.\n\nEvening types may take more risks, use more tobacco, alcohol and caffeine, and are more likely to skip breakfast and eat more later in the day. In addition, research suggests “later cronotypes have higher body fat located more in the stomach or abdominal region, an area which many health professionals believe to be worse for our health,” Malin said.\n\nFat or carbs?\n\nResearchers classified 51 adults without heart disease or diabetes into morning or evening chronotypes, based on their natural sleep and wake preferences. During the study, the participants ate a controlled diet and fasted overnight while their activity levels were monitored for a week.\n\nThe research team determined each person’s body mass, body composition and fitness level, and measured levels of insulin sensitivity. In addition, researchers looked at how each person’s metabolism obtained most of their energy, either via fat or carbohydrates.\n\n“Fat metabolism is important because we think if you can burn fat for energy that’s going to help the muscle pick up the glucose in a more enduring fashion,” Malin said.\n\nBurning fat can promote endurance and more physical and mental activity throughout the day. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are what the body uses for intense physical activity. Carbs are burned more quickly, which is why many athletes carb-load in advance of a race or marathon.\n\nResults of the test showed early birds used more fat for energy at both rest and during exercise than night owls in the study, who used more carbohydrates as a source of fuel.\n\nThere is a need for more research, Malin said, to confirm the findings and determine if the metabolic differences are due to the chronotype or a potential misalignment between a night owl’s natural preference and the need to wake early due to the hours set by society for work and school.\n\nPeople who are continuously out of synch with their innate body clock are said to be in “social jet lag.”\n\n“This extends beyond just diabetes or just heart disease,” Malin said. “It may point to a bigger societal issue.

Are we as a society forcing people to behave in ways that might actually be putting them at risk?", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/health/pulse-oximeters-fda-meeting/index.html", "title": "Pulse oximeters: FDA panel examines evidence that devices may ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Owais Durrani sees this issue regularly first-hand: When he clamps a pulse oximeter onto a patient’s fingertip to measure their blood oxygen levels, the small device can yield less accurate readings in people with darker skin tones, reporting levels higher than what they actually are.\n\nThe possibility of an inaccurate oxygen reading for Black and brown patients worries Durrani in the emergency room on a daily basis.\n\n“Was there a point where I may have discharged a patient that had a reading of, say, 95%, but the actual reading was lower and they maybe could have benefited from observation or being admitted to the hospital? Possibly, and that scares me, and that frustrates me,” he said. “So that’s why it’s so important that the FDA is looking into this.”\n\nA panel of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Medical Devices Advisory Committee met Tuesday to review clinical data about the accuracy of pulse oximetry in patients with darker skin and to discuss recommendations on using these devices on people with dark skin tones and whether they should have labels – such as a black box warning – noting that inaccurate readings may be associated with skin color.\n\nBecause the public continues to use these devices to check oxygen levels, “I think we should give more detailed instructions on what they’re supposed to do with them,” Dr. Murad Alam, a member of the panel and professor at Northwestern University, said in the meeting.\n\n“I understand we don’t know exactly what their accuracy is, but I would suggest that FDA might want to consider a labeling change,” he said. “In the meantime, it would allow the FDA the ability to investigate these products and give consumers some guidance as to how to use them – and have some power to actually, at the very least, compel the manufacturers to convey that simplified and expanded labeling to patients who will in fact be using these to try to save their own lives.”\n\nThe meeting was intended to help inform the FDA’s ongoing evaluation of pulse oximeters, their accuracy and performance, and what can be done to fix racial biases. The Anesthesiology and Respiratory Therapy Devices Panel heard from patients, regulators, researchers and developers of medical devices.\n\n“The performance of medical devices needs to be well understood to mitigate any negative, unintended consequences for patients in different populations,” Adm. Richardae Araojo, FDA associate commissioner for minority health, said during the meeting. “So today’s discussion on the real-world performance of pulse oximeters and factors that impact their accuracy will inform FDA as we consider the regulation of these medical devices.”\n\nA ‘critical issue’\n\nPulse oximeters work by sending light through your finger; a sensor on the other side of the device receives this light and uses it to detect the color of your blood. Bright red blood is highly oxygenated, while blue or purplish blood is less so. If the device isn’t calibrated for darker skin tones, the pigmentation of the skin could affect how the light is absorbed by the sensor, leading to flawed oxygen readings.\n\nUltimately, the pulse oximeter can estimate the amount of oxygen in the blood without the need for a blood sample. But on a person with dark skin, the oximeter could indicate that oxygen levels are normal, suggesting that the person may be discharged – when, in reality, a blood sample might show low oxygen levels, suggesting that they need not only additional care but oxygen support.\n\nTo compensate for the possible discrepancy, Durrani said, he sometimes conducts a “walking” pulse oximeter reading on patients with darker skin.\n\n“So having a patient walk for like five minutes while having a pulse ox on, and usually if they are at higher risk, what will happen is, their oxygen numbers might drop further,” said Durrani, who practices at a hospital in Houston.\n\nA walking test can help him gauge whether the standard pulse oximeter reading overestimated a person’s oxygen levels, but he is still waiting for the day when he can trust the device to provide an accurate oxygen level measurement for all of his patients – no matter the color of their skin.\n\n“I’m definitely very happy that this critical issue is being addressed on a national level at the FDA,” said Durrani, who is not involved in the meeting or with the agency.\n\n“But as an ER doc who’s in the trenches and making a lot of fast-paced decisions based on this data, I’d like to see more discussion hopefully in this meeting or future meetings around what the clinical implications of this are going to be,” he added. “We would need a more kind of multipronged guidance when it comes to how physicians should then interpret these results.”\n\n‘The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue’\n\nThe FDA announced in February 2021 that although pulse oximetry can be useful for estimating blood oxygen levels, the devices “have limitations” and “a risk of inaccuracy under certain circumstances,” referring to a 2020 report on racial bias in pulse oximetry measurements that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHowever, evidence of flawed pulse oximeter readings in people with dark skin dates to the 1980s. In 2013, the FDA issued premarket guidance for developers of pulse oximeters, recommending that they have “a range of skin pigmentation” represented in their clinical studies of the devices, including at least two “darkly pigmented subjects or 15% of the study group, whichever is larger.”\n\nThe issue of inaccurate readings for dark-skinned individuals has gotten more widespread attention as the use of pulse oximeters increased dramatically at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“I think that the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue,” Rutendo Jakachira, a Ph.D. student in Brown University’s Department of Physics who is studying racial disparities in pulse oximetry, told CNN in July.\n\n“People have known that there’s an issue with the overestimation of these oxygen saturation levels, particularly in dark-skinned patients, but they did not appreciate the significance of this issue until the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said. “The pandemic has seen an increased use of pulse oximeters in the hospital and in the home setting and thus the consequences of the neglect of the issues with errors in these pulse oximeter has been revealed.”\n\nOne study on flawed pulse oximeter readings, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine in July, found that among more than 3,000 hospitalized patients receiving intensive care, Asian, Black and Hispanic patients got less supplemental oxygen than White patients, and that was associated with differences in their pulse oximeter readings.\n\nOther research published that month in the medical journal BMJ found that Black patients had higher odds than White patients of having low blood oxygen noted in their drawn-blood readings but not detected by pulse oximetry. That finding was based on data from the Veterans Health Administration in which pulse oximeter readings were paired with oxygen level measurements from drawing blood.\n\nAnother study of about 7,000 Covid-19 patients, published in May in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, found that compared with White patients, pulse oximetry overestimated oxygen levels in the blood by an average of 1.7% among Asian patients, 1.2% among Black patients and 1.1% among Hispanic patients. That overestimation may have contributed to an unrecognized or delayed recognition of someone’s eligibility for Covid-19 therapies.\n\nSome experts in Tuesday’s meeting questioned whether differences in how pulse oximeters perform among people with dark or light skin are significant.\n\n“The data that we see from some of these studies, it really begs for, as some other people have said, prospective data collection with a measurement of skin pigmentation,” said Richard Branson, a voting member of the panel and professor emeritus at the University of Cincinnati.\n\nStudies of Medtronic’s Nellcor pulse oximeters found that they reported blood oxygen levels that were within 2% of participants’ drawn-blood oxygen levels – regardless of skin color, Dr. Sam Ajizian, chief medical officer of patient monitoring at Medtronic, said in an emailed statement Tuesday.\n\n“Still, the data shows a small statistical discrepancy between results for those with light pigmentation and patients with darker skin pigmentation,” he said.\n\n“Medtronic is seeking to make improvements in our devices based on a greater understanding of the impact skin pigmentation has on pulse oximetry readings,” he said. “Through better information-sharing and an industry-wide commitment to continued innovation, we are advocating for improvements in the methods we use to validate pulse oximeters, including standardization of how we assess skin pigmentation and an increase in representation of patients with darker skin pigmentations in clinical trials.”\n\nA problem that is ‘just the tip of the iceberg’\n\nPulse oximeters, invented in 1974 by Japanese bioengineer Dr. Takuo Aoyagi, are not the only medical devices that have been found to perform more accurately in people with fair skin than in those with darker skin – largely because of a lack of testing in racially diverse groups of people.\n\n“The first one that jumps into my mind is forehead thermometers, infrared thermometers: It’s a similar issue, in folks with darker skin, they tend to underreport fever in those patients,” Durrani said. “A lot of times, I’ve seen those thermometers, anecdotally speaking, just not even giving us a reading when it comes to darker folks.”\n\nTemporal thermometers – used to measure body temperature on the forehead – use light-sensing technology similar to that in pulse oximeters. Research published in September in the medical journal JAMA found that the devices may be less accurate than oral thermometers at detecting fevers among hospitalized Black patients, and undetected fevers could lead to delays in medical care.\n\nA study published in July in the journal ACM Transactions on Graphics describes how wearable devices that measure heart rate may not perform as well in people with darker skin tones because they also use similar technology to forehead thermometers and pulse oximeters.\n\nSome research groups across the United States are seeking solutions to address these biases. Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles are developing a new approach for wearable heart-rate sensors that involves radar technology.\n\nAnother group, involving Jakachira and her colleagues at Brown University, is developing methods to make pulse oximeters more accurate in people with dark skin tones by canceling out the effect that melanin – the substance that produces pigmentation in our skin, hair and eyes – can have on how these devices perform.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn theory, any medical equipment that leverages infrared sensing in how it works “will likely show discordance in its performance across people with different skin tones,” said Dr. Leo Anthony Celi, clinical research director and principal research scientist at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology, told CNN in September.\n\nThat’s because the technology in such devices, like pulse oximeters and temporal thermometers, involves emitting and capturing light to make a measurement. If a device isn’t calibrated for darker skin tones, the pigmentation could affect how the light is absorbed and how infrared technology works.\n\n“Skin tone will interfere with the reflection of light,” said Celi, who has also studied disparities in pulse oximeters. “We think that this is just the tip of the iceberg. I suspect that over the next year, we will have an abundance of papers showing how there are products that are in use for care that are themselves not objectively accurate across different demographics.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}]}

Here's why | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nUS natural gas prices have skyrocketed to levels unseen since 2008, a spike that threatens to offset the benefits of falling prices at the gas pump.\n\nNatural gas futures surged 7% on Tuesday to close at $9.33 per million British thermal unit (BTU), the highest closing price since August 1, 2008.\n\nAlthough natural gas futures cooled off a touch on Wednesday, they remain up about 70% just since the end of June. And natural gas is up a staggering 525% since closing at $1.48 in June 2020 when Covid-19 had shut much of the US economy down.\n\nThe summer spike is being driven in part by high demand as scorching temperatures through much of the country force Americans to crank up the air conditioning. That in turn has chipped away at relatively low inventory levels.\n\n“We’ve had this perma-heat wave cooking the United States,” said Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.\n\nAs temperatures drop this fall and winter, the natural gas spike signals sticker shock for families. Not only is natural gas a leading fuel source for the electric grid, it’s the most popular way to heat homes in America.\n\n“Depending on the weather, it could be a challenging winter,” said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors. “But not as challenging as in Europe. They are at risk of running out of natural gas. We aren’t.”\n\nEurope’s natural gas prices are seven times higher\n\nEurope’s natural gas crisis is being driven by its reliance on energy from Russia, which has slashed natural gas flows to Europe in response to Western sanctions.\n\nThe European Union has been forced to lay plans to ration natural gas, a drastic step that will hurt families and businesses. Natural gas prices have skyrocketed so high in Europe that it threatens to send the continent’s economy into recession.\n\nFor context, Europe’s natural gas prices are trading at levels equivalent to about $70 per million BTUs, according to Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. That is roughly seven times higher than prices in the United States.\n\nBut that is little consolation to Americans grappling with high prices at the grocery store, clothing stores and at restaurants.\n\nEven as natural gas prices surge, oil prices have tumbled, helping to drive gasoline prices sharply lower. The national average for regular gasoline has dropped 64 days in a row, according to AAA.\n\nExports pick-up to Europe\n\nAnalysts say Europe’s natural gas crisis is contributing to the higher natural gas prices in America, although it’s not the main driver.\n\n“Higher global prices are trickling down to the US. Natural gas has become a global commodity with the emergency of LNG,” said Thummel.\n\nThe United States has stepped up its exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe in an effort to mitigate the impact of the loss of Russian gas.\n\n“Every spare molecule we can find, we are shipping to the eurozone,” said Yawger.\n\nUS natural gas production is lagging behind\n\nBut the bigger issue for US natural gas is the fact that inventory levels are below historical averages, leaving the market with less of a buffer and driving up prices.\n\n“We entered this year at beaten-down levels and we never caught up,” Yawger said.\n\nSupply has failed to keep up with strong demand for gas. Thummel pointed to how US oil and gas producers are under pressure from Wall Street to spend less on expensive drilling projects and more on dividends and buybacks to shareholders.\n\n“We need more US natural gas production. The production levels are too low,” Thummel said.\n\nThe good news is that higher prices should, eventually, incentivize more production. And investors are not betting today’s high prices will continue. The futures market indicates natural gas prices should be almost 50% lower at this point next year.\n\nThen again, very few people thought a year ago natural gas prices would be at 2008 levels.

French police also confirmed the items are safe.\n\n\"Thanks to the @PompiersParis, the police and the municipal agents, the Crown of Thorns, the Tunic of Saint Louis and several other major works are now in a safe place,\" Hidalgo tweeted, along with a photo showing many of the artifacts carefully preserved in storage.\n\nIt's unclear where the Crown of Thorns, considered by some to be the French equivalent of Britain's Crown Jewels, was stored in the heavily damaged church. Notre Dame spokesman Andre Finot told reporters that several of the church's prized items were stored in a vault that he believed would be safe from the fire's ravages.\n\nThe Crown of Thorns, presented to believers during Lent and on the first Friday of each month, is originally from Jerusalem and its authenticity has never been proven with certainty. But historians say it has been verified to be at least 1,600 years old.\n\nSaint Louis' tunic is a relic made of linen that belonged to King Louis IX, the king of France from 1226 until 1270. He carried the Crown of Thorns into Paris in 1239 while possibly wearing the tunic.\n\nThe recovery of the artifacts is the latest bit of optimism for French officials and Notre Dame aficionados around the globe, who have been watching intently since Monday's fire laid waste to large swaths of the church's heavy timber construction.\n\nMore:Cathedral resurrection: A look at famous houses of worship reborn after destruction\n\nInitial reports from French leaders painted a dour picture of the 12th-century Cathedral's chances for survival. More than 400 firefighters battled unusual and grueling conditions that defied modern-day firefighting techniques, experts said.\n\nSome of the factors that made Notre Dame a must-see for visitors to Paris — its age, sweeping size and French Gothic design featuring masonry walls and tree trunk-sized wooden beams — also made it a tinderbox and a difficult place to fight a fire, said U.S. Fire Administrator G. Keith Bryant.\n\nBryant and others say the combination of a structure that's more than eight centuries old, built with thick, bone-dry wood beams amid soaring open spaces, and a lack of fire-protection systems left firefighters with few options.\n\n\"Very often when you're confronted with something like this, there's not much you can do,\" said Glenn Corbett, a professor of fire science at John Jay College.\n\nThe blaze collapsed the cathedral’s spire and spread to one of its rectangular towers. But Paris Fire Chief Jean-Claude Gallet said the church’s main structure had been saved after firefighters prevented the flames from spreading to the northern belfry. Gallet said the emergency response had evolved into a monitoring and clean-up operation.\n\n'I don't have words for this':Devastated Parisians watch in shock as Notre Dame Cathedral burns\n\nThe first photos from inside Notre Dame, released Monday night, showed heavy smoke, fire and water damage to the cathedral's venerable altars and other areas.\n\n“The worst has been avoided, although the battle is not yet totally won,” said French President Emmanuel Macron, who had rushed to the scene. Macron pledged to rebuild the church and said a national fundraising campaign would be launched Tuesday.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office said it was treating the fire as an accident, ruling out arson and possible terror-related motives, at least for now. French media quoted the Paris fire brigade as saying the fire was “potentially linked” to a $6.8 million renovation project on the church’s spire and its 500 tons of wood and 250 tons of lead.\n\nDespite the dramatic image of the flaming cathedral, no one was killed.\n\nBuilt in the 12th and 13th centuries, Notre Dame is the most famous of the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages as well as one of the most beloved structures in the world. Situated on the Ile de la Cite, an island in the Seine river, its architecture is famous for, among other things, its many gargoyles and its iconic flying buttresses. Some 13 million people visit it every year.\n\nAmong the most celebrated artworks inside are its three stained-glass rose windows, placed high up on the west, north and south faces of the cathedral. Its priceless treasures also include a Catholic relic, the crown of thorns, which is only occasionally displayed, including on Fridays during Lent.\n\n“It’s not one relic, not one piece of glass – it’s the totality,” said Barbara Drake Boehm, senior curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s medieval Cloisters branch in New York, her voice shaking as she tried to put into words what the cathedral meant. “It’s the very soul of Paris, but it’s not just for French people. For all humanity, it’s one of the great monuments to the best of civilization.”\n\n'History collapsing right before our eyes':Travelers express shock, horror over Notre Dame fire, share memories of their visits\n\nMore:Hunchback, bees and relics: As Notre Dame burns, 5 things to know about the cathedral\n\nThe renovation project was part of an effort to save the deteriorating building. Weather and pollution have taken their toll on the stone structure.\n\n“Pollution is the biggest culprit,” Philippe Villeneuve, architect in chief of historic monuments in France, told Time magazine in 2017. “We need to replace the ruined stones. We need to replace the joints with traditional materials. This is going to be extensive.”\n\nConstruction of the cathedral took more than 100 years to complete. The result is that, although it is predominantly French Gothic, there are areas that reflect the Renaissance and the Naturalism era of construction.\n\nStill, the cathedral is widely considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in the world.

CNS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince early in the pandemic, China has used health codes on mobile phones to track individuals’ health statuses. The color of these codes – in red, amber or green – decides whether users can leave their homes, use public transport and enter public places, or potentially need to quarantine.\n\nUnder the guidelines released Wednesday, people will be able to enter most places without showing a negative test result or their health code – a significant step after nearly three years of disruption to people’s daily routines and livelihoods.\n\nOnly a few exceptions will still require these checks, including nursing homes, medical institutions and secondary schools. Businesses can now determine their own prevention and control policies, the report added.\n\nHome quarantine allowed\n\nIn another massive change, asymptomatic Covid patients or those with mild symptoms will be allowed to quarantine at home instead of being taken to a government facility, unless they choose otherwise.\n\nPatients whose condition deteriorates will be transferred to hospital for treatment, the report said. Close contacts can also quarantine at home.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Chinese residents have described the chaos and stress of going into quarantine camps, many saying it was unclear when they would be allowed to leave, and others complaining of crowded or poor conditions.\n\nIn several cases, health workers reportedly killed the pets of those taken to government quarantine, citing health risks – triggering outrage on Chinese social media each time. Others criticized the policy after reports earlier this year of elderly residents being forced out of their homes in the middle of the night for transport to quarantine.\n\nMan dragged out of home after allegedly refusing to go to quarantine facility 00:59 - Source: CNN\n\nLimits on lockdown\n\nThe new guidelines also urge authorities to “ensure the normal functioning of society and basic medical services,” saying areas that aren’t designated high-risk should not restrict people’s movements or close businesses.\n\nLockdowns are only allowed in “high-risk areas,” and even then, should be “promptly” lifted if no new cases are found for five consecutive days, it said. It added that authorities are forbidden from blocking fire escapes, apartment or building entrances, and other gates, so residents can still evacuate and seek medical attention if needed.\n\nThis particular guideline comes at a particularly sensitive time, with China still reeling from a wave of rare public protest in late November and early December, that had been triggered by a deadly fire in the far western Xinjiang region. Public fury had swept the nation after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nDuring the protests, thousands across the country took to the streets to call for an end to lockdowns and other zero-Covid measures – with some voicing broader grievances against censorship and the ruling Communist Party’s authoritarian leadership.\n\n'Chilling': Protester tells CNN what the atmosphere is like in China 03:57 - Source: CNN\n\nVaccination plan\n\nThe State Council on Wednesday also emphasized the need to accelerate Covid vaccination among the elderly, saying all locations should be “administrating as many vaccinations as possible.”\n\nWhile the Omicron variant is milder than previous strains and China’s overall vaccination rate is high, experts say even a small number of severe cases among vulnerable and under-vaccinated groups like the elderly could overwhelm hospitals if infections spike across the country of 1.4 billion.\n\nMore than 86% of China’s population over 60 are fully vaccinated, according to China’s National Health Commission. That leaves around 25 million who have not received any shot, according to a comparison of official population figures and November 28 vaccination data. But booster rates are lower, with more than 45 million of the fully vaccinated elderly yet to receive an additional shot.\n\nFor the most at-risk over 80 age group, around two-thirds were fully vaccinated, but only 40% had received booster shots as of November 11, according to state media.\n\nDomestic travel\n\nThe rules also make domestic travel within China easier, with cross-regional travelers no longer needing to provide a negative test result or their health code – or test upon arrival.\n\nThese former requirements, as well as other travel restrictions such as provincial border closures and provincial train and bus suspensions, have made domestic travel difficult over the last few years.\n\nFor the many in China who left their hometowns to find work in other cities and provinces, that meant being separated from family for long stretches – or being stranded far from home without an income during snap lockdowns.\n\nResidents line up for Covid tests in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China on December 1. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nIn recent days, some social media users have pointed out that Lunar New Year is just a month away – the country’s biggest annual holiday, a time when people typically travel home to gather with family, akin to the American Thanksgiving.\n\nFor some, the prospect of mass nationwide travel has raised concern of the virus spreading once more. Others, long fatigued with the toll of zero-Covid, greeted the news with relief.\n\n“I haven’t been home for Chinese New Year for two years now, I’m crying,” one person said on Weibo. Another wrote: “It’s been a long time. Welcome home.”\n\nMedicine, schools, and monitoring\n\nA few other guidelines are also likely to ease the transition away from zero-Covid toward a less disruptive model.\n\nFor instance, schools without Covid outbreaks are now asked to carry out “normal offline teaching activities,” and to reopen on-campus facilities such as cafeterias, libraries and sports venues. Schools with Covid cases can continue “normal teaching and living,” as long as they designate certain “risk areas” with control measures.\n\nThe guidelines also emphasize the need to make medicine widely accessible, dropping restrictions that previously made it difficult to buy cold and fever medication in pharmacies. Since early in the pandemic, China has required a prescription and negative Covid test to buy these.\n\nPerhaps reflecting public concern that the relaxation in rules could cause a surge in cases, residents have rushed to drug stores, with reports last week that cold and fever medicines were flying off shelves.\n\nThe State Council also urged doctors and local medical institutions to continue closely monitoring the health situation of key populations, including the risks posed to elderly or immunocompromised residents.\n\nSome experts have warned that a broader reopening inevitably brings health risks, especially to those vulnerable groups.\n\n“The key risk when countries decide to move away from a zero-Covid policy is really the strain this will exert on the health care system,” said Ruklanthi de Alwis, deputy director for the Centre for Outbreak Preparedness at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/04/19/ezra-miller-arrested-again-hawaii-assault-against-woman/7374978001/", "title": "Ezra Miller, 'The Flash' actor, arrested for second time in Hawaii", "text": "Jennifer Sinco Kelleher\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nHONOLULU — Ezra Miller was arrested on suspicion of assault Tuesday, the second time the actor known for playing the Flash in \"Justice League\" films has been arrested in Hawaii in recent weeks.\n\nMiller became irate after being asked to leave a get-together at a Big Island home and threw a chair, hitting a woman in the forehead, said a news release from the Hawaii Police Department.\n\nThe woman refused treatment for a half-inch (1.3-centimeter) cut on her forehead, police said.\n\nMiller, described by police as a 29-year-old visitor from Vermont, was arrested during a traffic stop and released pending further investigation.\n\nAbout twelve hours after Miller’s arrest, the actor appeared via Zoom for a court hearing for an arrest last month at a Big Island karaoke bar.

But persistent inflation has reshaped their shopping habits.\n\nIn July, US retail sales were flat compared to the previous month, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday. That marks a slowdown from June, when retail sales rose by a revised 0.8% over the month.\n\nSpending at gas stations fell by 1.8% month over month, reflecting the recent drop in gas prices, while spending at grocery stores rose 0.2% for the month.\n\n“[American shoppers] are clearly spending money on consumables and basics at the expense of some discretionary merchandise,” said Sarah Henry, portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management.\n\nConsumers have no choice but to buy essentials like groceries and gas, although they may switch to cheaper brands or change how frequently they buy, said Kayla Bruun, economic analyst at decision intelligence company Morning Consult. “It’s really those discretionary goods we’re seeing a lot of cutback on, particularly among those lower- and middle-income groups,” she said. Retail sales at department stores, for example, dropped in the month of July and were also lower on a year-over-year basis.\n\nEven wealthier Americans are being impacted by the highest inflation in 40 years: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Tuesday on the company’s investor call that higher prices were contributing to an influx of higher-income shoppers at the discount store.\n\n“We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make,” McMillon said.\n\nHigher prices on food and gas impact lower-income households to a greater degree, because they must spend a larger share of their earnings for these necessary purchases, said Mike Rittler, head of retail card services at TD Bank.\n\n“It’s kind of a double whammy – you have less coming in, more going out. It really makes for challenging times,” he said, noting that the amount of debt people are carrying on their credit cards has been creeping up. The Federal Reserve said earlier this month that consumers added $40.1 billion worth of debt to their balance sheets in June.\n\nThe July data also showed that sales at home improvement stores rose by 1.5% over the month and by 10.1% from a year ago – as corroborated by recent earnings in this sector. Home Depot said Tuesday it had record sales in the most recent quarter, and that although the number of transactions ticked down by 3%, people spent about 9% more when they did make purchases. Lowe’s missed on expectations for same-store sales, but beat analyst estimates for earnings.\n\n“It speaks to the wealth effect of consumers who own homes,” Henry said.\n\nIncreasingly, experts worry that the divide between homeowners and renters is further driving economic inequality, as concerns grow that lower income households are losing more ground the longer inflation remains entrenched and prices for everything from groceries to rent keep rising.\n\nFor example, homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages are insulated from rising rents and are “not necessarily having to bear that burden of higher housing prices,” Bruun said, noting that lower-income adults are more likely to be renters, not homeowners.\n\n“There’s reasons to be optimistic, but also reasons to be concerned.

They were identified as Glenn Edward Bennett, 84, a customer who was shot in front of the store, and Safeway employee Donald Ray Surrett Jr., 66, who fought the shooter in the produce section, Miller said.\n\n“This is the Safeway employee who engaged with the shooter, which is to say he attempted to disarm the shooter and attacked this person, and we believe he prevented further deaths in addition to the quick police response,” Miller said. “Mr. Surrett acted heroically during this terrible incident.”\n\nGov. Kate Brown released a statement on Facebook Monday honoring Surrett.\n\n“While we are still gathering the facts about last night’s shooting, it’s clear that far more people could have been killed if not for the heroism of Donald Ray Surrett, Jr., who intervened to help stop the shooter, and the officers who entered while shots were still being fired,” Brown’s statement said. “In the face of senseless violence, they acted with selfless bravery. Their courage saved lives.”\n\nThe gunman – identified by police as Ethan Blair Miller, 20 – was found dead at the scene and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police spokeswoman said.\n\nPolice found an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun close to Miller’s body, according to Bend Police Chief Mike Krantz.\n\nThe shooting unfolded shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday at a shopping center, Krantz said. Police initially received reports there may have been more than one shooter, Sheila Miller said, but there is no evidence of a second shooter. There were reports of at least two other people who had injuries that were not life threatening, as well, she said.\n\nThe motive remains unclear, but police are aware of online posts that might be relevant, Sheila Miller said.\n\n“We are aware that the shooter may have posted information online regarding his plan. We are investigating this. We have no evidence of previous threats or prior knowledge of the shooter. We received information about the shooter’s writings after the incident had taken place and the shooter has no criminal history in the area,” Miller said.\n\nSafeway said in a statement the company was saddened by the “senseless violence.”\n\n“Our thoughts and actions now are directed toward supporting our associates, customers, and the community affected by this tragedy. We thank the officers at the Bend Police Department for their response and will continue to support the department’s investigation over the coming days,” the company’s statement said.\n\nSunday’s shooting follows a spate of other grocery store shootings across the country in the past year and amid an overall surge in “active shooter” incidents, according to an FBI report.\n\nIn May, 10 people were killed in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack in Buffalo, New York. A “hero” security guard and a beloved teacher were among those gunned down.\n\nIn March, another 10 people were gunned down at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. A veteran police officer with seven children was among those killed.\n\nLast September, a gunman shot 15 people – including one fatally – at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee. Some people hid in freezers to survive.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nMiller said police received multiple calls of shots fired around 7 p.m. at the Forum shopping center in northeast Bend.\n\nThe gunman entered from an apartment complex behind the shopping center, Miller said. He moved through the parking lot while firing rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before entering the Safeway.\n\nOnce inside, he shot a customer – Glenn Edward Bennett – who died while being taken to the hospital, Miller said.\n\nEmergency personnel respond to a shooting at the Forum shopping center in east Bend, Oregon, Sunday, August 28, 2022. Ryan Brennecke/The Bulletin/AP\n\nThe gunman continued to make his way through the store before having an altercation with and fatally shooting Donald Ray Surrett Jr., Miller said.\n\n“As our officers responded, they entered Safeway while shots were still being fired. They found the apparent shooter dead inside Safeway,” Miller said.\n\nAn AR-15 and shotgun were found near the gunman’s body, Miller said. Bend police did not fire any shots, she said.\n\nHow the gunman obtained firearms is under investigation. Because of online postings, Bend police also contacted the Oregon State Police Bomb Squad, who cleared the grocery store and the apartment complex, Miller said.\n\nPolice said it’s unclear how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting.\n\nOfficers were on scene within three minutes of the first 911 call, Miller said. It took four minutes from the time officers were dispatched to the time the shooter’s body was found, police said.\n\nPlans appeared to be posted online\n\nA search warrant was served on the gunman’s vehicle and home, Miller said. Investigators found three Molotov cocktails in his car along with a sawed-off shotgun. Police are working with the ATF to learn if the firearms were legal.\n\nIn his apartment, authorities found additional ammunition and digital devices that are currently being reviewed.\n\nCNN has identified several blog entries appearing to belong to Ethan Miller which were published on the blogging site “Wattpad” detailing a plan and reasons for the shooting. The posts were made public on the evening of August 28 by an anonymous account and viewable for 12 hours, according to Wattpad. The posts have since been removed.\n\nThe first blog entry was headlined June 29 and signed with the name Ethan. The writer of the post blamed Covid-19 and quarantine for worsening their mental health.\n\nInitially, this person planned a shooting inside a high school on September 8, according to the posts.\n\nMore than 35 posts were made by this same account on the blogging site. Most of the posts indicated a desire to commit violence.\n\nOne post referenced being “partially inspired” by the Columbine High School shooting.\n\nIn other posts signed with the name Ethan, several reasons were cited for the writer turning into a “ticking time bomb,” which included their family and their love life, which was detailed in a post headlined July 8.\n\nThe writer mentioned buying a shotgun and an AR-15 for the shooting, and said they hoped to kill over 40 people.\n\nThroughout the posts, other mass shootings were also referenced.\n\n“I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’”\n\nCustomers and employees described a chaotic scene at Safeway, saying they scrambled for safety as bullets flew.\n\nJosh Caba told CNN affiliate KTVZ he and his four children were shopping in the store when the shots broke out.\n\n“We started heading to the front. Then we heard I don’t know how many shots out front – six or seven. I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’ People were screaming. … it was a horrifying experience,” Caba told KTVZ.\n\nCaba said he was worried about his wife, who stayed in the car because she wasn’t feeling well. But as he and three of his children fled through exit doors by the produce department, he found that his wife had driven to the back of the store and was “sitting in the car, saying ‘Get in the car! Get in the car!’” KTVZ reported.\n\nThe father was able to rush back into the store and find their fourth child, he told KTVZ.\n\nAn employee who identified himself only as Robert told the Central Oregon Daily News that he and other employees were working a closing shift in the deli when they heard loud gunfire.\n\n“Me and three other employees ran into a walk-in refrigerator and closed the door and stayed there and stayed hidden until authorities arrived,” he said.\n\nA third person was struck and was in good condition at St. Charles Medical Center, spokesperson Lisa Goodman said.\n\nResidents in the central Oregon city were stunned by the shooting.\n\n“I heard anywhere from five to eight shots. I thought it sounded like backfire,” Heather Thompson, who lives across the street, told Central Oregon Daily News.\n\n“Less than a minute later, there were 10 to 20 shots, and then another 10 to 20 shots,” she said. “And by that time, I went inside and told my dad to get away from the window. And people were running out of Safeway.”\n\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify when the Wattpad posts were made public.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Tina Burnside Caroll Alvarado Hannah Sarisohn", "Amir Vera", "Tina Burnside", "Caroll Alvarado", "Hannah Sarisohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/politics/senate-gun-control-negotiations/index.html", "title": "America's deadly weekend of more mass shootings raise stakes for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn South Carolina and Texas, victims were shot at a high school graduation party. In Kentucky, funeral goers were hit outside a church. Multiple shooters sprayed a crowd with bullets in Philadelphia. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, shots rang out at a nightclub.\n\nJust America going about its normal business this weekend under the deadly daily shadow of gun violence, as a staggering 10 mass shootings since Friday deepened trauma from recent massacres at a Buffalo supermarket, a Texas elementary school and a mass shooting at a Tulsa, Oklahoma medical center.\n\nThe horrific new trail of death and injury, of broken families and mourning and fear, raised the stakes for the Senate’s latest effort to finally do something to stem the shootings and massacres and the costs for yet another political failure.\n\nTim Kelly, the mayor of Chattanooga, where three people were killed and 14 injured after a weekend shooting, warned on CNN’s “New Day” on Monday that “it’s going to be a long, hot summer” for cities like his unless Congress passes common sense gun reform.\n\nBut owing to political constraints rooted in conservative opposition to wide-ranging changes to the law, the congressional effort, led by Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy and Texas Sen John Cornyn, a Republican, may not fully address shootings like the one in Chattanooga. Still, the measure reaches a critical point this week even if it won’t be enough to end the violence in a nation awash in firearms.\n\nAnd if even one massacre is averted by incremental measures and some lives are saved, it could mark an important political win, and a sign that Washington can actually do something to mitigate a deadly threat.\n\nMurphy told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that despite formidable obstacles to success, he had never been more confident of getting something done after years fighting to tighten firearms laws following the massacre at an elementary school in his state in 2012, after which, reforms failed in Congress.\n\n“I’ve never been part of negotiations as serious as these. There are more Republicans at the table talking about changing our gun laws, investing in mental health than at any time since Sandy Hook,” Murphy told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I’ve also been part of many failed negotiations in the past, so I’m sober-minded about our chances.”\n\nMurphy said that the most likely areas for progress included “red flag” laws that can be used to confiscate weapons from people who are judged a danger or some tightening of background check rules in addition to more resources for mental health.\n\nMurphy on gun talks: 'The consequences of failure... are more significant than ever' 02:23 - Source: CNN\n\nA fierce political debate\n\nThere is no realistic chance that President Joe Biden’s appeal in a moving televised address last Thursday for a ban on assault-style weapons used in many recent massacres will be successful.\n\nAnd even if Cornyn and Murphy can forge a deal, there will still be a gut check moment for Republican senators. At least 10 of them will be needed to vote with Democrats to overcome the filibuster requirement for a super majority in most votes in the chamber. And backing any restriction carries the risk of being branded a traitor by the most activist Republican voters who decide primaries and oppose any form of new restrictions.\n\nGOP leaders like ex-President Donald Trump are meanwhile portraying any tinkering around the edges of gun laws as the start of an inevitable slippery slope towards ending the Second Amendment, an exaggeration and mischaracterization that has often scuppered action in the past.\n\nStill, there are signs that the momentum towards tighter gun restrictions is growing in the country with polls showing majority support for tighter background checks and assault weapons bans. In one case, a group of 250 people who identified themselves as conservatives and gun owners took out an ad in the Dallas Morning News calling on Cornyn to work to enhance gun control.\n\n“We vote for Republican Senators. We believe in the Second Amendment. Like many, we are struggling for good answers to our current problem of gun violence in America,” the group wrote in an open letter.\n\nBut the structural impediments for reform remain strong. While many Americans see their right to bear arms as a critical plank of self-defense and national identity, polls show even many Republicans consider some kind of sensible extra regulations is necessary. But an activist minority in the GOP and the power of the gun lobby has thwarted almost all reform efforts in response to mass killings in recent years.\n\nThe question before the Senate this week then is not just whether the nation’s political estrangement allows the passage of some action to make the country a little safer. It is whether a genuine debate is even possible in a bitterly divided Washington about the true causes of the deaths of so many innocent people.\n\n“Enough, Enough,” Biden said on Thursday soon after his second trip in a few weeks to console those left behind after one of America’s mass killings. His words found an echo Sunday in Chattanooga, Tennessee where the city’s mayor spent his second weekend in a row holding a news conference after a mass killing.\n\n“Once again, we had people decide to solve their issues with firearms,” said Kelly, who is not officially affiliated with either party and who says he is a hunter and favors responsible gun ownership but wants to see expanded background checks and limits on high capacity magazines.\n\nHe continued, “I’m tired of standing in front of you talking about guns and bodies.”\n\nA deadly trail of weekend shootings\n\nBy early Sunday evening, figures detailing a weekend of violence had reached stunning levels, even given the regular daily toll of gun killings and incidents.\n\nSince Friday alone, there were 10 mass shootings in the country that killed at least 12 people and injured many more. That’s not to mention all the other smaller shootings that occurred, as part of the drum beat of death. At times at the weekend, news of more shootings came in at speeds that were difficult to believe.\n\nOf course, most Americans went about their business without coming into contact with violence. But the indiscriminate nature of shootings recently at schools, medical offices, supermarkets, at bars and at parties shows how deeply engrained the threat of gun violence is in everyday life. No one killed in these outrages had any reasons to think that their lives were about to end in relatively mundane locations.\n\nThree people were killed and 11 were wounded in Philadelphia on Saturday night. Police said multiple shooters fired into a crowd in the busy South Street night life area. “Once again, we see lives senselessly lost and those injured in yet another horrendous, brazen and despicable act of gun violence,” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said.\n\nIn the incident in Tennessee, two people died from gunshot wounds and 14 were hurt at a shooting in Chattanooga. A third person died after being hit by a vehicle during the incident, police said.\n\nAcross the country, in Mesa, Arizona, two people were killed and two were wounded at a shooting at a bar.\n\nIn Phoenix, Arizona, a 14-year-old girl died and at least eight people were injured in a downtown shooting early on Saturday morning.\n\nIn yet another mass shooting, in Summerton, South Carolina, eight people were wounded and one was killed. Police told CNN affiliate WIS that two cars pulled into a yard where a high school graduation party was taking place. Victims ranged from 13 to 36 years old.\n\nFive people were wounded at another high school graduation party in Socorro,Texas, when someone started firing into a crowd.\n\nThree people were wounded and one was killed in an incident in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nIn Chesterfield, Virginia: one person was killed and another five were wounded\n\nAnd in, Macon, Georgia, three people were injured and one was killed when shots were fired in a neighborhood in Bibb County.\n\nIn several other incidents that would not be classified as mass shootings in recent days, two people attending a funeral were shot outside a church in Lexington, Kentucky, police said. Both were injured. And on Friday, a former judge in Wisconsin was shot dead in what police called a targeted attack.\n\nA huge political disconnect\n\nMurphy told CNN in his interview on “State of the Union” that the recent outburst of violence across the nation had taken anxiety about gun violence to levels he had not previously seen.\n\n“When I was in Connecticut last week, I have never seen the look on parents’ faces that I did. There’s just a deep, deep fear for our children right now,” he told Tapper. Murphy also said that there was “also a fear that government is so fundamentally broken that it can’t put politics aside to guarantee the one thing that matters most to adults in this country, the physical safety of their children.”\n\n“And so I think the possibility of success is better than ever before,” the Connecticut Democrat said. “But I think the consequences of failure for our entire democracy are more significant than ever.”\n\nYet the political position of many Republicans – as the party eyes big wins in the midterm elections in November – also weighs against the chances of success.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise, the Republican House Minority whip, is a victim of gun violence himself after being gravely wounded in a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in 2017. The Louisiana lawmaker however accused Democrats of using the recent mass shooting in Texas as an excuse to infringe gun rights and implied that such shootings almost always had a cause that could not be blamed simply on guns.\n\n“It immediately becomes about Democrats wanting to take away guns,” Scalise said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n“Let’s go search for the root of the problem. How can we do a better job of connecting the dots and stopping something before it happens. Like we did after September 11th, which has worked really well as it relates to stopping terrorist attacks,” Scalise said. When asked why the US had far more gun killings than other developed nations where firearms are far less available, he blamed what he said were “crazy” calls by liberal Democrats to defund the police.\n\nThe difference between Murphy and Scalise on this issue underscores the reasons why hopes for progress this week in Washington are tempered by the experience of the deep chasm that exists in the US on gun reform. And it raises questions over whether Washington will ever be able to keep Americans safe.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/26/afghanistan-news-kabul-evacuations-continue-pullout-deadline-looms/5592386001/", "title": "Afghanistan live updates: Joe Biden on deadly Kabul airport bombing", "text": "A 13th U.S. service member was killed in attacks at the Kabul airport Thursday, U.S. officials confirmed.\n\n\"The latest number of injured is now 18, all of whom are in the process of being aeromedically evacuated from Afghanistan on specially equipped C-17s with embarked surgical units,\" Navy Capt.

They are not our friends, we have never said that.”\n\nPsaki, however, noted that the United States must continue to work with the Taliban due to the control they have in the country.\n\n“It is also the reality that the Taliban controls large swathes of Afghanistan,” she said. “And to date, because of coordination with the Taliban, we've been able to evacuate more than 104,000 people, save 104,000 lives, and that coordination is necessary in order to continue our evacuation measures.”\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nWhite House to GOP senators calling for Biden resignation: ‘It’s not a day for politics’\n\nPsaki said the terrorist attack at the Kabul airport is “not a day for politics” when asked about calls for Biden to resign from two Republican U.S. senators, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Josh Hawley of Missouri.\n\n“This is a day where US service members, 12 of them, lost their lives at the hands of terrorists. It’s not a day for politics,” Psaki said.\n\n“And we would expect that any American -- whether they're elected or not -- would stand with us and our commitment to going after and fighting and killing those terrorists.\"\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPsaki: Some Americans not ready to leave yet\n\nThere are some Americans who have not decided to leave by the Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw all U.S. troops, according to Psaki.\n\nPsaki said \"many of these Americans who remain are dual citizens\" who may have extended family members or others they want to bring with them back to the U.S.\n\n\"Our commitment to them does not end,\" she said. \"We will continue to work to get them out.\"\n\nBut she added the focus now is getting every American out who wants to leave in the next few days.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden ‘somber and outraged’ by terrorist attacks\n\nPsaki said Biden was “somber and outraged” Thursday as the terrorist attack unfolded at the Kabul airport.\n\nBiden waited until 5 p.m. ET. to address attacks that occurred hours earlier because, Psaki said, he wanted to have all the information before he spoke to the public.\n\n“Any day where you lose service members is maybe the worst day of your presidency, and hopefully there's not more. But we are certainly early in the presidency at this point in time.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nWhite House says Taliban did not know about terrorist attack beforehand\n\nPsaki said there is no information to suggest the Taliban knew about the ISIS-K terrorist attack at the Kabul airport ahead of time.\n\n“We don't have any information at this point in time – and that has not changed over the last couple of hours – to suggest the Taliban had knowledge of or was engaged in or involved in this attack.”\n\nPsaki said the Taliban are “not our friends,” but said it is a reality that they occupy Afghanistan. As a result, she said the U.S. has tried to work with the Taliban government to ensure the evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies.\n\n“This is not about trust. But because they control large swaths of the country ... we have to coordinate with them.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPsaki: Biden has yet to call families of victims\n\nPsaki said the president is waiting for the Pentagon to complete its process of calling next of kin for victims of the Kabul attacks before he makes phone calls to their families.\n\nPsaki said the process is still underway but added that he would do everything he can to honor the sacrifice and service of those who lost their lives today.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden signals he's open to sending in more forces to Afghanistan\n\nBiden said he's willing to send in additional forces but suggested his commanders were behind his plan to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the Aug. 31 deadline he set.\n\n\"I've instructed the military, whatever they need – if they need additional force – I will grant it,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president said he ordered his commanders to \"to develop operational plans to strike Isis key assets, leadership, and facilities.\"\n\n\"We will respond with force and precision at our time at a place we choose in a moment of our choosing,\" he said.\n\nBiden emphasized that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and the commanders in the field have communicated that they prefer to stick to the mission, which is designed to get as many people out before the end of the month.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki later said any additional troops would be minimal.\n\n“What we're talking about here is avenging these deaths from terrorists,” Psaki said. “We're not talking about sending tens of thousands of troops back for an endless war that we've been fighting for 20 years.”\n\n— Courtney Subramanian and Joey Garrs\n\nBiden to attackers: We will hunt you down\n\nBiden said he was made aware by the U.S. intelligence community that ISIS-K had been planning \"a complex set of attacks\" against U.S. personnel and others.\n\nAfter offering his condolences to the families of the victims of the explosions outside Kabul's airport, he delivered a stern warning for those who carried out the attack.\n\n\"To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget,\" he said. \"We will hunt you down and make you pay.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden bears ‘responsibility’ for Afghanistan attacks\n\nBiden says he bears the “responsibility” for the attacks outside of the Kabul airport that killed 12 U.S. service members and wounded others, the first casualties in Afghanistan since Feb. 2020.\n\n\"I bear the responsibility, fundamentally, of everything that's happened of late,” Biden said.\n\nBiden noted that former President Donald Trump made a deal with the Taliban that if the United States got out service members by May 1 of this year, the Taliban would not attack U.S. troops.\n\n“The reason why there were no attacks on Americans as you said, from the date until I came in office was because the commitment was made by President Trump, ‘I will be out by May 1, in the meantime, you agree not to attack any Americans.’ That was a deal. That's why no American was attacked.”\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden defends Afghanistan withdrawal after Kabul terrorist attack\n\nBiden said he stands by the decision to pull the military out of Afghanistan after 20 years of occupation in the country even after the deadly Kabul airport terrorist attack.\n\n“Yes, I do.” Biden said in response to a question from a reporter.\n\nBiden said the alternative would have been to send thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan if he did not uphold his predecessor Donald Trump’s agreement to withdraw. He also said the threat of terrorism – the original purpose behind the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan – has now “metastasized around the world.”\n\n“I have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives, to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan, a country that has never once in its entire history been a united country,” Biden said.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, it was time to end a 20-year war.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden confirms U.S. told Taliban to let certain evacuees through\n\nBiden confirmed that on occasion, U.S. officials in Kabul told their Taliban counterparts to let certain groups of evacuees through security checkpoints but said he couldn't say whether there were any lists identifying individuals that were handed over.\n\nPolitico earlier reported that U.S. officials gave the Taliban a list of names of American citizens, green card holders and Afghans who were granted access to the Kabul airport in order to expedite the process. The move reportedly prompted backlash among lawmakers and military officials who said the decision put a target on those individuals' backs.\n\n\"To the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred, they've been let through,\" he said. \"But I can't tell you with any certitude that there's actually been a list of names...there may have been, but I know of no circumstances.\"\n\nBiden added that \"it could very well have happened.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden won't guarantee all Afghan allies will get out of Afghanistan\n\nBiden said the U.S. will work to continue to evacuate Afghan allies out of Afghanistan, saying “it matters.”\n\nBut he said he knows of “no conflict” where one side was able to guarantee everyone is able to leave.\n\n“Getting every single person out can't be guaranteed,” Biden said.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden says U.S. will complete evacuation mission\n\nBiden said that he has ordered officials to complete the mission to evacuate Afghanistan by their Aug. 31 deadline.\n\n“We must complete this mission and we will,” Biden said.\n\nHe said that the United States “will not be deterred” by Thursday’s attacks outside the Kabul airport will not deter the mission.\n\n“America will not be intimidated,” he said. “I have the utmost confidence in our brave service members that they’ll continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.”\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden leads moment of silence, vows to evacuate Americans who want out\n\nBiden finished his prepared remarks by leading a moment of silence for the U.S. service members killed in the Kabul airport terrorist attacks and vowing the U.S. will ensure the evacuation of all Americans who want to leave the country.\n\n“After our troops are withdrawn,” Biden said, the U.S. will “find means to find any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan.”\n\nBiden has stuck to a Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw from Afghanistan, but the administration has said it will continue to work to evacuate people even after the exit.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\n12 U.S. service members killed at Kabul airport; 60 Afghans killed\n\nTwelve U.S. service members were killed Thursday at the Kabul airport after a pair of bombings and a gun attack from the terrorist organization ISIS-K, the Pentagon said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Associated Press reported those killed included 11 Marines and one Navy corpsman.\n\nGen. Kenneth McKenzie said 15 additional U.S. service members were injured and a “number of Afghan civilians” were also killed or injured. The attacks also killed 60 Afghans.\n\nMcKenzie said the bombing on the Abbey Gate at the Kabul airport was followed by “a number of ISIS-gunmen” opening fire on civilians and military forces. He said a second bombing later occurred at the nearby Baron Hotel outside the airport but could not say whether it was a suicide bomb.\n\nA pair of explosions rocked the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul as the U.S. worked to rapidly evacuate American and Afghan civilians before the Aug. 31 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nThe explosions came after repeated warnings from President Joe Biden about the threat of ISIS-K terrorist attacks as the withdrawal deadline drew nearer. Biden has yet to address the attacks.\n\n“We thought this would happen sooner or later,” McKenzie said. “It’s tragic that it happened today.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPelosi: Marine deaths show why lawmaker trips imperil evacuation\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the “heartbreak” over the deaths of 12 service members at the Kabul airport is further proof that members of Congress should not be making unauthorized trips to the war-torn nation because it “would unnecessarily divert needed resources” from the mission to evacuate remaining Americans.\n\n“It should be clear that any Member presence presents a danger and an opportunity cost of resources, regardless of whatever value that Members consider they may add by such trips,” the California Democrat wrote in a letter to lawmakers that was released Thursday afternoon.\n\nHer warning came a day after two lawmakers - Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., and Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich. - flew into Afghanistan without military or legislative authority on a chartered aircraft and were on the ground at the Kabul airport for several hours.\n\n“As Members of Congress, we have a duty to provide oversight on the executive branch,’” the two said in a joint statement following their return Wednesday. “We conducted this visit in secret, speaking about it only after our departure, to minimize the risk and disruption to the people on the ground, and because we were there to gather information, not to grandstand.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nU.S. in contact with 1,000 Americans still in Afghanistan after evacuating 500 more\n\nThe U.S. is in contact with 1,000 Americans who remain in Afghanistan and have heard from 500 additional people “purporting to be Americans in Afghanistan who want to leave,” according to a State Department official.\n\nThe number of remaining Americans is down from 1,500 who were there as of Wednesday night Eastern time. The State Department said 500 were evacuated in the past 24 hours. The official said the vast majority – perhaps two-thirds – of the remaining 1,000 American citizens said they were taking steps to leave.\n\n\"We believe many, if not most, of these individuals are nearly or already out of the country.\"\n\nU.S. officials believe many of the additional 500 people who claimed to be American citizens are not.\n\n“We immediately began attempting to reach these individuals by phone, text, and email. Based on our experience, many of these will not turn out to be U.S. citizens in need of our assistance,” the official said.\n\nThe Pentagon said it is continuing its missions to evacuate Americans from Afghanistan even after a pair of bombings and gun attack killed at least 12 U.S. service members at the Kabul airport Thursday.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPentagon: U.S. expects attacks to continue and 'prepared to take action'\n\nThe threat from ISIS-K is \"extremely real\" and officials have been telegraphing warnings of attacks for several days, Marine Corps Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr., commander of U.S. Central command, told reporters Thursday.\n\nHe said threat streams are \"imminent\" and range from rocket attacks to vehicle-borne suicide attacks. U.S. officials are working with the Taliban, who are providing outer security outside the airport compound, to monitor possible attacks.\n\n\"We believe that is their desire to continue those attacks and we expect those attacks to continue, and we're doing everything we can to be prepared for those attacks,\" McKenzie said.\n\nMcKenzie also said the U.S. is prepared to take action over the deaths of U.S. service members but officials are still working to determine who's behind the attack.\n\n\"If we can find who's associated with this, we will go after them,\" he said. \"We've been clear all along that we're going to retain the right to operate against ISIS in Afghanistan, and we are working very hard right now to determine attribution.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nOfficial: Suicide bomber was being checked by service members\n\nMarine Corps Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr. said he believes the suicide bomber at the Kabul airport Thursday was being searched and checked by U.S. service members at the airport’s Abbey gate when he detonated the bomb.\n\n“I know this, he did not get inside,” McKenzie said.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nTaliban thwarted attacks on U.S. service members, officials said\n\nMcKenzie, during his briefing, alluded to a variety of imminent threats of concern to the U.S. presence at the Kabul airport, including intelligence indicating that a vehicle-borne IED – a truck bomb – could be imminent. It was also one of the threats that the U.S. military was working closely with the Taliban on, to help prevent future attacks.\n\nMcKenzie described “very, very real threat streams” that suggested an attack could occur at any moment. He said the airbase had good defenses against suspected rocket attacks that ISIS-K might be planning. ‘We also know they aim to get a suicide or vehicle-borne suicide attack in if they can, from a small vehicle to a large vehicle,” McKenzie said. “They're working all those options.”\n\nSome potential attacks on United States service members were thwarted, based on information provided by the U.S, by the Taliban, he said.\n\n“So in terms of practical things that we're doing, okay, again, we've reached out to the Taliban, we've told them, ‘You need to continue to push out the security parameter,’ “ McKenzie said. “We've identified some roads that we would like for them to close, they've identified that they will be willing to close those roads.”\n\n“As we assess the threat of a suicide borne vehicle threat, it's high right now. So we want to reduce the possibility of one of those vehicles getting close,” McKenzie added. So, with the Taliban’s help, “we're actually moving very aggressively to do that.”\n\nAlthough the U.S. does not give the Taliban a full range of information, they are given “enough to act and time and space to try to prevent these attacks,” McKenzie said.\n\n— Rebecca Morin and Josh Meyer\n\nEvacuations at Kabul airport continue\n\nMarine Corps Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr., commander of U.S. Central command, said evacuations would continue as the U.S. prepares to withdraw from Afghanistan by Aug. 31. He said about 1,000 American citizens remain in Afghanistan at this point.\n\n\"Despite this attack, we're continuing the mission, the evacuation of this state,” he said. “While we’re saddened by the loss of life, both U.S. and Afghan, we’re continuing to execute the mission.”\n\n— Joey Garrison and Tom Vandenbrook\n\nTaliban ‘strongly condemns’ bombing, says US was responsible for security\n\nThe Taliban government in Afghanistan said it “strongly condemns” the bombing outside the Kabul airport and said the attack occurred in an area where the U.S. is responsible for security.\n\nThe attack was believed to have been orchestrated by the ISIS-K terrorist network, an enemy of the Taliban.\n\n“The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns the bombing of civilians at Kabul airport, which took place in an area where US forces are responsible for security,” Shaheen said in a tweet. “The Islamic Emirate is paying close attention to the security and protection of its people, and evil circles will be strictly stopped.\"\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed the attack resulted in “a number of U.S. and civilian casualties.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nGermany has ended evacuation mission in Afghanistan\n\nBERLIN — The German defense minister says her country has ended its evacuation mission in Afghanistan.\n\nDefense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the last of the German military aircraft and troops arrived in Tashkent, Uzbekistan on Thursday evening. She said that, in all, Germany evacuated 5,347 people from at least 45 nations, including more than 4,000 Afghans.\n\nGermany hadn’t publicly specified ahead of time when exactly its flights would end but other European nations also have been wrapping up their evacuation efforts ahead of an Aug. 31 deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer said the last flights had been loading at the time of Thursday’s attacks just outside the airport and the German commander then set in motion plans for an “emergency departure.”\n\nShe added that “the attacks we saw this afternoon … have made clear that an extension of the operation in Kabul was not possible. The security situation on the ground, and also the Taliban’s decision not to tolerate an extension beyond Aug. 31, made it impossible.”\n\n— Associated Press\n\nBiden's Israeli PM meeting delayed a day after Kabul attack\n\nPresident Joe Biden's first face-to-face meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at the White House was postponed until Friday following a pair of deadly explosions outside Kabul's airport that killed an unspecified number of U.S. service members.\n\nThe president's meeting with Bennett, who took office in June, was originally scheduled for Thursday afternoon before it was delayed as Biden met with his national security team in the Situation Room on developments in Afghanistan. Among those who attended included Secretary Antony Blinken, Secretary Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and commanders on the ground, according to the White House.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who is traveling from Southeast Asia, also attended the meeting, according to her office.\n\nThe president's virtual meeting with a bipartisan group of governors who offered to temporarily house or help resettle Afghans has also been canceled, according to the White House.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nIntelligence official: U.S. operating under assumption that attacks were ISIS-K\n\nU.S. intelligence officials had no comment Thursday on what kinds of specific information they obtained that led to the urgent warnings for U.S. citizens to evacuate the airport before the attacks. But one senior staffer on the Senate Intelligence committee told USA TODAY that the threat stream flowing into the CIA and other intelligence agencies \"was pretty much flashing red for 3 days.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence officials are operating under the assumption that the attacks at Kabul airport Thursday were carried out by ISIS-K, given their motive and general threat intelligence received in recent weeks and days.\n\nA senior U.S. intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the intelligence community has made no specific or formal attribution that the attacks were ISIS-K, noting \"it's certainly something that they would gain a lot from from doing.\"\n\n“This is a perfect opportunity for them to stick it to the Taliban, stick it to us and gain a national stage to show that they're there, as terrorist groups will want to do,” the official noted.\n\nThe official also said he could not discuss the particulars of the intelligence that led the Biden administration to urge Americans to evacuate the airport, but said those warnings from the State Department and White House were prompted by recently gathered information provided by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nHospital in Kabul reports 30 wounded people in treatment; six dead upon arrival\n\nAn emergency hospital in Kabul says 30 people wounded in two explosions near Kabul’s international airport arrived for treatment on Thursday, according to the Wall Street Journal and TOLO News, an Afghan broadcaster.\n\nOf those taken by the hospital, six were dead on arrival. The Pentagon earlier confirmed “a number of U.S. and civilian casualties” as a result of the two explosions.\n\n— Matthew Brown\n\nMore:Thousands of Afghans are looking for refuge in the U.S. But the immigration process isn't simple.\n\nPentagon confirms 'unknown number of casualties' after Kabul airport explosion\n\nPentagon press Secretary John Kirby confirmed there was “an unknown number of casualties” resulting from an explosion at the Abbey Gate of Kabul’s international airport Thursday.\n\nAll gates at Hamid Karzai International Airport have since been shut down, according to a Department of Defense official.\n\n— Matthew Brown and Tom Vandenbrook\n\nDefense officials have been alarmed by threats from ISIS-K group\n\nDefense officials have been alarmed in recent days by threats at Hamid Karzai International Airport by ISIS-K, terrorists who are sworn enemies of the Taliban. One official deemed the threat from a suicide bomber from ISIS-K to be the chief concern for Afghans and U.S. citizens crowding the gates to the airport, and U.S. troops guarding it.\n\nISIS-K is an offshoot of the Islamic State terrorists who established a sprawling caliphate in Iraq and Syria that was eventually destroyed by a U.S.-led bombing campaign. The K stands for Khorasan, the group's offshoot in Afghanistan and Pakistan. They have mounted savage attacks in Kabul, targeting a girls' school and maternity hospital.\n\n— Tom Vandenbrook\n\nEmbassy warns U.S. citizens to avoid Kabul airport after explosion\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kabul is warning U.S. citizens to avoid Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul after a large explosion and reports of gunfire.\n\nThe embassy issued an alert on Thursday morning telling U.S. citizens who are at the airport’s three gates to leave immediately. Those that aren’t there should avoid traveling to the airport, according to the alert.\n\n— Rick Rouan\n\nExplosion leaves chaotic, bloody scene outside airport in Kabul\n\nThe explosion outside the gates of Kabul’s international airport Thursday, where U.S. and allied force evacuations are taking place, left a chaotic and bloody scene, according to reports on the ground.\n\n1TV, an Afghan news station, published photos of the immediate aftermath of the blast showing people fleeing the scene.\n\nImages from reporters inside the airport showed a large dust cloud envelope the side of the airport as an explosion scattered crowds of people.\n\n— Matthew Brown\n\nPresident Biden briefed on explosion outside Kabul airport\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on Thursday’s explosion outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, the White House confirmed.\n\nDetails are still emerging about the explosion, which the Pentagon announced Thursday morning amid warnings about the threat of an ISIS-K terrorist attack at the airport.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nExplosion reported outside Kabul airport\n\nAn explosion was reported on the outskirts of Hamid Karzai International Airport Thursday after reports of gunfire.\n\nPentagon press secretary John Kirby confirmed that there was an explosion at the airport. The number of casualties was unconfirmed in the immediate aftermath.\n\nThe Pentagon did not say who was behind the explosion, but it comes after the State Department on Wednesday night alerted Americans at gates of the chaotic Kabul airport to \"leave immediately.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has increasingly warned about the threat of an ISIS-K terrorist attack at the Kabul airport as the Aug. 31 U.S. deadline to withdraw draws near.\n\n— Matthew Brown and Joey Garrison\n\nAllied nations wind down evacuations ahead of U.S. withdrawal\n\nAllied nations who are evacuating refugees and their own citizens out of the international airport in Kabul are warning that they won’t be able to continue operations as U.S. military forces begin their final drawdown from the country.\n\nCanada, which evacuated around 3,700 people, has ended military flights from Kabul, according to the Associated Press. Italy, the Netherlands and Poland will all conduct their final evacuation flights Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported. French officials have said they will no longer be able to operate out of the country after Friday, the newspaper reported. The United Kingdom’s defense minister, Ben Wallace, said Thursday the U.K. military has 11 flights scheduled to leave Kabul today but declined to say if those would be the country’s last, per the Guardian.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Union foreign affairs commission said the bloc “will be on the ground as long as necessary in order to complete the evacuation operations.”\n\nClose U.S. allies, including the leaders of influential G7 nations like Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, pressed President Joe Biden to delay the date for U.S. troop withdrawal. While each country operating evacuations at the Kabul airport haves some military presence, the 6,000 American troops on the ground currently make up the bulk of allied defense and operations.\n\nThe withdrawal comes as the U.S. Embassy in Kabul issued a warning late Wednesday night that Americans should avoid traveling to the airport unless directly contacted by a U.S. official, citing a heightened terror threat. Australia and the U.K. have also issued warnings of a “high threat” of a terrorist attack on the airport, according to The Washington Post.\n\n— Matthew Brown\n\nAfghan evacuees face challenges of life in a new country\n\nWASHINGTON – Thousands of Afghans who helped aid the U.S. military or are vulnerable in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan are arriving in the United States, where they are staying in military bases, at convention centers and even some community colleges as they await their next move.\n\nBut as they prepare to rebuild their lives in a foreign country, Afghans face a two-pronged issue: Trying to get out of their native country safely and then completely restarting their lives in a new home where they likely have few personal connections.\n\nThe process to get Afghan nationals out of the country has been riddled with setbacks and issues for many, from unfinished applicant paperwork to the Taliban blocking vulnerable Afghans from getting to the Kabul airport. Once they arrive in the U.S., nonprofit groups and non-governmental organizations are working feverishly to get Afghans placed in a community so they could rebuild their life.\n\n'Infuriating':Florida veteran is still working to bring Afghan translator home to the U.S.\n\nThe Biden administration has an Aug. 31 deadline to evacuate U.S. citizens and others who qualify for U.S. protection, which President Joe Biden said the United States is on track to meet. Since Aug. 14, the United States has evacuated or helped facilitate the evacuation of nearly 90,000 people from Afghanistan.\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nRead more here:Thousands of Afghans are looking for refuge in the U.S. But the immigration process isn't simple.\n\nKabul evacuations continue as pullout deadline looms\n\nAbout 13,400 people were evacuated out of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on Wednesday, according to the White House, down from the 19,000 people shuttled out of the country the day before.\n\nThe U.S. military ushered 5,100 people out on 17 flights while coalition allies used 74 flights to ferry 8,300 people out of the country.\n\nThe total number of evacuated people from Afghanistan since Afghanistan’s capitol city fell to the Taliban is now 95,700. The largest airlift in history was during the fall of Saigon, when 131,000 people were evacuated.\n\nNeither the White House nor the Pentagon are currently breaking down the number of Americans, third party nationals or Afghans within the number of evacuated people.\n\nThe dip in the day-over-day number of people evacuated comes as the U.S. faces a looming deadline to fully withdraw U.S. troops from the country by Aug. 31. President Joe Biden determined that U.S. troops would withdraw from the country by that date in the spring, a commitment that the Taliban has now set as a red line.\n\nMore:Thousands of Afghans are looking for refuge in the U.S. But the immigration process isn't simple.\n\nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there were still approximately 1,500 possible American citizens in Afghanistan. The State Department is in contact with 500 of those Americans and is “aggressively” attempting to reach the others, Blinken added.\n\nWhile both Biden and Blinken have said the U.S. is “on track to complete our mission” in Afghanistan by the Aug. 31 pullout deadline, Blinken stressed Tuesday that there was “no deadline” for getting Americans out of the country.\n\n\"Let me be crystal clear about this,” Blinken said during a press briefing. “There is no deadline on our work to help any remaining American citizens who decide they want to leave to do so, along with the many Afghans who have stood by us over these many years and want to leave and have been unable to do so. That effort will continue every day past Aug. 31.”\n\nThe State Department and Pentagon say that the Taliban is currently providing safe passage to Americans en route to the Kabul airport. Yet reports on the ground of violence and chaos at the airport persist while Taliban fighters continue to harass and stop Afghans attempting to flee the country.\n\n— Matthew Brown\n\nFew leave after warning of attack on Kabul airport\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Western nations warned Thursday of a possible attack on Kabul’s airport, where thousands have flocked as they try to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in the waning days of a massive airlift. Britain said an attack could come within hours.\n\nSeveral countries urged people to avoid the airport, where Belgium said there was a threat of a suicide bombing. But with just days left before the evacuation effort ends and American troops withdraw, few appeared to heed the call.\n\nOver the last week, the airport has been the scene of some of the most searing images of the chaotic end of America’s longest war and the Taliban’s takeover, as flight after flight landed to pull out those who fear a return to the militants’ brutal rule.\n\nAlready, some countries have ended their evacuations and begun to withdraw their soldiers and diplomats, likely signaling the beginning of the end of one of history’s largest airlifts. The Taliban have so far honored a pledge not to attack Western forces during the evacuation, but insist the foreign troops must be out by America’s self-imposed deadline of Aug. 31.\n\nBut overnight, new warnings emerged from Western capitals about a threat from Afghanistan’s Islamic State group affiliate, which likely has seen its ranks boosted by the Taliban’s freeing of prisoners during their blitz across the country.\n\n— Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/09/30/40-best-gifts-sisters-gift-ideas-your-sister-actually-want/3534122001/", "title": "37 best gifts for sisters 2022: Gift ideas your sister will love", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Many other Italian towns are worried about similar pay-outs, especially in areas where nightlife has become “increasingly boisterous, particularly since the Covid pandemic”, the paper said.\n\nThe ruling has fuelled debate further afield too. The Daily Mail reported in October that Londoners were “fighting to save the city’s nightlife after becoming fed-up with the constant noise complaints threatening to close their local boozers”. Dozens of London pubs, clubs and music venues were served with noise complaints after two years of quiet during lockdowns.\n\n‘Fighting to save the city’s nightlife’\n\nPeople who live in capital cities should expect noise, said Samuel Kasumu, a Conservative contender for London mayor. “No offence, but it’s London,” the former Boris Johnson aide told the Evening Standard. “It’s the most cosmopolitan, most dynamic city in the world. So you know, deal with it.”\n\n“Fury was first sparked” in summer 2022 when the “iconic” 200-year-old Compton Arms in north London was served with a licence review by Islington Council, “after four new neighbours who moved into the area during lockdown complained that revellers were too noisy”, the Mail said. Pub bosses claim the pandemic has resulted in more noise complaints, as people “got used to the ‘Covid quiet’”.\n\nThe Jago, a live music venue in Dalston, east London, received a noise abatement notice from Hackney Council last year. “Since the pandemic, many surrounding buildings [in Hackney] have been converted into residential properties,” the venue wrote on Instagram. “This has resulted in noise complaints, which put the future of our venue and others at risk.”", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2023/06/07"}]}
