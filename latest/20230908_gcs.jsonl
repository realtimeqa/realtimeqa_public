He is purported to have significant influence over Russian President Vladimir Putin and was described as “Putin’s Brain” by Foreign Affairs magazine.\n\nBoth Dugin and his daughter have been sanctioned by the United States. The United Kingdom sanctioned Dugina in July for being “a frequent and high-profile contributor of disinformation in relation to Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on various online platform,” it wrote.\n\nVideos of the explosion showed a vehicle on fire at the side of the road and smashed car parts strewn across the surrounding area. One unverified video appears to show Dugin at the scene.\n\nA friend of Dugina told TASS that he believed Dugina’s father was the true target of the blast – or possibly both of them – as the car belonged to Alexander.\n\n“It’s her father’s car,” Krasnov told TASS. “Dasha (Darya) drives another car, but she drove his car today, and Alexander went separately,” Andrei Krasnov, head of the Russky Gorizont (Russian Horizon) social movement and a personal acquaintance of Dugina’s family, told TASS.\n\nRussian officials said the explosive device was attached under the car “on the driver’s side,” and 400g of TNT was used, according to TASS.\n\nA Russian foreign ministry official implied that Ukrainian state structures were responsible for the explosion, a claim that Ukrainian authorities have denied.\n\nRussian investigators believe an explosive device was planted in the car. BAZA\n\nDugina died at the scene after the explosion, say investigators. Courtesy BAZA\n\n“If the Ukrainian trace is confirmed… then we should talk about the policy of state terrorism implemented by the Kyiv regime,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a Telegram post. “There have been plenty of facts accumulated over the years: from political calls for violence to the leadership and participation of Ukrainian state structures in crimes,” she said.\n\nUkraine on Sunday strenuously denied any involvement in the car explosion. “Ukraine definitely has nothing to do with this because we are not a criminal state, which the Russian Federation is, and even more so, we are not a terrorist state,” Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a Ukrainian TV interview.\n\n‘Flames completely engulfed it’\n\nWhen Dugina “turned onto the Mozhaiskoye highway near the village of Bolshiye Vyazemi, there was an explosion, the car caught fire immediately,” Krasnov told TASS.\n\n“The flames completely engulfed it. She lost control because she was driving at high speed and flew to the opposite side of the road,” Krasnov added, as cited by TASS.\n\nIn the meantime, forensic experts, investigators and experts in explosive engineering are inspecting the scene.\n\nMoments before her death, Dugina had attended a political festival organized by the Eurasian Youth Union. The group, which her father played a prominent role in, has recruited people with military experience to fight on behalf of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic since 2014.\n\nThe organizers of the festival have urged participants to keep video recordings taken during the event, telling Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that surveillance cameras at the venue were not working.\n\nDugina, the daughter, was born in 1992 and studied Philosophy at Moscow State University, according to TASS.\n\nIn March 2022, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Dugina for her contribution to an article on the United World International (UWI) website suggesting that Ukraine would “perish” if it is admitted to NATO. Dugina was UWI’s chief editor.\n\nShe claimed in a recent interview with the Russian news channel, 1RNK, that the atrocities that happened during the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian town of Bucha were American propaganda, chosen because of its phonological similarity to “butcher,” a word she connects with US President Joe Biden calling Putin a “butcher” on March 29.\n\nBoth Alexander Dugin and his daughter have been sanctioned by the United States. Francesca Ebel/AP\n\nCNN visited the scene of mass graves in Bucha in April after Russian forces had withdrawn, revealing the horrors of their occupation to the world. Images of bodies lying strewn on the streets of Bucha sparked international condemnation and investigations into potential Russian war crimes. Multiple eyewitnesses and footage have connected many of the atrocities to Russian soldiers.\n\nHer father was sanctioned by the United States in 2015 for being responsible for, or complicit in actions or policies that threaten peace, security, stability, or sovereignty or territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in 2017, Dugin remarked on many similarities between his ideas and those of former US president Donald Trump. He called Trump’s inauguration speech discourse “as if I would write it myself.”\n\nHe also said that Putin provided inspiration for Trump, “a kind of … example to challenge the status quo, to challenge the conventional wisdom, challenge all this totalitarian principles of globalists and ultra-liberals.”\n\nFollowing Dugina’s death, a number of Russian media personalities demanded strikes against “decision-making” centers in Ukraine, including in the capital Kyiv.\n\nMargarita Simonyan, editor in chief of the Kremlin-backed TV network RT, said on her Telegram channel that the targets in Ukraine should be, “Decision Centers! Decision Centers!! Decision Centers!!!”\n\nAnother television personality in Moscow, Tigran Keosayan, said on his Telegram channel that he was “tired of all the talking,” adding: “I don’t understand why there are still buildings on Bankova Street in Kyiv.”", "authors": ["Mohammed Tawfeeq Josh Pennington Jonny Hallam Tara John Rob Picheta", "Mohammed Tawfeeq", "Josh Pennington", "Jonny Hallam", "Tara John", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/01/business/ukraine-war-bonds-crypto-nfts/index.html", "title": "War bonds, NFTs and crypto: How Ukraine is funding its defense ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe epicenter of the latest effort to raise money for Ukraine was a bare-bones office above a bakery in north London.\n\nIsaac Kamlish, Nathan Cohen and Isaac Bentata — ages 23 to 25 — gathered around their laptops earlier this week and helped launch the first-ever sale of one-of-a-kind digital collectibles by a national government.\n\nIn 24 hours, Kyiv, using technology developed by the trio, sold more than 1,200 non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, raising about $600,000 to help fund its defense against Russia.\n\nThe auction, which made novel use of blockchain technology as a lever of wartime financing, underscores how Ukraine’s government is using both new and traditional tools to generate the cash it needs to survive the crisis.\n\nOne playbook has been old school. Kyiv has hauled in roughly $1 billion from war bonds sold to people and institutions in Ukraine, as residents show a willingness to lend to the government even if it’s not guaranteed they’ll get all their money back.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration has also encouraged would-be donors around the world to directly transfer cryptocurrencies, an effort that’s raised more than $56 million, according to analytics group Chainalysis. And the NFT sale on Wednesday saw collectors from Los Angeles to Barcelona rush to participate in what they saw as a major moment for both Ukraine and the crypto world.\n\n“The Ukraine war is devastating, and it will be in history books,” said Ben Jacobs, the co-founder of Scenius Capital, a digital asset investment firm. “This usage of crypto technology is also historical in its own right.”\n\nJacobs, who is based in Venice Beach, California, bought two NFTs, spending a total of $1,100 including small fees related to the transactions. About $1,000 in ether — the cryptocurrency typically used for NFT sales — went to Ukraine’s government.\n\nA fundraising rush\n\nIn Europe and the United States, people have been displaying their solidarity with Ukraine by hanging blue and yellow flags from buildings, hosting local fundraisers and updating their avatars on social media.\n\nBut Zelensky’s team needs more than words and gestures. To keep Ukraine’s government running and equip its military, Kyiv requires cash — and lots of it. It has estimated that the war could cost the country $565 billion. Its economic output in 2020 was $155 billion.\n\n“Our fiscal gap is much wider than we expected when we started this year,” Yuriy Butsa, Ukraine’s commissioner for public debt management, told CNN Business, referring to the gap between government revenue and spending.\n\nTo help bridge that divide, the government has launched an unprecedented effort in the five weeks since Russia’s invasion to raise money for its cause on a global scale.\n\n“These guys are being creative,” said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager who specializes in emerging market debt at the UK-based investment firm Abrdn.\n\nA man sporting a ribbon with colors of the Ukrainian flag uses a smartphone in Barcelona on Mar. 1. Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKyiv has turned to tried-and-true channels to raise money. About $4 billion in emergency financing from multilateral organizations, including the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, has already been received by Ukraine, and an additional $2 billion is being negotiated.\n\nIt’s also utilizing classic war bonds, which governments issue during a conflict to tap support from citizens. They’re also helpful in fighting inflation, since it takes cash out of circulation at a time when there are often shortages of products.\n\nUkraine raised about $1 billion through five sales of local currency bonds in March. Butsa said there was significant demand from both institutions and individuals. The proceeds go into the government’s pot and are then used to cover expenses such as paying pensions or emergency services.\n\n“There are a lot of people buying $10,000, $5,000 of this instrument,” Butsa said.\n\nPurchasing these bonds in the current climate requires a leap of faith. One-year notes issued last month had a yield of 11%, indicating the very high level of risk. If Zelensky’s government is toppled or goes into exile, or a long war devastates the Ukrainian economy, repayment would not be a sure thing.\n\nS&P Global Ratings lowered its credit rating for Ukraine shortly after the invasion. It said that while it believes the international community will help Ukraine meet its financing needs over the next 12 months, there is the “potential for governance disruptions, putting commercial debt servicing at risk.”\n\nButsa said Ukraine’s government is currently working “24/7” with its bankers to develop a new dollar bond that could be sold to foreign investors, many of which are eager to back Kyiv but are hamstrung by capital controls that prevent them from collecting returns in Ukraine’s currency, as well as other logistical issues.\n\n“Our intention is to offer [an] instrument where every person who wants to support Ukraine sitting in [the] US, having their account with the local financial institutions, can easily support us,” Butsa said. His team is also exploring options within the European Union.\n\nDespite support for Ukraine, professional investors — who have a duty to protect their clients’ money — may be nervous about lending money to Ukraine’s government right now, even if it can find a way to offer bonds abroad.\n\n“We cannot invest in an asset where we see [a] high probability of that money not being returned,” Szabo said, though he added that he thinks the market could become attractive again once the war ends.\n\nWorking the crypto angle\n\nFinancing options that don’t involve borrowing are also appealing, since Ukraine is wary of dramatically increasing its debt load.\n\n“We don’t want to end up, as the war comes to the reconstruction phase, to spend more on the debt service than we pay on rebuilding infrastructure,” Butsa said.\n\nThat’s where crypto donations and NFT sales can come in. For weeks, Ukraine has encouraged people to transfer bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on official social media accounts. The effort has given the government access to a large pool of small donors who don’t need to worry about complex financial agreements or currency conversion.\n\nAs of March 28, Kyiv had raised roughly $56 million in crypto with a median donation of about $30, Chainalysis told CNN Business. Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation, said last month that the money had been used to buy bulletproof vests, helmets, walkie-talkies and medicine.\n\nPeople stand under a giant Ukrainian flag during a vigil to protest the Russian invasion of Ukraine in front of the White House on Feb. 24. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nA sale of an NFT of Ukraine’s flag by UkraineDAO, an initiative backed by a member of the Russian activist group Pussy Riot, raised more than $6.7 million.\n\nThe effort entered a new phase this week with the official NFT auction. Supporters around the world purchased digital images made with local artists that combined colorful imagery with artifacts of the war such as tweets.\n\nKevin Lista Navarro, a 26-year-old financial adviser in Barcelona, previously donated to support refugees from Ukraine. Still, he saw the NFT auction as a unique opportunity, and bought two.\n\n“Thanks to this technology, you now have the possibility to contribute to the cause and also receive in return a commemorative work of art,” he said. “Who knows what they might be worth in the future.”\n\nKamlish, Cohen and Bentata — the team in London whose nascent platform, FAIR.xyz, was used to run the sale — got the job after cold emailing people in the Ukrainian government after the NFT project was first announced. They’ve been involved for the past two-and-a-half weeks, pulling late nights and running on adrenaline to get the launch ready.\n\n“It’s been really crazy,” Bentata said.\n\nThe process went smoothly, despite heavy traffic to the website that could have come from malicious actors, Kamlish added.\n\n“How Ukraine has really leaned into crypto as a way to garner support financially … it shows the value of governments leaning into crypto and NFT technology, as opposed to rebelling against it simply because it’s new and scary,” said Jacobs of Scenius Capital.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/politics/us-ukraine-intelligence/index.html", "title": "US officials say Biden administration is sharing intelligence with ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US has multiple channels open and is sharing intelligence with Ukraine at a “frenetic” pace, US officials said Thursday, disputing criticism that the Biden administration is not sharing battlefield intelligence fast enough.\n\nStill, the US’ secure communications with Ukrainian officials are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain as the war rages on, the sources told CNN. Officials also acknowledged that the US is now more limited in its ability to collect real-time intelligence with no one on the ground, and the apparent lack of military drones flying overhead. The CIA has not acknowledged whether it is flying its own drones to surveil the conflict.\n\nRepublican Sens. Ben Sasse and Marco Rubio, the top GOP member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have both said publicly in recent days that they are concerned intelligence isn’t getting to the Ukrainian military quickly enough. House Republicans began amplifying those concerns this week, ramping up criticism of the Biden administration for allegedly “withholding” intelligence from the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians, though, have not complained publicly about any lack of intelligence-sharing by the US.\n\nOne Senate source familiar with GOP concerns said that lawmakers were concerned both that the intelligence was being downgraded, or made less specific, and that it wasn’t being conveyed to the Ukrainians fast enough.\n\nSources familiar with the intelligence said it is indeed being downgraded, but primarily to scrub sensitive sources and methods – a particular concern given the logistical challenges with establishing fully secure lines with Ukrainian officials amid the Russian onslaught.\n\nIn most cases, two sources familiar with the sharing system said, the intelligence being shared involves information about Russian force movements and locations, as well as intercepted communications about their military plans. And it is typically being provided to Ukrainian officials as quickly as within 30 minutes to an hour of the US receiving it, one of the sources said.\n\nThe sharing has been facilitated via secure communications equipment, although all communication with forces on the ground in Kyiv is becoming increasingly difficult given ongoing power and communications disruptions in the besieged capital, another source said.\n\nA key workaround has been a portal that was set up in recent weeks where US officials can upload intelligence that the Ukrainians can then access in near real time, the first source said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that the US has shared “a significant amount of detailed timely intelligence on Russia’s plans and activities with the Ukrainian government to help Ukrainians defend themselves.”\n\n“We’ve been doing that for months,” Psaki said. “This includes information that should help them inform and develop their military response to Russia’s invasion, that’s what’s happening – or has been happening.”\n\nAnother source of concern among critics of the US’ system appears to be that the administration is not providing the kind of detailed “targeting intelligence” that has long been used in lethal “find, fix and finish” operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan.\n\nThere may be practical reasons why the US can’t provide some of the more granular “targeting intelligence” that some lawmakers are demanding. Much of the intelligence community’s “imint” – an intelligence community term that means “imagery intelligence” – comes from satellites. Two sources familiar with the intelligence said some of the “game-changing” intelligence on Russian military positions is coming from commercial imagery. But those satellites are often limited by weather in what they can see, and in any event, can’t provide the kind of live-time video that lower-flying drones are capable of.\n\nCurrent and former officials also told CNN that the United States does not maintain the kind of 24/7 drone coverage in Ukraine that became typical of American conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Although the Pentagon has not commented on surveillance efforts in eastern Europe, flight tracking websites have repeatedly shown Global Hawk reconnaissance drones flying near, but not over, Ukrainian airspace.\n\n“We are not providing the type of real-time targeting that you see our military having gotten in conflicts like in Iraq where instant to instant, we have UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles or drones), the unblinking eye as they say, watching the situation and giving that targeting data,” Rep. Adam Smith, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. “We’re not doing that because that steps over the line to making us participate in the war.”\n\nUS says it is sharing information for ‘situational awareness’\n\nThe Biden administration in recent weeks made a deliberate policy decision to describe any information being shared with Ukraine as an effort to help them gain “situational awareness” in the war, rather than explicitly to target and kill Russian soldiers, one of the sources said. The distinction is meant to avoid Russia being able to claim the US is becoming directly involved as a co-combatant in the war, which could risk direct conflict breaking out between Moscow and Washington.\n\nSasse has also alleged that “lawyers” and unspecific “technicalities” are holding up the flow of information, a charge a senior defense official told reporters on Thursday was inaccurate. There are some indications that Biden administration guidelines for sharing intelligence with Ukraine have been amended as recently as this week.\n\n“Generally speaking, I share concerns that some of that may not be getting there fast enough. And even today there has been work done to sort of assess that and make sure that any sort of unnecessary impediments are removed,” Rubio told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday.\n\nThe senior defense official told reporters Thursday that the US continues to “provide information and intelligence to Ukraine as we assess would be most helpful.”\n\nAsked whether any decisions have been made that the US won’t share certain targeting intelligence with Ukraine because it risks making the US a party to the conflict, the official declined to discuss the specifics of what is being shared.\n\n“What I can tell you is we continue to provide intelligence and information to the Ukrainians, and that’s ongoing,” the official said. “We share with them what we believe can be helpful to them. I’m not going to talk about the vehicles, I’m not going to talk about the parameters of that.”\n\nThe official noted that the US no longer has boots on the ground in Ukraine or aircraft flying over the country’s air space, saying the US ability to glean intelligence “is not as robust as it once was.”\n\n“The Ukrainians are on the ground, the Ukrainians are in the fight,” the official said. “And in many cases, in many ways they simply have more contextual information than what we can give them.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details and context.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Katie Bo Lillis", "Natasha Bertrand", "Katie Bo Lillis"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/energy/energy-prices-uk-europe-explainer/index.html", "title": "Why UK energy prices are rising much faster than in Europe | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nMillions of people in the United Kingdom are steeling themselves for colossal rises to their energy bills over the next few months, a coda to a year already marked by record price increases.\n\nThe crisis is not unique to the country. Prices have shot up across Europe since last fall, driven by a spike in demand as countries lifted pandemic lockdowns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, and the subsequent drop in Moscow’s oil and natural gas exports to Europe, have pushed prices even higher.\n\nBut UK energy prices are now higher than in comparable economies like France and Italy, analysts told CNN Business. And Brits have suffered much bigger price increases than in most European countries, including Germany, where decades of energy policy has been turned on its head by the Ukraine war.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said this week that UK natural gas prices rose nearly 96% in the year to July, while electricity prices are up 54%.\n\nAnnual consumer price inflation for gas and electricity in the United Kingdom is forecast to soar to an average of around 80% this year, compared to an average of 40% across the 19 countries that use the euro, analysis from Deutsche Bank shows.\n\nThe worst is yet to come. Average annual energy bills could exceed £4,000 ($4,820) from January, and £5,000 ($6,000) later in the spring, up from about £2,000 ($2,400) currently. Millions could be forced into poverty as a consequence. Leaders of the UK National Health Service warned Friday of a “humanitarian crisis.” Many people could fall sick this winter as they “face the awful choice between skipping meals to heat their homes and having to live in in cold, damp and very unpleasant conditions,” they said.\n\nOverall UK inflation exceeded 10% in July, compared with 8.9% in the eurozone. Unlike other problems in the UK economy, Brexit doesn’t appear to be a major factor. So why are British energy bills rising so much faster than across much of Europe?\n\nA broken market\n\nAs wholesale costs ballooned last year, 31 smaller UK energy companies — who traditionally offered competitive prices — went bust, forcing millions of customers onto the books of bigger suppliers, and to pay higher bills.\n\nThe way the British government designed the energy market made this more likely, Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group, told CNN Business. Smaller companies were acting like brokers rather than providers of an essential utility.\n\n“Many UK retail energy providers weren’t real energy producers. Instead, they bought electricity and gas in the wholesale market and then sold it on to retail customers like households,” Gloystein said.\n\nThat meant that as soon as wholesale costs increased far above what suppliers could legally charge, they went bankrupt.\n\nEurope operates in a different way. Most countries have tighter regulations on suppliers, Gloystein said, including rules designed to shield them from sudden price spikes.\n\nThe prices UK households pay are subject to a cap, but it is adjusted every six months — a period about to be cut to three — meaning bills rise more quickly in line with wholesale costs.\n\n“There’s a transitional arrangement between now and when we move to that full quarterly model that’s pushing up prices a little bit more,” Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, told CNN Business. “Suppliers are able to pass on the increases in wholesale gas prices a lot more quickly than they were in the past,” he added.\n\nLack of storage\n\nThe United Kingdom has faced a “perfect storm” of events which have bumped up energy bills, according to Raja.\n\nMost homes are supplied with natural gas, he said, whereas electricity, nuclear energy and renewable sources make up a bigger share of the energy mix across the European Union.\n\nThe country also relies on gas to generate 40% of its electricity, compared to less than one fifth for the bloc as a whole, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\n“It’s a double whammy effect and the UK’s overdependence on gas is a big reason why gas prices I think in the UK are a little bit more elevated than elsewhere,” he said.\n\nHigh voltage power lines and cooling towers at the Dampierre-en-Burly nuclear power plant, operated by Electricite de France SA (EDF), in Dampierre-en-Burly, France, on Tuesday, May 3, 2022. EDF's falling nuclear production, combined with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is exacerbating Europe's energy crisis as France is traditionally a net exporter of electricity. Anita Pouchard Serra/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWhile the United Kingdom produces about half of its gas, North Sea output last year fell to its lowest level on record due to maintenance work, according to the government’s business department.\n\nA lack of storage has exacerbated the situation. Centrica (CPYYF), a UK energy company, closed the largest gas storage facility in the country in 2017, though it is in discussions with the government to reopen the site this winter. Europe has more storage capacity, and has been rapidly filling it ahead of winter — and a feared total cut off of Russian gas.\n\nUK natural gas contracts for next year’s first quarter are nearly 7% more expensive than European benchmark contract prices, according to analysis by Auxilione. That’s because Europe has now built a buffer for the winter months.\n\nThe lack of storage forces the the United Kingdom to rely on “real-time flows” of gas from the North Sea, Norway, Belgium, as well as liquefied natural gas imports, Tony Jordan, director at Auxilione, told CNN Business.\n\n“We’re much more reliant on the here and now when it gets to winter,” he said.\n\nEurope’s gas is still eye-wateringly expensive. It was trading at €242 ($244) per megawatt hour on Friday, an all-time high, according to Auxilione. That’s much higher than the spot price for UK gas, which is trading at an equivalent of €160 ($161) per megawatt hour, but the differential is driven mostly by greater demand in Europe as it fills up its tanks for winter.\n\nGermany declared a gas crisis in June after Russia cut flows through the vital Nord Stream 1 pipeline by two-thirds, bringing the country one step closer to rationing gas to industry.\n\nMinimal government support\n\nFaced with soaring bills, governments across Europe have stepped in to help ease the financial pressure on households.\n\nBut the “elephant in the room,” said Raja, is that none of the support offered by the UK government so far has directly subsidized consumer energy prices. Earlier this year, the government announced a £150 rebate on a local tax for millions of households to help ease the pain.\n\nMore help is coming soon, but it won’t be anywhere near enough, according to anti-poverty campaigners.\n\nAn electricity transmission tower near residential houses in Upminster, UK, on Monday, July 4, 2022. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIn May, the government announced a £15 billion ($18 billion) package of support, including a £400 ($482) credit to 29 million households from October, which will be spread over six months.\n\nBy comparison, France has capped electricity price increases to 4% until the end of the year.\n\nOther countries “have had more direct intervention when it comes to energy prices, so comparatively UK gas and electricity prices are running a little bit higher,” Raja added.\n\nOn Thursday, Germany announced plans to slash a sales tax on gas to 7% from 19% until March 2024, which is designed to more than offset new levies introduced to pay for gas storage. The government has asked companies to pass the reduction onto their customers, according to a report by German broadcaster ZDF.\n\nLiz Truss, the favorite to succeed Boris Johnson as the UK’s next prime minister next month, has not said how she would provide further help to households beyond cutting taxes.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party is calling for a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to be extended to help fund a freeze on energy bills this winter.\n\n— Mark Thompson contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/business/liz-truss-energy-price-cap-europe/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss caps UK energy prices as Europe's subsidy bill hits $500 ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe United Kingdom on Thursday confirmed plans to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses, joining other European governments in a costly race to protect their economies from freezing up this winter as Russia cuts off supplies of gas.\n\nThe UK plan could cost as much as £150 billion ($172 billion), analysts said. Add that to recent similar announcements by Germany, Austria and other EU governments, and the region’s bill for drawing the sting of rising prices is already more than €500 billion ($500 billion).\n\nStarting in October, the typical UK household will pay no more than £2,500 ($2,880) for their energy for the next two years. The government will also support businesses, charities and public sector organizations with their energy costs for the next six months, and possibly longer.\n\n“Because the program does not specifically target the most needy but is rather broad-based, it will be relatively expensive,” said Salomon Fiedler, an analyst at Berenberg bank.\n\n“The support package for households may cost around £100 billion (over 4% of UK GDP). Further measures for businesses may take the total price tag to around £150 billion,” he added.\n\nBritons desperately need the support. Already, the average annual household energy bill has increased by 54% this year to £1,971 ($2,263). Without the new plan to cap prices, bills would have soared above £3,500 in October, and even higher earlier next year. Businesses were facing even greater increases and many had warned they would not survive the winter.\n\n“The price of inaction would have been far greater than the cost of this intervention,” finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng said in a statement. He is due to reveal the cost later this month.\n\nAnnouncing the measures in parliament, UK Prime Minister Liz Truss again ruled out imposing a new “windfall tax” on the bumper profits of energy companies to pay for the measures. Instead, her government will likely have to increase government borrowing to subsidize bills.\n\nThat plan could spook investors already concerned that the country’s finances are on an unsustainable path. Heavy borrowing could convince investors to dump the pound, which has already dropped to its lowest level in 37 years, further driving up prices.\n\nA $500 billion intervention\n\nBruegel, a think tank based in Brussels, said last month that the European Union and United Kingdom had already committed €280 billion ($280 billion) to protect consumers from eye-watering energy prices.\n\nThe analysis included spending commitments made between September 2021 — when global energy prices started to rise — and July this year. They include measures taken to help with other cost-of-living pressures.\n\nBut the bulk of the support has come since late February, when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, sending natural gas and oil prices soaring, Giovanni Sgaravatti, a research analyst at Bruegel told CNN Business.\n\nOn Sunday, the German government announced a €65 billion ($65 billion) package to help households and businesses meet their energy costs. Austria announced Wednesday that it would freeze electricity prices from December until June 2024. Reuters reported that the plan would cost up to €4 billion ($4 billion)\n\nAdded together, Europe and the United Kingdom have so far promised to spend more than €500 billion ($500 billion) to subsidize bills.\n\nBut governments know that more needs to be done as its energy standoff with Russia heats up.\n\nOn Friday, EU energy ministers will hold an emergency meeting. On the table will be a price cap on Russian natural gas, breaking the link between the price of gas and electricity, and a mandatory target for countries to use less power, in addition to other measures.\n\n“We must cut Russia’s revenues, which Putin uses to finance this atrocious war against Ukraine,” EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n— Mark Thompson, James Frater, Anna Chernova and Eleanor Pickston contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Lauren Kent Anna Cooban", "Lauren Kent", "Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/business/russian-oligarchs-deaths-intl/index.html", "title": "Several prominent Russian businessmen have died by apparent ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least eight prominent Russian businessmen have reportedly died by suicide or in as yet unexplained accidents since late January, with six of them associated with Russia’s two largest energy companies.\n\nFour of those six were linked to the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom or one of its subsidiaries, while the other two were associated with Lukoil, Russia’s largest privately owned oil and gas company.\n\nEarlier this year, the company took the unusual public stance of speaking out against Russia’s war in Ukraine, calling for sympathy for the victims, and for the end of the conflict.\n\nLukoil’s chairman Ravil Maganov died this week after falling out of the window of a hospital in Moscow, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nLukoil confirmed the death on Thursday in a statement published on its website.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What we know about Lukoil chairman's death 01:54 - Source: CNN\n\nMaganov “passed away following a severe illness,” Lukoil said, making no mention of a fall. “Maganov immensely contributed to the development of not only the company, but of the entire Russian oil and gas sector.”\n\n\n\nAnother top Lukoil manager, Alexander Subbotin, was found dead near Moscow in May after reportedly visiting a shaman, TASS reported. Russia’s State News Agency quoted an official as saying authorities were called to an unconscious man suffering from a heart failure.

But it’s not the only cause of the spike.\n\nNumerous factors are pushing prices up, with regular gasoline hitting a record $4.67 a gallon Wednesday according to AAA’s survey.\n\nGas prices were already expected to breach the $4 a gallon mark for the first time since 2008, with or without shots fired in Eastern Europe or economic sanctions imposed on Russia.\n\n“I think we reach $5 somewhere between this weekend and Juneteenth/Father’s Day weekend,” he said.\n\nIt was back in March that prices first broke the record of $4.11 a gallon, which had stood since 2008. That now seems like the good old days: The national average has been rising steadily for the past month, setting 27 records in the last 28 days.\n\nMore than one out of every five gas stations nationwide is now charging more than $5 a gallon for regular, and just more than half are charging $4.75.\n\nThere are 10 states, plus Washington, DC, where the average price is already at $5 or more: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Several more are within a penny of $5, so those states’ prices are likely only a day or two at most from crossing the mark.\n\nThat’s because there’s a number of reasons beside the disruption of Russian oil exports driving prices higher according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. And making predictions about where prices will go has proved difficult. Wednesday’s record is already higher than Kloza a few weeks ago expected prices would reach. As school let out and summer travel picks up, so will gasoline demand and price, he said.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said.\n\nHere’s what’s behind the record price surge:\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia is one of the largest oil exporters on the planet. In December it sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets, 5 million of them as crude oil.\n\nVery little of that went to the United States. In 2021 Europe got 60% of the oil and 20% went to China. But oil is priced on global commodity markets, so the loss of Russian oil affects prices around the globe no matter where it is used.\n\nThe concerns about disrupting global markets led Western nations to initially exempt Russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they put in place to protest the invasion.\n\nBut in March the United States announced a formal ban on all Russian energy imports. And Monday the EU announced a ban on imports of Russian oil by ship, which represented about two-thirds of the oil European nations imported from Russia. Russia’s oil is slowly and steadily being removed from global markets.\n\nChina lockdowns ending\n\nOne factor keeping oil prices somewhat in check has been the surge of Covid cases, and strict lockdown rules in much of the country. That was a major drag on demand for oil.\n\nBut as the Covid surge has started to retreat, the lockdowns are being lifted in major cities such as Shanghai. And more demand without increased supply can only drive up prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This is what determines the price of gas 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\nLess oil and gas from other sources\n\nOil prices plunged when pandemic-related stay-at-home orders around the world crushed demand in the spring of 2020, and crude briefly traded at negative prices. In response, OPEC and its allies, including Russia, agreed to slash production as a way to support prices. And even when demand returned sooner than expected, they kept production targets low.\n\nUS oil companies don’t adhere to those types of nationally mandated production targets. But they have been reluctant or unable to resume producing oil at pre-pandemic levels amid concerns that tougher environmental rules could cut future demand. Many of those stricter rules have been scaled back or failed to become law.\n\n“The Biden administration is suddenly interested in more drilling, not less,” Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, said earlier this spring. “People are more worried about high oil prices than anything else.”\n\nIt takes time to scale up production, particularly when oil companies are facing the same supply chain and hiring challenges as thousands of other US businesses.\n\n“They can’t find people, and can’t find equipment,” McNally added. “It’s not like they’re available at a premium price. They’re just not available.”\n\nOil stocks have generally lagged the broader market over the last two years, at least until the recent run-up in prices. Oil company executives would rather find ways to boost their share price than increase production.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, said earlier this spring. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks, instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nOne of the starkest examples: ExxonMobil (XOM) last month announced first quarter profits of $8.8 billion, more than triple the level of a year ago when excluding special items. It also announced a $30 billion share repurchase plan, far more than the $21 billion to $24 billion it expects to spend on all capital investment, including searching for new oil.\n\nNot only is oil production lagging behind pre-pandemic levels, US refining capacity is falling. Today, about 1 million fewer barrels of oil a day are available to be processed into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum-based products.\n\nState and federal environmental rules are prompting some refineries to switch from oil to lower carbon renewable fuels. Some companies are closing older refineries rather than investing what it would cost to retool to keep them operating, especially with massive new refineries set to open overseas in Asia, the Middle East and Africa in 2023.\n\nAnd the fact that diesel and jet fuel prices are up far more than gasoline prices shows that refiners are shifting more of their production to those products.\n\n“Economics mandate you make more jet and diesel fuel to the detriment of gasoline,” said Kloza.\n\nAnd with prices in Europe even higher than in the United States, both Canadian and US oil producers have increased exports of oil and gasoline to the continent. That has also limited the US supply.\n\nStrong demand for gas\n\nBut supply is only part of the equation for prices. Demand is the other key, and while it’s very strong right now, it’s still not back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How to save money on gas by being more fuel efficient 01:40 - Source: CNN\n\nThe US economy had record job growth in 2021, and while those gains have slowed, they remain historically strong. Demand is getting another boost as the many employees who have been working from home for much of the last two years return to the office.\n\nThe start of the summer travel season on Memorial Day weekend is likely to spark the typical annual increases in demand for gas and jet fuel. US airlines all report very strong bookings for summer travel, even with airfares climbing above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe end of the Omicron surge and the removal of many Covid restrictions is encouraging people to get out of the house for more shopping, entertainment and travel. US trips in passenger vehicles have increased 10% since the beginning of this year, according to the mobility research firm Inrix.\n\n“Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations,” said Kloza.\n\nCommuting may remain down slightly. Many who plan to return to the office will be there only three or four days a week, and the total number of jobs is still slightly below 2019 levels. But there will be periods, most likely this summer, with higher demand for gas than during comparable periods before the pandemic, Kloza predicts.\n\n“Even before Ukraine, I was expecting to break the record,” Kloza said. “Now it’s a question of how much we break the record by.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/business/renault-moskvich/index.html", "title": "Moskvich: Russia needs cars, so it's rebooting this Soviet-era brand ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter Renault announced its departure this week from the Russian auto market amid the country’s war with Ukraine, Moscow’s mayor announced its factory will be used to restart the defunct Soviet-era Moskvich car brand.\n\nLittle known outside the former Soviet Union and its satellite countries, Moskvich was founded around 1930 and operated until 1991. As with many car brands from Communist bloc countries, Moskvich struggled with quality problems. The Muskovich 408 of the 1960s, which had a 50-horsepower engine, was even cited by Soviet officials for numerous defects, according to the book “Cars for Comrades” by Lewis Siegelbaum.\n\nThe author describes it, simply, as a “terrible car.”\n\nDespite these persistent issues, the Soviet government entered into an agreement with French automaker Renault, to modernize the factory and increase output to 200,000 cars by 1975, according to the book. Production ended as the Soviet Union dissolved and Western automakers, like Renault, moved in. A portion of a former Moskvich factory reopened in 2005 as a joint venture between Renault and the city of Moscow.\n\nRenault had also owned a controlling interest in Avtovaz, parent company of the popular Russian car brand Lada. In its statement this week, Renault said that controlling interest was sold to the government of Russia, while its controlling interest in the Moscow factory, where Renault vehicles were made, was sold to the city of Moscow. Renault left open the possibility of a return to the Russian market later.\n\n“The foreign owner has decided to close the Moscow Renault factory. This is their right, however, we cannot allow the several thousand strong workforce to find themselves unemployed,” Moscow’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin, wrote in a blog post, which was translated by CNN Business. “Therefore, I have made a decision to record the plant as a city asset and resume the production of passenger cars under the historical Moskvich brand.”\n\n“In 2022, we are turning a new page in the history of Moskvich,” Sobyanin added.\n\nThe company will try to keep all the plant’s current employees working there, the mayor wrote. The factory will also try to get most of the cars’ parts from Russian firms. The factory will begin by producing conventional gasoline-powered cars but, as some point, will switch to making electric cars, according to Sobyanin’s blog post.\n\nSobyanin did not specify what vehicle models would be built under the Moskvich name at the former Renault factory in the near future, however.\n\nMoskvich traces its roots to what are considered some of the first Soviet-designed cars from the 1920s and 30s. Following World War II, the company began producing cars under the Moskvich name, which means “Muscovite,” or a native of Moscow.\n\nToday, about 200,000 Moskvich cars are still registered in Russia, according to the Autostat analytical agency.\n\nGenerally speaking, cars produced in the centrally controlled economies of the Soviet Union and its satellite nations were not known for their quality.\n\nSome cars made in Communist bloc countries, such as the East German Trabant, found cult followings in the West. The Trabant’s body was made from a material called Duroplast that resembled plastic but was made from a mixture of wood pulp, cotton fiber and resin.\n\nEven still, turnarounds are possible. Škoda, which was made in then-communist controlled Czechoslovakia, was taken over by the Volkswagen Group after the fall of the Soviet Union.

So things like sarin and mustard and VX are probably the most famous types of chemical weapons. Different chemicals work different ways, but basically the effects depend on the dose that you receive.\n\nThat’s why (Russian dissident Alexey) Navalny and (former KGB double agent Sergei) Skripal were able to survive the assassination attempts on them, because they probably only got a very small exposure to the chemical, and then they were able to get some treatment right when they became symptomatic.\n\nWhat are biological weapons?\n\nKOBLENTZ: Biological weapons are either bacteria or viruses or toxins derived from living things that infect you and cause the disease. So it’s a totally different mechanism of action. And the types of materials involved are entirely different.\n\nThe typical biological weapons that we will talk about are things like, you know, anthrax, smallpox, plague, tularemia – these are living organisms, right? They’re biological entities, they’re not inert man-made chemicals – so fundamentally very different.\n\nHow are chemical and biological weapons different?\n\nKOBLENTZ: When you get infected with a biological weapon, again, depending on the particular pattern we’re talking about, you might get a very small dose; you might inhale only a small amount of anthrax spores. But then because these are living organisms, they will, once you’ve been infected, they will start multiplying in your body.\n\nUnfortunately, we’ve learned way more than we want to about routes of infection and the epidemiology of this stuff because of Covid-19, right? But that’s how the biological weapons work differently.\n\nSome biological weapons can be contagious, right? Some can spread person to person. Chemicals do not do that.\n\nIf you’re contaminated with a chemical, it’s on your skin or it’s under clothing. You could transfer it to somebody else. But someone who has been exposed to sarin is not contagious. They can’t spread sarin by sneezing on somebody else. So there are some different fundamental properties, the way these things operate.\n\nDoes Russia admit to having chemical weapons?\n\nKOBLENTZ: First off, chemical and biological weapons are banned under international law, and Russia has signed those treaties and claims it doesn’t have chemical or biological weapons.\n\nSo, you know, for it to use either of those weapons would be to admit that it’s been violating those treaties for many decades.\n\nCould Russia use chemical weapons against Ukraine?\n\nKOBLENTZ: I wouldn’t expect Russia to use these weapons, either openly or directly on Ukrainian civilians or the military, just because:\n\na) It’s a huge escalation of the conflict.\n\nb) It would not be too hard to trace back the use to Russia, and all the diplomatic and political problems that come along with that.\n\nc) It’s not clear to me what the military value would be for this.\n\nIf the Russians are just trying to kill civilians, which is what chemical weapons are really good at, unfortunately the Russians have lots of conventional weapons that they can use very effectively for that, from the thermobaric weapons to cluster munitions to bombing apartment buildings.\n\nd) And, finally, there’s some question about if Russia had chemical and biological weapons ready to go. Could they even use them effectively, given how, you know, how poorly they performed in terms of logistics, and just supplying their forces with conventional firepower? Because you need special handling for these weapons and special training and logistics and units. And if the Russians can’t keep their soldiers fed and keep the tires inflated on their trucks, are they really going to have confidence that they’re going to conduct a very complex chemical or biological attack? That seems unlikely.\n\nHow, then, might Russia use chemical weapons?\n\nKOBLENTZ: The bigger risk for me is that basically they conduct what people call a false-flag operation, right?\n\nWhere they stage an attack that is either completely fake or they use a limited amount of a chemical agent in territory they control and then blame it on Ukraine or the United States as a way of trying to justify the invasion to date, and maybe they justify some kind of escalation.\n\nAt some point, Russia is kind of running out of their conventional military power. They might have to call in the reserves, they might have to do other things that would be very unpopular domestically, so they might need to gin up more of a justification for what they’ve done.\n\nWhat suggests Russia could use chemical weapons as part of a false-flag operation?\n\nKOBLENTZ: The US, the United Kingdom and some other European countries have said they have intelligence that Russia is planning this. So we have to take it seriously, because we think these were the same people warning that Russia was going to invade Ukraine, which they did.\n\nBut I think it’s most likely a false flag and most likely … would be very carefully staged and controlled by them so they can maximize propaganda value and minimize the risk to which they’re going to be exposed.\n\nWhat about the argument Russia has already used chemical weapons against dissidents in Russia and the UK?\n\nKOBLENTZ: Putin has a long history of poisoning people that he doesn’t like.\n\n(Note: Putin has denied this.)\n\nAlexey Navalny was the most recent example, but the Skripals in the UK clearly were another one, and those two cases were particularly notable because they involved the Novichok nerve agent, which is a chemical agent the Soviet Union developed during the Cold War.\n\nThe use of Novichok was a pretty clear fingerprint that the Kremlin was behind those two attempted murders.\n\nWhat else does the use of Novichok tell us?\n\nKOBLENTZ: We know they have these Novichok nerve agents, which are deadlier than the other kinds of chemical weapons that have been developed previously. We don’t know how much they have. And for an assassination program, you don’t need very much.\n\nBut it is a clear indicator that the Russian chemical weapons program has continued in some way, even though they claim that they destroyed all their stockpiles and (claim) their compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nHas Russia used chemical weapons on people in the past?\n\nKOBLENTZ: Novichok was developed in the 1980s, but, you know, the Soviet leadership would use poison pretty frequently since the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917. Enemies of the state keep getting poisoned in Russia.\n\nThat’s a long-standing tactic by them to poison dissident defectors, journalists and political rivals, and a long history of folks like that getting poisoned in Russia. Alexey Navalny is unfortunately only the latest in a long line of people who’ve run afoul of the Kremlin who end up getting poisoned, and it’s just this time there’s the most modern nerve agent used, not some of the older types of chemicals that would have been used in previous years.\n\nThese weapons are illegal under a treaty joined by both the US and Russia. What’s the brief history there?\n\nKOBLENTZ: So it started right after World War I, which is the first time you had chemical weapons used. These weapons caused horrific casualties during that war.\n\nAnd so as part of the effort in the mid-1920s to try and develop international laws regulating conflict and trying to prevent other wars as deadly and devastating as World War I, one of the topics we want to do was ban chemical weapons.\n\nThey didn’t get an agreement to ban a couple of weapons. What they got was the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which said countries agreed not to use chemical weapons. …\n\nOnly Japan used chemical and biological weapons in World War II. None of the other great powers did, even though they all had programs to one degree or another.\n\nAnd then, by the late ’60s, early ‘70s, there was a push to ban biological weapons. And that resulted in the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which banned development, production and acquisition of biological weapons. This was the first invoked treaty to eliminate an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. So it was kind of very groundbreaking that way.\n\nThe one big shortfall to that treaty, though, is that there’s no verification mechanism attached to it. There’s no international organization to verify that countries are actually complying with the treaty.\n\nBy the late ’80s, there was widespread use of chemical weapons by Iraq against Iran. There were concerns that Libya was building chemical weapons, and the Cold War was winding down, so all these conditions made it possible for there to be the creation of a Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993.\n\nThat was like the BWC because it said you cannot develop, produce or acquire chemical weapons, but on top of that there was an organization created, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based at The Hague, that would verify compliance with the treaty. … The US is the last country in the treaty with the clear chemical weapons that are awaiting destruction, and they’re supposed to be done in a year or two, I believe.\n\n(Note: The US is required under the treaty to destroy its remaining stockpiles of chemical weapons by September 30, 2023. Currently, it still has tons of chemical weapons, including sarin and VX, awaiting destruction in Pueblo, Colorado, and Blue Grass, Kentucky, according to the Arms Control Association.)", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Lionel Messi and Argentina now await as France seeks to win back-to-back World Cup titles.\n\n“Here we go again. It’s just an amazing feeling,” France captain Hugo Lloris said afterwards, per FIFA. “We suffered a lot, especially in the second half.

With two of the world’s best players in opposition on Sunday, it promises to be an exciting clash for the neutrals, but a nerve-wracking one for fans of the respective finalists. Lionel Scaloni’s Argentina team started their Qatar 2022 campaign with a shock 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia, but 2-0 victories over Mexico and Poland ensured that they qualified as group C winners. In the knockouts La Albiceleste beat Australia 2-1 in the round of 16, the Netherlands on penalties in the quarter-finals, and Croatia 3-0 in the semi-final. Didier Deschamps’s France won their two opening group D games – 4-1 against Australia and 2-1 against Denmark – and although they lost 1-0 to Tunisia, Les Bleus qualified as group winners. France beat Poland 3-1 in the round of 16, England 2-1 in the quarter-finals, and Morocco 2-0 in the semi-finals. Both nations are aiming for their third World Cup win. France were triumphant at Russia 2018 and on home soil in 1998, while Argentina won at Mexico 1986 and on home soil in 1978. Messi vs. Mbappé: a ‘dream final’ for Qatar Argentina’s Lionel Messi and France’s Kylian Mbappé have lit up Qatar 2022 and they will go head-to-head for a possible World Cup triple: winning the trophy, the golden boot for top goalscorer and the golden ball for the tournament’s best player. With five goals apiece, Messi leads the golden boot race having provided three assists compared to Mbappé’s two. Rivals on the international stage, the duo are club team-mates at Paris Saint-Germain and form two-thirds of the “M-N-M” attack, along with Brazil’s Neymar. As well as the team trophy and individual awards at stake on Sunday, there’s also the bragging rights for when they return to the French capital. Messi vs. Mbappé is the “dream World Cup final” for Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said Jesús Mata in Spanish newspaper Marca. PSG have been owned by Qatar Sports Investments since 2011. The final represents different scenarios for the two No.10s. Mbappé, 23, is aiming for a second World Cup winners’ medal having starred for Les Bleus in Russia four years ago. Meanwhile, Argentina captain Messi, 35, has played in five World Cups for his country, but has never won the trophy. Having already broken Argentina’s all-time World Cup goals tally with his 11th, a penalty against Croatia, he is set to add another record this weekend. Barring a late injury, Messi will make history on Sunday by appearing for a men’s record 26th time in the World Cup – in what will be his last World Cup match. Skip advert\n\nThis World Cup final “could be one for the ages”, said Phil McNulty on BBC Sport. And on the evidence of what we have seen in Qatar so far, “it is too close to call”. The result could even come down to “one moment of genius” from the two players “most likely to provide it”. Messi? Deschamps only bothered by one objective French boss Deschamps is aiming to become just the “second manager to win successive World Cups”, said the BBC. He was asked about the “will for Messi to win” his final World Cup game and whether if it had left him feeling “alone in the world”. The 54-year-old replied that he was “fine being alone” and that “doesn’t bother me”. “I don’t have any particular worries or stress about the game,” he added. “When you prepare for a game like this you need to keep your focus, remain composed, but, of course, in a World Cup final especially you have the match and the whole context behind that. Of course, the objective is to come out with the title. “I know Argentina and many people around the world, and maybe some French people as well, would hope that Lionel Messi could win the World Cup, but we’re going to do everything to achieve our objective.” 2022 Fifa World Cup match facts Who: Argentina vs. France\n\nWhen: Sunday 18 December 2022\n\nWhere: Lusail Stadium, Al Daayen, Qatar\n\nKick-off time: 3pm (all times GMT) How to watch on TV in the UK The BBC and ITV have split the coverage of the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar, but for the final they will both show Argentina vs. France on Sunday. ITV’s coverage is from 1.30pm to 6pm, while the BBC’s is from 1.50pm to 5.45pm. The final kicks off at 3pm. Predictions and odds “Do I have to? Really?”, said Joe Brennan on AS. “I will go for a draw after 120 minutes” and “endless penalties” until every player and substitute scores and the managers have to take one each. Then Scaloni “buries his” and Argentina win. “OK, maybe it doesn’t play out exactly like that, but it’s the only way my brain can compute how to separate these two football giants. I predict an Argentina... win? Wait, do I?” Skip advert Athos Salome, nicknamed the “Living Nostradamus”, correctly predicted that France will face Argentina in the World Cup final, “before a ball was kicked in Qatar”, said the Daily Star. And now the Brazilian has revealed who he reckons will win the tournament. Making his predictions based on a system called “Kabbalah” that “analyses mathematical probabilities”, unfortunately for France, Salome’s senses have told him that Argentina will emerge victorious in the finale.\n\nThis game has “just about everything” with “immense quality” all over the pitch and it could come down to “a moment of pure genius” from any of the world-class talents available to Deschamps and Scaloni, said Jack Rathborn in the Independent. For that reason “we’ll side with Messi”, a man “possessed” and surely determined to “not let this rare second chance pass him by”. He may have to wait until extra-time for his moment, but we’re “picking Messi to drag his side to victory once again”. Prediction: Argentina 2-1 France AET. There’s “enough talent” in both sides for this game – which is “devoid of a clear favourite” – to be decided by “a moment of magic”, said Grey Whitebloom on 90min.com. But there has been “plenty of evidence” this winter to suggest “a mistake may prove even more likely and pivotal”. Argentina, Messi and their “deafening travelling support” may just edge out Mbappé and Co. Prediction: Argentina 2-1 France. While Messi would appear to be “destined for the ultimate glory”, this French team “will take some beating”, said Jonathan Gorrie in the London Evening Standard. “Seemingly incapable of panicking” and boasting “obvious firepower”, they could “feasibly weather the Argentine storm” on their way to a third World Cup win. Prediction: France to win 2-1. There’s not much between these teams and “I can see it going all the way to penalties”, where Argentina will be “the slight favourite”, said Robert Kidd on Forbes. “I think it will finish 1-1 after extra time”, and Argentina, and Lionel Messi, will win the 2022 World Cup on penalties. As much as a Messi-led victory for Argentina will be “memorable”, a French victory will be “historic”, said Dan Roberts on Football Italia. It will be the “first time since 1962 that a nation has won the tournament twice in a row”. Obviously, it will “break Argentinian hearts”, but this is a France team that could be about to “go down in history”. Skip advert Right now, the latest odds are “about as close as they can be”, said Brian Good on Oddschecker. But, it looks as though France have the “early upper hand when it comes to the betting markets”. France are priced at 10/11 to lift the trophy, while Argentina are 19/20. Prices as of 15 December, according to Oddschecker. Team news Messi looked to have been holding his left hamstring during the win over Croatia, but the Argentine skipper insisted there was no problem and that he felt “really good”, “strong” and “ready to play each game”. Considering the way Messi “tore” Croatia to shreds, “potentially on one leg”, there’s almost “no chance he would be kept out of the World Cup final”, said Kyle Bonn on The Sporting News.", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2022/06/01/macron-sad-and-sorry-after-champions-league-final-chaos/50310157/", "title": "France's interior minister admits mistakes at CL final", "text": "AP\n\nPARIS (AP) — France's interior minister admitted that mistakes were made in dealing with the crowd outside the Champions League final in Paris but justified the use of tear gas, saying the move was crucial to prevent supporters getting killed.\n\nGerald Darmanin was grilled by a senate commission and asked to provide explanations for the organizational fiasco outside the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, where Real Madrid beat Liverpool 1-0 on Saturday.\n\nHe maintained that the presence of 30,000 to 40,000 supporters without tickets or with forged tickets led to the incidents that marred the event, despite being challenged by a lawmaker who said he did not bring the proof to back up those numbers.\n\nDarmanin threw his full support behind the police and security officers who were in charge of policing the event. He said that dispersing the crowd that had amassed near the stadium's fences was the only way to prevent people getting crushed.\n\n“In order to push back a crowd that was about to be crushed, the policemen and the gendarmes, probably in a hurry and under the order of their hierarchy, used dispersion means,\" Darmanin said.\n\nHowever, he said there were two instances where the use of tear gas was disproportionate — without giving details — and promised that sanctions will be taken against two individuals.\n\n“The negative impact of this game is a scar to our national pride and it is obvious that things should have been better organized,\" he said. “Did we avoid the worst? Yes. Could we have anticipated more? No doubt about it.”\n\nIn the wake of the chaos, Liverpool fans’ leadership groups complained about heavy-handed policing and poor organization on a troubling night that saw children and elderly people among those getting sprayed by tear gas.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron and government members said they were “sad and sorry” for the 2,700 Liverpool fans who had a ticket but couldn't get into the stadium.\n\n“Could we have done things better or could it have been better handled? Yes,” said French government spokesperson Olivia Grégoire said. “Can we improve things, especially in view of the future sports events? Certainly.”\n\nSaturday’s events prompted concerns in France and abroad about the country's ability to host major sporting events. France will host the Rugby World Cup next year and the 2024 Olympics.\n\nSports minister Amelie Oudéa-Castéra also attended the senate hearing and pointed out areas of improvement for the future, including a better management of crowd flows and a more systematic use of electronic ticketing.\n\nRepeated allegations of brutality have been made against French police in recent years, notably during the Yellow Vests protests against the government, amid calls for police to exercise greater restraint. French police have also struggled to get a grip on fan violence at domestic soccer matches this season.\n\nLiverpool said it has already collected more than 5,000 testimonies from supporters who traveled to France to attend the final. Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogan has reviewed some of the information and said he was “horrified by the way some men, women, children — able bodied, less able bodied — have been indiscriminately treated,\" both before and after the match.\n\nAccording to the French Football Federation (FFF), 35,000 people without tickets or with “fake” tickets made their way to the Stade de France. It said they created disorder by blocking access to the stadium and preventing fans who had real tickets from getting into the venue. Darmanin cited the exemple of a ticket that was reproduced 760 times.\n\nEuropean soccer’s governing body, UEFA, has also started to gather evidence about issues outside the Stade de France that marred one of the world’s biggest games in sports.\n\nGrégoire expressed sympathy for 2,700 Liverpool fans, “fathers, mothers with their children disgusted they couldn’t attend a sports event they were waiting for. The President of the Republic and all the government were sad and sorry for these people.”\n\nHogan also drew attention to what happened after the match.\n\n“I do think it’s important to recognize we’ve all been rightly focused on the access issues at Stade de France,” he said. “I think it’s also important we don’t lose sight of what happened after the match. I think we’ve all seen videos, photos, I’ve read a number of stories of (fans') absolutely horrific experiences leaving the stadium as well – crimes being committed, muggings taking place.”\n\nAccording to Darmanin, the violence was made possible because the police officers initially deployed in the area between the stadium and the train station had been moved closer to the stadium’s gates to help disperse fans, leaving that zone without surveillance.\n\nHe said that 29 people were arrested around the stadium, including 14 Britons, with 52 other people apprehended within 200 meters of the stadium. Darmanin added that Spanish and British citizens will be able to file legal complaints in their own countries.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nRob Harris in London and Oleg Cetinic in Paris contributed to this report.

England, who were “soundly beaten” by South Africa in the final four years ago, have had a “far from ideal” build-up, with a first defeat by Fiji last month “regarded as a new low”.\n\nMany pundits have pointed to the wide-open contest between four teams – France, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa – who are “a cut above the rest”, said Benjamin Dodman on France24.

In the blue, white and red corner you have France, the reigning champions, while in the red and green corner you have Morocco, the underdogs and first African nation to ever reach the final four of a World Cup. Didier Deschamps’s Les Bleus will go into the match as favourites, but Morocco’s superb victories over Belgium in group F, Spain in the round of 16 and Portugal in the last eight will give them huge confidence of causing another major upset against Kylian Mbappé and Co. “Marvellous” Morocco have “lit up” this World Cup, said Shamoon Hafez on BBC Sport. Roared on by many fans in Qatar, they’re not just the first African side to reach the semi-finals, but also the “first Arab one from a country with a Muslim majority”. The “history makers” are now just one win from football’s showpiece fixture. Head coach Walid Regragui has mastermind the Atlas Lions’s incredible run and he believes they are becoming a team everyone “loves” because they are showing what can be achieved. “It is not a miracle – those in Europe might say it is, but we have beaten Portugal, Spain, Belgium and drawn against Croatia without conceding,” Regragui said. “That is the result of hard work. African and Arab teams work hard but we have made our people happy and proud. The whole continent is proud. When you watch Rocky Balboa, you want to support him and we are the Rocky of this World Cup.” Lloris expects ‘hostile’ atmosphere Morocco’s run to the World Cup final four has the potential to “galvanise” football in Africa, said Veron Mosengo-Omba, general secretary of the Confederation of African Football (Caf). However, he told BBC Sport Africa that “dreaming” is not enough for the continent, and there needs to be more “long-term efforts”. Morocco have shown that “it is possible for Africa to shortly have more teams in the World Cup semi-final, and even in the final”, Mosengo-Omba added. But “galvanising and dreaming” is “not enough” to grow the game and make African football “more competitive” to win the World Cup. “It needs concrete actions and long-term efforts.” Skip advert\n\nNow one step from the final, Morocco and their fans will provide tough opposition for the holders at the Al Bayt Stadium.

Katheryn Houghton/KHN\n\nThe transaction took less than 10 minutes. It was the third hotel Piccolo had visited that hot July day in Livingston, a mountain town of roughly 8,000, where, as in much of the nation, health officials are worried about a recent rise in the use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\nIt was the first time the local health department offered door-to-door training and supplies to prevent overdose deaths. The underlying strategy was forged during the pandemic when public health officials distributed rapid tests and vaccines in high-risk settings.\n\n“We learned this from covid,” said Dr. Laurel Desnick, the county’s public health officer. “We go to people who may not have time to come to us.”\n\nDr. Laurel Desnick, public health officer for the Park City-County Health Department in Montana, prepares to deliver boxes of Narcan to local hotels. The free distribution of Narcan, the brand name of the drug naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, is one public health strategy borne out of the covid-19 pandemic. Katheryn Houghton/KHN\n\nThe pandemic laid bare the gaps and disparities in the U.S. public health system, and often resulted in blowback against local officials trying to slow the coronavirus’s spread. But one positive outcome, in part fueled by a boost in federal dollars, is that health workers have started adapting lessons they learned from their covid-19 response to other aspects of their work.\n\nFor example, in Atlanta, where the county health department planned to mail out at-home kits to test for diseases, a program modeled on the distribution of covid rapid tests. In Houston, health officials announced this month they’ll begin monitoring the city’s wastewater for monkeypox, a tactic broadly used to gauge how far and fast covid spread. And in Chicago, government agencies have tweaked covid collaborations to tag-team a rise in gun violence.\n\nSome of these adaptations should cost little and be relatively simple to incorporate into the departments’ post-pandemic work, such as using vans purchased with covid relief money for vaccine delivery and disease testing. Other tools cost more money and time, including updating covid-borne data and surveillance systems to use in other ways.\n\nSome public health workers worry that the lessons woven into their operations will fall away once the pandemic has passed.\n\n“When we have public health crises in this country, we tend to have a boom-and-bust cycle of funding,” said Adriane Casalotti, with the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nSome federal pandemic relief funding is scheduled to last for years, but other allocations have already run dry. Local health workers will be left to prioritize what to fund with what remains.\n\nMeanwhile, historically short-staffed and underfunded health departments are responding to challenges that intensified during the pandemic, including delayed mental health treatment and routine care.\n\n“You’re not just starting from where you were 2½ years ago, there’s actually a higher mountain to climb,” Casalotti said. “But places that were able to build up some of their systems can adapt them to allow for more real-time understanding of public health challenges.”\n\nIn Atlanta, the Fulton County Board of Health has offered to mail residents free, at-home tests for sexually transmitted diseases. The state has historically had some of the highest rates of reported STDs in the nation.\n\n“This program has the power to demonstrate the scalable effects of equitable access to historically underserved communities,” Joshua O’Neal, the county’s director of the sexual health programs, said in a press release announcing the kits.\n\nThe changes go beyond government. University of Texas researchers are trying out a statewide program to crowdsource data on fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses. Those working on the project are frustrated the national effort to track covid outbreaks hasn’t extended to the overdose epidemic.\n\nDr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said her team is expanding the covid data-driven approach to track and report neighborhood-level data on opioid drug overdoses. Nonprofits and city agencies that have worked together through the pandemic now meet each month to look at the numbers to shape their response.\n\nArwady said the city is trying to use the pandemic-driven boost in money and attention for programs that can last beyond the covid emergency.\n\n“Every day, we’re having these debates about, ‘How much do we continue on? How big do we go?’” Arwady said. “I feel like it’s such a moment. We’ve shown what we can do during covid, we’ve shown what we can do when we have some additional funding.”\n\nThe city also opened a new safety center modeled on its covid-response base to counter gun violence. Employees from across city departments are working together on safety issues for the first time by tracking data, connecting people in highest-risk areas to services, and supporting local efforts such as funding neighborhood block clubs and restoring safe spaces.\n\nSeparately, neighborhood-based organizations created to handle covid contact tracing and education are shifting focus to address food security, violence prevention, and diabetes education. Arwady said she hopes to continue grassroots public health efforts in areas with long-standing health disparities by using a patchwork of grants to retain 150 of the 600 people initially hired through pandemic relief dollars.\n\n“The message I’ve really been telling my team is, ‘This is our opportunity to do things that we have long wanted to do,’” Arwady said. “We built some of that up and I just, I’m gonna kick and scream before I let that all get dismantled.”\n\nBack in Montana, Desnick said not every change relies on funding.\n\nWhen flooding destroyed buildings and infrastructure in and around Yellowstone National Park in June, the Park County health department used a list of contacts gathered during the pandemic to send updates to schools, churches, and businesses.\n\nDesnick posts regular public health video updates that began with covid case counts and broadened to include information on flood levels, federal cleanup assistance, and ice cream socials for people to meet first responders.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPiccolo, the county’s health director, spent roughly an hour on that day in July going to hotels in Livingston’s core to offer opioid overdose response training and supplies. Three hotel managers took the offer, two asked her to come back later, and one scheduled an all-staff training for later that week. Piccolo plans to extend the program to restaurants and music venues.\n\nIt’s that kind of adaptation to her job that doesn’t require the continuing flow of covid aid. The state supplied the Narcan boxes. Otherwise, she said, “it’s just about taking the time to do this.”", "authors": ["Katheryn Houghton"], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/economy/brexit-uk-economy/index.html", "title": "Brexit has cracked Britain's economic foundations | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN —\n\nIt’s been two years since former Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed his Brexit trade deal and triumphantly declared that Britain would be “prosperous, dynamic and contented” after completing its exit from the European Union.\n\nThe Brexit deal would enable UK companies to “do even more business” with the European Union, according to Johnson, and would leave Britain free to strike trade deals around the world while continuing to export seamlessly to the EU market of 450 million consumers.\n\nIn reality, Brexit has hobbled the UK economy, which remains the only member of the G7 — the group of advanced economies that also includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — with an economy smaller than it was before the pandemic.\n\nYears of uncertainty over the future trading relationship with the European Union, Britain’s largest trading partner, have damaged business investment, which in the third quarter was 8% below pre-pandemic levels despite a UK-EU trade deal being in place for nearly two years.\n\nAnd the pound has taken a beating, making imports more expensive and stoking inflation while failing to boost exports, even as other parts of the world have enjoyed a post-pandemic trade boom.\n\nBrexit has erected trade barriers for UK businesses and foreign companies that used Britain as a European base. It’s weighing on imports and exports, sapping investment and contributing to labor shortages. All this has exacerbated Britain’s inflation problem, hurting workers and the business community.\n\n“The most plausible reason as to why Britain is doing comparatively worse than comparable countries is Brexit,” according to L. Alan Winters, co-director of the Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy at the University of Sussex.\n\nThe sense of gloom hanging over the UK economy is captured by striking workers, who are walking out in ever larger numbers over pay and conditions as the worst inflation in decades eats into their wages. At the same time, the government is cutting spending and hiking taxes to fill the hole in its budget.\n\nWhile Brexit isn’t the cause of Britain’s cost-of-living crisis, it has made the problem more difficult to solve.\n\n“The UK chose Brexit in a referendum, but the government then chose a particularly hard form of Brexit, which maximized the economic cost,” said Michael Saunders, a senior adviser at Oxford Economics and former Bank of England official. “Any hope for economic upside from Brexit is pretty much gone.”\n\nNHS nurses strike over pay outside St Thomas' Hospital in London on December 20, 2022. Maja Smiejkowska/Reuters\n\nBusinesses count the cost\n\nAlthough Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, its exit from the single market and customs union was finalized only on December 24, 2020, when the two sides finally agreed a free trade deal.\n\nThe Brexit deal, known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, came into effect on January 1, 2021.\n\nIt eliminated tariffs on most goods but introduced a raft of non-tariff barriers, such as border controls, customs checks, import duties and health inspections on plant and animal products.\n\nBefore Brexit, a farmer in Kent could ship a truckload of potatoes to Paris just as easily as they might send it to London. Those days are no more.\n\n“We hear stories every single day from small businesses about the nightmare of forms, transportation, couriers, things getting stuck for weeks at a time… the epic length of the problems is just gobsmacking,” said Michelle Ovens, the founder of Small Business Britain, a campaign group.\n\n“The way things have panned out in the last two years has been really bad for small businesses,” Ovens told CNN.\n\nResearchers at the London School of Economics estimate that the variety of UK products exported to the European Union declined by 30% during the first year of Brexit. They said that this was likely because small exporters had exited small EU markets.\n\nTake the example of Little Star, a UK company that makes jewelry for children. Its business took off in the Netherlands and it had plans to expand to France and Germany next. But since Brexit, only two of more than 30 of its Dutch customers are prepared to handle the costs and paperwork to obtain stock from the company.\n\nProducts that took two days to ship are now taking three weeks, while import duties and sales taxes have made it much harder to compete with European jewelers, according to Rob Walker, who co-founded the business with his wife, Vicky, in 2017. The company is now looking to the United States for growth opportunities.\n\n“Isn’t it mad that we have to look to the other side of the Atlantic to do business, because it’s so difficult to do business with people 30 miles away?” Walker said.\n\nA truck passes a Union Jack, at the Port of Dover on April 1, 2021. The UK government has delayed post-Brexit checks on EU food imports until the end of 2023. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA British Chambers of Commerce survey of more than 1,168 businesses published this month reported that 77% said Brexit has not helped them increase sales or grow their businesses. More than half said they were finding it difficult to adapt to the new rules for trading goods.\n\nSiteright Construction Supplies, a manufacturer in Dorset, told the Chamber that importing parts from the European Union to fix broken machines has become a costly and “time-consuming nightmare.”\n\n“Brexit has been the biggest-ever imposition of bureaucracy on business,” according to Siteright.\n\nNova Dog Chews, a producer of snacks for canines, said it would have lost all its EU trade had it not set up a base in the bloc. “This has cost our business a huge amount of money, which could have been invested in the UK had it not been for Brexit,” it added.\n\nA UK government spokesperson told CNN that the government’s export support service has provided exporters with “practical support” on the implementation of the Brexit deal. The deal is “the world’s largest zero tariff, zero quota free trade deal,” the spokesperson added. “It secures the UK market access across key service sectors and opens new opportunities for UK businesses across the globe.”\n\nPermanent damage to trade\n\nBritain won’t easily replace what it has lost by forfeiting unfettered access to the world’s largest trading bloc.\n\nThe only substantive new trade deals it has struck since exiting the European Union, which did not simply roll over the deals it had as an EU member, have been with Australia and New Zealand. By the government’s own estimate, these will have a negligible impact on the UK economy, increasing GDP in the long run by just 0.1% and 0.03% respectively.\n\nBy contrast, the UK Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces economic forecasts for the government, expects Brexit to reduce Britain’s output by 4% over 15 years compared to remaining in the bloc. Exports and imports are projected to be around 15% lower in the long run.\n\nInitial data has borne this out. According to the OBR, in the fourth quarter of 2021, UK goods export volumes to the European Union were 9% below 2019 levels, with imports from the European Union 18% lower. Goods exports to non-EU countries were 18% weaker than in 2019.\n\nThe United Kingdom “appears to have become a less trade-intensive economy, with trade as a share of GDP falling 12% since 2019, two and a half times more than in any other G7 country,” the OBR said in the March report.\n\nThe decline in exports to non-EU countries could be a sign that UK businesses have become less competitive as they battle higher supply chain costs following Brexit, according to Jun Du, an economics professor at Aston University in Birmingham.\n\n“The UK’s trading ability has been damaged permanently [by Brexit],” Du told CNN. “It doesn’t mean it can’t recover, but it’s been set back for a number of years.”\n\nResearch by the Centre for European Reform, a think tank, estimates that over the 18 months to June 2022, UK goods trade is 7% lower than it would have been had Britain remained in the European Union.\n\nInvestment is 11% weaker and GDP is 5.5% smaller than it would have been, costing the economy £40 billion ($48.4 billion) in tax revenues annually. That’s enough to pay for three quarters of the spending cuts and tax rises that UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced in November.\n\nA heavy economic toll\n\nThe United Kingdom is projected to have one of the worst performing economies next year among developed nations.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4%, ahead only of sanctioned Russia. GDP in Germany is forecast to be 0.3% smaller.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of just 0.3% for UK GDP next year, ahead of only Germany, Italy and Russia, which are expected to contract.\n\nBoth institutions say high inflation and rising interest rates will weigh on spending by consumers and businesses in Britain.\n\nAccording to the Confederation of British Industry, a leading business group, the fall in private sector activity picked up pace in December and has now declined for five consecutive quarters.\n\nThe downward trend “looks set to deepen” in 2023, principal economist at the CBI Martin Sartorius said in a statement.\n\n“Businesses continue to face a number of headwinds, with rising costs, labor shortages, and weakening demand contributing to a gloomy outlook for next year. ”\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2021/12/04/nft-apple-metaverse-2022-predictions/8803081002/", "title": "From NFTs to Apple and the metaverse: What 2022 holds for the tech", "text": "Peter Csathy\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJust when we thought it was safe to get back into the real world, new COVID variants emerge to brush us back – continuing to transform all aspects of our lives. While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain – a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Will the blockchain’s adoption in media accelerate in 2022?\n\nMy Magic 8-Ball says “Signs point to ‘YES’.”\n\n►What's an NFT:A guide to what they are and why someone spent $69 million for one\n\nHere are 10 predictions for the coming year in which we hope that we finally get COVID under some kind of real long-term control.\n\n1. Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple’s $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain’s poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom – opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center’s new “Crypto.com Arena” moniker is here to stay. Hey, brands out there, you better claim your \".eth\" web address now. (Here's why.)\n\n►Decoding the lingo:10 cryptocurrency terms people use every day\n\n►Crypto tithes:With fewer young parishioners carrying cash, more churches accept bitcoin as offering\n\n3. Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022’s mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself). These “unlockings” of tech conglomerates will unlock more content innovation across more competing tech platforms.\n\n►The Facebook Papers:Facebook fed posts with violence and nudity to people with low digital literacy\n\n4. Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential “lipstick on a pig”), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple’s AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable – AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse – outside of the games industry – much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n►What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n►From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We’ve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over “free to play” business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new “play to earn” model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that’s where it’s happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix – and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members – as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don’t forget Disney’s “special sauce” that Netflix can’t touch – Disney’s priceless crown jewels of content – i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions – but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty – to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth – fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably – and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today – superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n►Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market – that's you and me, the superfans – to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being “king,” private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the “big boys” in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren’t just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out “The Chosen.” If you don’t know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution – not to mention the overall “festival experience” for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it – 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/trump-policy-speech/index.html", "title": "There is no such thing as a Donald Trump policy speech | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time since January 2021, Donald Trump returned to Washington on Tuesday to deliver a speech at a summit hosted by the America First Policy Institute.\n\nCoverage in the run-up to the address focused on how it would be policy-heavy, laying out Trump’s vision for America (and, presumably, setting the stage for him to run for president again in 2024).\n\n“What I’d ask you to do is to lay out a hopeful agenda for America. Tell us how we can make chips without spending all this money. Tell us how we can be safer, you don’t have to worry about your kids as much as you do today,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said in remarks at the AFPI conference in advance of Trump’s speech. “You did it once, you can do it again.”\n\nWhich, well, let me just stop you there.\n\nThe notion being put forward by Graham, that Trump has a) given a serious policy address and b) painted a “hopeful” vision for America is simply false.\n\nGo back to Trump’s two most famous/infamous speeches: The one to kickoff his 2016 presidential campaign and the one he delivered at his 2017 inauguration.\n\nThe first is defined in the public’s mind by Trump’s insistence that “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. … They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”\n\n(In that same speech, Trump blasted his opponents for their lack of understanding about air conditioning, bragged about his crowd size and called the US as a “dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.”)\n\nHopeful!\n\nThen there was Trump’s inauguration speech, which is remembered for Trump’s evocation of “American carnage” in describing the current state of the country.\n\nUplifting!\n\nThe simple fact is that Trump’s appeal has NEVER been about policies or a hopeful vision. It’s always been totally and completely about Trump himself – and the roiling sense of grievance, nostalgia and score-settling that sits at the center of his personality.\n\nSure, there have been issues that embodied that sentiment. Trump voters rallied behind his call to build a border wall – and make Mexico pay for it – because it sounded tough and freaked out liberal elites. His foreign policy stances appealed to voters who wanted America to go back to the take-no-prisoners approach they remembered from decades ago. (That such an American foreign policy stance never existed was besides the point for these folks.)\n\nTrump’s ever-shifting views on, well, most things, was the clearest evidence that his winning campaign – and the four years he spent in the White House — weren’t about advancing some broader theory of the case. They were about Trump doing whatever felt good at the moment – and the cult of personality that grew up around his many maneuvers. (In 2017, the New Yorker wrote a great piece about conservative intellectuals who tried to put an ideological framework around Trumpism. Which, well, ha!)\n\nNow to Trump’s speech on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the country was “on the brink” and the weakest that it has been since the Civil War. (Trump cited Newt Gingrich as the authority on that second claim.) He said we have “very little” public safety. He said that there is an “invasion” of immigrants coming into the country. He said, “Our streets are riddled with needles and soaked with the blood of innocent victims.” He decried “drugged-out lunatics” and “sadists” who he insisted are taking over the country. “Our country is now a cesspool of crime,” said Trump.\n\nHis policy solution? “It has to stop and it has to stop now.”\n\nWhich, well, color me unsurprised.\n\nThe Point: The appeal of Trump to voters has never, ever been about a policy or a set of policies.

The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,” Stokes wrote. The group said it is gross negligence to ignore the quarantine guidelines and threatened possible legal action.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest city plans to boost enforcement of an expanded mask mandate and restrict gathering sizes in a bid to curb coronavirus cases, officials said Friday. The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while “exercising vigorously outdoors,” the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. “Congregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. “I know we are asking a lot of you.” Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record. Saturday’s total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state’s death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/opinions/liz-cheney-seat-loss-wierson-honan/index.html", "title": "Opinion: In Cheney's loss, Biden has an opportunity | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Arick Wierson is an Emmy Award-winning television producer and former senior media adviser to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

And they might be right. But Liz Cheney made it clear in her barn burner of a concession speech that she is not planning to ride off quietly into the sunset; rather, she plans to “do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it.”\n\nArick Wierson Tunheim\n\nNo longer chained to a party whose leaders have abandoned its core values and principles, Cheney is now poised to become the Obi-Wan Kenobi of American politics. Like Kenobi’s famous line in “Star Wars,” “If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,” uttered moments before he’s killed by Darth Vader, the same can now also be said about Cheney.\n\nBradley Honan c/o Bradley Honan\n\nBut with her rejection from Republican voters in Wyoming comes an unparalleled opportunity for President Joe Biden and the Democrats, and one they should not squander.\n\nAs a conservative with a dynastic last name who, in this hyper-partisan climate, wields uncommon and genuine respect on both sides of the aisle, Cheney would be a valuable addition to the Biden administration. The President should appoint her as a cabinet-level czar on election integrity and the preservation of democracy once her term is up in January. Creating this post would allow her to continue the work she so adroitly began as the co-chair of the January 6th Committee and empower her to fight against the violent and pseudo-autocratic undercurrents that have seeped into conservative politics and pose a real existential threat to our democracy.\n\nWe don’t agree with much, if any, of Cheney’s politics, but at this point, when our democracy is hanging on by a bare thread, principles trump policy, and we commend Cheney for sticking to her guns amid a hail of incoming fire.\n\nSadly, Cheney was one of the last Republicans standing among those who voted to impeach Trump. Regardless what anyone thinks of her political stances, Cheney has displayed courageous leadership in the face of staunch opposition and even threats to her physical safety. She has proven her mettle as an unapologetic defender of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nIn her concession speech on Tuesday, Cheney made no formal commitments about what the future may hold for her beyond her work as co-chair of the January 6th Committee, but her speech left the door wide open for any number of moves down the road.\n\nShe invoked the name of President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican who lost a US Senate bid only a few years before winning the presidency – a move that surely added to already rampant speculation that she too might seek the nation’s highest office.\n\nBut should Trump declare himself a presidential candidate for 2024, a Cheney run in a Republican primary would likely be nothing more than a constant irritant. She would likely use the megaphone that comes with a national profile to blanket the media with strong anti-Trump messaging and truth telling in the hopes of chipping away at the former President’s support among those who might be on the fence about backing him a third time.\n\nBut primarying Trump is not Cheney’s best play. Nor is running as an independent, a move that might actually serve Trump’s interests by splitting the conservative anti-Trump vote. And certainly, what the country does not need is another ex-pol turned TV pundit.\n\nCheney’s smartest move would be to join the Biden administration in a bespoke senior-level role where her mandate is clear: coordinate the fight for free and fair elections and wage all-out war against the anti-American and undemocratic forces that Trumpism has unleashed. Cheney is the ideal crusader in this fight.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nSuch a move by Biden certainly has ample precedent. Both Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama appointed notable Republicans to serve in their Cabinets. The symbolism of bringing members from an opposing party into an administration is a strong signal of bipartisanship, putting the country ahead of party. Placing a high-profile conservative like Cheney in a senior-level position would be a powerful signal to our nation’s shared, bipartisan commitment to the rule of law and the right to free and fair elections.\n\nThis is a perilous time for our democracy, and Biden should recognize that Cheney can be a national force for good by taking the helm of our nation’s fight to push back the dark, homegrown forces and ideologies that threaten our future. It’s clear that, despite her Tuesday night primary defeat, her star continues to shine brightly.\n\nBiden would be well-served to act decisively and harness her star power.", "authors": ["Arick Wierson Bradley Honan", "Arick Wierson", "Bradley Honan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}]}

Inside and outside of the SEC Centre there have been calls for climate justice for the communities on the frontlines of extreme environmental harm.\n\nOthers have also warned of the impact on stability for nations around the world.\n\nAhead of the summit, the UN’s top climate official said a failure to tackle greenhouse gas emissions could lead to migration crises and food shortages bringing conflict and chaos, reported The Observer.\n\nPatricia Espinosa said a “catastrophic” climate scenario would “provoke very serious problems” for populations across the world. “It would mean less food, so probably a crisis in food security. It would leave a lot more people vulnerable to terrible situations, terrorist groups and violent groups. It would mean a lot of sources of instability,” she said.\n\nEspinosa’s warnings, described as “unusually strong” by The Observer, point to the severity of what is at stake for human populations’ safety as temperatures rise.\n\nA 2015 research paper by American academics at Stanford and California universities found that a temperature increase of 1C results in an 11.3% rise in conflict, such as riots and civil war, between different groups. At this level of warming, a 2.4% increase is also seen in the level of interpersonal crimes, such as abuse or even murder.\n\nDespite “the lack of a single, simple causal pathway linking climate and conflict”, the researchers concluded that to ignore the “causal relationship” between the two would be “a dangerously misguided interpretation of the inevitable evidence”.\n\nHowever, multiple studies have since concluded that no single trigger can be identified as the root cause of climate conflict because the former does “not directly” result in the latter, explained the International Growth Centre’s head of communications Emilie Yam earlier this year.\n\nChanges in climate are rather “threat multipliers”, meaning sudden or severe changes in temperature or rainfall, for example, can exacerbate the vulnerability of certain communities or countries to further dangers. As a result, extreme weather events can “intensify existing conflict patterns” that threaten livelihoods, health and personal safety, in some cases leading to violent clashes over access to resources or services.", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2021/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961781/can-the-ukraine-russia-black-sea-grain-deal-be-rescued", "title": "Can the Ukraine-Russia Black Sea grain deal be rescued? | The ...", "text": "Concerns over a global food crisis are mounting as the West continues to look for safe ways to export Ukrainian grain following the ending of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\n\nLast week the Kremlin announced that it was terminating its participation in the agreement that had allowed Ukraine to export its grain by sea despite Moscow’s naval blockade.\n\nUkraine is a major producer of grain and other foodstuffs, meaning millions of people who face hunger around the world, as well as those who have been affected by the cost-of-living crisis, will potentially struggle even more.\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general António Guterres said he was “deeply disappointed” by the decision which would “strike a blow to people in need everywhere”.\n\nAlternative overland routes for Ukrainian produce to leave the country have also come under threat with the EU’s so-called “solidarity lanes” facing criticism. Poland is threatening to close its border for the second time due to concerns that the “Ukrainian products…are undercutting Polish farmers”, said Politico.\n\nWhat did the papers say?\n\nThe Kremlin’s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative on 17 July “immediately sparked concern”, said NPR, “particularly in food-insecure countries”.\n\nThe deal was originally brokered by the UN and Turkey a year ago “to combat a global food crisis worsened by Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine”, Al Jazeera explained. Both Ukraine and Russia are leading grain exporters, the news site noted.\n\nThe reason offered by Russia for its withdrawal from the deal was twofold: first, Moscow said that its demands to improve its own food and fertiliser exports had not been met, and second, that not enough Ukrainian grain had reached poor countries, as the deal had intended.\n\nThe Kenyan government denounced the move as a “stab in the back” for nations in the Horn of Africa in particular, which have been afflicted by drought this year.\n\nIn the wake of the announcement, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he would speak about the deal with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin directly, which “signalled hope that it could be revived”, The New York Times said.\n\nHowever, the day after the termination of the grain deal, Moscow launched a barrage of missiles against the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, which some analysts viewed as an indication that Russia has no intention of yielding to international pressure.", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll"], "publish_date": "2023/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/asia/pelosi-taiwan-visit-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Taiwan: What to know about Nancy Pelosi's visit | CNN", "text": "Hong Kong/Beijing/Taipei CNN —\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan Tuesday evening, marking a significant show of support for Taiwan despite China’s threats of retaliation over the visit.\n\nPelosi’s stop in Taipei is the first time that a US House speaker has visited Taiwan in 25 years. Her trip comes at a low point in US-China relations and despite warnings from the Biden administration against a stop in Taiwan.\n\nThe California Democrat is leading a congressional delegation on a tour in Asia this week, which includes stops in Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, and Japan. Although not included in her official itinerary, expectations that she was planning a visit to Taiwan have fueled US-China tensions since reports of her trip emerged last month.\n\nIn a statement after landing, Pelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said the visit “honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.”\n\nPelosi, a forthright critic of Beijing, has previously said it is important for the US to show support for Taiwan.\n\nChina has lashed out at the visit. In a statement following Pelosi’s arrival, China’s Foreign Ministry said the trip would have a “severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations.”\n\n“China will definitely take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity in response to the US Speaker’s visit,” the statement said.\n\nA spokesman for China’s Ministry of Defense said the People’s Liberation Army was “on high alert” and would launch “a series of targeted military operations to counteract the situation, resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely thwart the interference of external forces and ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist schemes.”\n\nPrior to the visit, US officials had been worried that China could respond militarily, potentially triggering the worst cross-strait crisis in decades. Last week, China’s Defense Ministry warned: “If the US insists on taking its own course, the Chinese military will never sit idly by.”\n\nThe tensions provided the backdrop for a lengthy phone call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, in which Xi warned the US not to “play with fire” on the Taiwan issue. Neither side immediately confirmed if Pelosi’s reported plans were discussed, though a US official later confirmed they were. Preparation for the call predated reports of the trip.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the high-stakes visit.\n\nWhy is Beijing angry about Pelosi’s visit?\n\nChina’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-ruled democracy of Taiwan as its own territory – despite never having governed it – and has not ruled out the use of force to “reunify” the island with the Chinese mainland.\n\nFor decades, Beijing has sought to isolate Taipei on the world stage, from chipping away at its diplomatic allies to blocking it from joining international organizations.\n\nAny move that appears to lend Taiwan a sense of international legitimacy is strongly opposed by China. And in the eyes of Beijing, high-profile overseas visits by Taiwanese officials, or visits by foreign officials to Taiwan, will do just that.\n\nIn 1995, a visit by Taiwan’s then-President Lee Teng-hui to the United States triggered a major crisis in the Taiwan Strait. Enraged by the trip, China fired missiles into waters around Taiwan, and the crisis ended only after the US sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area in a forceful show of support for Taipei.\n\nIn recent years, Taiwan has received a flurry of visits by US delegations, consisting of sitting and retired officials and lawmakers. That has drawn angry responses from China, including sending warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared air defense identification zone.\n\nBut Pelosi’s political stature makes her visit all the more provocative to Beijing.\n\n“Pelosi is the third public official in the line of succession after the President and Vice President, I think the Chinese take that very seriously,” said Susan L. Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at UC San Diego.\n\n“So she is a very important figure in American politics. It’s different from your ordinary member of Congress.”\n\nPelosi is a longstanding critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has denounced Beijing’s human rights record, and met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government.\n\nIn 1991, Pelosi unfurled a banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters. More recently, she has voiced support for the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nWhy is the trip fueling US-China tensions?\n\nBeijing sees Pelosi’s trip as a “serious violation” of historical US-China agreements governing their relations.\n\nThe US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 – but has long trod a delicate middle path. Washington recognizes the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China, but maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan.\n\nThe US also supplies Taiwan with defensive weaponry under the terms of the decades-old Taiwan Relations Act, but it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion – a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”\n\nChina’s authoritarian turn under Xi’s leadership and plummeting relations with Washington have pulled Taiwan closer into the orbit of the US. This has infuriated Beijing, which has accused Washington of “playing the Taiwan card” to contain China’s rise.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has stepped up its engagement with Taiwan, approving arms sales and sending delegations to the island.\n\nSince the Taiwan Travel Act was signed into law by then-US President Donald Trump in March 2018, US officials and lawmakers have embarked on more than 20 trips to the island, according to a CNN tally. The 2018 law encourages visits between officials of the US and Taiwan at all levels.\n\nTaiwan figured prominently in Xi and Biden’s two-hour-and-17-minute phone call, with the Chinese leader urging Washington to honor existing agreements with Beijing both “in word and in deed,” according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry. The statement added that China would “resolutely safeguard” its national sovereignty.\n\nFor his part, Biden reiterated that US policy “had not changed,” according to a White House readout of the call.\n\n“The United States strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” Biden said, according to the statement.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan 02:58 - Source: CNN\n\nHas a US House speaker ever visited Taiwan?\n\nPelosi’s trip isn’t the first time a sitting US House speaker has visited Taiwan.\n\nIn 1997, Newt Gingrich visited Taipei only days after his trip to Beijing and Shanghai. China’s Foreign Ministry criticized Gingrich after his Taiwan visit, but the response was limited to rhetoric.\n\nFormer US House Speaker Newt Gingrich meets with Taiwanese Vice President and Premier Lien Chan during a brief visit to Taiwan in April, 1997. Central News Agency/AP\n\nBut twenty-five years on, China is stronger, more powerful and confident, and its leader Xi has made it clear that Beijing will no longer tolerate any perceived slights or challenge to its interests.\n\n“China is in a position to be more assertive, to impose costs and consequences to countries that don’t take China’s interest into consideration in their policymaking or actions,” said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\n\nBut the decision not to include Taiwan on the official itinerary released by the delegation “preserves the unofficial nature of the visit,” and should be a “good outcome for Beijing and US-China relations,” Thompson added on Twitter following the release of Pelosi’s statement Sunday listing her itinerary.\n\nWhat about the timing?\n\nPelosi’s visit comes at a sensitive time for China.\n\nThe House speaker had previously planned to lead a US congressional delegation to Taiwan in April, but postponed the trip after she tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe Chinese military celebrated its founding anniversary on August 1, while Xi, the country’s most powerful leader in decades, is preparing to break conventions and seek a third term at the Communist Party’s 20th congress this fall.\n\nIn August, Chinese leaders are also expected to gather in the seaside resort of Beidaihe for their annual summer conclave, where they discuss personnel moves and policy ideas behind closed doors.\n\n“It’s a very tense time in Chinese domestic politics,” Shirk said. “(Xi) himself and many other members of the elite in China would view the Pelosi visit as a humiliation of Xi Jinping (and) his leadership. And that means that he will feel compelled to react in a way to demonstrate his strength.”\n\nWhile the politically sensitive timing could trigger a stronger response from Beijing, some experts believe it could also mean the Communist Party would want to ensure stability and prevent things from getting out of control.\n\n“Honestly, this isn’t a good time for Xi Jinping to provoke a military conflict right before the 20th party congress. It’s in Xi Jinping’s interest to manage this rationally and not instigate a crisis on top of all the other crises he has to deal with,” Thompson said, citing China’s slowing economy, deepening real estate crisis, rising unemployment, and constant struggle to curb sporadic outbreaks under its zero-Covid policy.\n\nHow has China reacted?\n\nChina’s military will start exercises around Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the self-governed island and launch a series of “targeted military operations to counteract the situation,” according to statements released by its Eastern Theater Command and Ministry of Defense Tuesday.\n\n“Starting from the evening of August 2, the Eastern Theater Command will carry out a series of joint military operations around Taiwan Island, and conduct joint air and sea exercises in the sea and air spaces of the northern, southwestern and south-eastern Taiwan Island, conduct long-range live ammunition firing in the Taiwan Strait, and organize regular-guided-fire testing in the eastern waters of Taiwan Island,” Col. Shi Yi, spokesman for the Eastern Theater Command, said.\n\n“This action is a solemn deterrent against the recent major escalation of the negative actions of the United States on the Taiwan issue, and a serious warning to ‘Taiwan independence’ forces,” the statement added.\n\nThe Eastern Theater is one of the five joint commands of the People’s Liberation Army with jurisdiction over China’s eastern coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, which sit opposite and above Taiwan.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China sends warplanes into Taiwan's air defense zone amid Pelosi's visit 02:33 - Source: CNN\n\nPrior to her arrival, national security officials quietly worked to convince Pelosi of the risks her trip to Taiwan could pose, while the Pentagon developed a security plan to use ships and aircraft to keep her safe.\n\nThe constant worry among US officials is that miscalculations or inadvertent incidents or accidents could occur if China and the US significantly increase their air and maritime operations in the region.\n\nBut US does not expect direct hostile action from Beijing during a visit by Pelosi. At least five defense officials, speaking prior to her arrival, described this as a very remote possibility and said the Pentagon wants to see the public rhetoric lowered.\n\nWhat has Taiwan said about Pelosi’s trip?\n\nPelosi was welcomed at the airport by Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, and the iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper was lit up with a welcome message for the speaker praising “US-Taiwan friendship forever.”\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen will receive Pelosi and her delegation at the Presidential Palace on the morning of August 3, according to a statement from the president’s office.\n\nPresidential Spokesperson Xavier Chang said that Speaker Pelosi had not only supported Taiwan for a long time, but also paid attention to Taiwan’s democratic development and regional peace and security.\n\nBut prior to her arrival, Taiwan had been tight-lipped about the situation. When Pelosi’s visit was first reported by the Financial Times last week, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had “received no information” about the visit.\n\nDuring a regular news briefing on Thursday, a ministry spokeswoman reiterated it had not received any definite information on whether Pelosi would be visiting the island and had “no further comment” on the matter.\n\n“Inviting members of the US Congress to visit Taiwan has long been a focus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan and our Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States,” spokeswoman Joanne Ou said.\n\nThough international media is closely watching events, the escalating tension barely made headline news in Taiwan this week. Taiwan’s media has mostly focused on upcoming local elections and Taiwanese military drills.\n\nPreviously, Taiwanese officials have publicly welcomed visits by US delegations, seeing them as a sign of support from Washington.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Selina Wang Eric Cheung Simone Mccarthy", "Nectar Gan", "Selina Wang", "Eric Cheung", "Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/958431/worlds-most-extreme-weather-events", "title": "The deadliest and most extreme weather events of 2022 | The Week ...", "text": "The past 12 months have seen stark warnings issued by climate scientists and health experts as communities across the world experienced deadly floods, soaring temperatures and intense snowfall.\n\nAt the UN’s annual climate conference, held this year in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in November, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned that the last eight years are set to be the eight hottest years on record.\n\n“The tell-tale signs and impacts of climate change are becoming more dramatic,” said the WMO at Cop27. Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases hit record levels last year and are continuing to increase, according to its Provisional State of the Global Climate in 2022 report.\n\nThe UN’s aim of ensuring that global temperatures don’t increase beyond 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was renewed at Cop27, but a pledge to cause emissions to peak within three years was removed from the agreement “to the dismay of many”, said The Guardian.\n\nWhile world leaders, delegates and negotiators met in Montreal in December for Cop15, the UN’s biodiversity conference, the UK was plunged into freezing temperatures and the US braced for storms and blizzards across central states. At the same time, flood recovery efforts continued in Australia and Pakistan, while catastrophic rainfall hit the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nTake a look back at the deadliest and most extreme weather events of 2022.\n\nStorms, southern Africa In January, Storm Ana “wrought devastation across southern Africa”, said Climate Home News. More than 80 people were killed and thousands of people were “cut off” as roads and bridges were “washed away in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi”, said the BBC. Ana “highlighted the need for investment in early warning systems and anticipatory action” in African nations, said Climate Home News.\n\nCyclone, Africa Within weeks of Storm Ana, Cyclone Batsirai then “barrelled towards” Madagascar, said Reuters. The tropical storm also hit Mauritius, bringing life “to a standstill, with public transport cancelled, shops and banks shut, and air and sea travel halted”, said Africa News. In Madagascar, the death toll reached 120 and 124,000 people had their homes damaged or destroyed. The island had already been “struggling with food shortages in the south”, said Al Jazeera, “a consequence of a severe and prolonged drought”.\n\nFloods, Pakistan It was estimated that more than 33 million people were impacted by the deadly floods that swept across Pakistan from June to September this year. “Logistically the country was hardly prepared”, said The Diplomat. When the government announced a “national emergency” in August, “it was already too late”. A UN report published in December warned that 240,000 people remain displaced as a result of the flooding, while an estimated eight million are still potentially exposed to the floodwaters. Thousands of kilometres of road were washed away. By September, a third of the country was underwater, with water-borne diseases “now making the situation even worse”, the site continued. It remains “hard to predict if Pakistan will be able to rebuild its lost infrastructure in this decade”.\n\nLightning strikes, India India experienced “a big jump in extreme weather events” this year, said the World Economic Forum (WEF). Almost 50 people in Uttar Pradesh were killed by lightning strikes during the monsoon season. The state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, called for an early warning system for thunder and lightning storms as a result. A significant number of people die each year in India due to lightning, said The Independent, “A large number of people work outdoors” and there is “poor awareness and education about the dangers” of strikes. According to government figures, lightning increased by 111 times this year and 907 people were killed by strikes in 2022.\n\nHeatwave, UK “For three months, heat was a regular curse, not an occasional blessing” in the UK, said the Financial Times. A record-breaking temperature of 40.3 degrees was recorded on 28 July, and a series of fires broke out across the country. A drought was officially declared in parts of England in August, with a hosepipe ban imposed in some areas as reservoir levels sunk. Analysis by the UK Health Security Agency published in October, found that 2,800 more people aged 65 and over died during the periods of high temperatures than would normally be expected.\n\nWildfires, Europe By mid-August this year, wildfires had burned an area equivalent to the size of Azerbaijan, according to Euronews. Portugal, Italy and Romania were among the countries affected by blazes, and “wildfire carbon emissions broke all records in France and Spain”, said The Guardian. “Fire weather” – a mix of heat, dry conditions and wind – “is not new to the Mediterranean”, said Euractiv. But rising global temperatures are “creating more intense, less controllable fires, and driving these conditions” further across the continent.\n\nHeatwave, US California experienced its most extreme heat ever in September, “an epic grilling that disabled one of Twitter’s main data centers, pushed the power grid to its limit and triggered a succession of weather and safety alerts”, said the Los Angeles Times. Temperatures “sizzled” across the state as mercury readings soared above 100F, said CNN. “Such extreme heat events are being pushed into unprecedented territory”, scientists warned.\n\nTyphoon, Japan Typhoon Nanmadol was “one of the most powerful” storms that Japan had ever seen, said The Japan Times. Local authorities ordered the four million people living on Kyushu island to evacuate their homes in September. Despite “dumping heavy rain, paralysing traffic and leaving tens of thousands of homes without power”, said The Guardian, the Japan Meteorological Agency said that damage “appeared relatively limited”.\n\nHurricane, US “One of the strongest storms ever to hit the US mainland”, according to Reuters, made landfall on 28 September. “After pummeling Cuba”, said The Washington Post, Hurricane Ian “came ashore on the western coast of Florida with an unforgiving storm surge that gutted the first floors of buildings and winds that knocked out about a quarter of Florida’s power”. It then moved up the Atlantic coast, hitting North and South Carolina. More than 100 people died in Florida as a result of the storm’s devastation, said The New York Times, more “than any hurricane in almost 90 years”.", "authors": ["Julia O Driscoll"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/middle-east/960910/the-rehabilitation-of-syrias-bashar-al-assad", "title": "The rehabilitation of Syria's Bashar al-Assad | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

According to the Washington D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the meeting “was characterised as an ‘informal grouping’ that touched on areas of common interest”.\n\nThe political union triggered alarm in China. The BBC reported that “a deeply concerned Beijing” had “sent formal protests to the four governments”.\n\nAmid “unclear objectives and mounting Chinese pressure”, said USA Today, “Australia, India and the United States hesitated to formalise the dialogue”.\n\nThe sudden resignation of Abe in September 2007 then eliminated what the CSIS described as the Quad’s “main cheerleader and architect”.\n\n… and then revived once more?\n\nThe Quad was formally resurrected in 2017, amid alarm over China’s growing regional influence.\n\n“Both the Trump and Biden administrations saw the Quad as key to a pivot towards placing more focus on the Indo-Pacific region, particularly as a counterweight to China’s assertive actions,” according to the Associated Press. The first formal Quad summit was held in 2021 and the member nations’ leaders met again virtually in March this year.\n\nThe Quad’s goal “is to keep military and political influence out of the critical water routes in the Indo-Pacific”, said India-based site News9Live, and to “maintain a worldwide order based on norms, as well as freedom of navigation and a free trading system”.\n\nThe alliance also aims to provide alternative debt financing to countries in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\n“Over the years, the Quad’s diplomacy has waxed and waned,” said the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nFollowing this week’s meeting, the four nations unveiled a maritime initiative to combat illegal fishing, and pledged to invest more than $50bn in developing infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific as part of their push to counter China’s growing influence in the region.\n\nChina has shot back by describing the group as an “Asian Nato”.

This has raised fears of “catastrophic consequences” for the UK’s bee populations for years to come.\n\nThere has been a “sharp rise” in sightings of the invasive species in the UK this year, noted The Guardian. There were only two sightings in each of the previous two years, whereas there have been 22 confirmed so far in 2023. As the vast majority have been in Kent, some experts believe the species may have established itself there.\n\n“It is a bit too early to say for sure but the situation looks ominous,” Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex, told the paper.

More than half of the bat species in the United States are in severe decline or listed as endangered. And international scientists recently announced the monarch butterfly is perilously close to extinction.\n\nWhat these three creatures have in common is that they are all pollinators. Without them, fruits, vegetables and other plants wouldn’t be pollinated, and that’s a major problem for our food supply.\n\n“One out of every three bites of food that we eat” is directly connected to a pollinator, Ron Magill, the communications director and a wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, told CNN. Around 30% of the food that ends up on our tables gets there because of things like butterflies, bees and bats.\n\nLosing those critical populations could also mean losing some of our favorite foods.\n\nApples, melons, cranberries, pumpkins, squash, broccoli and almonds are among the foods most susceptible to the pollinator decline, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Bees, in particular, are responsible for pollinating around 90 commercially produced crops, the agency reports. Even tequila is at risk.\n\n“It’s all so intricately connected, whether you’re eating the food that is directly pollinated or you’re eating something that depends on that pollinator,” Magill said. “It’s a domino effect.”\n\nIn other words, if you are eating fried chicken or pork chops, those chickens and pigs eat fruit, vegetables and other plants that depend on pollinators.\n\nA monarch butterfly. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nAnd the climate crisis has taken a toll on pollinators. While more intense and prolonged drought is the most obvious impact, a growing concern is the effect of extreme heat – particularly on butterflies.\n\n“Because butterflies are some of the most sensitive insects to changes in temperature, they are considered the ‘canary in the coal mine’ when it comes to climate change,” Magill said.\n\nWarmer temperatures cause plants to bloom sooner, which is out of sync with when the butterflies lay their eggs and metamorphose. This will mean the flowers they depend on for food will have already bloomed out, leaving little for the butterflies to feed on, which will in turn greatly impact their ability to reproduce and survive.\n\nIt snowballs into a cyclical problem where the butterflies can’t get the food they need to reproduce, nor can the plants get pollinated – causing both to suffer greatly.\n\nBees tending a honeycomb. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nAlso, for butterflies like monarchs that are known for long migrations from the Northern US to Mexico – food along their route may no longer be available at the time that the natural migration takes place.\n\nA UN report in 2019 found that a million species are at risk of extinction in the coming decades, as the climate crisis accelerates. Magill says we’re starting to see that play out in insect populations.\n\n“One million species in the next 50 years,” Magill said. “That is catastrophic.”\n\nHuman impact on natural pollinators\n\nScientists at the the International Union for Conservation of Nature last month added the monarch butterfly – one of the world’s most popular and recognizable insects – to its red list of endangered species, noting that the destruction of its habitat and rising temperatures fueled by the climate crisis are increasingly threatening the species.\n\n“Climate change has significantly impacted the migratory monarch butterfly and is a fast-growing threat; drought limits the growth of milkweed and increases the frequency of catastrophic wildfires, temperature extremes trigger earlier migrations before milkweed is available, while severe weather has killed millions of butterflies,” scientists reported.\n\nA monarch butterfly. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nHoneybees began to show an alarming decline in 2006. From April 2020 to April 2021, beekeepers in the US lost around 45% of their colonies, according to Auburn University’s College of Agriculture, which reports that the average acceptable turnover is around 20%.\n\nClimate change may be amplifying a deadly parasite in honeybee populations. Research has showed that those bee-killing parasites become more prevalent in warmer climates which means as temperatures continue to rise the parasites could flourish and become catastrophic for bees.\n\nSeveral countries and even some states in the US are already moving to help protect these crucial species. California is pushing to restrict bee-killing pesticides.\n\nMagill noted that while these declines are happening gradually, they will eventually be too great for ecosystems to overcome – like a tipping point beyond which some species will be lost forever.\n\n“You know, what is the straw that is going to break the camel’s back when it comes to the balance of the environment?” Magill said.\n\nTequila at risk\n\nBats also play an irreplaceable role in food security. The USDA points to recent studies which estimate that bats eat enough pests to save more than $1 billion per year in crop damage and pesticide costs in the United States, mostly from the corn industry alone.\n\n“Across all agricultural production, consumption of insect pests by bats results in a savings of more than $3 billion per year,” according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nBats are also vital pollinators.\n\n“You wouldn’t have tequila if you had no bats, because that’s the only thing that pollinates the agave plant that makes tequila,” Magill said.\n\nBats pollinate the agave plant, a base ingredient for tequila. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nFruit bats. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nBats are affected by the climate crisis in the same way butterflies and bees are.\n\n“Bats are also more susceptible to heat stress,” Magill said. “There have been major die-offs of bats as a result of rising temperatures that led to death from heat stroke as bats have limited cooling mechanisms.”\n\nUnlike butterflies and bees, though, bats aren’t just a vital pollinator – they are considered a major seed disperser and critical for our ecosystems, much like birds.\n\n“The seeds from the fruits that they eat germinate after going through their digestive system and then are deposited throughout their range to ‘plant’ future trees,” Magill said.\n\nHow you can help\n\nThis is a global problem which means fixes need to be on a global scale, but there are still ways individual people can help.\n\n“Plant gardens with native wildlife, the native plants that are critical to the survival of these animals,” Magill said.\n\nPlants that are native will also require less care. If you plant a cactus in Louisiana, it’s not going to do well in the humid environment. Likewise, impatiens or begonias will not do well in the desert Southwest as they require a tremendous amount of water to flourish.\n\nAn atala butterfly. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nA new online database helps users in the UK find pollinator friendly plants for their gardens, and support biodiversity. Similar lists of native, pro-pollinator plants exist for the United States.\n\n“When you plant native wildflowers, you’re planting a buffet for the wildlife that needs that to survive,” Magill says. “That’s the refueling stations for our pollinators.”\n\nMagill points to Lady Bird Johnson’s effort to beautify roadsides in the US. While her goal was nationwide, her efforts shone in Texas.\n\n“She did such a wonderful thing with wildflowers in Texas,” Magill says. “There are times you can drive through Texas, and you can see wildflowers for as far as the eyes can see, and it’s such a beautiful sight, because she understood the value of that.”\n\nWhile other states are doing that along roadways as well, individual homeowners can also do the same.\n\n“We have beautiful plant life in our native areas where we live in this country. If we could focus more on that and start rebuilding what was naturally here, we can start bringing back those natural rhythms.”\n\nYou can also work to reduce your pesticide and chemical use around your home. Good alternatives include using organic products such as compost for soil health and adding beneficial insects like ladybugs, praying mantises, or even nematodes to keep pests away.", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar Jennifer Gray", "Allison Chinchar", "Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/962339/quiz-of-the-week-2-8-september", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 2 - 8 September | The Week UK", "text": "The UK’s prison system is in the spotlight this week after a terror suspect managed a “jaw-dropping” escape from Wandsworth prison in south London.\n\nDaniel Abed Khalife, a 21-year-old former soldier, was believed to have been preparing breakfast for inmates before he made a break for it by clinging to the underside of a delivery truck as it drove out of the prison grounds.\n\nExperts have questioned why someone facing terrorism charges was awaiting trial at a category B rather than a category A jail.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOne-fifth of all reptile species face the risk of extinction, according to a comprehensive new study, with crocodiles and turtles most threatened.\n\nIt’s the first study of its kind for reptiles and involved 961 scientists in 24 countries across six continents and took 15 years to complete.\n\nSimilar global assessments for other classes of animal have revealed that 40.7% of amphibians, 25.4% of mammals and 13.6% of bird species face the threat of extinction.\n\n“Reptiles, to many people, are not charismatic, and there’s just been a lot more focus on the furry or feathery species of vertebrates for conservation. But through persistence we were able to find the funding needed to complete the study,” Bruce Young, chief zoologist and senior conservation scientist at NatureServe, a conservation nonprofit, told a news briefing. He was one of the authors of the study, which published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\n“Through work like this, we advertise the importance of these creatures. They’re part of the tree of life. Just like any other equally deserving of attention.”\n\nHabitat destruction\n\nHabitat loss driven by logging, agriculture and urbanization, and competition with invasive species is the main threat to reptiles. Other factors played a role for some species such as their use in traditional medicine. The climate crisis also poses an uncertain challenge, the study added.\n\nThreats to reptiles were most acute in forest environments, according to the study.\n\nCrocodiles and turtles were among the most at-risk species and in need of focused conservation efforts, with respectively around 57.9% and 50% of those assessed being under threat, the study found.\n\nThe authors said that the lack of data on reptiles and their habitats had restricted conservation efforts, although they noted that many of the measures put in place to protect mammals, birds and amphibians would protect reptiles, too.\n\nThe researchers applied the criteria of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species to 10,196 species of reptile. The team found that at least 1,829 of species were threatened with extinction (categorized as being vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered in the IUCN criteria), but estimate that 21% of the species overall are threatened, when species lacking detailed data are included in the analysis.\n\nWidespread and high-profile species such as the king cobra were under threat, the survey revealed.\n\n“It was suspected that it might be in decline, but without the global reptile assessment we wouldn’t have known it’s actually vulnerable,” said coauthor Neil Cox, manager of the Biodiversity Assessment Unit, a joint initiative of IUCN and Conservation International in Washington, DC.\n\nDelegations from the world’s governments are expected to meet in Kunming, China, later this year to agree on a new biodiversity action plan.\n\nHowever, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 15) has been delayed several times, and China has yet to set a date.

How can a community learn and be better?” Joseph said to CNN Monday.\n\nOn October 22, Bobbi was walking through her Caldwell, New Jersey, neighborhood, spraying a homemade mixture to kill lanternflies. The 4th-grader had first learned about the spotted lanternfly last summer. Once she found out the invasive species damages trees by feeding on the sap found in leaves and tree trunks, she wanted to stop the infestation. On this fall morning, she was excited to see if the mixture whose recipe she found on Tik Tok would work.\n\n“That’s her thing,” Joseph told CNN. “She’s going to kill the lanternflies, especially if they’re on a tree. That’s what she’s going to do.”\n\nSo, when her neighbor’s call led to police stopping and questioning the child, Joseph said she was very confused and upset. In the call, Gordon Lawshe told the dispatcher, “There’s a little Black woman walking, spraying stuff on the sidewalks and trees on Elizabeth and Florence. I don’t know what the hell she’s doing. Scares me, though.”\n\nWhen asked for a description, Lawshe told the dispatcher that she was a “real tiny woman” and wearing a “hood.”\n\nBobbi was invited to tour Yale last week. Courtesy Dr. Ijeoma Opara\n\nAccording to Joseph, Lawshe initially told her that he thought Bobbi was either a “lost little girl” or a “little old lady with dementia.” He immediately apologized, but Joseph couldn’t understand why he’d call the police instead of figuring out himself who the girl was, especially since their families knew each other and have been friendly for years.\n\nLawshe’s attorney, Gregory Mascera, told CNN in an emailed statement that, “He (Lawshe) did not want to become involved in a confrontation, so he called the Caldwell police to look into the matter. Mr. Lawshe did not call 911 but called the police non-emergency dispatch line. Mr. Lawshe had no reason to believe that he would be putting anyone in harm’s way by calling the police.”\n\nAccording to Mascera, Lawshe attempted to again apologize to Joseph and her daughter the following morning.\n\n“Mr. Lawshe told Mrs. Joseph that had he known that it was her daughter that he had seen, he certainly would not have called the police. Mrs. Joseph did not accept Mr. Lawshe’s apology.”\n\nThe ‘adultification’ of Black girls\n\nJoseph points out that, in a country perpetually plagued with police killing unarmed Black and brown children, Lawshe should understand that he put her daughter in harm’s way. They’ve been next-door-neighbors for nearly eight years, so she can’t understand not only how he didn’t recognize Bobbi but also why he’d see a 9-year-old girl as an adult woman.\n\nThis incident underscores the “adultification bias” that young Black girls like Bobbi face in American society, Rebecca Epstein, the executive director of the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality, told CNN.\n\nIn 2017, the center released “Girlhood Interrupted: The Erasure of Black Girls’ Childhood,” a quantitative analysis showing that adults perceive Black girls as less innocent and less worthy of protection than White girls and explaining how this bias subsequently makes Black girls targets of harsh treatment by police.\n\n“It’s a very pervasive form of bias that does not know boundaries, in terms of which fields it occurs in. In emergency rooms, we’re seeing it affect the treatment and diagnosis of Black girls. In schools, we’re seeing it come up in the form of harsher and more frequent discipline against Black girls,” Epstein said in an interview with CNN.\n\nWhile Epstein noted the police handled the situation with Bobbi extremely well, she also pointed to times where they didn’t – like last year when a Rochester police officer handcuffed a 9-year-old Black girl, put her in the back of a police car, and remarked “you’re acting like a child” before pepper-spraying her as she cried out for her father.\n\nThere are “statistics that unequivocally show that Black people of whatever age and whatever gender are treated more harshly and violently than white people. And if that’s not known, it should be,” Epstein added.\n\nJoseph said Bobbi has not been the same since that day. She’s confused and still trying to process everything, much like the rest of the family.\n\n“I’m her mom. I’m doing my job to shield her from as much as I can.” But with the continued support comes the constant reminder of her experience being stopped by police.\n\nAfter the officer realized Bobbi was a child, he waited with her until Joseph came walking down the sidewalk to see what was happening.\n\n“Am I in trouble?” Joseph recalls Bobbi asking once she arrived. Joseph pulled her daughter close while both she and the officer reassured her that nothing was wrong.\n\n“When she asked that, I knew that while she was holding it in, she was scared,” Joseph said. “I immediately went into mommy mode.”\n\nA community rallies behind Bobbi\n\nJohn Kelly, the mayor of Caldwell, told CNN he was “horrified” by the incident. He said he immediately apologized to Joseph once he heard about the call and assured her that she and Bobbi had his support.\n\nKelly said he’s not prepared to label the incident racist, but that he’d be naïve to believe racism does not exist – in Caldwell and nationwide.\n\n“The fact that this was a Black family in a predominately White neighborhood certainly introduced race to the equation,” he said.\n\nCalling the police on a 9-year-old girl, regardless of the race of the individuals, is very troubling, Kelly said.\n\nOnce the responding officer exited the vehicle, he quickly realized that Bobbi was a preadolescent girl and saw she was only catching lanternflies. This immediately de-escalated the situation, according to Kelly, who was thankful for the police’s handling of the situation.\n\nLater, the West Caldwell Police Department invited Joseph and her daughters to tour the station and assured the family that there’s no reason to be afraid of them.\n\nJoseph says she she’s received a lot of support, and some friends in the area have even set up a GoFundMe to “support Monique, Bobbi and Hayden.”\n\nOlder sister Hayden, 13, spoke at a city council meeting on Nov. 1 to discuss the racist implications and the emotional impact of Lawshe carelessly calling the police on her 9-year-old sister.\n\n“She was not only doing something amazing for our environment, she was doing something that made her feel like a hero,” Hayden said in her speech to the city council, Bobbi standing right beside her.\n\n“What Mr. Gordon Lawshe did to my sister was extremely offensive, traumatic, and scarring towards my family. I can confidently assure you guys that she will never forget this,” she added.\n\nThe Caldwell Environmental Commission voted unanimously to award Bobbi one of their annual Sustainability Awards – given to those who have helped to better the town’s environment – once they heard about Bobbi’s mission to save the neighborhood trees from lanternflies. They plan to formally grant her the award during the December 6 city council meeting.\n\n“Bobbi Wilson is a recipient of this award this year as she has tried very hard to eradicate lantern flies from the trees on her street. We are very proud of her efforts and are happy to give her this certificate to recognize her efforts,” they said in an emailed statement to CNN.\n\nAfter clips of the council meeting went viral on social media, the family began receiving national support from people like science writer Jason Bittel and Ijeoma Opara, an assistant professor at Yale.\n\nBobbi -- with her sister, left, and mom, right -- looks at butterflies during a tour at Yale. Courtesy Dr. Ijeoma Opara\n\nBittel is a freelance writer whose articles on scientific studies and human-animal conflicts have been published in The New York Times and The Washington Post. Last month National Geographic published a story he wrote on spotted lanternflies. He told CNN he was outraged about Bobbi’s story and wanted to send her free copies of the science-related children’s books that he’s written.\n\n“This, to me, was the worst possible affront to that little bit of wonder that she was experiencing,” Bittel said.\n\nBittel also organized a Twitter campaign seeking donations to Bobbi of science books, animal stickers, and other biology-related swag.\n\n“People just want to make sure that this little budding naturalist, scientist, chemist … that she doesn’t lose her spark,” Bittel said.\n\nJoseph told CNN that Bobbi reads every single night, so she’s “really excited” about receiving the books from Bittel and his associates. Opara is an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, and she runs the “Black Girls Go to Yale” program. She invited Bobbi and her family to Yale University and gave them a tour of the institution on November 15.\n\nDuring the tour, to the surprise of even Opara, Yale Entomology announced they’ll ensure Bobbi’s name is always attributed to the lantern flies or any other specimens she contributes, according to the Entomology Collections Manager of the Yale Peabody Museum.\n\n“It’s beautiful to be able to replace that memory of somebody calling the cops on her for doing something that she was excited about to now people clapping, awarding her,” Opara said.\n\n“They don’t want her to lose her fire and her passion for doing this work.”", "authors": ["Jalen Brown Meron Moges-Gerbi", "Jalen Brown", "Meron Moges-Gerbi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/05/29/raccoon-dogs-hissing-screaming-terrorizing-english-village/1279994001/", "title": "Raccoon dogs, 'hissing and screaming,' are terrorizing English village", "text": "Authorities are warning residents of a small village in England to be on the lookout for a pair of raccoon dogs that are on the loose.\n\nThe Nottinghamshire Police warned those living in Clarborough that the animals went missing from their enclosure around 6 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n“The animals, which are described as being the same size of a medium- to small-sized dog, are potentially dangerous if approached as they are not domesticated,” police said in a statement.\n\nAlso referred to as a “tanuki”, the raccoon dog is part of the Canidae family, which includes dogs and wolves.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you have always suspected that you might just be a mosquito magnet, scientists now have evidence for you: Mosquitoes indeed are attracted to certain humans more than others, according to a new study.\n\nA research team led by Leslie Vosshall, a professor at Rockefeller University and head of its laboratory of neurogenetics and behavior, sought to identify why certain people seem to draw more mosquitoes than others. The research findings were published in the journal Cell on October 18.\n\nOver the course of three years, researchers asked a group of 64 volunteers to wear nylon stockings on their arms for six hours a day over multiple days. Maria Elena De Obaldia, the study’s first author and former postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University, constructed a “two-choice olfactometer assay” – an acrylic glass chamber in which researchers put two of the stockings. The study team then released yellow fever mosquitoes, scientifically called Aedes aegypti, into the chamber and observed which stocking drew more insects.\n\nThis test allowed researchers to separate study participants into “mosquito magnets,” whose stockings drew lots of mosquitoes, and “low attractors,” who didn’t seem as enticing to the insects. The scientists scrutinized the skin of the mosquito magnets and found 50 molecular compounds that were higher in these participants than the others.\n\n“We had no preconceived notions about what we would find,” Vosshall, who is also chief scientific officer of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, told CNN. But one difference was particularly distinctive: The mosquito magnets had much higher rates of carboxylic acid on their skin than the low attractors.\n\nCarboxylic acids are found in sebum, the oily substance that creates a barrier and helps keep our skin moisturized.\n\nThe carboxylic acids are large molecules, Vosshall explained. They’re “not that smelly by themselves,” she said. But beneficial bacteria on the skin “chew on these acids, that produces the characteristic smell of humans” – which may be what attracts mosquitoes, according to Vosshall.\n\nOdor from skin secretions play a role\n\nOne participant, identified only as Subject 33, was the belle of the ball for mosquitoes: The subject’s stockings were 100 times more attractive to mosquitoes than the least attractive participants.\n\nAnd humans’ attraction level seemed to stay pretty constant over time for participants who were monitored over the three-year period, Vosshall said.\n\nSubject 33, for instance, “never took a day off from being the most attractive human,” which might be “bad news for mosquito magnets.”\n\nWhen it comes to Aedes aegypti, female mosquitoes prefer to use human blood to fuel their egg production, giving urgency to their quest to find humans to prey on. And these mini predators use a variety of mechanisms to identify and choose the humans they bite, Vosshall said.\n\nCarboxylic acids are just one piece of the puzzle in explaining how the pesky insects might choose their targets. Body heat and the carbon dioxide we release when we breathe also attract mosquitoes to humans.\n\nScientists still don’t know why carboxylic acids seem to attract mosquitoes so strongly, Vosshall said. But the next step might be to explore the effects of reducing carboxylic acids on the skin.\n\n“You can’t strip natural moisturizers off the skin completely, that would be bad for your skin health,” she said. However, Vosshall said dermatological products might be able to minimize carboxylic acid levels and reduce mosquito bites.\n\n“Every bite of these mosquitoes puts people into public health danger,” she said. “Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are vectors for dengue, yellow fever, and Zika. Those people who are magnets are gonna be much more likely to be infected with viruses.”\n\nMosquitoes evolved to hunt by scent\n\nMatthew DeGennaro, an associate professor at Florida International University who specializes in the neurogenetics of mosquitoes, told CNN that the results of the study help answer long-standing questions about what specific factors make mosquitoes love some humans more than others. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“This study clearly shows that these acids are important,” he said. “Now, how the mosquitoes perceive these carboxylic acids is interesting because these particular chemicals are really heavy, so they’re hard to smell at a distance.\n\n“It could be that these chemicals are being altered by, let’s say the skin microbiome, and it causes a certain kind of odor plume. Or it could be that other factors in the environment break down these chemicals a little bit, so they’re easier for mosquitoes to detect.”\n\nThe results are also “a really great example of how well insects can smell,” DeGennaro, added. “This insect has evolved to hunt us.”\n\nFor DeGennaro, the staying power of certain humans’ attractiveness is one of the most interesting aspects of the research.\n\n“We did not know that there were very stable preferences of mosquitoes for certain people,” he said. “It could suggest that the skin microbiome is important, although they did not address that.”\n\nFurther research should explore the microbiome that lives on human skin to understand why mosquitoes are attracted to certain compounds over others, he said. And that could lead to better products to reduce mosquito bites and the spread of disease.\n\n“I think if we understand why mosquitoes find a host, we can design new repellents that will block the mosquitoes from sensing those chemicals,” DeGennaro said. “And this could be used to improve our current repellents.”", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/environment/2023/02/22/jesus-lizard-florida-what-to-know-brown-basilisks/69902695007/", "title": "'Jesus lizard' in Florida: What to know about brown basilisks", "text": "Is it a ghost, this tiny, terrifying cold-blooded figure that approaches, miraculously scampering the surface of Florida's lakes and rivers?\n\nTake courage, Florida! Just as Saint Peter's terror that the messiah who walked on water was an apparition, so too must Floridans' fear turn to faith then action when confronted with the dreaded brown basilisk, a.k.a. \"Jesus lizard,\" as it, too, unbelievably walks on water. And possibly in a pond near you.\n\nUnlike Jesus, though, brown basilisk lizards — native to Central America — are ferocious predators. And scientists are worried about the lizard's spread into Florida and what that might mean for native species.\n\nBrevard borders on what scientists call the \"invasion front,\" the northern line of where the non-native Jesus lizards continue to take their leaps of faith north.\n\nFlorida's other lizard issues:How to handle frozen iguanas when temperatures drop near freezing\n\nPython problems:'Snake-pocalypse?'

Instead he caught something amazing\n\n\"It’s almost like an army,” said Ken Gioeli, UF's extension agent for St. Lucie County. “The army of basilisks are moving forward. And the population is just going to expand.”\n\nThat's why researchers are asking Floridians to help track the spread of water-walking reptiles across the Sunshine State. Here is the lowdown on the lizard:\n\nAre brown basilisks invasive to Florida?\n\nBrown basilisk lizards are native to lowland habitats in coastal regions of central México south through Panama in Central America.\n\nThe lizard was first observed in Florida in 1963, thought to have been dumped in the wild as pet lizards often are in Florida. The basilisk had reached as far north as Sebastian Inlet by 2008. Now it's thought to be as far north as Gainesville, according to a map of non-native species maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nHow big is a brown basilisk?\n\nIt can grow to three feet long.\n\nWhy is it called a Jesus lizard?\n\nIt's one of the only critters that can walk on water. But that can be explained by physics, not divine intervention.\n\nWhy can the Jesus lizard walk on water?\n\nThe basilisk stands on its hind legs and high tails it, briskly skimming the water's surface — thus the nickname, \"Jesus lizard.\"\n\nBasilisks can run in excess of 15 mph, and they use their rear legs and feet to “slap” and “stroke” the water, according to UF/IFAS. \"The initial “slap” creates an upward force as the foot is plunged vertically into the water,\" IFAS says. \"During the “stroke” the lizard is propelled forward as the foot is quickly swept back in the water.\"\n\nIs the brown basilisk bad for Florida?\n\nBiologists don't know yet.\n\nThey are urgently asking residents to report any basilisk sightings using an App called IveGot1. They hope to tap the data the public puts into that app to detect early where the reptile is spreading in Florida, in case its presence is harmful to humans and/or native fish and wildlife.\n\nWhile not native to the state, it's unknown what the basilisk lizard's ecological and economic impacts are, but some research suggests they might increase spread of mosquito-borne illnesses.\n\nCan Jesus lizards harm humans or pets?\n\nBrown basilisks do not pose a direct threat to pets or people, UF says. The bite of a large brown basilisk is potentially painful, but unless the lizard is handled there is no threat. The lizard avoids people and is very fast moving when spooked.\n\nBut it is among several species of introduced lizards identified as the source of blood meals for the mosquito Culex nigripalpus in Florida, a known vector for West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus, both of which infect mammals and can be deadly to humans.\n\nAre their other bad lizards in Florida?\n\nYes. More non-native reptile species have been introduced into Florida than any other region on Earth, according to the University Florida. The state has three times as many species of established, nonnative lizards as it does native species.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/world/insect-collapse-climate-change-scn/index.html", "title": "Parts of the world are heading toward an insect apocalypse, study ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nExtreme land use combined with warming temperatures are pushing insect ecosystems toward collapse in some parts of the world, scientists reported Wednesday.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature, identified for the first time a clear and alarming link between the climate crisis and high-intensity agriculture and showed that, in places where those impacts are particularly high, insect abundance has already dropped by nearly 50%, while the number of species has been slashed by 27%.\n\nThese findings raise huge concerns, according to Charlotte Outhwaite, the lead author on the study and researcher at the University College London, given the important role of insects in local ecosystems, pollination and food production, and noted that losing insects could threaten human health and food security.\n\n“Three quarters of our crops depend on insect pollinators,” Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex in the UK, previously told CNN. “Crops will begin to fail. We won’t have things like strawberries.\n\n“We can’t feed 7.5 billion people without insects.”\n\nOuthwaite said their findings “may only represent the tip of the iceberg,” because of the limited amount of evidence in some regions.\n\n“But I think there are also a lot of consequences that we probably don’t really know because obviously there are so many different kinds of insects,” Outhwaite told CNN. “They do so many important things. We just don’t have a strong handle on how much we rely on them for certain situations.”\n\nDragonflies were among the insects that researchers studied. Seung-il Ryu/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nTom Oliver, a professor of applied ecology at the University of Reading, said in a statement that scientists don’t yet know when insect populations could reach a point of no return, where their losses would be too great to overcome.\n\n“In terms of a potential tipping point where the loss of insects causes whole ecosystems to collapse, the honest answer is we just don’t know when the point of no return is,” said Oliver, who was not involved in the study. “We know that you can’t just keep losing species without, ultimately, causing a catastrophic outcome.”\n\nHe likened the gradual loss to removing rivets from an airplane, which you can’t keep doing “without it eventually falling out of the sky.”\n\nThe researchers defined high-intensity agriculture as the kind characterized by the use of chemical pesticides or fertilizers, low crop diversity, large field size or high livestock density, among other things — all of which are relatively common features of modern-day farming.\n\nAnd, scientists say, extreme land use has a compound effect with the climate crisis. Razing natural habitats for agriculture can dramatically alter the area’s local climate and trigger temperature extremes. Researchers found substantial declines in insect populations in areas of the world that are much warmer, particularly in the tropics, where Outhwaite noted finding alarming reductions in insect biodiversity.\n\nButterflies and bees gather honey. Costfoto/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nResearchers analyzed data from a 20-year period for more than 6,000 locations and studied nearly 18,000 insect species, including butterflies, moths, dragonflies, grasshoppers and bees.\n\nThey concluded that in areas with low-intensity agriculture, less climate warming, and a nearby natural habitat, insects only declined by 7%, compared to the 63% decrease in areas with less natural habitat cover. Many insects rely on plants for shade during sweltering days — the loss of nearby natural habitats could leave them more exposed and vulnerable to warming temperatures. And as climate change advances, scientists say these natural buffers may become less effective.\n\nOuthwaite told CNN there are things we can do at an individual level to help stave off this crisis – planting more native species and wildflowers, reducing pesticides used in gardens and even limiting the frequency of lawn mowing.\n\n“And then, thinking a little bit more broadly about perhaps protecting insects in other areas, it’s probably a good idea to think about where the foods that we are buying are being sourced from,” Outwaite said. “So if they’re being sourced from tropical countries, there’s probably going to be a high impact on biodiversity there.”\n\nShe also noted that governments have a large role to play in recognizing the impact of trade and food production, and could try to not source food “from areas which are implementing deforestation.”\n\n“I think people are becoming more aware now that biodiversity and insects in particular are at risk, but we haven’t quite got them into the thoughts and thought processes” that would result in protective action, Outhewaite said.\n\nA recent UN report on adapting to the climate crisis underscored how the world’s ecosystems are very much connected to human systems. And unless the planet slashes heat-trapping emissions, those systems will continue to see major losses in biodiversity — particularly insects.\n\n“Whether these remaining insects can continue to support ecosystem functioning, or whether they will eventually be lost themselves is still an open question,” Oliver said. “Under the precautionary principle, however, it would be best to act now so we don’t ever find out about ecosystem collapse by experiencing it.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/03/08/genetically-modified-mosquitoes-florida-california/9424548002/", "title": "Genetically modified mosquitoes in Florida, California get OK from ...", "text": "The EPA has approved the release of more than 2 billion genetically altered male mosquitoes in Florida and California following a pilot program last year in the Florida Keys.\n\nOxitec, the biotechnology company that developed the mosquitoes, says the project’s goal is to reduce the transmission of harmful diseases -- such as dengue, Zika and yellow fever.\n\nSome environmental advocacy groups are concerned about the potential impacts of the genetically altered insects: “Once you release these mosquitoes into the environment, you cannot recall them.”\n\nMillions of genetically altered mosquitoes that seek to ward off their natural, disease-causing counterparts may soon be released in Florida and California after the Environmental Protection Agency approved a plan to further test the modified insects.\n\nDeveloped by the biotechnology company Oxitec, the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are genetically modified so that males, which do not bite, are released into the wild and mate with females, which do bite. Their offspring are either male or females that never survive to reach maturity, the company says.\n\nMillions of the mosquitoes were released in the Florida Keys in a pilot project last year, and the EPA has authorized the extension of the project in Florida as well as the expansion into four counties in California, pending approval from the states' regulators.\n\nMeredith Fensom, head of global public affairs at Oxitec, said that while the EPA approval covers one Florida county and four in California and the release of more than 2 billion genetically altered male mosquitoes across the states, the launch is planned to be much more limited – covering only the Florida Keys and expanding to Visalia in Tulare County, California.\n\n'OUTSIDE OF THE BOX' THINKING:The first genetically modified mosquitoes released in the U.S. to buzz in the Florida Keys\n\nOxitec says the goal is to reduce the transmission of harmful diseases, such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya. Though the Aedes aegypti, an invasive species, make up a small fraction of the total mosquito population in Florida, they account for a large number of the cases of human diseases, Fensom said.\n\nIn Florida, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are well known, she added, and the state has seen dengue outbreaks as recently as 2020. In California, the species is growing, but there have not been confirmed cases of dengue, chikungunya, Zika or yellow fever spread through the insect, according to state health officials.\n\nPart of the goal with the new EPA approval is to study the genetically altered mosquitoes in two different environments, Fensom said.\n\nThe mosquitoes Oxitec produces are males with a \"self-limiting gene,\" she said. The difference isn't visible to the naked eye, but the modified insects produce similar male offspring and female offspring that cannot survive, Fensom said. In theory over time, as the female population declines, so will the overall population, according to Oxitec.\n\nThe program has drawn pushback from some environmental advocacy groups that are concerned about the possible consequences of releasing genetically altered insects.\n\n\"This is a destructive move that is dangerous for public health,\" said Dana Perls, food and technology program manager with Friends of the Earth.\n\nPerls said one of her major concerns with the expansion of the Florida project is the lack of widespread, peer-reviewed scientific data from the past year. Fensom said peer-reviewed data is expected to be released, but Perls said she was worried about the potential risk without a more rigorous and public review.\n\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nTHESE MOSQUITOES 'PREFER TO BITE PEOPLE':Meet the invasive insect ravaging the West Coast\n\nThe lack of confirmed transmission of diseases from Aedes aegypti in California was also of concern to Perls: \"There's no immediate problem, and there are a lot of unknowns,\" she said.\n\nPerls said that without the data, it's unclear whether the mosquitoes and the offspring they create will function how Oxitec says they will. A concern would be whether a hybrid species could be produced and difficult to eradicate or whether other species of mosquitoes will simply fill the ecological hole the Aedes aegypti may leave, she said.\n\nFensom, however, said the company produces the mosquitoes with the environment in mind. The insects are designed so that over time, the mosquito population dies out and is no longer circulating in the environment, she said, unlike pesticides that can persist for decades.\n\nBut for Perls, a new framework to regulate living, genetically altered organisms is needed before approving more widespread testing of such insects.\n\n\"Once you release these mosquitoes into the environment, you cannot recall them,\" she said. \"This could, in fact, create problems that we don't have already.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}]}

The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n“We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military’s commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, “SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.”\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX’s own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk’s Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: “F*** off.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk’s claimed peace plan for Russia’s Ukraine war by saying: “F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.”\n\n“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN’s reporting and Melnyk’s comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. “That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,” said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.”\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a “catastrophic” loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn’t dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX’s suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk’s allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he “still very much support[s] Ukraine” but fears “massive escalation.”\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn’t want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, “Russia would accept those terms,” according to a person who heard them.\n\n“Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,” the person familiar with the discussions said. “The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That’s Elon Musk. He hasn’t been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.”\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine’s infrastructure, Musk replied: “You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.”\n\n“The gall to look like heroes”\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it’s hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It’s not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,” said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “Without that they’d be really operating in the blind in many cases.”\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX’s request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has “the gall to look like heroes” while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid – or partially paid – for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units’ “exceptional utility” and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine’s new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, “The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine’s armed forces as they repel Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.”\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level – $4,500 a month – to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n“You could say he’s trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‘I don’t want to be part of this anymore,’” said the person familiar with Ukraine’s requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk’s reputation for being unpredictable, “Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,” this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter – including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he’d made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called “The Weekend,” at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they’ve had recent victories.\n\n“This is the time to do it.

The letter requested that the Defense Department take over more of the funding for Ukraine’s military, which it calculated would run tens of millions of dollars a month.\n\nDays after the CNN report, Musk appeared to reverse course, claiming that SpaceX had withdrawn the request.\n\n“The hell with it,” Musk tweeted, “we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.”\n\nNegotiations between SpaceX and the Defense Department continue despite Musk’s claim that SpaceX withdrepw its request, according to a senior defense official.\n\n“Negotiations are very much underway. Everyone in our building knows we’re going to pay them,” the senior Pentagon official told CNN, adding that the department is eager to have commitments in writing “because we worry he’ll change his mind.”\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk provides an update on the development of the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket at the companys Launch facility in south Texas. Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, Musk attended a ceremony for US Space Force which also included Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Musk has also been embroiled in his high-profile and controversial takeover of Twitter.\n\nNeither Musk nor SpaceX responded to a request for comment. The Ukrainian government, including the Ministry of Defense, did not immediately respond.\n\nThe recent outage started on October 24 and was described by one person briefed on the situation as a “huge problem” for Ukraine’s military. The terminals had been disconnected, this person said, due to a lack of funding.\n\nThe outage affected a block of 1,300 terminals that Ukraine purchased from a British company in March and were used for combat-related operations.\n\nSpaceX was charging Ukraine’s military $2,500 a month to keep each of the 1,300 units connected, pushing the total cost to almost $20 million by September, the person briefed on the matter said. Eventually, they could no longer afford to pay, the person said.\n\nA British request\n\nBefore the terminals went completely dark, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense made a request in early October to their British counterparts to pick up the $3.25 million monthly bill. The batch of terminals were also rotated out as concerns grew that service could be turned off, in order to minimize the impact, the source said.\n\nA British official said after discussions between the ministries “it was agreed there were higher priority military capabilities.” Among many other channels of support, the UK has been flying thousands of Ukrainian troops to Britain for training before they head back to the frontlines.\n\n“We support a number of terminals that have a direct tactical utility for Ukraine’s military in repelling Russia’s invasion,” the British official told CNN. “We consider and prioritize all new requests in terms of the impact contributions would have in supporting Ukraine to defend its people against Putin’s deplorable invasion.”\n\nA senior Ukrainian official confirmed the outage, calling the Starlink units “very important” for Ukraine’s fight against Russia.\n\nThe September letter from SpaceX to the Pentagon said there were almost 20,000 Starlink terminals in Ukraine. At that time, by SpaceX’s own admission, the majority of them were fully or partially purchased with outside funding, including from the US, Polish and UK governments. The letter claimed those sources paid for about 30% of the monthly connectivity bill as well.\n\nThe terminals, which include small satellite dishes, connect to SpaceX’s constellation of satellites orbiting the earth and not only keep troops and civilians online but have been used with lethal effect, proving critical for Ukraine’s use of drones and artillery targeting.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how many terminals Ukraine’s military is operating but the 1,300 that recently shut off represent a significant portion. In July the country’s commander-in-chief wrote Musk directly asking for more, in a letter seen by CNN, saying approximately 4,000 had been deployed by the military.\n\nA woman rides a bicycle past a damaged building in the town of Kupiansk on November 3, 2022, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this month, Musk said that of the more than 25,000 terminals now in Ukraine, fewer than 11,000 were paying for the service, which can run as high as $4,500 per month.\n\nOn Monday a Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on potential contracts or agreements but said talks are ongoing.\n\n“We continue to discuss Ukraine’s satellite communication needs with Ukraine and companies like SpaceX and others,” Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told reporters.\n\nWhether greater cooperation with SpaceX would give the US government stronger control over the Starlink signal in Ukraine has not been answered. Currently SpaceX controls where Ukraine Starlink terminals can be used and outages have previously been reported by Ukrainian units near the front, as they advanced and liberated Russian-held areas.\n\nAs a result, Musk’s control of the signal gives him significant sway over the battlefield at a time when he has come under heavy criticism for arguing that Ukraine should sue for peace and give up some of its territory.", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt Sean Lyngaas", "Alex Marquardt", "Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/962339/quiz-of-the-week-2-8-september", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 2 - 8 September | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

He also told me what the Kremlin’s red lines were,” Bremmer wrote.\n\nMusk tweeted a succinct response: “Nobody should trust Bremmer.”\n\nEurasia Group is a political risk research and consulting firm that reports on emerging and developed economies. Bremmer, who is often cited by mainstream media, has also been involved with international organizations including the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe exchange comes after Musk tweeted a “Ukraine-Russia peace plan” last week that reflected demands Kremlin officials have made repeatedly in recent months, including that Kyiv commit to military neutrality, acknowledge that Crimea is formally part of Russia, and ensure continued water supply to the peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014.\n\n“Ukraine-Russia Peace: Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people. Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake). Water supply to Crimea assured. Ukraine remains neutral,” Musk tweeted.\n\n“This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then,” he added. “Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war.”\n\nMusk’s tweet was welcomed by the Kremlin – but sparked outrage among Ukrainian government officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, who suggested in a tweet that Musk was expressing support for Russia with his proposal.\n\n“F— off is my very diplomatic reply to you,” Ukraine’s Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk wrote in response to Musk’s Twitter thread.\n\nA lawyer for Musk did not immediately return CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday night, Bremmer strongly defended his claim, saying: “I have been writing my weekly newsletter on geopolitics for 24 [years]. I write honestly without fear or favor and this week’s update was no different.\n\n“I’ve long admired Musk as a unique and world-changing entrepreneur, which I’ve said publicly. He’s not a geopolitics expert.”\n\nMusk on peace proposals\n\nMultiple sources told CNN separately that in recent weeks, Musk had floated a similar “peace plan” proposal in conversations with attendees at think tanks and conferences, and hinted at having contact with Kremlin officials.\n\nIn a conversation at “The Weekend” festival in Aspen, Colorado, last month, Musk told attendees, “I really would encourage Ukraine – because Ukraine’s had some victories recently – really encourage them to seek peace. This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it. Cause you know everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning. For now.”\n\nAccording to one attendee, Musk added that “in my view the nature of that peace would be: recognizing Crimea as Russia, allowing Luhansk and Donetsk to be independent, quasi-independent republics, and don’t block the water to Crimea like they did last time. Russia would accept those terms.”\n\nBased on the ideas Musk put forward, according to another source who heard them, it seemed “clear” he had been “in communication with the Kremlin.” A third source echoed that, telling CNN Musk had suggested in late September that his proposals for a peace deal were endorsed by the Kremlin.\n\nMusk made similar suggestions for a resolution to tensions between China and Taiwan, telling the Financial Times that some control over the self-governing island could be handed to Beijing in a bid for peace.\n\n“My recommendation…would be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won’t make everyone happy,” Musk told the Financial Times in an interview published last week. “And it’s possible, and I think probably, in fact, that they could have an arrangement that’s more lenient than Hong Kong.”\n\nIn a note to Eurasia Group subscribers on Monday, Bremmer expanded upon his conversation with Musk, which he said took place about two weeks ago.\n\n“I spoke with Elon two weeks ago, and he told me Putin (in a direct conversation with him) was “prepared to negotiate” (much as I had heard from Shanghai Cooperation Organization members the week before) and had outlined the minimum the Russian President would require to end the war,” Bremmer wrote.\n\n“There were three components: (1) Crimea remains Russian, (2) Ukraine accepts a formal status of neutrality, and (3) recognition of Russia’s annexations of Luhansk and Donetsk, Kherson control for the water supply to Crimea, and Zaporizhzhia for the land bridge.”\n\nBremmer wrote that Musk told him Putin said he would accomplish those goals “no matter what,” and was prepared to retaliate with a nuclear strike should Zelensky try to take back Crimea by force.\n\n“Elon said everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome,” Bremmer wrote.\n\nMusk has been providing Starlink systems to Ukraine since early on in the war, allowing Kyiv to maintain internet and communications access in areas cut off by Russian attacks on infrastructure. But according to Bremmer, Musk was spooked in recent weeks by a Ukrainian request to activate Starlink systems in Crimea – suggesting a potential ground operation – and refused the request.\n\n“Musk also appeared concerned about more direct threats from Putin,” Bremmer wrote. “While he didn’t surface anything explicit with me, he did talk about Russian cyber capabilities and Russia’s potential to disrupt his satellites.”\n\nAsked on Tuesday about the reported Musk-Putin discussion, US National Security Council official John Kirby told reporters that Musk does not speak on behalf of the Biden administration in any conversations he may have with the Russian President.\n\n“I’ll let Mr. Musk speak for his conversations. Obviously, he’s not representing the United States government in this conversation. So I think I’ll let him characterize this. And we’ll avoid commenting on the particulars,” Kirby said.\n\nKirby reiterated that Russia started its war in Ukraine “in an unprovoked and illegal way” and “can end it today simply by taking their troops out.”\n\nAbsent that, Kirby said the United States plans to continue to support Ukraine with capabilities and tools to succeed on the battlefield.\n\nZelensky, Kirby added, “will get to determine for himself when is the right time to negotiate, and Mr. Zelensky will get to determine for himself and for his country what terms he’s willing to consider, what success looks like.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the name of the festival at which Elon Musk told attendees Ukraine should seek peace.

They could paint ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent a truckload of Starlink antennas — which can be used to connect to the company’s satellite-based internet service — to Ukraine this week, responding to a plea from the country’s vice prime minister amid fears that Ukrainians could lose internet access if Russia continues its attacks on communication infrastructure.\n\nBut using satellite services can be dangerous in wartime, as evidenced by a history of states using satellite signals to geolocate and target enemies, cybersecurity experts told CNN Business.\n\n“If an adversary has a specialized plane aloft, it can detect [a satellite] signal and home in on it,” Nicholas Weaver, a security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, said via email. “It isn’t necessarily easy, but the Russians have a lot of practice on tracking various signal emitters in Syria and responding. Starlink may work for the moment, but anyone setting a [Starlink] dish up in Ukraine needs to consider it as a potential giant target.”\n\nIn short: “It may be useful, but for safety’s sake you don’t want to set it (or really any distinctive emitter) up in Ukraine anywhere close to where you would not want a Russian bomb dropping,” Weaver said.\n\nShortly after this story was originally published, Musk also weighed in on Twitter, saying “Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine, so probability of being targeted is high. Please use with caution.”\n\nHe went on to advise users in Ukraine to “turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible,” and to “place light camouflage over antenna to avoid visual detection.”\n\nIt’s not clear how many Starlink terminals SpaceX sent to Ukraine, nor is it clear how the Ukrainian government plans to use or distribute them.\n\nSpaceX’s foray into aiding Ukraine began when the country’s vice prime minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, issued a public plea to Musk on Twitter last weekend, saying, “while you try to colonize Mars – Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space – Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand.” It was one in a string of tweets Fedorov directed at various US-based tech figureheads, imploring them to take action on Ukraine’s behalf.\n\nMusk responded with offers to help, announced that the Starlink network was now activated in Ukraine, and, this week, a truckload of user terminals — which are required to give users access to the satellite-based internet service — arrived.\n\nFedorov shared a picture online.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, he shared a photo of what appeared to be an active Starlink antenna at work.\n\nFedorov then acknowledged that he’d seen the warning Musk posted on Twitter about the safety issues, writing to respond, “Sure…We are going to use them for Ukrainians also after our victory.”\n\nThe majority of the country still has access to their normal, Earth-based internet connections, despite attacks on other communications infrastructure, such as a TV tower in the capitol of Kyiv, by Russian invaders, according to Alp Toker, who heads the internet monitoring firm NetBlocks.\n\nBut certain areas have experienced outages, Toker said.\n\n“The heaviest disruptions are observed in the east, Melitopol, Mariupol, Kharkiv, and past the Luhansk and Donetsk regions toward Ukraine-controlled regions and Severodonetsk,” Toker said via email. “Kyiv has fared better, as has the west of the country.”\n\nToker added that, in NetBlocks’ view, Starlink “isn’t going to get Ukraine back online in the event of a nation-scale blackout” — but the service can provide hotspots for crucial services, such as supporting journalists, resistance groups and public officials “fortunate enough to have access to the equipment.”\n\nBut Toker also acknowledged using the service can be dangerous: “There is always risk associated with new technologies in warzones, where being found with unfamiliar equipment can single out journalists or activists for closer scrutiny. There’s also the specific risk of getting traced and triangulation via [radiofrequency] emissions when it comes to telecommunications equipment.”\n\nThose risks, Toker said, “need to be weighed up on a case-by-case basis.”\n\nJohn Scott-Railton — a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab who has spent a decade studying hacking and surveillance in conflict zones — took to Twitter over the weekend in an attempt to raise awareness about the possible risks. He praised SpaceX’s outreach, but warned that Starlink terminals can turn into the equivalent of painting a giant target on one’s back.\n\n“It’s great to see the tech sector engaging on the topic of Ukraine. This could not be a more powerful signal of global solidarity,” Scott-Railton told CNN Business. “But we have to be mindful of the risks. People in a conflict zones are limited by time and resources. And we want to make sure that they’re not given a false impression of the safety of the technology that we’re providing to them.”\n\nThe risks have nothing to do with whether the communications are encrypted, Scott-Railton added, because devices don’t necessarily need to be eavesdropped on by the enemy — they just need to emit unique enough signals to be hunted for, and possibly located. He also noted that Starlink is still a very new technology, so it hasn’t necessarily been tested in war zones to identify and assess its risks.\n\nA US military spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. The US military has been aware of the risks of using satellite technology in war zones. In 2003, during the Iraq war, for example, both sides banned satellite phones because of the security and intelligence risks.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment about Starlink, nor has it responded to routine email inquires from reporters in years. Ukrainian officials and the country’s military did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nScott-Railton pointed out that using satellite technology in conflict zones has — time and again — been an underestimated risk. In 1996, for example, Russians reportedly used the signals emitted from a satellite phone to target and kill Chechen president Dzhokhar Dudayev. Russia has “decades of experience” executing such attacks, he said on Twitter. Scott-Railton has also researched the role that satellite technologies played in the Libyan revolution of 2011.\n\nIt’s not always clear when an adversary has caught on to an enemy’s use of satellite technology, Scott-Railton added, until it’s too late.\n\nJosh Lospinoso, the CEO of Shift5, a US-based computer security startup, added in an email: “Bottom line, SpaceX’s Starlink terminal deployment to Ukraine could pose serious concerns for Ukrainian officials who use them…Russia could use this geolocation information for anything ranging from intelligence gathering and tracking to airstrikes.”\n\nDmitry Rogozin, the head of Russian space agency Roscosmos, made clear that Russia is aware of Musk’s donation — and Rogozin sees it as a hostile act. In comments on Wednesday that were translated by CNN Business, Rogozin said SpaceX’s assertions that Starlink is for civilian use and meant to connect the world are “fairy tales.”\n\n“Muskophiles say this is amazing, it is the light of our worldwide cosmic exploration,” Rogozin said. “Well, [Musk] has taken a side. I don’t have issues with him. It’s obvious, it’s the West, which we should never trust because it has always chronically experienced jealousy, among the political elites, jealousy to our country. Look at how right now they are racing each other to defecate on our relationships, and who is going to clean the mess all up later? It is very dangerous what is happening right now.”\n\nMusk replied in a tweet.\n\n“Ukraine civilian Internet was experiencing strange outages – bad weather perhaps? – so SpaceX is helping fix it,” he wrote.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}]}

The high levels of caesium-137 found in wild boars in Bavaria, southeast Germany, have long been linked to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\nYet while radiation levels have decreased in other animals across Europe since then, experts have wondered why that decline did not occur in the pigs, a phenomenon that has become known as the “wild boar paradox”.\n\nBut according to a newly published study in the Environmental Science & Technology journal, the source of their contamination may be linked to atmospheric weapons testing that took place in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe researchers used a “relatively new method of analysis” involving the ratio of two caesium isotopes to analyse the carcasses of boars killed by hunters across Bavaria from 2019 to 2021, explained The New York Times.\n\nNuclear reactors and nuclear weapons leave slightly different contamination signatures, “with distinct ratios of cesium-135 to cesium-137 isotopes”. So researchers could determine that the radiation present in the boars stemmed from nuclear testing conducted decades ago.\n\nGeorg Steinhauser, a radiochemist at the Vienna University of Technology and co-author of the study, explained that it was impossible to attribute the nuclear weapons fallout to any particular location or weapons test, as they affected the entire northern hemisphere evenly.\n\nAfter a nuclear explosion “an enormous updraft occurs”, which pushes the radioactive material higher. When this falls back to Earth, the material has evenly distributed higher in the atmosphere to create a truly “global fallout” phenomenon, he told The Washington Post.\n\nAs for exactly why wild pigs are more radioactive than other animals, and how they came into contact with radioactive isotopes, the answer lies in their food. The boars are likely to have consumed caesium from contaminated deer truffle mushrooms, said Steinhauser.\n\nDeer truffles, which sit some 20-40cm deep into the soil, appear to have absorbed all the caesium from nuclear weapons testing six decades ago. But caesium from the Chernobyl disaster is yet to reach the depths of the deer truffles, meaning radioactivity levels could increase even further.\n\nThose who enjoy eating wild boar, however, shouldn’t be too concerned.

Mark Stichert, the groundfish and shellfish fisheries management coordinator with the state’s fish and game department, said that more crab were being fished out of the oceans than could be naturally replaced.\n\n“So there were more removals from the population than there were inputs,” Stichert explained at Thursday’s meeting.\n\nBetween the surveys conducted in 2021 and 2022, he said, mature male snow crabs declined about 40%, with an estimated 45 million pounds left in the entire Bering Sea.\n\n“It’s a scary number, just to be clear,” Stichert said.\n\nBut calling the Bering Sea crab population “overfished” – a technical definition that triggers conservation measures – says nothing about the cause of its collapse.\n\n“We call it overfishing because of the size level,” Michael Litzow, the Kodiak lab director for NOAA Fisheries, told CNN. “But it wasn’t overfishing that caused the collapse, that much is clear.”\n\nLitzow says human-caused climate change is a significant factor in the crabs’ alarming disappearance.\n\nSnow crabs are cold-water species and found overwhelmingly in areas where water temperatures are below 2 degrees Celsius, Litzow says. As oceans warm and sea ice disappears, the ocean around Alaska is becoming inhospitable for the species.\n\n“There have been a number of attribution studies that have looked at specific temperatures in the Bering Sea or Bering Sea ice cover in 2018, and in those attribution studies, they’ve concluded that those temperatures and low-ice conditions in the Bering sea are a consequence of global warming,” Litzow said.\n\nTemperatures around the Arctic have warmed four times faster than the rest of the planet, scientists have reported. Climate change has triggered a rapid loss in sea ice in the Arctic region, particularly in Alaska’s Bering Sea, which in turn has amplified global warming.\n\n“Closing the fisheries due to low abundance and continuing research are the primary efforts to restore the populations at this point,” Ethan Nichols, an assistant area management biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, told CNN.\n\nStichert also said that there might be some “optimism for the future” as a few, small juvenile snow crabs are starting to appear in the system. But it could be at least three to four more years before they hit maturity and contribute to the regrowth of the population.\n\n“It is a glimmer of optimism,” Litzow said. “That’s better than not seeing them, for sure. We get a little bit warmer every year and that variability is higher in Arctic ecosystems and high latitude ecosystems, and so if we can get a cooler period that would be good news for snow crab.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/22/world/mosquito-bite-attraction-smell-scn-trnd/index.html", "title": "Here's why mosquitoes are attracted to some people more than ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you have always suspected that you might just be a mosquito magnet, scientists now have evidence for you: Mosquitoes indeed are attracted to certain humans more than others, according to a new study.\n\nA research team led by Leslie Vosshall, a professor at Rockefeller University and head of its laboratory of neurogenetics and behavior, sought to identify why certain people seem to draw more mosquitoes than others. The research findings were published in the journal Cell on October 18.\n\nOver the course of three years, researchers asked a group of 64 volunteers to wear nylon stockings on their arms for six hours a day over multiple days. Maria Elena De Obaldia, the study’s first author and former postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University, constructed a “two-choice olfactometer assay” – an acrylic glass chamber in which researchers put two of the stockings. The study team then released yellow fever mosquitoes, scientifically called Aedes aegypti, into the chamber and observed which stocking drew more insects.\n\nThis test allowed researchers to separate study participants into “mosquito magnets,” whose stockings drew lots of mosquitoes, and “low attractors,” who didn’t seem as enticing to the insects. The scientists scrutinized the skin of the mosquito magnets and found 50 molecular compounds that were higher in these participants than the others.\n\n“We had no preconceived notions about what we would find,” Vosshall, who is also chief scientific officer of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, told CNN. But one difference was particularly distinctive: The mosquito magnets had much higher rates of carboxylic acid on their skin than the low attractors.\n\nCarboxylic acids are found in sebum, the oily substance that creates a barrier and helps keep our skin moisturized.\n\nThe carboxylic acids are large molecules, Vosshall explained. They’re “not that smelly by themselves,” she said. But beneficial bacteria on the skin “chew on these acids, that produces the characteristic smell of humans” – which may be what attracts mosquitoes, according to Vosshall.\n\nOdor from skin secretions play a role\n\nOne participant, identified only as Subject 33, was the belle of the ball for mosquitoes: The subject’s stockings were 100 times more attractive to mosquitoes than the least attractive participants.\n\nAnd humans’ attraction level seemed to stay pretty constant over time for participants who were monitored over the three-year period, Vosshall said.\n\nSubject 33, for instance, “never took a day off from being the most attractive human,” which might be “bad news for mosquito magnets.”\n\nWhen it comes to Aedes aegypti, female mosquitoes prefer to use human blood to fuel their egg production, giving urgency to their quest to find humans to prey on. And these mini predators use a variety of mechanisms to identify and choose the humans they bite, Vosshall said.\n\nCarboxylic acids are just one piece of the puzzle in explaining how the pesky insects might choose their targets. Body heat and the carbon dioxide we release when we breathe also attract mosquitoes to humans.\n\nScientists still don’t know why carboxylic acids seem to attract mosquitoes so strongly, Vosshall said. But the next step might be to explore the effects of reducing carboxylic acids on the skin.\n\n“You can’t strip natural moisturizers off the skin completely, that would be bad for your skin health,” she said. However, Vosshall said dermatological products might be able to minimize carboxylic acid levels and reduce mosquito bites.\n\n“Every bite of these mosquitoes puts people into public health danger,” she said. “Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are vectors for dengue, yellow fever, and Zika. Those people who are magnets are gonna be much more likely to be infected with viruses.”\n\nMosquitoes evolved to hunt by scent\n\nMatthew DeGennaro, an associate professor at Florida International University who specializes in the neurogenetics of mosquitoes, told CNN that the results of the study help answer long-standing questions about what specific factors make mosquitoes love some humans more than others. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“This study clearly shows that these acids are important,” he said. “Now, how the mosquitoes perceive these carboxylic acids is interesting because these particular chemicals are really heavy, so they’re hard to smell at a distance.\n\n“It could be that these chemicals are being altered by, let’s say the skin microbiome, and it causes a certain kind of odor plume. Or it could be that other factors in the environment break down these chemicals a little bit, so they’re easier for mosquitoes to detect.”\n\nThe results are also “a really great example of how well insects can smell,” DeGennaro, added. “This insect has evolved to hunt us.”\n\nFor DeGennaro, the staying power of certain humans’ attractiveness is one of the most interesting aspects of the research.\n\n“We did not know that there were very stable preferences of mosquitoes for certain people,” he said. “It could suggest that the skin microbiome is important, although they did not address that.”\n\nFurther research should explore the microbiome that lives on human skin to understand why mosquitoes are attracted to certain compounds over others, he said. And that could lead to better products to reduce mosquito bites and the spread of disease.\n\n“I think if we understand why mosquitoes find a host, we can design new repellents that will block the mosquitoes from sensing those chemicals,” DeGennaro said. “And this could be used to improve our current repellents.”", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/archives/2017/07/06/family-fatal-brain-diseases-has-baffled-scientists-while-infecting-new-species/445332001/", "title": "A family of fatal brain diseases has baffled scientists while infecting ...", "text": "\n\n\n\nThis story was originally published Nov. 3, 2002.\n\nThis is part three of five of the Deadly Game: Chronic Wasting Disease series.\n\n\n\nLater this month in an austere, concrete building in Ames, Iowa, scientists expect to begin a macabre experiment involving the two animals that most define Wisconsin's culture and economy: white-tailed deer and dairy cattle.\n\n\n\nResearchers will inject brain tissue from deer infected with chronic wasting disease into the brains of healthy cattle to see whether the cows develop a similar illness.\n\nWith Wisconsin's 1.6 million deer and 1.3 million cattle living so close to one another, scientists want to know whether what threatens one, also threatens the other.\n\n\n\nCan chronic wasting disease, which crossed the Mississippi River this year to infect Wisconsin's white-tailed deer, also cross the species barrier to infect cattle?\n\n\n\nIn a sense, the experiment in Iowa represents the hand of man trying to undo the hand of man.\n\n\n\nFor nearly 250 years, sheep appeared to be the only species of animal afflicted with a type of fatal brain disease now called a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. All of that changed in the last 60 years.\n\n\n\nIn short order, mink, deer and cattle developed similar brain diseases, and the outbreaks appeared to have human fingerprints on them. Researchers believe that changes in the way animals were fed, housed and recycled may have opened a door to the deadly new diseases.\n\n\n\nOne of the first warnings was sounded in Wisconsin, a state that has become an epicenter for this family of animal brain illnesses. Only the cattle disease, \"mad cow,\" has yet to be found here, or anywhere in the United States.\n\nPart One:With deer hunting woven into our cultural and economic fabric, a threat to the herd could turn catastrophic\n\nPart Two:In tracking a lethal family of diseases that threatens humans and animals, scientists have become the hunters\n\n\n\nAlthough Richard Marsh might dispute that if he were still alive.\n\n\n\nIt was Marsh, an affable, intensely curious scientist from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who sounded a warning about questionable animal feeding practices more than a decade ago and kept sounding it until his death in 1997, even as critics dismissed him as an alarmist.\n\n\n\nWhat worried Marsh was the feeding of rendered cattle and other ruminant animal products back to cattle, a practice widely blamed for the outbreak of mad cow disease in Great Britain.\n\n\n\n\"We caused these animals that are vegetarians to cannibalize themselves with these feeds,\" Roger C. Viadero, the former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said in a recent interview. \"To a large extent, man is responsible.\"\n\n\n\nHumans have suffered the consequences as well. About 130 people have died so far from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, believed to be the result of mad cow jumping to humans who ate infected beef. And the mad cow experience raised the specter that other diseases in the same family — such as chronic wasting disease — might infect people, with harrowing results.\n\n\n\nToday, some scientists suggest that man may yet have an opportunity to repair the damage.\n\nPart Four:Despite growing worries about the herd's health, the annual fall deer hunt continues as a family tradition\n\nPart Five:Survey says 88% plan to hunt this fall, even a 12% drop would mean 80,000 fewer hunters\n\n\n\nThey believe genetic testing could reveal animals that are resistant to diseases such as mad cow and chronic wasting. Once identified, resistant animals could be bred in captivity and then used to repopulate herds after susceptible animals have been killed off. Veterinarians already have found a breed of sheep that appears resistant to the brain disease scrapie.\n\n\n\nTheoretically, the same could be done for deer, said Gary Voelker, a research scientist with Infigen, a DeForest biotechnology firm and one the country's leading animal cloning companies.\n\n\n\nBut finding white-tailed deer that are resistant to chronic wasting disease may not be so easy. Preliminary research by Judd Aiken, a UW professor in the department of animal health and biomedical sciences, suggests that a majority of white-tailed deer in Wisconsin may be susceptible to the disease.\n\n\n\nIf whitetails with natural resistance can't be found, there may be an even more meddlesome option: genetically engineering resistant deer. Such a feat would entail adding a gene to the DNA of deer.\n\n\n\nOnce accomplished, \"You would just turn them into the wild and say 'breed away guys,' because every one of their offspring would be resistant,\" said Bob Wagner, a molecular biologist and president of Gene Check, a Fort Collins, Colo., biotech company.\n\n\n\nEven in the biotech frenzy of the 21st century, such a feat would be a considerable challenge. But it would have seemed like science fiction to Marsh when he first began to understand man's role in these deadly diseases.\n\nMink outbreak\n\n\n\nThe mink on Ed Brecke's farm were behaving strangely.\n\n\n\nThey left droppings, not in one place as usual, but all over the cages. They arched their tails over their backs like squirrels.\n\n\n\nWithin weeks, the normally agile mink were staggering about the cages, their legs plunging through gaps in the wire mesh. Some circled rapidly; others lay trance-like, noses buried in a corner.\n\n\n\nThen, one by one, they died. Thousands of them.\n\n\n\nReports of the dying animals brought Marsh to an unlikely setting for scientific discovery, a mink ranch in a village called Stetsonville, about 40 miles west of Wausau.\n\n\n\nIt was April 1985, the very month a veterinarian in England was discovering a frightening, new disease in cattle, similar to the one infecting the Wisconsin mink.\n\n\n\nMad cow disease.\n\n\n\nMarsh, the son of an Oregon mink rancher, was already one of the nation's experts on the family of fatal brain diseases that afflicted mink, sheep, deer and now cattle. For a renowned researcher he seemed deceptively simple, with his taste for polyester pants and fondness for doughnuts.\n\n\n\n\"He always came across — he had this act down to perfection — sort of like the bumbling, old veterinarian who didn't know a whole lot of things,\" said Debbie McKenzie, a senior scientist at UW-Madison who worked with Marsh for more than a decade.\n\n\n\nBut in the arcane field of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Marsh held a special place.\n\n\n\n\"He was god in those circles,\" McKenzie said. \"People would defer to his opinion.\"\n\n\n\nIn Stetsonville, Marsh knew right away that he was dealing with transmissible mink encephalopathy.\n\n\n\nThe disease was no stranger to Wisconsin, a state that led the nation in mink production in the 1960s. In fact, the first place in the world to see an outbreak of the mink illness was a farm in Brown County in 1947. Virtually all of the adult mink on the Brown County farm got the disease. They became uncoordinated and drowsy, then died.\n\n\n\nOther outbreaks hit Wisconsin ranches in 1961 and 1963. Finally in 1965, a Wisconsin veterinarian, G.R. Hartsough, and a UW-Madison researcher, Dieter Burger, wrote the first paper identifying a new disease in mink \"that reveals many traits in common with scrapie of sheep.\"\n\n\n\nThe disease intrigued Marsh. In the late 1960s, he studied infected mink brain from the 1963 outbreak, noting that the infectious agent resisted attack by chemicals and ultraviolet radiation, and seemed to have no genetic material.\n\n\n\n\"The biochemical properties of the agent are quite unusual for a virus,\" Marsh wrote in a 1968 paper. \"The only other agent which has been shown to have similar properties is that of scrapie.\"\n\n\n\nMarsh had no way of knowing that more than a decade later a new theory would shock the scientific world by suggesting that the mysterious agent was not a virus, but a rogue protein.\n\n\n\nMedford veterinarian Oscar Hildebrandt, who specialized in mink and knew the Stetsonville rancher, also was intrigued by the disease.\n\n\n\nHildebrandt said the disease was a terrible financial blow to the young rancher, who ultimately lost 60% of his 7,300 adult mink. Hildebrandt had read about the disease, but the visit to Stetsonvile was the only time he ever saw it in a living animal.\n\n\n\n\"The mink that were pointed out to me had intense itching all over their bodies, mainly the hindquarters,\" he said. \"They were rubbing themselves on the wire of the cages, rubbing themselves so their fur was coming off. Because of this intense irritation, they weren't eating. They were skinny.\"\n\n\n\nWhat Hildebrandt saw brought to mind scrapie. He wondered whether the rancher had fed sheep remains to his mink.\n\n\n\nBut Marsh's investigation led him in another direction. Marsh returned to the ranch several times, questioning the rancher closely about what he fed his mink.\n\n\n\nThe rancher, Marsh wrote, had never fed sheep to his mink. Nor did he use supplements of meat and bone meal.\n\n\n\nMost of the meat he fed the mink had come from fallen and sick dairy cattle.\n\nThis led Marsh to the startling conclusion that would shape his career and launch a scientific debate: Cattle had passed a killer to the mink.\n\n\n\nThe possibility that the mink disease came from cows had been raised by Hartsough and Burger 20 years earlier when they wrote that \"tissues of bovine or perhaps ovine (sheep) origin are possible sources\" for the illness. But Marsh had eliminated sheep as the source of the Stetsonville outbreak.\n\n\n\nHis critics — and there were plenty, especially in the feed and rendering industries — would claim there were crucial errors in his work.\n\n\n\nThe stakes were high, perhaps nowhere higher than in his own state of Wisconsin, with its large herd of dairy cattle.\n\n\n\nIf Marsh was right, the cows harbored their own brain-destroying illness caused by an extraordinary infectious agent, an agent that had jumped the species barrier from cattle to mink.\n\n\n\nIf Marsh was right, mad cow disease, or something like it, had reached the U.S.\n\nA minor disease in a minor species\n\nThe earliest record of these brain-destroying illnesses dates back to 1732, when sheep scrapie was first described in Great Britain.\n\n\n\nScrapie got its name from the way in which infected sheep — or goats — often rubbed against objects and scraped off wool or hair. As the disease progressed, sheep sometimes became uncoordinated in their hind limbs, struggling to stand and swaying unsteadily when they did. They lost weight and displayed other odd behaviors, including high-stepping and lip smacking.\n\n\n\nIn the early 1900s the disease was thought to be a virus, but the virus could not be isolated. Later, some experts believed scrapie was genetic. That theory too has been rejected, though genes do appear to play a role, making some sheep more susceptible than others.\n\n\n\nThe most common explanation for how the disease spreads is through contact with the placenta in birthing areas.\n\n\n\nFor years, even after scrapie first reached the U.S., North American interest in the disease was limited.\n\n\n\n\"For a long time scrapie was considered a minor disease, and in the U.S., a minor disease in a minor species,\" said Linda Detwiler, a U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian who began studying the disease in Ohio in the 1980s. In the hierarchy of American agriculture, sheep lagged far behind cattle.\n\n\n\nBut to Ed Dittbrenner, scrapie was no minor disease, and sheep no minor species.\n\nIn the summer of 1980, five years before Marsh went to Stetsonville, a state veterinarian showed up on Dittbrenner's sheep farm in Cumberland.\n\n\n\nDittbrenner had been raising sheep since he was 4 years old, but this was the first year he had gone into the business full time. He had 380 head of Suffolk sheep, some purchased from Illinois and North Dakota.\n\n\n\nThere was a problem, the state veterinarian said. Dittbrenner had sold two sheep to a livestock broker who then sold the sheep to another farmer. The sheep had come down with scrapie, raising the likelihood that they had carried the disease when they were on Dittbrenner's farm.\n\n\n\nThe veterinarian told Dittbrenner he could not sell or move any of his sheep. His 200-acre farm was quarantined.\n\n\n\nA month later came worse news: State agriculture officials had decided that all of his sheep would have to be killed, even though they appeared to be generally healthy. All of the sheep belonging to the livestock broker and the other farmer would also be destroyed. And so would the sheep Dittbrenner had sold to a dozen children to raise as a project for 4-H.\n\n\n\nThe slaughter couldn't take place until federal reimbursement for the farmers was available.\n\n\n\n\"I was going to have to feed them and care for them and know that the end result was that they were going to be killed,\" Dittbrenner said. \"This was the only thing I had, these sheep. I had raised sheep all of my life.\"\n\n\n\nIn August of that year, a trailer pulled into his farm. He watched as a veterinarian killed each animal with a pistol shot to the head.\n\n\n\nThen the farmer loaded his dead sheep onto a trailer and hauled them to the top of a hill on his property, where a pit, 8 feet wide and 40 feet long, had been dug. There, his entire herd was buried.\n\n\n\nFear of scrapie ran so strong that when Dittbrenner went looking for new sheep to buy, a farmer in Hayward refused to allow him on the property.\n\n\n\n\"They were afraid we would spread it,\" said Dittbrenner, who has since returned to raising sheep.\n\n\n\nToday Dittbrenner buys only sheep that have been tested and found to have a gene that appears to be resistant to scrapie. Still, there are no guarantees. Detwiler said scientists don't know if the gene is truly resistant to scrapie or just gives animals a longer incubation period before they get sick.\n\n\n\nIn the years since Dittbrenner's flock was destroyed, however, scientists have made progress in understanding what causes scrapie, and indeed the whole family of related diseases. In a landmark 1982 article in the journal Science, a California researcher, Stanley Prusiner, wrote that scrapie was caused by a mutant protein called a prion. This abnormally shaped protein caused disease, he said, simply by inducing another protein in the brain to mimic its deformed shape.\n\n\n\nAlthough Prusiner would win many converts to his theory, including the committee that awarded him the Nobel Prize, other scientists continue to voice doubts.\n\n\n\nAnd no one yet has figured out how to eliminate the disease in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\"I had a couple of wishes before I retire, and now I've pushed them back to before I die,\" Detwiler said. \"One is to see what the agent (in scrapie) really is. The other is to see scrapie eradicated from the U.S.\"\n\nMad cow concerns lead to feed ban\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Marsh's work in Stetsonville began to have wide repercussions, igniting a debate over how to protect the U.S. from a disease that had grown into a full-blown crisis in Great Britain.\n\n\n\nThe prevailing theory is that mad cow disease came from sheep scrapie. The British had used the scrapie-infected carcasses of sheep to make the meat and bone meal fed to dairy cattle. The meat and bone meal also included the remains of so-called downer cattle, cows too ill to walk.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the British had changed the rendering process used to make the meat and bone meal, phasing out the use of flammable solvents to get rid of animal fat and imitating American firms that used lower temperatures.\n\n\n\nThe combination of more fat protecting the infectious agent and less heat attacking it may have allowed the scrapie agent to survive in feed and then jump to the cows that consumed it.\n\n\n\nAn alternate theory holds that the disease emerged after a genetic mutation that occurred in a small number of cows, which then were used to make cattle feed.\n\n\n\nWhatever the disease's origin, it spread through meat and bone meal, a man-made product used to boost protein in animals. And by the late 1980s, man was paying a price.\n\n\n\nIn 1989, the number of British cows testing positive for mad cow tripled to more than 7,000 annually. The following year, the number doubled to more than 14,000. The disease ultimately infected nearly 180,000 cattle in Great Britain and spread to other countries in Europe and South America, as well as Israel and Japan.\n\n\n\nIn a gruesome effort to eradicate the disease, British authorities slaughtered nearly 4.5 million cattle that had no symptoms.\n\n\n\nThe mounting crisis in Britain lent a sense of urgency to what Marsh had found in Stetsonville.\n\n\n\nIf U.S. cows already had a similar illness, as he believed, then using them to make meat and bone meal for other cows risked unleashing a sizable outbreak in this country.\n\n\n\nThe same troubling conclusion had occurred to an acquaintance of Marsh, William Wustenberg, a Minnesota animal health consultant who had grown up on a mink ranch.\n\n\n\nIn 1990, the two men published an article, not in a medical journal, but in a publication that would reach farmers, Hoard's Dairyman.\n\n\n\n\"The question facing American dairy farmers and feed companies is one of economic benefit versus risk,\" they wrote, \"Are the benefits of feeding meat and bone meal enough to justify the risk of (mad cow)? ... Evidence provided by the (mink) outbreak in Stetsonville, Wis. indicates there may be a risk in feeding meat and bone meal of cattle origin.\"\n\n\n\nThe paper unleashed a furious debate.\n\n\n\nThe warning, if heeded, would dramatically change business for U.S. renderers, who process about 50 billion pounds of animal parts annually — enough to fill nearly two continuous trains stretching from Miami to Seattle.\n\n\n\nFred Bisplinghoff, a veterinarian and consultant to the $3 billion-a-year rendering industry, had serious doubts about Marsh's work. Bisplinghoff said he conducted his own study of the Stetsonville outbreak, questioning the mink rancher and getting him to admit that he had fed his mink organs and other material from various animals — not just downer cows — that had been rejected by feed companies.\n\n\n\n\"We contacted the owner, and the owner denied the story (he had told Marsh),\" Bisplinghoff said.\n\n\n\nOfficials in the rendering industry tried to get Marsh to change his conclusion. When he refused, they went to the dean of Marsh's college in an attempt to get the professor to recant.\n\n\n\nHe never did. In fact, Marsh continued to sound the alarm.\n\n\n\n\"Dick Marsh was an excellent scientist who loved publicity and who came to the wrong conclusion,\" Bisplinghoff said. \"I could never understand why he persisted. He stuck to his story all the way.\"\n\n\n\nHe would win one important convert. A year before winning the Nobel Prize, Prusiner was quoted as agreeing with Marsh that mad cow disease must be in the U.S.\n\n\n\nFinally, in January 1997, more than six years after the Hoard's Dairyman article, the Food and Drug Administration proposed a ban on the feeding of rendered ruminant protein to cattle. Wustenberg phoned his congratulations to Marsh.\n\n\n\n\"You got it done.\"\n\n\n\nMarsh was typically restrained.\n\n\n\n\"He was kind of quietly satisfied that it had been done,\" Wustenberg recalled, adding that there was also the feeling \"like 'Jesus, it's about time. We've been at this for a long time.' \"\n\n\n\nTwo months later, on March 23, Marsh died of cancer, at his home in Middleton. He was 58.\n\n\n\nThe ban was approved and took effect later that year, though the FDA stressed that mad cow had not been found in the U.S.\n\n\n\nEven after his death, Marsh's work in Stetsonville would raise vital questions for Wisconsin when yet another prion disease entered the state: chronic wasting disease.\n\nAfter years of obscurity, disease on the move\n\nIn the late 1960s, researchers in Fort Collins, Colo., were raising mule deer in wildlife pens for nutritional studies. At some point, sheep also were raised in the pens, allowing researchers to compare the two species.\n\n\n\nIt's not clear whether the sheep arrived before or after deer began falling ill. Nor is there any record that any of the sheep had scrapie. But their presence would raise the same question that haunted mad cow researchers: Had sheep passed a prion disease to another species?\n\n\n\nFor a disease to jump the biological barrier between species is no simple matter. Different species have different structures for the normal protein in their brains. Scientists believe those differences make it difficult for prions from one animal to infect an animal of a different species.\n\n\n\nSometimes, though, there is enough similarity that a prion can cause a normal protein to misfold, triggering a cascade of misfolding that kills off brain cells.\n\n\n\nResearchers in Colorado noticed that in the early stages of chronic wasting disease, deer got a dull, vacant look in their eyes and appeared standoffish. Later they urinated much more than normal and their bodies wasted away — the characteristic that gave the disease its name.\n\n\n\nAt first, the animal's weight loss didn't suggest a brain disease, but rather something like exposure to toxins. Roughly a decade would pass before a scientist made the connection between chronic wasting disease and scrapie.\n\n\n\nLate one night in 1977, a graduate student in Colorado State University's Department of Pathology peered through a microscope, seeking clues to the mysterious deer disease.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Williams, daughter of a professor of dairy science, had wanted to be a veterinarian since childhood. She was determined now to examine every way in which the deer that were dying differed from normal deer.\n\nShe sectioned the brain of a dead mule deer and put a slide under the microscope. What she saw was striking. Clear holes in the otherwise pink tissue. Williams had written a term paper on a sheep disease that looked like this, so the image set off a flash of recognition.\n\n\n\nI think this is scrapie.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't scrapie exactly, but Williams had the right idea. Deer now had their own transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. As researchers learned more, they grew to suspect that chronic wasting disease spread from deer to deer either by direct contact or through saliva, urine or feces.\n\n\n\nFor years, the disease remained as obscure as scrapie had been, confined to portions of Colorado and Wyoming, and of interest to just a few scientists. Not until the mid-1990s did chronic wasting show up outside those two states.\n\n\n\nBut then it began to move, propelled, some believe, by the growing trade in farmed deer and elk.\n\n\n\nIn 1996, the disease was found on an elk farm in Saskatchewan. In 1997, an elk farm in South Dakota. In 1998, an elk farm in Nebraska, then a farm in Oklahoma. Then, in subsequent years, Montana. Kansas. Alberta.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, the first cases showed up in New Mexico, Minnesota and most significantly, Wisconsin, the first state east of the Mississippi River. On Friday, Illinois confirmed that chronic wasting had been found there, in a doe shot near the Wisconsin border.\n\n\n\nDeer and elk farmers quickly learned the same lesson driven home to Ed Dittbrenner by scrapie and to Ed Brecke by the mink disease: The infectious agent brought economic devastation.\n\n\n\nWisconsin's once-thriving deer and elk trade shut down.\n\n\n\nAll of a sudden Corey Bauldry couldn't sell the red deer on his Sturgeon Bay game farm, and he needed to badly. His delivery business had been struggling.\n\n\n\nThe 95 deer on Bauldry's farm — apparently quite healthy — could once have commanded between $70,000 and $80,000 total. Now he couldn't sell them at all.\n\n\n\nIn past years, the 33-year-old Bauldry enjoyed watching the fawns being born. This year, he was running low on money to feed his animals. In September, all 22 fawns were shot and buried. The remaining deer will be shot and butchered soon, which is why Bauldry won't be hunting.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going this year, because I'm going to have a freezer full of my own deer,\" he said.\n\nJumping species\n\nA poor hunt and hardships for deer farmers may be just the short-term effects of chronic wasting disease. The state's wildlife could face long-term problems if the disease spreads to other animals or gets in the soil.\n\n\n\nHere again Marsh's work in Stetsonville seemed to anticipate the long-range threat from these diseases. When he studied the mink 17 years ago, Marsh wondered not only where their disease had come from, but also where it might go.\n\n\n\nMarsh and other UW-Madison researchers began injecting tissue from diseased mink brains into a variety of other animals. It turned out the disease could be transmitted \"with relative ease\" into sheep, goats, hamsters, squirrel monkeys, raccoons and skunks, according to a 1996 paper by Marsh and two other researchers.\n\n\n\nIn addition, when infected mink brain tissue was injected into two Holstein steers, both animals developed a fatal brain disease within 19 months after exposure. Marsh did not label the ailment mad cow disease, calling it only a fatal spongiform encephalopathy.\n\n\n\nThe species barrier, though formidable, was not impenetrable.\n\n\n\nMoreover, recent research suggests that prion diseases adapt over time, becoming more virulent and shortening incubation periods.\n\nLast year, scientists at the National Institutes of Health described a series of experiments in which they injected mice with a strain of a hamster prion disease. Although the mice never got sick, it turned out that the prions persisted in the mice for years at undetectable levels.\n\n\n\nWhen researchers injected brain tissue from the mice back into healthy hamsters, all of the hamsters got sick. In addition, when brain tissue from the first group of mice was injected into more groups of mice, the disease grew more virulent and began making the mice sick.\n\n\n\nIt was as though the prions learned how to deal with a new species, said Richard Race, an NIH researcher.\n\n\n\n\"It replicated faster in additional rounds of mice and even became more lethal to them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe NIH researchers warned that prion disease may be more common than originally thought. And they said the research raised public health concerns about the practice of giving other farm animals — not just cows — feed made from the byproducts of other animals.\n\n\n\nThose experiments and others now raise questions about whether chronic wasting disease can jump, not just to dairy cattle, but to wild animals such as raccoons, skunks, possums and feral cats.\n\n'It's naive to think we can get rid of it'\n\nComplicating matters further, the prions that cause chronic wasting may persist in the environment for years.\n\n\n\nAs the centerpiece of its effort to eradicate the disease from Wisconsin deer, the state Department of Natural Resources plans to have an estimated 25,000 deer killed in a zone southwest of Madison where the disease was first detected. But even that may not be enough, given the ability of prions to remain infectious for years in the ground.\n\n\n\n\"You can go into Sauk County and kill every deer there and when the deer come back, they are going to be infected,\" said Robert Petersen, a Wisconsin native and prion expert at the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center in Cleveland. \"It's naive to think we can get rid of it.\"\n\n\n\nIn a 1991 experiment, NIH scientists mixed brain material from scrapie-infected hamsters with soil, packed it in perforated petri dishes, placed those in soil-filled clay pots and buried the pots in the ground.\n\n\n\nWhen the pots were dug up three years later, the prions were still strong enough to infect other animals.\n\n\n\nThe researchers suggested halting the practice of plowing under the carcasses of animals that have died of scrapie or mad cow disease or using those carcasses in fertilizer.\n\n\n\nIn Iceland, where there have been scrapie outbreaks, pastures grazed by scrapie-infected sheep were left vacant for several years. When new sheep were brought in from flocks believed to be scrapie-free, the disease reappeared, according to a 1992 U.S. Department of Agriculture review paper.\n\n\n\nThe deer pens in Fort Collins experienced a similar phenomenon — a new generation of sick elk — despite efforts to purge the soil of deadly prions.\n\nPart of the concern is that animals may consume contaminated soil. Cattle, for instance, can consume more than two pounds of soil a day while grazing.\n\n\n\nAnother possibility: Prions in the soil could be absorbed by plants and worms that animals might consume.\n\n\n\n\"I think that's a legitimate concern,\" said Joel Pedersen, an assistant professor of soil biochemistry and environmental toxicology at UW-Madison.\n\n\n\nPedersen is hoping to get a federal grant to study how scrapie and chronic wasting disease prions react with various soil components.\n\n\n\n\"Clearly, the more deer that get infected and die out there, the more of a problem there will be,\" Aiken said.\n\nThe next step\n\nBy the end of this month, researchers at the USDA hope to begin what might be described as the ultimate Wisconsin chronic wasting disease experiment: injecting brain tissue from diseased white-tailed deer into dairy cattle.\n\n\n\nSo far, chronic wasting disease has not been found to naturally infect cows — in a five-year experiment by Williams, now at the University of Wyoming, cows have lived near infected deer, and none of the cows have gotten sick.\n\n\n\nBut other experiments involving mule deer and beef cattle suggest cattle may be susceptible.\n\n\n\nIn one, tissue from the diseased brains of mule deer was injected into the brains of a type of Angus beef cow.\n\n\n\nOf the 13 that were inoculated nearly five years ago, four have developed a prion disease.\n\n\n\nBut the concern for Wisconsin is white-tailed deer, not mule deer.\n\n\n\nTest tube studies show that prions from white-tailed deer can induce changes in the normal brain protein of several other animals, including elk, mule deer, and to a lesser extent, sheep and cattle.\n\n\n\nIn Ames, scientists are taking the next step.\n\n\n\nTwenty Jersey calves will be brought into pens, where a ventilation system will filter out bacteria and a special drainage system will allow fluids and animal waste to be collected and steam-heated to at least weaken any prions.\n\n\n\nThe young cattle brought there will spend their lives standing on a concrete floor in a pen with concrete walls and steel bars.\n\n\n\n\"We aren't allowed to put them outside,\" said Janice Miller, a USDA veterinarian who will be in charge of the experiment.\n\n\n\nEach calf will be injected with a concoction that includes 10% diseased brain tissue from Wisconsin white-tailed deer and 90% saline. Each animal will receive about one-tenth of a gram of brain tissue.\n\n\n\nNext year, USDA researchers plan similar experiments with white-tailed deer and pigs and sheep.\n\n\n\nIt may take several years before the final results of the dairy cattle experiment are known.\n\n\n\nBased on previous research, Miller said, she believes it will be very difficult for chronic wasting disease to naturally jump to dairy cattle.\n\n\n\nBut, she added: \"There is no way you can say 'no risk.' The way the research is piling up, I think you can say 'low.' In two years or three years or four years or five years we'll have some results.\n\n\n\n\"I've learned not to make predictions because I always get surprised.\"\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/climate-change/2021/08/23/fact-check-kansas-senator-mike-thompson-claims-climate-change-nazi-propaganda/8212554002/", "title": "Science a 'weapon,' Kansas Sen. Mike Thompson says. Climate ...", "text": "Do humans and carbon dioxide have no effect on climate change? Is science being weaponized, and are scientists comparable to Nazi propagandists?\n\nThat's what one politician told the Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Association during its annual convention in Wichita last week. Sen. Mike Thompson, a Republican from Shawnee, is the chair of the Senate utilities committee. He is also a retired meteorologist.\n\nThe convention was held one week after the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report was released. International officials referred to its findings as a \"code red for humanity.\"\n\nMore:'Code red for humanity': UN report gives stark warning on climate change, says wild weather events will worsen\n\nFollowing are eight claims Thompson made during a seminar on \"The Weaponization of Climate Science\" — and what the climate experts at the University of Kansas contacted by The Topeka Capital-Journal had to say in response.\n\nDo humans have 'zero control' over climate change?\n\nThompson: \"Climate change has been happening since Earth has been around naturally, natural cycles, with stuff that's more powerful than anything humans can do. And so it's pure hubris to think that we should be spending billions of dollars — or now trillions of dollars — on mitigating climate change for something we have zero control over. And that includes trying to change our energy policy to fit that by going more green, with the renewables, which are not reliable.\"\n\nKees Van der Veen (Department of Geography & Atmospheric Science professor): \"As reported in the IPCC Report, we cannot explain recent temperature trends (i.e. over the last century or so) without taking into account the warming effect from anthropogenically produced carbon dioxide. That is, natural processes (volcanos, solar activity, etc) are not enough to explain the recent warming trend. See Figure TS.7 in the Technical Summary of the WGI IPCC Report that was just published.\"\n\nMore:Kansas senator compares climate change message to Nazi propaganda. Here's what else was said at oil convention.\n\nDoes burning fossil fuels and increasing carbon dioxide affect climate change?\n\nThompson: \"We can burn fossil fuels. We can put things into the environment that might change the environment, but it's not going to change the climate. Reducing CO2 will have nothing to do with changing the climate on this planet. ... CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but it's a very tiny one. Water vapor does 95% of the stabilization of the temperature of this planet. ... With carbon dioxide right now, we could double, triple quadruple the amount of CO2, it is not going to change the amount of warming on this planet or the temperature on this planet at all.\"\n\nVan der Veen: \"Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide: any hydrocarbon source (fossil fuel) plus oxygen produces carbon dioxide and water, plus a lot of energy that we as society use. This is a straight-forward chemical reaction.\n\n\"It has been known since the 19th century that CO2 is a greenhouse gas (from laboratory experiments conducted at the time). No one denies this and every introductory textbook will tell you that conditions on Earth are favorable for life as we know it exactly because of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Compare conditions on Mars (no atmosphere to speak of) and Venus (atmosphere consisting of 96% carbon dioxide). If we look over the last million years, temperature variations corresponding with glacial cycles are linked with similar variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Water vapor is indeed a strong greenhouse gas that is likely to amplify warming brought about by carbon dioxide — this is called a positive feedback in the climate system.\"\n\nDoes green and renewable energy work, and is it reliable?\n\nThompson: \"The renewables, which are not reliable. Green energy, which doesn't work. ... And of course, it's green, but it kills the birds. And, of course, it's full of all sorts of toxic materials. And then during the course of a winter outbreak ... look what provided the energy, it was oil and it was gas, and it was coal.\"\n\nShannon O'Lear (director of the Environmental Studies Program and a Department of Geography & Atmospheric Science professor): \"The fossil fuel based infrastructure on which much of the world relies would not be possible without considerable and sustained government subsidies and support of large corporations. What could it look like if renewable energy received the same amount of support and protection? Energy storage solutions mean that wind power can still be effective even if the wind is not blowing right now. Granted, expanding renewable energy will require a new business model, because key inputs such as wind and solar radiation are freely available, do not require international trade agreements, and do not generate waste that requires additional problem solving.\"\n\nVan der Veen: \"One might want to expand one's view to other countries, such as Germany and elsewhere in Europe where 'green energy' plays a greater role in society and increasingly replaces fossil fuels as energy source.\"\n\nIs becoming net carbon neutral by 2050 possible?\n\nThompson: \"BP, Exxon Mobil, they all put the promos on Sunday morning, they have the windmills and everything. They say they're gonna go net carbon neutral by 2050, or whatever year it is. It's impossible to do, it's virtually impossible to do. And a lot of it has to do with these ESG standards, because they are being forced into these ESG standards by financial institutions. ... it's a complete distortion of our economy.\"\n\nVan der Veen: \"Where there is (political) will there is a way — who would have imagined the Internet only three decades ago or the phenomenal growth in online retail, spurred on by Amazon? — just to name one example of rapid societal changes occurring despite naysayers stating it could not be done.\"\n\nDoes global warming exist, and can it kill people?\n\nThompson: \"Science has just become a weapon. So we basically turned real science into we're all gonna die in 12 years, OK. And unfortunately, this is the culmination of the dumbing down of America. People buy this stuff. They hear it on the news. They think global warming is real. We're all gonna die.\"\n\nVan der Veen: \"Strawman argument – no credible scientist will say that we are all going to die, let alone in 12 years! But one has only to look around to see impacts of warming already happening, be it more frequent storms, tornados and landslides brought on by wildfires or clear-day flooding in Miami.\n\n\"It would be wise for politicians and other officials to read the actual IPCC Reports — or at least the appropriately titled 'Summary for Policy Makers.' These Reports are a far cry from the sensationalist headlines or sound bites that Senator Thompson apparently attributes to science.\"\n\nAre mitigation strategies, such as carbon sequestration, a waste of money?\n\nThompson: \"From the climate mitigation standpoint, there really, like I said, if you look, there really isn't much we can do. We could spend money, but it would be fruitless. The climate is going to change on its own. … Bottom line is, there's nothing we can do to change the climate. Nothing at all.\n\n\"CO2 sequestration sounds like the dumbest idea I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nVan der Veen: \"I agree that CO2 sequestration, or any other proposed geo-engineering 'solution' is not a real or permanent solution and mostly a waste of money (and energy!!)\"\n\nWould more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere be good for agriculture?\n\nThompson: \"If you do some studies on carbon dioxide, plants thrive at high levels of CO2. ... In fact, there was a Harvard study that showed plants are hardier, more drought resistant, produce more crops at about 1200 parts per million — three times what we have in the atmosphere right now. So it's actually beneficial to have more CO2. And since we've seen higher levels of CO2, we've seen a greening of the planet. We've seen a lot more forestation we've seen a lot more green, which counteracts any potential warming that we have.\"\n\nO'Lear: \"Although plants may grow larger leaves with increased levels of CO2, the nutrient quality in those plants becomes diluted and causes knock down effects throughout the foodchain. Research at Kansas State University has demonstrated this point and why it is a concern both for agriculture and for ecosystem resilience. For instance, lowering the nutritional value of biomass could lead to a decline in some species of grasshoppers only to contribute to swarms of other species of grasshoppers that could damage crops. Beyond grasshoppers, other species and types of animals could be negatively affected.\"\n\nMore:Tallgrass of the Kansas prairie is changing along with the climate. It's now grasshopper-killing junk food.\n\nIs messaging on climate change comparable to Nazi propaganda?\n\nThompson: \"Why are we spending billions and billions of dollars subsidizing an energy source that we cannot rely on when we absolutely need it. It's just basically because of propaganda. And you go back to the Nazi era, this guy Edward Bernays actually helped Woodrow Wilson institute, he helped some big tobacco companies institute smoking in America, promote smoking. And basically he said, you know, you tell a lie big enough, you keep telling it, eventually it becomes true. That's what's happening in America today. And Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, actually studied Bernays, because he knew it worked. He saw that it worked.\n\n\"And of course, if you control the language, you control the narrative. And what has happened since we started on this global warming or climate change path, is that ... they have controlled the language.\"\n\nO'Lear: In response to the comments on energy subsidies: \"This point is true for fossil fuels in our current, deeply networked system. Case in point: the recent cyber attack on the Colonial Pipeline and the resulting gas shortages on the East coast.\"\n\nMore:Colonial Pipeline reportedly pays $5M in cryptocurrency to hackers to end ransomware cyberattack\n\nVan der Veen: \"Or think back to the last hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast and disrupting energy supplies and following temporary shortages and price hikes.\n\n\"It is interesting that Senator Thompson brings up Edward Bernays and his influence on advertising. As documented extensively by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway in their book 'Merchants of Doubt' many of the strategies developed by Bernays and the advertising agency Hill and Knowlton originally for the tobacco industry, were later used by the fossil fuel lobby to discredit or deny the reality of climate change cause by humans burning fossil fuels.\n\n\"And one could argue that some continue to deploy these tactics to discredit or deny climate change.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/22/2020-predictions-decades-ago-self-driving-cars-mars-voting/2594825001/", "title": "2020 predictions from decades ago: Self-driving cars, Mars, voting", "text": "Jetpacks, disintegrator rays, nuclear energy, Mars.\n\nDecades ago, academics, futurists and government agencies cast their predictions of what would happen by the year 2020. Would submarines reach historic depths? Who would lead nations, and which ones would be global superpowers? Would Planet Earth even exist as we knew it?\n\n\"I shall not be surprised if on my 92nd birthday I am able to go for a ride in an antigravity car,\" mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan wrote in 1968.\n\nSome, like Brennan, were overly optimistic. Others were spot-on. Here's what happened, what didn't and what was just plain crazy.\n\n1. Life expectancy will rise past 100\n\nFuturist Ray Kurzweil predicted in 1999 that human life expectancy would rise to \"over one hundred\" by 2019.\n\n\"Computerized health monitors built into watches, jewelry, and clothing which diagnose both acute and chronic health conditions are widely used. In addition to diagnosis, these monitors provide a range of remedial recommendations and interventions,\" he wrote in \"The Age of Spiritual Machines.\"\n\nNope: While Kurzweil may have accurately predicted health-related gadgets (such as fitness watches, BioScarves and EKG apps for your smartphone), he jumped the gun on life expectancy.\n\nIn 2019, the average life expectancy of the global population was 72.6 years, according to the United Nations. That average is slightly higher in the USA, at 78.6 years in 2017, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThough life expectancy in many industrialized nations continues to inch up, it has been going in the opposite direction in America. The United Nation predicts the average global life expectancy to rise to 77.1 years by 2050.\n\nLife expectancy:What countries have the longest?\n\n2. Computers will be invisible\n\nKurzweil had several other prophecies for the year 2019, including invisible computers.\n\n\"Computers are now largely invisible. They are embedded everywhere – in walls, tables, chairs, desks, clothing jewelry and bodies. People routinely use three-dimensional displays built into their glasses or contact lenses. ... This display technology projects images directly into the human retina.\"\n\nKeyboards and cables would become rare, he said.\n\nIt's true: Computers are embedded everywhere these days. We have smart homes, smart tables, smart chairs, smart desks and more. Though we may not project images directly into our retinas, Google Glass comes pretty close.\n\n(Per Kurzweil's prediction, scientists are developing smart contact lenses capable of monitoring the physiological information of the eye and tear fluid that could provide \"real-time, noninvasive medical diagnostics.\" Several groups are testing smart lenses that would measure glucose levels in the tears of people with diabetes.)\n\n3. Books will be dead\n\n\"Paper books and documents are rarely used or accessed. Most twentieth-century paper documents of interest have been scanned and are available through the wireless network,\" Kurzweil predicted.\n\nWrong: Though the net revenue of the U.S. book publishing industry has decreased since 2014, the industry still sold 675 million print books and brought in nearly $26 billion in 2018, according to the Association of American Publishers' annual report.\n\n4. Your every move will be tracked\n\nKurzweil predicted that privacy would be a huge political and social issue and that \"each individual’s practically every move (will be) stored in a database somewhere.\"\n\nTrue, most say: Your TV watches you. Your smartphone follows you. Your web browser traces your digital trail. In an era when some populations worldwide live under 24/7 high-tech surveillance, most U.S. adults say they do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government, according to a survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center.\n\nMore than 80% say the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits.\n\n5. World's population will reach 8 billion\n\nIn 1994, the International Food Policy Research Institute projected the world population would increase by 2.5 billion to reach 8 billion by 2020. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the continent of Africa would add 1.5 billion people, the institute predicted.\n\nClose, but no cigar: The world's population is 7.7 billion, according to a report in June from the United Nations. The report expects the population to grow by 2 billion in the next 30 years. Around 2027, India is projected to overtake China as the world’s most populous country, the report says.\n\n6. China will be the world's largest economy\n\nSpeaking of China... in a 1997 article titled \"The Long Boom,\" futurists Peter Schwartz and Peter Leyden said China would be on top.\n\n\"By 2020, the Chinese economy has grown to be the largest in the world. Though the U.S. economy is more technologically sophisticated, and its population more affluent, China and the United States are basically on a par,\" they said.\n\nClose: In 2019, China still trailed the United States as the world's second-largest economy, by nominal GDP. Recent reports predict that China and India will overtake the United States by 2030.\n\n7. We'll have self-driving cars\n\n\"Self driving cars are being experimented with in the late 1990s, with implementation on majors highways feasible during the first decade of the twenty-first century,\" Kurzweil wrote.\n\nKind of: Dozens of companies – including Tesla, Google spinoff Waymo and ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft – are testing self-driving vehicles in select locations, such as Boston, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWidespread use of a truly autonomous vehicle is not yet here: Experts say it might still be decades before we see a car that can drive anywhere it pleases.\n\nSelf-driving shuttle:Why a Rhode Island police officer pulled it over\n\nIn April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would have fully self-driving cars ready by the end of the year and a \"robotaxi\" version – one that could ferry passengers without anyone behind the wheel – ready for the streets next year. Tesla owners can \"summon\" their cars, which can drive themselves from parking spots to the curb, where the owner is standing.\n\nWhat about flying cars? Porsche and Boeing partnered to create \"premium urban air mobility vehicles,\" and Uber plans to launch a flying taxi service in 2023.\n\n(Planes are landing themselves.)\n\n8. It will be normal to retire at 70\n\nIn his 1994 book \"The World in 2020,\" British commentator and editor Hamish McRae foresaw retirement ages reaching 67 to 70.\n\n\"The main motive for this in Europe is cost to the state. Governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised, the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them,\" McRae wrote.\n\nNo: In the USA, the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women, according to the Center for Retirement Research. That number has stayed relatively steady for men over the past few decades but has increased for women. For full Social Security benefits, the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born.\n\nSome European countries set 67 as retirement age, the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions, and several plan to raise the age in the next few years, according to the Finnish Center for Pensions. For many Europeans, the topic is a matter of fierce debate.\n\n9. Americans will vote electronically from home\n\nAs the millennial generation comes of age, they'll be able to vote electronically from home, Schwartz and Leyden predicted – possibly as soon as the presidential election of 2008.\n\nNot yet: Amid fears of foreign interference in U.S. elections, lawmakers aren't about to let you vote in next year's presidential election on your iPhone. Proponents of online voting say it could improve turnout and prevent voter suppression at polling stations.\n\nStartups are developing solutions for online voting, such as the Voatz mobile voting platform, which has used biometric/facial recognition in at least four public election pilots in the USA. Last year, West Virginia began using Voatz for absentee voting for military personnel stationed overseas. In one Utah county, citizens with a disability were able to vote electronically on their smartphones in a 2019 municipal general election.\n\n10. China will be on a path to democracy\n\nSchwartz and Leyden predicted that, despite taking \"draconian measures\" to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century, China \"is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics – though not in the image of the West.\"\n\nNot really: China faces scrutiny over human rights abuses against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and against nearly 1 million Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim population, members of which have been arbitrarily detained and imprisoned in \"reeducation\" camps in China's Xinjiang region.\n\n11. We'll have 'personal companions'\n\nIn his 1999 book, \"Business @ the Speed of Thought,\" Bill Gates predicted personal devices that \"connect and sync all your devices in a smart way, whether they are at home or in the office, and allow them to exchange data.\"\n\n\"The device will check your email or notifications, and present the information that you need. When you go to the store, you can tell it what recipes you want to prepare, and it will generate a list of ingredients that you need to pick up. It will inform all the devices that you use of your purchases and schedule, allowing them to automatically adjust to what you're doing,\" Gates wrote.\n\nHey, Alexa: Add milk to my shopping list.\n\nThough Alexa isn't sorting through your emails (that we know of) and your smart thermostat isn't tracking your purchases, Gates isn't far off. Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and an array of smart tech in the Internet of Things readily exchange data with your other devices and respond to commands.\n\n12. Cars will be able to go months without refueling\n\nSchwartz and Leyden predicted that by 2010, \"hydrogen would be processed in refinery-like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles – and many months – before refueling.\"\n\nBy 2020, they said, almost all new cars would be hybrid vehicles, mostly using hydrogen power.\n\nWhat's the future of the auto industry? Hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric\n\nNot yet: Toyota and Honda lead the hydrogen-powered car market, but it's an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery-powered electric vehicles. In 2018, 2,300 hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles were sold in the USA – less than 1% of the number of electric cars sold, according to InsideEVs, which covers electric vehicle news.\n\nIn other green transportation news: Last year, European railway manufacturer Alstom launched the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train, and next year, London is likely to roll out double-decker hydrogen-powered buses.\n\n13. Heart disease, depression will be world's top diseases\n\nIn 1996, the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Health Organization predicted that by 2020, the world's top two causes of the global burden of disease – a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost because of sickness, disability or early death – would be ischemic (coronary) heart disease and unipolar major (clinical) depression.\n\nAt the time, the leading causes were lower respiratory infections (such as pneumonia) and diarrheal diseases, the study said.\n\nClose: In 2017, the most recent year that the data set was published, the five leading causes of the global burden of disease were neonatal disorders, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n14. Global surface temperature will increase\n\n(Climate predictions tend to have a longer range, but here's a snapshot of where 2020 stands.)\n\nA report in 1995 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.\n\nThe report predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year.\n\nOn track: With 80 years to go, both predictions appear possible. The global average temperature has risen a tad more than 1 degree Fahrenheit since the mid-90s, according to NOAA. Since 1992, the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches, according to NOAA.\n\nMore:Were the predictions we made about climate change 20 years ago accurate? Here's a look\n\n15. Humans will set foot on Mars\n\nA report in 1996 by the Space Studies Board of the National Research Council said NASA would launch \"possible human exploratory missions to the moon and Mars within the next quarter century,\" predicting that humans would land on Mars by 2018.\n\nSchwartz and Leyden envisioned a similar scenario: \"In 2020, humans arrive on Mars. ... The four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment. The expedition is a joint effort supported by virtually all nations on the planet, the culmination of a decade and a half of intense focus on a common goal.\"\n\nNot quite: Though we haven't set foot on Mars, we've landed eight unmanned spacecraft on the planet's surface.\n\n16. Boris Johnson would lead Brexit\n\nIn 1997, British news organization The Independent forecast that in 2020, Boris Johnson would become a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, a decision-making body composed of the prime minister and a team of handpicked members of Parliament.\n\nAt the time, Johnson, 32, was an outspoken editor and columnist but had not held public office. \"Not shy in clashing with party lines, Boris would 'renegotiate EU membership so Britain stands to Europe as Canada, not Texas, stands to the USA,' \" the journalists wrote.\n\nPretty close: Have you heard of Brexit? Johnson became prime minister in July. He served in the Cabinet, starting in 2016 as foreign secretary under Theresa May. In December, Johnson led his Conservative Party to victory in a national election on the promise to \"get Brexit done.\"\n\n17. Antigravity belts will revolutionize warfare\n\nImagine a world where battles are fought a few feet above the ground, as soldiers hover in midair. In 1968, mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan predicted that antigravity belts would \"revolutionize the tactics of land warfare,\" writing that \"even if the antigravity mechanism did not itself provide horizontal propulsion, relatively modest sources of thrust could easily be provided.\"\n\nHe suspected that by 2018, humans would have antigravity cars and jetpacks capable of operating for 30 minutes.\n\nNo: (Unless you're Luke Skywalker or Buzz Lightyear.)\n\n18. Nuclear will replace natural gas\n\nIn 1968, Stanford University professor Charles Scarlott predicted that nuclear breeder reactors would make up the majority of U.S. energy production by 2018 as natural gas faded.\n\n\"Energy from water power, solar radiation, the wind, tides, or earth heat will not figure large in the totals. Power from nuclear power plants should be available in large amounts at low cost,\" Scarlott wrote.\n\nWrong: In 2018, fossil fuels – petroleum, natural gas and coal – accounted for about 79% of total U.S. primary energy production in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. About 12% was from renewable energy sources, and about 9% was from nuclear electric power.\n\nFor the electrical power sector, in particular, nuclear creates 19% of energy.\n\n19. Americans will work 26 hours a week\n\nIn 1968, physicist Herman Kahn and futurist Anthony J. Weiner said that by 2020, Americans would work 1,370 hours a year (or 26 hours a week), instead of the 1,940 hours (37 hours a week) that was average at the time.\n\nUnlikely: Though we work less than we did in 1968, the average American worked nearly 1,800 hours in 2018 (35 hours a week), according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\n20. Nationalism will wane\n\nIn 1968, Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicted that better communication, easier translation and greater understanding of the nature of human motivations would make it easier for people to connect across ethnic and national lines.\n\n\"By the year 2018 nationalism should be a waning force in the world,\" he wrote.\n\nThe opposite is true: Fueled by backlash against immigration, globalization and the political establishment, populist nationalism was a driving force behind Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and the rise of right-wing politicians in France, Austria, Italy, Hungary and Poland, among other countries, academics said.\n\n\"Everywhere one looks, in fact, one sees nationalism at work in today’s world,\" Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, wrote in Foreign Policy Magazine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/957109/do-polar-bears-no-longer-need-saving", "title": "Do polar bears no longer need saving? | The Week UK", "text": "“Save the polar bears” has long been a mantra among the climate-conscious. But a new study has suggested that the Arctic mammals might not need our help quite as much as we once thought.\n\nA team of researchers has discovered a unique population of polar bears who are surviving in southeast Greenland despite a lack of sea ice. They live in a region that is ice-free for more than 250 days a year, mimicking the conditions predicted for the rest of the Arctic by the end of the 21st century.\n\nThe fjords they call home should be “unlivable for polar bears”, said Scientific American, “but the southeastern bears seem to be managing surprisingly well without the sea ice”.\n\nThe team’s findings, published in the journal Science, provided “a glimpse into how Greenland’s bears may fare under future climate scenarios”, said Kristin Laidre, a polar scientist at the University of Washington who conducted the study.\n\nTeam faced ‘uphill battle’\n\nDealing with “volatile weather, a harsh coastline, almost no human settlements, and no spots for fuel or food”, Laidre and her team faced an uphill battle in southeast Greenland, said The Atlantic.\n\nBut they were able to collect enough data, including tissue samples, to find that the newly discovered bears had adapted to dwindling sea ice levels by hunting seals using chunks of freshwater ice broken off from Greenland’s glaciers, rather than sea ice.\n\n“We wanted to survey this region because we didn’t know much about the polar bears in Southeast Greenland, but we never expected to find a new subpopulation living there,” said Laidre. “We knew there were some bears in the area… we just didn’t know how special they were.”\n\nOffers ‘possibility of survival’\n\nThe study offers a “possibility that pockets of the species might survive despite rising temperatures”, said BBC News. It also answers one of the “big questions” asked by scientists: where will polar bears be able to “hang on” once the rest of the Arctic becomes uninhabitable?\n\nBut, said Laidre in an interview with The Atlantic, this doesn’t mean that polar bears are saved. “Like the Wrangel mammoths, they might outlast others of their kind, but they won’t hold out forever. Perhaps Southeast Greenland is simply the place where the polar-bear endling will live out its species’ final days.”\n\nAnd although the study does offer a “glimmer of hope” for the future of some polar bears, it’s important to remember that habitats like southeast Greenland are “rare and likely to change with global heating”, said The Guardian.\n\nGlaciers are subject to climate change and have been in retreat in recent years, with the ones in southeast Greenland no exception.\n\nLack of genetic diversity\n\nAs the bears are so isolated – and have been for “several hundred years” – they face further problems.\n\n“Occasionally, there’s an immigrant that comes in and adds genetic diversity to the group,” said Laidre. “But because they are so geographically isolated, they don’t have a lot of genetic input from other polar bears from other parts of the Arctic.”\n\nInbreeding can prove dangerous over time and riddle the bears “with genetic problems”, added The Atlantic.\n\nThey are ‘not thriving’\n\nAlthough these bears are \"living at the edge of what we believe to be physiologically possible”, they “are not thriving”, said study co-author Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary molecular biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nThanks to slow reproduction rates and a small population of just several hundred, as well as glaciers being in retreat pretty much everywhere in Greenland, the long-term survival of this subpopulation of polar bears feels “highly unlikely”, Andrew Derocher, a researcher at the University of Alberta, told The Atlantic.\n\nWith just 26,000 individual polar bears left in the world, the best hope for the species is “strong action to limit human-caused climate change”, said Laidre.", "authors": ["Amrita Gill"], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/energy/2016/08/17/how-many-birds-killed-solar-farms/88868372/", "title": "How many birds are killed by solar farms?", "text": "Sammy Roth\n\nThe Desert Sun\n\nDuring a meeting at Palm Springs City Hall in June, public commenters tore into the Palen solar farm, which would be built on 4,200 acres of public land just south of Joshua Tree National Park.\n\nOne of their main complaints: The vast field of solar panels — which would generate enough electricity to power 230,000 average California homes, according to its developer — would kill birds.\n\n\"We do know that (solar) photovoltaic projects kill birds, especially ones in these Colorado River flyways. There are a lot of numbers now available from Desert Sunlight, Blythe, McCoy,\" said Kevin Emmerich, co-founder of the environmental group Basin and Range Watch, referring to large solar farms already operating in Riverside County. \"I believe the California numbers — there are up to 183 species of birds killed on these solar projects, and over 3,500 individuals. And those are just what's reported.\"\n\nTHE CURRENT: Sign up for The Desert Sun's energy and water newsletter\n\nMore: California adopts requirement for every public bus in the state to be zero-emission by 2040\n\nMore: This Mexican city was transformed by factories. Its people pay a heavy price\n\nIt's a common refrain from desert environmentalists: Solar farms might help limit the carbon emissions responsible for climate change, but they're harming delicate ecosystems and species, from desert tortoises and bighorn sheep to certain migratory birds. Many conservationists have argued that state and federal officials should prioritize rooftop solar panels over large-scale power plants.\n\nBut at least when it comes to birds, those broad criticisms belie a more nuanced reality.\n\nYes, birds have died at solar farms — most famously at the Ivanpah project in San Bernardino County, where birds have been incinerated as they fly through the \"solar flux\" reflected by fields of mirrors toward boilers atop three massive towers. But Ivanpah's tower-and-mirror setup is the exception, not the rule. Only two big tower projects have been built in the United States, and it's unclear whether there will be more, in part due to the technology's high costs. Most solar farms use photovoltaic panels like the ones installed on many rooftops, which convert sunlight directly to electricity.\n\nAnd the impact of those facilities on birds is still mostly unknown, according to academic experts, industry officials and leading bird conservationists. Yes, birds have died at solar photovoltaic projects, some of them from crashing into panels or other infrastructure. But there's hardly any science examining how many birds deaths are caused solar farms, and what can be done to stop it.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot that can be said with any certainty right now,\" said Lee Walston, an environmental scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, a federal funded lab operated by the University of Chicago.\n\nWalston was the lead author of a study last year reviewing what little information there is about bird deaths at solar farms. The study noted that avian fatality data was available for just seven large-scale solar plants in the United States, four of which had conducted systematic monitoring for bird carcasses. Only three of the seven projects used solar photovoltaic panels, also known as PV panels.\n\nOne PV project that has reported mortality data is Desert Sunlight, a 550-megawatt power plant in eastern Riverside County that was the largest solar project in the world when it opened. A contractor for the project says it documented 173 bird deaths during construction, from August 2011 through December 2014, although it didn't conduct systematic monitoring.\n\nREAD MORE: Counting up bird deaths at desert solar plants\n\nThomas Dietsch, a migratory bird biologist at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in a presentation earlier this year that 3,545 bird deaths had been reported at seven Southern California solar farms, including Ivanpah, from 2012 through April 2016. Those deaths spanned at least 183 species, including three species listed as endangered or threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act: Ridgway's rail, willow flycatcher and yellow-billed cuckoo.\n\nBut it's hard to know how accurate or complete those figures are. Most of the monitoring has been done by consultants hired by project owners, and there are no consistent guidelines for how to scour solar plants for dead birds. It's difficult to estimate the overall number of deaths based on the number of birds actually found, in part because scavengers sometimes make off with bird carcasses.\n\n\n\nThose factors could mean the reported numbers are lowball estimates. At the same time, it's unclear how many of the birds deaths have actually been caused by solar panels and other electrical infrastructure. Bird experts say we don't know much about \"background mortality\" rates in the desert — the number of birds that might die at project locations even in the absence of solar panels.\n\n\"There's valuable data (on bird deaths at solar farms). The problem is, most of this is gray literature. It's not peer-reviewed,\" said Thomas Smith, director of the Center for Tropical Research at UCLA. \"You get into a real problem using not-peer-reviewed material in making decisions.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Lawsuit over bird deaths at solar plants\n\nIndustry officials and environmentalists are trying to get better data. Last year they formed the Avian-Solar Work Group, which includes First Solar, NextEra Energy Resources, Audubon California and Defenders of Wildlife, among others. The group organized a team of scientists, led by Smith, to develop a rigorous scientific plan for studying the relationship between solar farms and birds.\n\nThe group is finalizing that plan and intends to seek funding for specific research projects, said Danielle Mills, senior policy advisor for the Large-scale Solar Association, a California trade group.\n\n\"All of the organizations that are participating in the (work group) have an interest in developing renewable energy to combat climate change,\" Mills said. \"At the same time, we don't want that to have negative impacts on populations of birds. It's those two goals that are really driving the work.\"\n\nAmong the topics the group hopes to learn more about: The \"lake effect\" theory, which posits that waterbirds might crash into solar panels after confusing them with lakes. Critics of Palen and other solar farms have pointed to the alleged lake effect as a major cause for concern, but experts say it isn't yet a proven phenomenon — it's still a theory, based on incidental observations.\n\nThe Argonne report said water-dependent species accounted for 46 percent of known bird deaths at Desert Sunlight, but less than half a percent of known bird deaths at the California Valley Solar Ranch, a 250-megawatt PV project in San Luis Obispo County.\n\nA field of solar panels \"may look like a lake to a human being, but we don’t know what it looks like to a bird,\" Smith said. \"There needs to be more information collected on waterbirds found in these facilities, and not just what birds are found there, but what are the potential impacts on populations of those birds.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Critics slam Palen solar farm at Palm Springs City Hall\n\nOther key research questions revolve around the Pacific Flyway, a vast migratory bird route that stretches from Alaska to South America, passing through California. At least a billion birds travel along the route each year, according to the Audubon Society.\n\nSome critics of big solar point to the desert's location along the Pacific Flyway as a cause for concern, but the reality is more complicated. The term \"Pacific Flyway\" doesn't refer to one specific route, experts say, but rather a broad swath of of geographic real estate that encompasses many narrower pathways used by various bird species.\n\nThe impact of desert solar farms on migratory birds needs to be understood at the level of specific species and specific project sites, Smith said. If you want to know how a proposed solar farm might harm migratory birds, he said, you need to know which bird populations might pass near the project site during their migrations, and what kinds of threats those populations already face.\n\nFunded by grants from the California Energy Commission and the developer First Solar, among others, Smith is using cutting-edge genomic techniques to map out migration routes, stopovers and breeding and wintering locations for 10 bird species. Eventually, he hopes to cover 100 species. That information could help developers and government officials determine the best places to build solar farms in the desert while minimizing bird deaths.\n\n\"It's very cool,\" said Garry George, renewable energy director for Audubon California. \"This work can be applied to lots of things. It's just that it's kicked off by these questions around the solar industry.\"\n\nGovernment agencies are trying to boost their understanding of solar-bird impacts, too. State and federal officials formed the Multiagency Avian-Solar Collaborative Working Group earlier this year, and they're now finalizing a science plan to identify knowledge gaps, with a focus on California, Arizona and Nevada. The group's draft plan, released this month, lists several research needs, including a better understanding of what draws birds to solar farms, clearer monitoring guidelines and a more robust strategy for deciding when avian impacts should be considered significant.\n\nWalston said similar questions have been raised about the wind energy industry over time, leading to more consistent monitoring and efforts to avoid building turbines in sensitive locations.\n\n\"In many ways, solar is where wind was 10 or 15 years ago,\" Walston said. \"Over time, we're going to see some monitoring guidelines.\"\n\nThat process will take years. In the meantime, bird deaths have already become a sticking point as federal officials finalize a series of regulations that will help determine the future of renewable energy development in the California desert.\n\nThe Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan would encourage solar and wind development on nearly 400,000 acres of public land across seven counties, while setting aside 5.3 million acres for conservation. Energy companies that want to build in the development zones would still need to comply with hundreds of new conservation rules, some of which are designed to protect birds.\n\nSeveral of those rules have drawn the ire of solar developers, who say the requirements would constrain or possibly eliminate development in the desert. Environmental groups believe the industry is overreacting, or else posturing for a better deal.\n\nREAD MORE: Federal rules could kill solar development, critics say\n\nSome solar proponents say the industry is being unfairly targeted, pointing to the number of bird deaths from other causes as evidence. Scientists have estimated that between 365 million and 988 million birds die from crashing into buildings and windows in the United States each year. Cars are estimated to kill between 89 million and 340 million birds in the United States annually, with fossil fuel power plants responsible for about 14.5 million. A 2013 study found that cats kill between 1.4 billion and 3.7 billion birds in the continental United States each year.\n\nIn another study led by Walston and published earlier year, Argonne researchers estimated that large solar farms are responsible for somewhere between 37,800 and 138,600 bird deaths in the United States each year. Walston cautioned it's an extremely rough estimate, based on the incomplete and not-necessarily-reliable data that exists for three Southern California solar farms.\n\n\"We really have to stress that it's preliminary, and it's only meaningful in one region, the Southwest,\" he said.\n\nSo far, more bird deaths have been reported at Ivanpah than at any other solar farm. A contractor for the project owner estimated in June that 6,185 birds had died at the power-tower plant during its second year of operation, based on 1,068 birds carcasses and 30 injured birds actually being found at the site. The contractor attributed 572 of those confirmed deaths and injuries to known causes, including collisions and \"singeing\" from flying through the intense sunlight reflected by the mirrors. Causes couldn't be determined for the other 526 deaths and injuries, according to the contractor.\n\nREAD MORE: A tough road ahead for solar power towers\n\nWhatever the true impact of solar farms on avian life, many environmentalists say climate change poses a greater threat to birds than industrial solar projects do.\n\nIn a 2014 report, Audubon Society scientists found that 314 North American bird species could lose at least half of their current ranges by 2080 due to global warming. The organization described 126 of those species as “climate endangered,” meaning they're likely to lose at least half of their ranges by 2050 if global warming continues unabated.\n\nAudubon's chief scientist, Gary Langham, has called global warming \"the greatest threat our birds face today.\" The biggest thing people can do to help birds deal with climate change, he told The Desert Sun earlier this year, is to limit the carbon emissions that are causing temperatures to rise. That will involve replacing coal, oil and natural gas with cleaner sources of energy, like solar and wind.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT: The extinction crisis in a warming world\n\nStill, big solar farms shouldn't be given \"free passes\" to kill birds, said George, from Audubon California.\n\n\"I don't think that there will be no utility-scale projects in the future. They’re part of the plan,\" he said. But \"if we're going to have them, we're going to put them in the right places, and understand the impacts, and mitigate effectively for them.\"\n\nSammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun.

Baby alligators have been reported in parking lots on the causeway that crosses Mobile Bay and along heavily traveled U.S. 98 in Daphne, WKRG-TV reports, so the city posted notes on social media asking residents to be careful, particularly with pets. Charles Epler of Wildlife Solutions, an animal removal services, said the sightings likely were linked to the weather. “They get pushed out. That heavy, torrential rain washes them out of where they’re at, and then they’re going to try and find somewhere else to set up shop,” Epler said. Daphne, a city of about 26,000, is located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. “About 83% of their diet in the wild is turtles. I think that’s why there’s so many over here in Daphne,” Epler said.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A bus that people sometimes embarked on deadly pilgrimages to visit can now safely be viewed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks while it undergoes preservation work. The bus was moved to the school’s engineering facility last week while it’s being prepared for outdoor display at the Museum of the North, television station KTVF reports. The abandoned Fairbanks city bus became a shelter for hunters and others using the backcountry near Denali National Park and Preserve, but it was a beacon for those wishing to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless, who hiked to the bus in 1992. The 24-year-old Virginia man died from starvation when he couldn’t hike back out because of the swollen Teklanika River. During his last days he kept a journal that was discovered when his body was found. McCandless’ ordeal was chronicled in Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book “Into the Wild,” followed later by director Sean Penn’s movie of the same name. People from all over the world made the bus a focal point and tried to retrace his steps. The state removed the bus located about 25 miles from the town of Healy after two women from Europe drowned on homages to the bus. There were 15 other search-and-rescue missions since 2009, the state Department of Natural Resources said in August 2020 when the bus was flown out of the wilderness.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Documents and training materials from the Arizona Department of Corrections’ servers contain images of a skull with a sword through it that experts liken to gang and white supremacist symbols. Corrections experts say the designs may offer a window into the mindset of the department’s Special Operations teams, reflecting an us-against-them mentality and members acting out militaristic fantasies, rather than rehabilitating prisoners. PowerPoint presentations featuring the skull and sword emblem also define the imagery. “Skull = Death before dishonor,” a slide says, while the shotguns are “tools of the trade,” and the eyes of the skull, embellished with gun sights, indicate: “We are always watching you.” Set to Guns N’ Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle,” a training video depicts special operations teams responding to riots at the Yuma and Kingman prisons. The video contains graphic images of the aftermath, including zip-tied prisoners, officers using dogs to intimidate prisoners, blood-stained walls and floors, and nonlethal weapons used on inmates. Prisoners alleged special operations officers committed civil rights abuses in the aftermath of the deadly riot at the Yuma prison in March 2018. Thirty-seven people were injured, one prisoner died, and six officers were fired and criminally charged for destroying prisoner property.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday effectively approved a new law that will allow employees to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements, a move by fellow Republicans to challenge federal vaccine mandates. Hutchinson allowed the measure to become law without his signature despite his concerns about the impact it will have on businesses in the state. The new law won’t take effect until early next year. In Arkansas, a bill becomes law after it sits on the governor’s desk for five days without any action. Governors have traditionally used that approach to express opposition to legislation without prompting a veto fight with the Legislature. Hutchinson said the amount of time before the opt-out law takes effect gives the state more time to weigh its impact on businesses and for any court challenges to be filed. But he also called the proposal unnecessary and counterproductive. “The debate on these bills has been harmful to our goal of increasing vaccination rates in Arkansas,” he told reporters. The measure requires employers to allow workers to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements if they’re tested weekly for the coronavirus or can prove they have antibodies. Health officials have said antibody tests should not be used to assess immunity, those who’ve recovered should still get vaccinated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: A wildfire raging through Southern California coastal mountains threatened ranches and rural homes and kept a major highway shut down Wednesday as the fire-scarred state faced a new round of dry winds that raise risk of flames. The Alisal Fire covered more than 22 square miles in the Santa Ynez Mountains west of Santa Barbara, and the number of firefighters was nearly doubled to 1,300, with more on the way. Containment remained at 5%. While the scenic region along the Pacific shoreline is lightly populated, the blaze was a threat to more than 100 homes, ranches and other buildings, fire officials said. Fire crews were protecting Rancho del Cielo, which was once owned by Ronald and Nancy Reagan and was known as the Western White House during his presidency. The 688-acre ranch where Reagan hosted world leaders sits atop the mountain range, above the flames feeding on dense chaparral and grasses. The area hadn’t burned since 1955, according to the conservative youth organization Young America’s Foundation, which now operates the ranch. Crews also protected an Exxon/Mobil gas processing facility in a canyon surrounded by flames. The fire erupted Monday near the Alisal Reservoir and swept down through the mountains, forcing the closure of U.S. 101. At one point, the fire jumped the highway and reached a beach.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado will include gender confirmation care in its individual and small-group health insurance plans, state and federal officials announced Tuesday. The state’s plan under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will include jaw, cheek and eye modifications, face tightening, facial bone remodeling for facial feminization, breast or chest construction and reductions, and laser hair removal. Additional health benefits for Colorado’s plan include an annual mental health exam and expanded coverage of opioid alternatives for pain management, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said. The new plan adds 15 drugs as alternatives and will cover up to six acupuncture visits per year, according to the Colorado Division of Insurance. The changes will go into effect Jan. 1, 2023. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Colorado’s request to provide gender-confirming care as part of the state’s “essential health benefits,” which are requirements for individual and small-employer plans set forth under former the Affordable Care Act. Christy Mallory, legal director at the Williams Institute, a research institute based in the University of California Los Angeles’ School of Law, said without insurance, much of gender-confirming care is “prohibitively expensive,” so Colorado’s move increases access to medically necessary care for trans people.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: President Joe Biden plans to visit the University of Connecticut on Friday for the dedication of a human rights center named after former U.S. Sens. Thomas and Christopher Dodd. The Dodd Center for Human Rights serves as an umbrella home for the school’s human rights programs and archives. Those include the Human Rights Institute, which houses the largest undergraduate and graduate human rights program at a public university in the U.S., and Dodd Impact, which focuses on community-based human rights initiatives. It had been known as the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center since its opening in 1995, named for the late senator who also was a lead prosecutor for the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany, after World War II. UConn’s Board of Trustees voted in August to change the name to the Dodd Center for Human Rights to recognize the work of both Democratic senators and their family. “I’m deeply grateful to UConn for recognizing me and my family by dedicating the Dodd Center for Human Rights, and I’m honored that my good friend President Biden is joining us to mark this occasion,” said former Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, who is Thomas Dodd’s son. He served as a senator from 1981 to 2011, gaining a reputation as a human rights advocate for his work to end abuses in Central America.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Auditor Kathy McGuiness turned herself in to authorities and pleaded not guilty to corruption charges Tuesday morning. Accompanied by her attorney, McGuiness entered the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center just before 10 a.m. to turn herself in to Delaware Capitol Police. Steve Wood, her attorney, told the court in a brief hearing that she pleaded not guilty to the charges, including felony theft and intimidation, as well as public service misdemeanors like official misconduct. The basis of the charges is that she violated conflict-of-interest laws by arranging a job for her daughter and her daughter’s friend in the auditor’s office, that she rigged public payments to a campaign consultant to avoid regulatory scrutiny, and that she sought to spy on and intimidate those who questioned her conduct. McGuiness and Wood opposed prosecutors’ request that she be barred from speaking about the case to her daughter. Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney argued that Elizabeth McGuiness is an “unindicted co-conspirator” and a witness. But “to say to a mother that you may not talk to your young daughter about probably the most traumatic event that has occurred for either of them in their lives is unnecessary and inhumane,” Wood argued to the court. The judge sided with McGuiness’ attorney and denied the request.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Washington National Cathedral formally dedicated a new stone carving of Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in a ceremony Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The carving, completed in April, shows Wiesel’s likeness inside the cathedral’s Human Rights Porch, which features carvings of leading human rights defenders throughout history, including Rosa Parks, Mother Teresa, Jonathan Daniels and Eleanor Roosevelt. The dedication was a collaboration among the cathedral, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. “From surviving the Holocaust to becoming one of the world’s leading lights in preserving the memory of that unspeakable tragedy forevermore, we owe a great debt of gratitude to Elie Wiesel,” Cathedral Dean Randy Hollerith said. “It is an honor to have his memory and his legacy included in our Human Rights Porch so he can serve as a reminder of the consequences of hate, as well as the resiliency and indomitability of the human spirit.” Wednesday’s ceremony featured remarks from former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and author John Meacham, who is canon historian of the cathedral. A survivor of the Auschwitz and Buchenwald camps, Wiesel told his story to millions through his autobiographical novel “Night.”\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: A statue of Black educator Mary McLeod Bethune will be on display for two months in the city before heading to its permanent home in the U.S. Capitol, where it’s replacing a sculpture of a Confederate soldier as one of two statues from the Sunshine State in the building’s National Statuary Hall. The 11-foot marble statue of Bethune, a civil rights leader and adviser to President Franklin Roosevelt, was unveiled Monday at the News-Journal Center in Daytona Beach. The statue depicts Bethune, a founder of Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, wearing a graduation cap and gown and holding a black rose. Early next year, Bethune will become the first Black woman represented in the National Statuary Hall, where each state has two likenesses of prominent native sons and daughters. “The sculpture is a gleaming representation of what is possible with unyielding tenacity and dogged determination,” Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry said. The statue of Bethune replaces one of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. Confederate monuments across the country have fallen in recent years amid contentious debate over whether they are proud monuments to Southern heritage or hated symbols of racism and past slavery.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit alleging fraud in the state’s most populous county during the 2020 election. The suit sought a review of some 147,000 absentee ballots to see if any were illegitimate. Originally filed in December, the lawsuit that alleged evidence of fraudulent ballots and improper ballot counting in Fulton County was filed by nine Georgia voters and spearheaded by Garland Favorito, a longtime critic of the state’s election systems. Henry County Superior Court Chief Judge Brian Amero’s order dismissing the case said the voters who brought the suit “failed to allege a particularized injury” and therefore lacked the standing to claim their state constitutional rights to equal protection and due process had been violated. Amero also noted that Georgia’s Secretary of State’s Office had provided a “substantive and detailed response” to his request for an update on any investigations into allegations of fraudulent or counterfeit ballots in Fulton County. Favorito expressed frustration after the ruling, saying his team had “prepared diligently to show the evidence of our allegations” at a hearing the judge had previously scheduled for Nov. 15. Angered by his narrow loss in a traditionally red state, former President Donald Trump had focused his fury on Georgia and particularly on Fulton County.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state has not experienced a large spike in evictions despite the expiration of state and federal moratoriums meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect renters during the pandemic’s economic downturn. Tracey Wiltgen, executive director of the Mediation Center of the Pacific, said her organization has handled more cases in recent months but not as many as she anticipated, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Between Aug. 7 and Oct. 2, the center opened 565 eviction cases for mediation – fewer than the 1,000-1,500 cases it had expected. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Wiltgen said, the center mediated about 200 eviction cases per month. A state-level moratorium ended Aug. 6. A few weeks later, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal moratorium that was announced by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. David Chee, an attorney who mostly represents landlords, said some cases are being kept out of court because tenants are choosing to leave their units without fighting the eviction. “A lot of tenants have just run away,” Chee said. “So once the moratoriums were done, a lot of tenants, as soon as they figured out their landlords were going to evict them, just simply left.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Tuesday that he wants to use federal coronavirus relief money to increase day care capacity to help alleviate the state’s worker shortage. The Republican governor, in a speech about the future of work that was followed by several questions, said expanding day care could help get more workers back in the workforce. Idaho’s current unemployment rate of 2.9% puts the state back at pre-pandemic levels last seen in early 2020, a span that includes a period of double-digit unemployment as COVID-19 spread and jobs evaporated. But now, many employers can’t find enough workers. “We know part of that is parents who are staying home,” Little said. “We think we can take some one-time money and build some (day care) capacity.” The U.S. Department of Labor has said the national unemployment rate last month dropped from 5.2% to 4.8%. Officials said 194,000 people found work, a tepid number and evidence that the pandemic remained a problem, with many companies struggling to fill millions of open jobs. Idaho has had problems with the coronavirus’ highly contagious delta variant, with the state currently on crisis standards of care due to so many unvaccinated patients filling hospitals. Crisis care standards mean scarce resources such as intensive care beds will be allotted to the patients most likely to survive.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The head of a police union has called on its members to defy the city’s requirement to report their COVID-19 vaccination status by Friday or be placed on unpaid leave. In the video posted online Tuesday and first reported on by the Chicago Sun-Times, Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara vowed to take Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration to court if it tries to enforce the mandate, which requires city workers to report their vaccine status by the end of the workweek. After Friday, unvaccinated workers who won’t submit to semiweekly coronavirus testing will be placed on unpaid leave. Catanzara suggested that if the city does enforce its requirement, and many union members refuse to comply with it, “it’s safe to say that the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50% or less for this weekend coming up.” In the video, Catanzara instructs officers to file for exemptions to receiving the vaccine but not to enter that information into the city’s vaccine portal. He said that although he has made clear his vaccine status, “I do not believe the city has the authority to mandate that to anybody, let alone that information about your medical history.” During a news conference Wednesday, Lightfoot accused Cantazara of spreading false information and dismissed most of his statements as “untrue or patently false.”\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Monroe County officials are buying part of a site dotted with old limestone quarries for a possible tourist destination despite chemical contamination found in the area. The Monroe County Council this past week approve the $370,000 purchase of nearly 30 acres near Bloomington just northwest of the Interstate 69 and Indiana 46 interchange. County leaders have discussed over the past couple years buying about 100 acres of wooded former quarry property with the idea of building trails, exhibits about the limestone industry and an outdoor concert venue. Tests by an Indiana University researcher have found low contamination levels of polychlorinated biphenyls in sections of the quarry site not yet purchased by the county. Several sites around Bloomington contaminated with the toxic industrial chemicals have faced multimillion-dollar cleanups since the 1980s. County Council member Kate Wiltz said the proposed park project could acknowledge the negative impact of industrial pollution on the community while being a tribute to the area’s limestone heritage. “I think that’s a side of parks and public lands that we don’t often promote, but that’s every bit as important reason to purchase and steward the property,” Wiltz said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: With the threat of a United Auto Workers strike looming, Deere & Co. managers told employees at factories across the state not to come in Wednesday. Workers said managers ordered third-shift employees in Waterloo not to report to work at their usual 11 p.m. start time. Employees at the company’s Ankeny and Ottumwa plants said Deere also canceled their second shifts. Employees are working under a contract that expires Friday, but the UAW told Deere that its 10,100 members will go on strike Thursday morning if the two sides cannot reach a tentative agreement. Workers have not gone on strike against Deere since 1986. UAW International spokesperson Brian Rothenberg said Wednesday that his team was looking into reports of temporary layoffs. “We’ve gotten no formal notification about anything,” he said. In addition to plants in Ankeny, Ottumwa and Waterloo, the UAW represents Deere workers in Davenport and Dubuque, as well as in Illinois and Kansas. The Waterloo plant, with about 3,000 members, is Deere’s largest. On Sunday, UAW members overwhelmingly rejected a proposed six-year contract with Deere that would have raised wages and bolstered current employees’ retirement payments while ending traditional pensions for new hires, who would participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has passed an ordinance aimed at banning discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. After four months of delays, the council voted 6-1 to approve the measure Tuesday, the Wichita Eagle reports. Council member Jeff Blubaugh cast the lone dissenting vote. Council members rejected a proposed exemption that would have allowed religious groups to fire or refuse to hire LGBTQ individuals, an amendment proposed by council member Jared Cerullo, the first openly gay man to serve on the council. Cerullo said the proposed amendment would help bridge the divide between religious groups who opposed it and those who wanted it. But council members Becky Tuttle and Cindy Claycomb said it would “dilute” the ordinance. The measure seeks to prohibit discrimination based on age, color, disability, familial status, gender identity, genetic information, national origin or ancestry, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, citizenship, veteran status or any other factor protected by law. The city will begin accepting complaints under the ordinance Jan. 1.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, the influential chairman of the House Budget Committee who has played a key role in pushing for President Joe Biden’s agenda to expand the nation’s social safety net, announced Tuesday that he will not seek another term in next year’s election. At age 74, Yarmuth – first elected to Congress in 2006, when he unseated a Republican incumbent in his Louisville-area district – said he wanted to spend more time with his family. The congressman is the 10th Democrat to announce plans to retire ahead of the 2022 election. Although the district he represents has become increasingly blue, the retirement of a Democrat in a senior leadership position sends yet another ominous sign about the party’s chances heading into next year’s midterms, when its thin majority in both U.S. chambers will be at stake. The party that wins control of the White House typically loses congressional seats in subsequent elections. Yarmuth is the only Democrat in Kentucky’s six-member U.S. House delegation. State Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top-ranking Democrat in the GOP-controlled state Senate, quickly announced he’d run for the seat. State Rep. Attica Scott was already waging a primary challenge against Yarmuth, and his son, Aaron Yarmuth, said he is weighing throwing his hat in the ring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billionaire Richard Branson said it was an honor and a once-in-a-lifetime experience to don a drum major’s uniform and march ahead of a New Orleans high school band. But some of the Catholic school’s fans apparently were less enthusiastic about Branson’s appearance last week with the St. Augustine High School Marching 100 – the band that integrated an exclusive Mardi Gras parade. The band and Branson paraded to a new Virgin Hotel in New Orleans as part of opening ceremonies Thursday. “I’ve had quite a few exciting experiences in my time, but I’ve never got (a) chance to lead a marching band before – let alone the best marching band in the world,” Branson wrote on his blog Friday. “What an honour to join the legendary St. Augustine High School band for a performance through the streets of New Orleans.” Aulston G. Taylor, president and CEO of the school, tweeted a letter late Sunday acknowledging that many people had told him only students who have earned it should be allowed to wear the purple and gold uniform. Others felt that “Sir Branson adorning our drum major uniform with honor across his millions of followers was great for the school and sets us apart as a global brand,” he wrote. He said both viewpoints are valid.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Republicans in the state Senate want to return to taxpayers a portion of the surplus that accumulated during the pandemic, thanks in part to historic federal assistance. The “Give It Back” plan is seen as a major piece of the GOP’s messaging push ahead of the 2022 legislative session and comes as former Republican Gov. Paul LePage seeks to unseat current Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, the Bangor Daily News reports. The plan calls for splitting unused monthly revenue, sending half to the state’s rainy day fund and half to taxpaying residents. The proposal is in line with LePage’s campaign promise of eliminating Maine’s income tax if he wins in 2022. Mills has overseen a healthy state budget during her time as governor despite higher spending. A spokesperson for her administration called the GOP proposal a tacit acknowledgement of the state’s good fiscal situation under Mills’ leadership, according to the newspaper. Maine Republican legislators have fought with Mills over the $1 billion in federal relief that was used to bail state government out during the pandemic. Party leaders have called the aid excessive.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city’s public schools are using software that alerts officials when a student using one of the system’s laptops might be considering suicide. Since March, GoGuardian’s Beacon software has identified nine students as having a severe mental health crisis. All were taken to an emergency room, Stacey Davis, the city schools’ coordinator of media and instructional technology, told The Baltimore Sun. But the practice, which came about as the system loaned out laptops for students’ home use during the pandemic, is raising questions about privacy and equity. Two recent reports warn that such technology could be used for disciplinary purposes, unintentionally out LGBTQ students or squash student expression. They also note that economically disadvantaged students may be tracked more frequently because school-owned laptops may be their only devices. “Privacy and equity was not being considered as much as it needs to be,” said Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington and co-author of one of the reports. “Student activity monitoring is quite widespread.” Baltimore schools have gotten 786 alerts from Beacon since March. Of those, clinicians responded 401 times, and school police went to homes 12 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBarnstable: A rare two-headed diamondback terrapin turtle is alive and kicking – with all six of its legs – at the Birdsey Cape Wildlife Center after hatching a little over two weeks ago. A threatened species in the state, this turtle is feeding well on bloodworms and food pellets, staff at the center said. The two heads operate independently, coming up for air at different times, and inside its shell are two gastrointestinal systems to feed both sides of its body. The turtle originally came from a nest in West Barnstable that researchers determined was in a hazardous location and needed to be moved. After hatching, turtles in these so-called head start nests are sent to different care centers to be monitored before their release in the spring. Center veterinarian Pria Patel and other staff members will continue to monitor the turtle, which they nicknamed Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen after the twins who rose to prominence as child actors, beginning with “Full House” in 1987 when they were babies, and now are the famously elusive designers behind fashion label The Row. The staff is hoping to perform a CT scan to learn more about the turtle’s circulatory system.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Backers of former President Donald Trump will launch a ballot drive to require a “full forensic audit” of the 2020 presidential election, rallygoers were told Tuesday. Jon Rocha, of Portage, a Republican who is running against U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, said he expects paperwork for the legislative initiative to be filed with the Board of State Canvassers next week. “This is how a revolution begins,” Rocha told several hundred people gathered on the state Capitol lawn. If about 340,000 valid signatures are collected, and the measure is approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature, “it is absolutely veto-proof,” Rocha said. “That’s the best part about it.” Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer “cannot stop this bill.” Should lawmakers fail to act on the measure, it would go to voters at the November 2022 election, he said. Though ill-defined, a “forensic audit” is the phrase that has been embraced by large numbers of people unhappy with the result of the 2020 presidential election, in which President Joe Biden, a Democrat, defeated Trump, a Republican. Biden won 306 to 232 in the Electoral College and by more than 7 million popular votes. Biden prevailed in Michigan by more than 150,000 votes. Several private donors have agreed to help fund the effort, Rocha said. He would not name them.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Moccasin maker Minnetonka is publicly apologizing for making money off Native American culture and promised to do more to support Indigenous communities in the future after 75 years in business. In a statement posted Monday on Minnetonka’s website, CEO David Miller said the company is not a Native-owned business. He noted the Minneapolis-based firm acknowledged its appropriation in summer 2020 but said this public apology was long overdue. “We deeply and meaningfully apologize for having benefited from selling Native-inspired designs without directly honoring Native culture or communities,” Miller said. The company timed the apology to coincide with Indigenous Peoples Day. To better address the needs of the Native American community, Minnetonka said it has hired Adrienne Benjamin – a Minnesotan, Anishinaabe, and a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe – as a reconciliation advisor. The company said it’s also making a concerted effort to improve diversity, equity and inclusion of underrepresented groups and will seek out more partnerships with Native-owned businesses as vendors and suppliers. In the past year, it has done business with two different Native-owned companies, the company said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Students who left college at least two years ago without a degree can apply for a grant to help them return to and finish school. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation recently awarded the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning $1.3 million to fund the state’s Complete 2 Compete tuition assistance grants through 2023. The Complete 2 Compete program provides one-on-one support for adult learners who have earned college credits – but not a degree – and works with them to complete their education. Qualifying returning students can receive a $1,000 grant that can be renewed every semester. The award helps pay for any coursework needed to graduate and can help repay prior debt. Funds can be used at any Mississippi public universities or community colleges. A total of 2,400 students have graduated since the program launched in 2017. More than 200,000 prior students qualify for the Complete 2 Compete program, according to a press release from the Mississippi Community College Board. Since May, the program has reached out to former students through postcards as well as internet and social media ads. More than 2,700 former students’ applications were processed over the summer, with 620 returning to enroll in one of 15 community colleges, eight universities and a medical center.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A federal judge has struck down the state’s requirement that a majority of the owners of companies that dispense, grow or manufacture marijuana must be Missouri residents. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey last week issued a permanent injunction against the residency requirement, The Kansas City Star reports. She had issued a temporary injunction in June. Missouri voters approved creation of a medical marijuana industry in the state in 2018. One of the regulations required that state-licensed marijuana cultivation plants, dispensaries and manufacturing facilities must be at least 51% owned by people who had lived in Missouri for at least one year. Mark Toigo, a Pennsylvania-based investor, filed a lawsuit last December challenging the requirement, arguing that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause. Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said in a statement that the agency is “happy to have clarity on how we should handle the ownership residency requirement in the Missouri Constitution and will comply with the court’s decision.” The health department oversees the medical marijuana program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A lawsuit filed Tuesday is challenging a new state law banning voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts in certain areas of college campuses. The lawsuit filed by the Montana Democratic Party, Montanans for Tester and University of Montana student Macee Patritti is one of several challenging the law passed by the Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year. The plaintiffs argue the law is suppressing the vote of young people, who typically favor Democratic candidates. The law prohibits political committees including student organizations from conducting voter registration drives and other political activities inside certain high-traffic public university spaces including residence halls, dining facilities and athletic facilities. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Missoula argues the law “imposes arbitrary, vague, and onerous restrictions on the rights of college students” to participate fully in the political process. Patritti, a 19-year-old freshman, registered students to vote at the Montana Technological University in Butte as an intern with the Montana Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 election, according to the court filing. The plaintiffs argue that her First Amendment rights to political expression would be curtailed under the new law, which would prohibit such activities.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has announced a five-year ban on Phi Gamma Delta fraternity for student conduct code violations following a report of a sexual assault at the fraternity’s house in August. The report led to a protest of about 1,000 people outside the fraternity house Aug. 25 and sparked similar protests on college campuses around the country. The UNL chapter of Phi Gamma Delta – better known as Fiji – was temporarily suspended in late August while the university investigated possible violations of a previous probation. The university said Tuesday in a news release that an investigation by the University Conduct Board showed violations had occurred and that Fiji is no longer recognized by the university. The fraternity is suspended from the Lincoln campus at least through 2026, the release said. Fiji was already on probation for previous violations of university policy when the assault was reported. That report is still being actively investigated by the University Police Department, according to the university.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state’s top election official is challenging the status of two ballot measures that Nevada’s largest teachers union promised to withdraw after successfully using them as bargaining chips and pressuring legislators to boost education funding. In a Sept. 7 letter first published by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske wrote that state law required she include measures that propose raising taxes on sales and gambling on the 2022 ballot. Neither Democrats nor Nevada’s powerful resort industry want the tax measures to appear before voters next year, both have said. Democrats worry their inclusion could allow Republicans to frame the election around taxes. And resorts and casinos do not want to risk a hike that could deter tourists from visiting Las Vegas. The initiatives originated almost a year ago, when the Clark County Education Association submitted the tens of thousands of signatures necessary to qualify the two proposals for the 2022 ballot. John Vellardita, the teachers union’s executive director, said in March that the measures were designed to “start a conversation” about education funding and said they’d remain on the ballot unless lawmakers increased education funding before adjourning in June, which they did.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Executive Council on Wednesday rejected $27 million in federal funds for vaccination outreach, thrilling outspoken activists who previously derailed a public meeting and delayed the vote. Several were arrested Wednesday after audience members repeatedly interrupted the debate. Among other things, the money would have allowed the state to hire a public health manager and a dozen workers to promote the COVID-19 vaccines and address public concerns about them. Opponents argued the grant language would have required the state to comply with any “future directives” issued by the Biden administration regarding COVID-19, such as vaccine mandates. The same language has appeared in other grants accepted by the council, a five-member body that approves state contracts. And it does not in any way impede the state’s sovereignty, said both Attorney General John Formella and Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. “I appreciate that you have concerns, but they’re based on fantasy,” Sununu told Councilor Joe Kenney. All four of the Republican councilors voted against the grants. “You want the government to tell private businesses who to hire and fire?” the governor said. “That is completely un-American.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: The state has awarded a contract to replace a century-old rail bridge that has been the source of regular delays for years, officials announced Tuesday. The $1.56 billion contract is the largest in NJ Transit’s history, CEO Kevin Corbett said in a statement. The board of directors approved a joint venture by Sweden-based Skanska and Traylor Brothers, a civil construction company based in Evansville, Indiana. Construction is expected to take about five years. The Portal North Bridge is to replace a 111-year-old swing bridge over the Hackensack River that occasionally becomes stuck after it opens to allow boats to pass and must be manually hammered back into place. The new bridge will allow marine traffic to pass underneath without interrupting rail traffic. The project completed its design phase and received environmental approvals several years ago but languished while New York and New Jersey officials squabbled with the Trump administration over dividing up the costs between the states and the federal government. “Few infrastructure projects are as critical to the nation as replacing the aging Portal Bridge,” Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: After seven years of mining, federal officials say work to carve out the eighth disposal area at the U.S. government’s underground nuclear waste repository is complete. Managers at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant are planning to use the space beginning next year. Workers still need to run power to the excavated area known as Panel 8 and install air monitors and chain link to protect the walls. Constructed in a deep layer of salt in southern New Mexico, the repository entombs the radioactive remnants of decades of nuclear research and bomb-making. That includes special boxes and barrels packed with lab coats, rubber gloves, tools and debris contaminated with plutonium and other radioactive elements. Having enough space for the waste became more of an issue in 2014, when a radiation release contaminated parts of the underground facility and forced an expensive, nearly three-year closure. Some parts of the repository became off-limits. State regulators currently are weighing a permit change that some critics say could open the door to expanded operations at the repository. A decision is expected this year. In operation for more than two decades, the repository has received nearly 13,000 shipments. The idea is that the shifting salt will eventually encapsulate the waste after the underground vaults are filled and sealed.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A $2 billion project to build a rail link to LaGuardia Airport was officially put on hold Tuesday, after weeks of criticism from public officials and a lawsuit from neighborhood and environmental groups. In a news release, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it is pausing the project to consider alternatives. In recent weeks, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul had criticized the project, championed by her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo. Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who represents part of the area through which the link would pass, also has spoken out against it, as has outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio. The Federal Aviation Administration issued environmental approval in July but recently had asked the Port Authority to reconsider in light of a lawsuit filed by neighborhood and environmental groups. Preliminary construction on the roughly $2 billion, 1.5-mile elevated link was to begin this year. Public transit officials have sought for years to build a rail link to LaGuardia, one of the few major U.S. airports without rail service. Critics had opposed the plan, saying it would negatively impact Queens neighborhoods and wouldn’t be appreciably faster than driving, as it would involve taking a train or subway from points east or west to a stop serving CitiField, home of the New York Mets, then switching to the rail link.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A jail violated regulations requiring guards to observe inmates at least twice an hour, according to a state agency probing the deaths of two inmates last spring. On May 22, John Devin Haley, 41, of Charlotte, was found hanging below his cell window at the Mecklenburg County jail with a strip of blanket tied around his neck, The Charlotte Observer reports. Haley had a history of addiction and mental health problems when he entered the jail April 3 and was temporarily placed on suicide watch, according to jail records. Karon Golightly of Gastonia died at the jail May 14. Five months later, the cause of his death has not been made public, the newspaper reports. In North Carolina, jailers are required to observe each inmate “at least twice an hour on an irregular basis, with no more than 40 minutes between rounds,” according to state regulations. That standard was repeatedly violated in the hours leading up to the two deaths, according to investigators with the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. A DHHS report obtained by the newspaper says 52 minutes elapsed between the time Golightly was seen healthy and being discovered in distress in another inmate’s cell. The state also pointed to a camera near where Golightly collapsed that apparently was malfunctioning.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Budget writers in the Legislature began mulling proposals Tuesday on how to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in federal coronavirus aid the state received this year. House and Senate appropriations committees met separately in all-day meetings at the Capitol, listening to pitches from fellow lawmakers and others on a wish list that totaled $9.2 billion – significantly more than the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief funds transferred to the state-owned Bank of North Dakota in June. The meetings, attended heavily by lobbyists, were the first in a series being held this month to prioritize projects ahead of a Nov. 8 special session, when the full GOP-led Legislature will debate the proposals. The $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus funds represents the single-largest deposit into state coffers in history. The money currently is parked in short-term CDs, earning less than 1% interest. Senate Appropriations Chairman Ray Holmberg and his counterpart in the House, Jeff Delzer, said priority for the funding will be given to water, sewer and infrastructure projects, for which there is an immediate need, and those that won’t require a commitment of funds from taxpayers in the future.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Recreational marijuana would be legalized for adults 21 and older under Republican legislation coming in the state House that would levy a 10% sales tax on the product, a lawmaker announced Tuesday. Ohio facilities currently producing and processing medical marijuana would be grandfathered into the program, with new producers to be added to meet the expected demand, said Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Lake County. He said he’s currently looking for co-sponsors for the legislation, which has been in the works for months. The bill “is the responsible approach for adult use,” Callender said. A quarter of the sales tax revenue would go to police departments to purchase equipment used in detecting impaired drivers and another quarter toward addiction and recovery programs. The remaining 50% would not be earmarked, which could help the state during a precarious economic time, Callender said. In addition to the legislation being announced Tuesday, a separate ballot issue to legalize marijuana use and sales in Ohio is underway. A spokesperson for the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, which proposed that statute, said Tuesday that the group applauded Callender’s plan and said it continues to welcome the chance to work with the Legislature on passing a recreational marijuana bill.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A retired New York attorney is suing the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, saying its claim to have no records pertaining to the drugs it plans to use in upcoming executions “defies belief.” Fred Hodara, who filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Oklahoma County District Court, is asking the court to compel the corrections department to comply with his open records requests for documentation of its execution plans. He said in his lawsuit that in response to his requests for the records, including some the department is legally required to keep, the department told him none exist, the Tulsa World reports. “In light of the scope and nature of the requests, the assertation defies belief,” the lawsuit said, arguing that the agency has a history of refusing to search for and produce records that are subject to the state’s Open Records Act. A department spokesman told the newspaper that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation. Oklahoma is preparing to execute John Marion Grant on Oct. 28. It would be the state’s first execution since 2015, when then-Gov. Mary Fallin put a moratorium on capital punishment following the execution of Charles Warner with a drug that wasn’t authorized to be used that way.\n\nOregon\n\nKeizer: Republican state lawmaker Bill Post has announced his resignation from the Legislature after saying he misunderstood the residency requirements for being in office when he moved out of Oregon. His resignation announced Tuesday will be effective Nov. 30. Post previously said he wouldn’t seek reelection in 2022 but said Tuesday that he would resign after “discussions with an elections attorney.” Post, a former talk radio host, has served in the Oregon House of Representatives since 2015. He and his wife moved to Fallon, Nevada, which is east of Reno. In a Sept. 27 Facebook message, Post said his wife accepted a job, and they had sold their Keizer house and bought one in Fallon. He said he’d be in the district “at least once per month.” “My intent was to be open with my constituents about my move out of state and the steps I’d be taking to continue to fulfill my duties for the rest of my term to the best of my knowledge and ability,” Post said in a statement. Republican precinct committee members from House District 25 will select three to five candidates to replace Post. County commissioners from Marion and Yamhill counties will then choose a candidate to serve out the remainder of Post’s term. A Republican has held the seat since 2003.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Love was unexpectedly on the court docket when a man accused of murder made an unusual request of the judge who will preside over his trial. Kashawn Flowers’ lawyer on Tuesday asked York County Judge Harry Ness whether he’d consider marrying Flowers and his girlfriend. Attorney Brian Perry acknowledged it was the first time he had ever made such a request. Flowers is accused of gunning down a man in York in August 2014. His girlfriend would not be a witness at the trial, his attorney said. Prosecutors did not object, and neither did the judge. But the marriage is on hold until after the trial. “We’ll take care of it next week,” the judge said. Flowers remains held in the county jail without bail.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A series of controversial murals at a school have been painted over following criticism that they depicted children of color in a disparaging light. Among the four painted panels at Robert F. Kennedy Elementary School, only one shows children with different skin tones together, while the others show varying races separated. Two white children are shown playing on a beach in one scene, while two Black children build a snowman in another. Meanwhile, in a separate image, other children of color tidy up the school and collect trash. City Councilman David Salvatore said he received complaints about the murals, focusing in part on their apparent themes of inequality and segregation, and held community meetings on the issue. Initially, Salvatore explored the idea of removing the murals, preserving them and putting them on display, though he said it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. Eventually, the murals were painted over just before the school year began. Considerations for a new mural will be made. The city’s decision generated backlash from state Rep. Anastasia Williams, who said the paintings represented desegregation and anti-racism to her. Officials have been unable to find any mention of the murals in city archives; it’s only known that they were painted decades ago.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two civil rights groups are suing the state, saying lawmakers are taking too long to draw new maps for U.S. and state House districts. Candidates are required to file to run for the 2022 races by the end of March, but time is running out for potential candidates to research the new districts and settle any lawsuits asking judges to decide if the new maps are fair, according to the suit. It was filed Tuesday by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups are asking a panel of three federal judges to set a specific timeline for maps to be drawn and approved and not allow any elections until the new districts get judicial approval. The suit said lawmakers should have kept to suggestions when they adjourned in June that there would be a special session in September or October to approve maps. Those plans became less firm as lawmakers dealt with the aftermath of a budget provision that prevented districts from passing mask requirements this school year. South Carolina Senate President Harvey Peeler called for an Oct. 12 special session last month but canceled it about a week later, saying a committee working on the school district issues wouldn’t be finished in time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Zoo officials say COVID-19 may have killed a snow leopard. The animal, named Baya, died at the Great Plains Zoo on Thursday of a respiratory illness that might have been COVID-19. Coronavirus test results are pending. The snow leopard began coughing Oct. 3. By Oct. 4 she was acting lethargic and wouldn’t eat. Zoo veterinarians gave Baya antibiotics Thursday, but she was in critical condition later in the day. Baya was 21/ 2 years old and had been at the zoo since early 2021. Officials had hoped she would mate with another snow leopard named Strut. Zoo officials said Monday that an Amur tiger at the zoo tested positive for the virus Oct. 6, the day before Baya died. Five other big cats at the zoo have shown COVID-19 symptoms, including Strut. Most of the animals have been on antibiotics and are improving, said Matt Eschenbrenner, the zoo’s director of animal care and conservation. He said the zoo hopes to bring in another snow leopard to replace Baya, but it’s unclear when that animal might arrive. “We can’t even think about bringing in another animal until we know everything has passed and our animals are healthy, 100%,” Eschenbrenner said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Three U.S. Postal Service workers died in a shooting spree at a sorting facility Tuesday, including a supervisor, a manager and a letter carrier temporarily assigned to the postal annex, relatives and co-workers said. Two workers were fatally shot by a third who died from a self-inflicted gunshot, authorities said. The FBI and U.S. Postal Service didn’t immediately name those involved. The postal facility reopened Wednesday. Laquita Benjamin, president of the local branch of the National Association of Postal Supervisors, said those killed were a carrier, a supervisor and a manager. “You can’t just relate it to the Postal Service because you have school shootings, store shootings – you have shootings all over,” Benjamin said. A family member identified one of the dead as James Wilson, a manager at the East Lamar Carrier Annex in Orange Mound, a historic Memphis neighborhood. “He was a humble soul, one of the nicest supervising managers you could ever wish there was,” Roxanne Rogers said of Wilson, her cousin. Rogers, herself a postal worker, said Wilson had just returned to the annex after filling in at a different location. Melvin Richardson, president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 96, said the annex is only used by employees.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday launched an investigation into allegations of widespread mistreatment at the state’s embattled youth lockups, where at least 11 staffers have been arrested on sexual abuse charges in recent years. The move by the Biden administration is the latest sign of trouble for the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, which for more than a decade has been beset by scandal, staff shake-ups and investigations into allegations of abuse. Just last week, a former coach at a West Texas facility was arrested on charges alleging that he touched the breast of an 18-year-old in custody. The announcement comes a year after advocates in Texas filed a complaint with federal investigators that outlined “grave problems” at the state’s five youth lockups. Texas put more than 800 youths in state juvenile detention in 2019 – more than any other state – according to an agency report published in September. “Being subjected to harmful conditions does not rehabilitate children; it only leads to worse life outcomes,” said Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Spokespeople for the state agency and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In July, Abbott ordered a new investigation into the agency.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Apple CEO Tim Cook and NBA All-Star Dwayne Wade joined Utah leaders Wednesday to announce the completion of a local advocacy group’s campaign to build new homes that provide services for LGBTQ youth in the West. Encircle, a nonprofit providing mental health services for LGBTQ youth, has surpassed its goal of raising $8 million to build eight new homes with locations in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Utah aimed at providing safe spaces and preventing teen suicide. “Encircle’s mission is very personal to me because I see myself in so many of these young people,” Cook told reporters at a press briefing Wednesday. “It’s not easy when you’re made to feel different or less than because of who you are or who you love. It’s a feeling that so many LGBTQ people know far too well.” Wade, who joined the Utah Jazz ownership group in April, shared his experience as the parent of a transgender child and voiced his support for Encircle’s mission. “I stand here as a proud parent of a beautiful daughter that’s a part of the LGBT+ community,” Wade said. “I don’t have all the answers. I don’t know everything, but I’m willing to listen.”\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A dam built at the end of the 18th century has been fully removed after it was abandoned and contributed to flooding that threatened nearby homes in central Vermont. The removal of the Dunklee Pond dam started in 2019 and was completed in the past month, WCAX-TV reports. In the decades after it was built, the dam powered industries including a linseed oil mill, a wood planing mill, a metal mill, a slate pencil mill and a tannery, the broadcaster reports. More recently, it was used as a skating rink and swimming hole. “In the ’50s, ’60s, there were photos of the people diving, jumping off the dam, off the wall up here, swimming, fishing,” said Todd Menees of the Vermont Rivers Program. But the dam deteriorated, and Rutland City Fire Chief Bill Lovett said if it failed, it would have threatened dozens of homes downstream, and a bridge over a busy roadway could have been destroyed. The Vermont Natural Resources Council and the city of Rutland coordinated the project, using about $500,000 of state and federal funding. The project removed sediment that accumulated behind the dam, which the city of Rutland will use for road repairs.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: The family of a slain journalist is asking the Federal Trade Commission to take action against Facebook for failing to remove online footage of her shooting death. Andy Parker said the company is violating its own terms of service in hosting videos on Facebook and its sibling service, Instagram, that glorify violence. His daughter, TV news reporter Alison Parker, and cameraman Adam Ward were killed by a former co-worker while reporting for Roanoke’s WDBJ-TV in August 2015. Video footage of the shooting – some of which was taken by the gunman – repeatedly resurfaces on Facebook and Instagram despite assurances from top executives that it will be removed, according to a complaint filed Tuesday by Parker and attorneys with the Georgetown Law Civil Rights Clinic. “The reality is that Facebook and Instagram put the onus on victims and their families to do the policing of graphic content – requiring them to relive their worst moments over and over to curb the proliferation of these videos,” the complaint said. It said Facebook is engaging in deceptive trade practices by violating its own terms of service and misrepresenting the safety of the platform and how hard it is for users to get harmful and traumatic content removed.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The pace of the 20-acre Rattlesnake Ridge landslide in central Washington near Union Gap is continuing to slow, officials said. Yakima County emergency services director Tony Miller said measurements taken in August show the slab is moving less than 2 inches each week, The Yakima Herald-Republic reports. In 2020, the slab was sliding 2 to 3 inches each week. The slab is expected to continue sliding south, with debris depositing in a nearby quarry. “It’s moving a little bit, crumbling and falling right into the pit,” Miller said. State and county officials, as well as scientists, have been monitoring the slide since a crack was spotted on the ridge in 2017. Initially, officials said the slide could pose an immediate danger, and 60 people living nearby were evacuated. Some residents returned after an assessment firm hired by the state confirmed the landslide was not likely to rapidly slip. Stephen Reidel, a research faculty member at Washington State University, said the slab is sliding on a sedimentary layer between basalt flows. As the basalt slides into the quarry, it will stack up and eventually build up enough to act as a barrier, stopping the landslide. “It’ll just stabilize itself and then stop moving,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Employers would be limited in their ability to require workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 under a bill introduced by Gov. Jim Justice on Wednesday. The proposal, which would allow certain medical and religious exemptions to company vaccine mandates, comes as the state approaches 4,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Employers would be barred under the bill from penalizing or discriminating against current or prospective employees for pursuing the exemptions. The bill, which covers businesses and state government agencies, was advanced in the state Senate on first reading Wednesday. In the House of Delegates, it was referred to a committee. Justice, a Republican, lifted an earlier indoor mask mandate in June and opposes any new mask or vaccine mandates. Businesses can mandate the COVID-19 vaccine, “but at the same time they need to allow for these exemptions,” Justice said at a news conference. Under the bill, a doctor or nurse can provide signed documentation that the employee has a physical condition preventing them from safely receiving the COVID-19 vaccine or that the worker has recovered from COVID-19 and can show they have antibodies for the coronavirus. The worker also can present a notarized certification for a religious exemption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans brought in rocker and avid hunter Ted Nugent on Wednesday to publicize a package of bills that would declare open hunting season on sandhill cranes and allow anyone 18 or older to carry concealed firearms without a permit. Nugent appeared with more than 20 Republican lawmakers, including state Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, inside the Assembly chamber. The musician and conservative activist said that “hunting is essential, and any regulation that doesn’t deal with safety or science-based wildlife management is an obstacle to participation.” The package of 13 bills is making its way through the Republican-controlled Legislature. Even if they passed, to become law they would need the approval of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who would likely veto many of them. Nugent, who lives in neighboring Michigan, is the national spokesman for Hunter Nation, a group that outraged conservationists when it won a court order forcing an unprecedented late-winter wolf hunt in Wisconsin during the animal’s breeding season. The proposal to create a sandhill crane hunting season mirrors another that died in 2012 in home state of the International Crane Foundation. Nugent said in addition to population control, sandhills are tasty. “Are you familiar with the term ribeye?” he said. “They’re ribeyes in the sky.”\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Trustees at the University of Wyoming say they’ll continue a policy requiring masks in indoor campus spaces where social distance can’t be maintained, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Only about 40% of students have confirmed COVID-19 vaccinations, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/14"}]}

The UK economy will feel ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nFor years, home ownership in Britain has been a one-way bet. Prices have climbed steadily since the global financial crisis, rising in even larger increments after the pandemic began.\n\nFueled by a post-lockdown buying frenzy, the average UK house price hit a record £275,000 ($315,474) in December, a £27,000 increase on the previous year’s high. People buying houses for the first time benefited from cuts to taxes on their purchases and even though homes were more expensive, rock-bottom mortgage rates kept monthly payments affordable.\n\nPrices have risen every year since 2012, when they dropped by 1.1%, according to data from Nationwide, a major mortgage lender. Now, that boom is over.\n\nIt was already fading well before Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng blew up the UK bond market and sent borrowing costs through the roof. But the financial market turmoil sparked by the former prime minister and her then finance minister’s plans for unfunded tax cuts made matters much worse.\n\nThe sharp and sudden increase in mortgage rates that followed has made it much more expensive to buy a house, leading some forecasters to predict a 10%-15% plunge in prices over the next year or so.\n\nThe UK's former finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng and former Prime Minister Liz Truss at the Conservative Party conference on October 02, 2022 in Birmingham, England. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nEven though most of Truss’ tax cuts have been ditched by new finance minister Jeremy Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, calming bond markets, the era of cheap debt that helped drive house prices ever higher is coming to an an end.\n\nOn Thursday, the Bank of England increased its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point — it’s biggest hike in 33 years — taking it to 3% from near zero at the end of last year. That’s the highest level since November 2008.\n\nThat will keep mortgage rates elevated, even if not at their current inflated levels.\n\n“I think all that can happen in the short term is that we go back to where we were at the end of August,” said Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at broker Knight Frank. “There’s a bigger, wider psychological shift that has to take place after 13 years of ultra-low borrowing costs and the housing market readjusting to mortgage rates that are not below 1% or 2%.”\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nUK mortgage rates have been ticking upwards since spring, in line with rising interest rates. But Truss and Kwarteng’s “mini” budget of Sept. 23 kicked those increases into overdrive.\n\n“The mini budget added a whole percentage point onto mortgage rates,” said Richard Donnell, executive director of research at online property portal Zoopla.\n\nThe promise of sweeping tax cuts but no plan to pay for them caused a bond market rout that pushed up borrowing costs for lenders. “The biggest immediate impact was the accelerated pace of change in mortgage rates,” said David Hollingworth, associate director of communications at broker L&C Mortgages.\n\nWithin days, lenders pulled over 1,500 products and more than half have still not returned to the market, according to financial product comparison website Moneyfacts.\n\nEven though Kwarteng and Truss are out, along with most of their tax cuts, mortgage rates have still not fallen back to where they were before the pair unveiled their doomed economic plan.\n\nThe “mini” budget added a whole percentage point onto mortgage rates.” Richard Donnell, executive director of research at Zoopla\n\nAverage two-year and five-year fixed rates stood at 6.47% and 6.32% on Tuesday, levels not seen since 2008. That compares with around 4.75% before the “mini” budget, according to Moneyfacts.\n\nFor a typical borrower, with a mortgage worth 70% of the price of their home, that would increase monthly repayments by £500 ($574), according to Donnell.\n\nThe dramatic rates reset has seen some homeowners spend thousands of pounds to refinance early for fear that rates could climb higher still.\n\nKaram Heer, a tax adviser based in London, decided to refinance his two-year fixed mortgage a year earlier than planned, taking his rate from 1.75% to 3.57%. That will cost him an extra £375 ($424) a month until January 2028.\n\n“We haven’t had a choice really,” he said. Even though it cost him £4,500 ($5,162) to switch deals early, Heer wanted the certainty of a fixed rate because, as he told CNN Business, “I have absolutely no clue what’s going to happen with interest rates.”\n\nTudor Nanu and his wife, who bought a house in February, are considering doing the same. The health care workers in southeast England are preparing to take a £6,000 charge ($6,883) to refinance early at a rate almost double what they had been paying. The higher rate would cost them an extra £500 ($574) a month, on top of the one-off refinancing hit.\n\nHomes are pictured in south London, on October 3, 2022. Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGovernment bond yields fell back in October and swap rates — a gauge of bank funding costs that are used to price mortgage rates -— are also falling. That means mortgage rates are likely to come down in the next few weeks.\n\nStill, there’s no returning to the “ultra-low levels of recent years,” said Donnell, who thinks mortgage rates of 4% to 5% will become the new norm.\n\nThat will come as a shock to millions of homeowners who bought houses when rates were much lower. According to Bill at Knight Frank, more than 4 million mortgages have been issued to first-time buyers since 2009 when rates “hit the floor.”\n\n“So there’s a lot of people out there who don’t appreciate what it’s like when their monthly outgoings rise,” he told CNN Business.\n\nAs many as 1.8 million borrowers on fixed-rate mortgages will have to refinance next year, according to the Resolution Foundation, a think tank. Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst at research firm BuiltPlace, estimates that about 300,000 fixed-rate deals will come to an end between October and December.\n\n“As more buyers come up against the reality of monthly mortgage bills rising by hundreds of pounds, the financial pain will spread through the housing market,” Bill added.\n\nHouse price falls ‘inevitable’\n\nSigns of a slowdown are already starting to emerge, as banks take a more cautious approach to lending and aspirant home buyers delay purchases in the face of much higher borrowing costs.\n\nUK house prices fell 0.9% between September and October, the first decline in 15 months, according to data from Nationwide. The average house now costs £268,282 ($309,396).\n\nMortgage approvals also declined to 66,800 in September, from 74,400 in August, data published Monday by the Bank of England showed.\n\nZoopla’s Donnell said demand from new buyers has fallen 30% since the Truss budget. “Straight after the mini budget there was a scrabble to do deals, now sales are still happening but at a 20% lower run rate than they would be normally,” he said.\n\nA member of the public looks at residential properties displayed for sale in the window of an estate agents' in London on September 30, 2022. Isabel Infantes/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlan Edwards, a local government worker from the north of England, was about to start house hunting, hoping to buy early next year, until the mini budget caused mortgage rates to spike.\n\n“I can’t see that happening now,” he told CNN Business. Edwards expected rates to rise over the next few months, but not “this fast this quickly,” he said. “We’ve really got to pay attention to the government now because they can drive our costs up by having a bad week of their own making.”\n\nThose who do buy won’t be able to borrow as much, which will knock prices. Take, for example, someone who a year ago could afford to put £1,500 ($1,700) a month towards a 25-year mortgage. At an interest rate of 1.75%, the low reached in September 2021, that person could have borrowed £378,000 ($433,000). Today, at an interest rate of 5.5%, the monthly payment is enough only for a £244,500 ($280,000) mortgage.\n\nA drop in buying power makes a significant drop in house prices inevitable, according to Andrew Wishart, a senior economist at Capital Economics. The consultancy expects prices to fall between 10% and 15% between now and 2024. Credit Suisse has made a similar projection.\n\nThat’s a wider problem for the UK economy, given that 36% of household wealth is tied up in property, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. When house prices fall, homeowners feel less confident about their personal finances, causing them to cut back on spending and hold off on making additional investments.\n\nHomeowners may already be shoring up their finances, saving more in anticipation of higher mortgage payments. Households deposited an additional £8.1 billion ($9.3 billion) with banks and building societies last month, compared with £3.2 billion ($3.7 billion) in August, the biggest increase since June 2021, according to Bank of England data.\n\nEven if house price declines simply take prices back to where they were before the pandemic-induced buying spree, it will still hit the UK economy hard, because many sectors of the economy, from financial services and construction to moving companies and furniture stores, rely on a strong and active housing market.\n\nAnalysis by Knight Frank and the British Property Federation in 2020 found that for every 100,000 housing transactions involving existing homes, the UK economy benefited to the tune of almost £1 billion ($1.14 billion).\n\n“Higher debt payments, falling property prices and a slump in construction will play a major role in dragging the economy into recession,” Wishart said.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban Hanna Ziady", "Anna Cooban", "Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/economy/uk-mortgage-rate-increase/index.html", "title": "UK mortgage borrowers are in for a nasty shock from soaring rates ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nMillions of mortgage borrowers in the United Kingdom are bracing themselves for huge hikes to their monthly payments as a consequence of the run on the pound.\n\nMarkets have been in turmoil since UK finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng announced the biggest tax cuts in 50 years on Friday, together with a big rise in government borrowing, sending the pound falling to a record low against the US dollar.\n\nSome analysts now expect the Bank of England to hike the cost of borrowing to 6% next year, up from 2.25%, to shore up the currency and convince markets that it’s committed to getting inflation under control.\n\n“It is hard not to draw the conclusion that [recent events] will require a significant monetary policy response,” Huw Pill, the central bank’s chief economist told the Barclay’s-CEPR International Monetary Policy Forum on Tuesday, according to a Reuters report.\n\nMarkets had already been expecting the central bank to raise interest rates to 4.75% by next spring. That would have added £201 ($217) to a typical homeowner’s monthly payment on an outstanding fixed-rate mortgage of £146,000 ($157,000), Laura Suter, head of personal finance at investment firm AJ Bell, told CNN Business. Now borrowers face an even bigger cliff edge.\n\nThere are 9 million outstanding residential mortgages in the United Kingdom, according to UK Finance, an association of banks and financial services firms. About 20% of those loans are tracker, or variable rate products, that typically become more expensive when the central bank hikes rates. The rest are fixed-rate loans.\n\nBut as many as 1.8 million borrowers will have to refinance next year, according to the Resolution Foundation. Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst at research firm BuiltPlace, estimates that about 300,000 fixed-rate deals will come to an end between October and December. Those borrowers face a sudden increase in their monthly payments should they refinance.\n\nIf the base rate rises to 6%, a person refinancing a 20-year fixed-rate mortgage of £146,000 ($157,000) will have to pay an extra £309 ($333) per month, according to Suter. That’s £108 ($116) more than estimated before the pound’s crash.\n\nMany borrowers won’t be able to cope. Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a Tuesday report that a 6% mortgage rate would “lead to a sharp rise in mortgage defaults.”\n\nHe calculates that the average household refinancing a 2-year fixed rate mortgage in the first half of next year would see its monthly repayment jump by a whopping 73% to £1,490 ($1,607), an increase equivalent to about 14% of disposable income.\n\n“Mortgage arrears and default would rise just as house prices likely would be tumbling, placing huge strain on banks’ balance sheets,” he said in the report.\n\nSome mortgages have been withdrawn and rates are already rising\n\nBanks are already becoming more risk-averse as they struggle to reprice their mortgages in such volatile markets.\n\nSince Friday, lenders have withdrawn more than 350 mortgage products in response to the turmoil, according to Moneyfacts, a financial product comparison website.\n\nHalifax, owned by Lloyds Bank (LLDTF), removed some of its mortgage products, while Virgin Money stopped taking mortgage applications from new customers until later this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Santander (SAN) said it would remove mortgages worth 60% and 85% of a property’s value for new UK customers, and increase rates for “new and existing customers from 10 p.m. this evening.”\n\n“Customers who have already applied by this time will not be impacted,” a company spokesperson told CNN Business in a statement.\n\nBorrowers are worried. Online searches for “remortgage” more than doubled in the United Kingdom on Monday, according to analysis of Google search data by Loan Corp, a mortgage broker.\n\nSome may now struggle to find any deals at all.\n\n“Those with smaller deposits or who are trying to borrow at their maximum affordability might find it harder to get a mortgage deal or that they are paying even higher rates to do so,” Suter said.\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/investing/pound-plunge-why-matters-what-next/index.html", "title": "Pound to dollar: The pound's crash will make inflation worse | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe UK government’s decision to implement the biggest tax cuts in 50 years while borrowing tens of billions of dollars to subsidize soaring energy costs this winter is a massive gamble that’s sent shockwaves through financial markets.\n\nSince Friday, when finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng formally announced the plans, the British pound has plunged 5% against the US dollar, bringing its total losses so far this year to an eye-popping 21%. The euro, for comparison, is down about 15% against the dollar during the same period.\n\nThe turmoil doesn’t end there. Investors have raced to dump UK government bonds as they worry about the extra £72 billion ($77 billion) in borrowing due before April. The yield on 5-year debt, which moves opposite prices, has jumped from about 3.6% to more than 4.4% over the past two trading sessions — an astronomical jump in a corner of the financial universe that typically logs movements in tiny fractions of a percent.\n\nThe Bank of England said in an emergency statement that it was “monitoring developments in financial markets very closely,” while the UK Treasury said plans to ensure the sustainability of government finances would be released later this year.\n\nBut that may not bring an end to the chaos, the consequences of which won’t be limited to markets. A falling pound is dire news for an economy that may already be in recession, since it makes it more expensive to import essential goods like food and fuel. That could fan decades-high inflation that’s stoking a cost-of-living crisis for millions of households.\n\nConsequently, the Bank of England will come under pressure to jack up interest rates further and faster. This would push up the cost of borrowing for businesses and individuals, and leave less money for firms to invest and consumers to spend.\n\n“This is a painful reminder that economic policy is not a game,” said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on boosting living standards for low- to middle-income households. It has been sharply critical of the UK government’s proposals.\n\nWhy a plunging pound is bad news\n\nThe pound hit a record low against the dollar on Monday, dropping near $1.03 before recovering to almost $1.07.\n\nWhen a currency loses value, it can be helpful for manufacturers, making their exports cheaper. But given the broader economic climate, few would frame the steep drop as a positive development.\n\nOne big worry is what it will mean for paying for imports. The cost of energy is a particular concern as the weather gets cold.\n\nSince commodities are typically paid for in dollars, a rallying greenback and falling sterling will mean higher prices for UK importers. And while countries in Europe have been racing to stockpile natural gas as they try to reduce their reliance on Russia, the United Kingdom lacks similar storage capacity, leaving it even more exposed to prevailing market prices.\n\nThen there’s the rapid rise in borrowing costs for the government, businesses and households. Investors expect the Bank of England will need to increase interest rates much more aggressively to get inflation in check. They are now penciling in a rise in rates to about 6% by next spring.\n\nRates haven’t been that high since 2000. Given the central bank only starting hiking in December, when rates stood at 0.1%, the rapid pivot could trigger substantial economic whiplash.\n\n“The surge in interest rate expectations has already added another £1,000 a year to the coming increase in mortgages for a typical borrower, while sterling’s fall means more expensive imports feeding through to higher inflation,” said Bell. People living in the United Kingdom would see a decline in living standards as a result, he added.\n\nHalifax, owned by Lloyds Bank (LLDTF), removed some of its mortgage products, while Virgin Money stopped taking mortgage applications from new customers until “later this week” because of the wild market movements.\n\nAsking for calm\n\nThe disorder in financial markets pushed the Bank of England on Monday to say it would look into the effects of the government’s plans on inflation at its next scheduled meeting in November, and would “not hesitate to change interest rates as necessary.”\n\nThe bank issued its comments shortly after the UK Treasury said Kwarteng would outline plans to ensure the sustainability of UK debt over the medium term on November 23, and that the country’s budget watchdog would be asked to release an updated forecast at that time.\n\nIt’s not clear, however, whether these comments will be enough to reduce alarm among investors, who are worried about the government’s unorthodox approach.\n\n“It remains to be seen whether today’s statement by the government and the Bank of England will be enough to ease the markets’ fears about the government’s fiscal policy,” said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.\n\nOver the weekend, Kwarteng doubled down, hinting of more tax cuts to come and asserting that Friday’s measures were “just the start” as the government goes all out in its attempts to foster growth.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nMujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the consultancy Eurasia Group, thinks that Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss are unlikely to reverse course despite the stark reaction from investors.\n\n“For now, they’re going to try to ride out the storm,” Rahman said.\n\nThat leaves markets looking to the Bank of England to step in and stop the bleeding.\n\n“I think monetary policy is going to be the crucial determinant in the short term,” said James Ashley, head of international market strategy at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nThe central bank has given no indication it will hike interest rates outside its normal schedule of meetings. James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, said the Bank of England is probably discussing this option, but may be worried it could further damage to the credibility of the United Kingdom among foreign investors.\n\nIt’s more typical of central banks in emerging markets to step in to defend their country’s currencies, he noted, although Japan intervened last week to prop up the yen for the first time in 24 years.\n\nThe Bank of England will almost certainly have to be tougher moving forward, especially since its half-point interest rate hike unveiled last week now looks too small. The economist Mohamed El-Erian, an adviser to Allianz, told BBC that the central bank should hike interest rates “by one full percentage point to try and stabilize the situation.”\n\nIn the meantime, a more fundamental problem could continue to fan volatility. While the Truss government wants to boost demand to take the edge off a recession this winter, the Bank of England is trying to cool the economy so it can put a lid on the fastest price increases among G7 countries.

Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”\n\nIn contrast, those who are not vaccinated are “going to get the brunt of the severe aspect of this,” he added.\n\nAcross the United States, at least one in five eligible Americans – roughly 65 million people– are not vaccinated against Covid-19. More than 62% of the country has been fully vaccinated, but only 23% are fully vaccinated and boosted, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFauci’s comments came in response to a question about whether the pandemic has entered a new phase. That will come when there’s enough protection in the community and drugs to easily treat severe Covid-19, he said, adding, “We may be on the threshold of that right now.”\n\nAlso Tuesday, US Food and Drug Administration acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said that while most people could catch the virus, the focus now should be on making sure hospitals and essential services function.\n\nWoodcock was responding to a question from Sen. Mike Braun about whether it’s time for the United States to change its Covid-19 strategy. Her statement was not a new assessment of Covid-19, but rather an attempt to make clear the need to prioritize essential services as the Omicron variant surges.\n\n“I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is: Most people are going to get Covid,” Woodcock said Tuesday at a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. “And what we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, you know, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the number of US patients hospitalized with Covid-19 hit a record high, adding strain to health care networks and pushing states toward emergency staffing and other measures as they struggle to cope.\n\nMore than 145,900 people were in US hospitals with Covid-19 as of Tuesday – a number that surpasses the previous peak from mid-January 2021 (142,246), and is almost twice what it was two weeks ago, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe hospitalization record comes amid a surge in cases fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to JHU.\n\nThe country has averaged 1,646 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week – 33% higher than a week ago, according to JHU. The peak average was 3,402 daily on January 13, 2021, JHU data shows.\n\nThe Omicron variant caused 98.3% of new coronavirus cases in the United States last week, according to estimates posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA technician administers a Covid-19 test Monday at a drive-thru location at Churchill Downs, Kentucky. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nLeaders activate new measures to combat surging numbers\n\nHospitals are increasingly juggling staffing issues – not just because of the increased demand, but also because their employees, who are at a high risk of infection, have to isolate and recover after testing positive.\n\nIn Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a limited state of emergency Monday after the number of intensive care unit hospitalizations more than doubled since December 1. The order allows hospitals to expand bed capacity and gives more flexibility in staffing, he said, adding that it also expands the use of telehealth as well as expanding which medical professionals can give vaccines.\n\nIn Texas, at least 2,700 medical staffers are being hired, trained and deployed to assist with the surge, joining more than 1,300 personnel already sent across the state, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement to CNN.\n\nKentucky has mobilized the National Guard to provide support, with 445 members sent to 30 health care facilities, the state announced.\n\n“Omicron continues to burn through the commonwealth, growing at levels we have never seen before. Omicron is significantly more contagious than even the Delta variant,” said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, noting the earlier variant that spurred a surge of cases in the summer and fall.\n\n“If it spreads at the rate we are seeing, it is certainly going to fill up our hospitals,” he said, and Kentucky is “down to 134 adult ICU beds available.”\n\nAnd New Jersey reinstated a public health emergency, Gov. Phil Murphy announced, saying the state needed to “commit every resource available to beating back the wave” caused by Omicron. In the past two weeks alone, the state saw more than 10,000 people requiring hospitalization due to Covid-19, the governor said in a video announcement.\n\nMitigation measures such as mandatory masking are also being revived in some areas.\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney signed a universal indoor mask mandate Monday because of hospitalization increases, with some hospitals “over 100% inpatient bed capacity amid crippling staffing shortages,” he said. Churches and places of worship are exempt, while businesses should provide masks to customers and have signage about indoor mask requirements.\n\n“It’s time for everyone to pitch in and do what works. Wear your mask indoors. Avoid gatherings or expect to get and spread Covid. Get your vaccine and, if eligible, get boosted. That’s how we’ll get through this surge without endangering more lives,” Carney said.\n\nShare of hospitalizations from breakthrough infections is growing, but risks for unvaccinated are higher\n\nThe HHS data on Covid-19 hospitalizations includes both those patients who are hospitalized because of Covid-19 complications and those who may have been admitted for something else but test positive for Covid-19. This has been true throughout the pandemic, though the share of patients who fall into each category may have changed over time.\n\nFully vaccinated people are accounting for a growing share of people hospitalized with Covid-19 – but hospitalizations among people who received a booster shot are still rare, and the gap in risk by vaccination status has been wide.\n\nBetween April and July 2021, before the emergence of the Omicron variant, more than 90% of Covid-19 hospitalizations were among people who were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, according to a study published by the CDC.\n\nBut a sampling of data collected by CNN suggests that figure has dropped to somewhere between 60% and 75% in recent days and months:\n\n• In Pennsylvania, about 75% of Covid-19 hospitalizations between September and early December 2021 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• In New York, about 61% of Covid-19 hospitalizations during the week ending January 2, 2022 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• Beaumont Health, the largest health care system in Michigan, reported on Thursday that 62% of Covid-19 patients in its eight hospitals were unvaccinated.\n\nIn some hospitals, up to 40% of patients with Covid-19 “are coming in not because they’re sick with Covid, but because they’re coming in with something else and have had Covid or the Omicron variant detected,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nBut Covid-19 cases in hospitals strain resources, regardless of whether a patient was hospitalized because of Covid-19, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n\n“If they get (incidentally) diagnosed with Covid in the hospital, they still need to go into infection protocol – personal protective equipment, all of that still needs to be utilized. So it’s a huge drain on the system overall,” Gupta said Tuesday.\n\nWhile fully vaccinated people are accounting for a larger share of Covid-19 hospitalizations, multiple accounts suggest that those who are fully vaccinated and boosted account for a small share.\n\nIn the University of Maryland Medical System, less than 5% of hospitalized patients were fully vaccinated and boosted, President and CEO Dr. Mohan Suntha said Thursday. Beaumont Health reported Thursday that only 8% of Covid-19 patients were fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for data on the share of Covid-19 hospitalizations by vaccination status.\n\nThe agency publishes data on its website regarding the relative risk by vaccination status. Cumulatively, the risk of hospitalization has been eight times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people. But in the last week of November, CDC data showed that hospitalization rates were about 17 times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people.\n\nSchools and industries face Omicron issues\n\nThe debate over safety in schools from Covid-19 continues to play out as only about one in six children ages 5 to 11 is fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC.\n\nAs Los Angeles prepared to return to school on Tuesday, approximately 62,000 students and staff had tested positive for Covid-19 and will have to stay home, data from the Los Angeles Unified School District showed Monday, equating to a 14.99% positivity rate. The positivity rate of Los Angeles County at large, by comparison, has spiked to 22%.\n\nIn Chicago, educators returned to school Tuesday and students are expected to resume in-person learning Wednesday following a nearly weeklong dispute. The Chicago Teachers Union had voted to teach remotely last week, and the school district responded by canceling classes for four days.\n\nThe agreement, announced late Monday, included metrics for when a classroom would need to go remote due to Covid-19 levels.\n\nIn areas where schools have returned to in-person learning after the holiday break, the time needed for those with Covid-19 to recover has impacted some essential services.\n\nOther sectors also are struggling due to high infection rates.\n\nSome municipalities have seen nearly a quarter of their trash collection workforce call in sick in recent weeks due to Covid-19, leading to delays, according to the Solid Waste Association of North America.\n\n“This coincided, unfortunately, with increased trash and recycling volumes associated with the holidays. However, we hope that as volumes decline and sanitation workers return to work, these delays will prove temporary,” executive director and CEO David Biderman said in a statement Monday.\n\nIn travel, US airlines canceled thousands of additional flights over the weekend due to Covid-19 callouts and winter storms, and cruise line Royal Caribbean International announced it has canceled voyages on four ships because of “ongoing Covid-related circumstances around the world.” Last week, Norwegian Cruise Line canceled the voyages of eight ships.\n\nPublic transit systems in major metropolitan areas such as New York City and Washington, DC, have had to scale back service with employees ill from Covid-19. In Detroit, 20-25% of SMART bus service is canceled or delayed, the agency said in a statement Saturday.", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell Jason Hanna Deidre Mcphillips Christina Maxouris", "Travis Caldwell", "Jason Hanna", "Deidre Mcphillips", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/investing/russia-ruble-dollar-debt-payment/index.html", "title": "Ruble hits 2-year high against the dollar as Russia tries to avoid ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s efforts to support the ruble continue to pay off — and then some.\n\nRussia’s currency hit a two-year high against the US dollar Friday. The ruble gained ground after the country said it managed to pay back creditors with dollars as Russia tries to avoid a default.\n\nThe country’s finance ministry said in a statement that it made a $565 million eurobond that was due this year, as well as an $84 million eurobond that was set to mature in 2024. Both payments were made in US dollars, the finance ministry claimed, as required by the bond’s contract stipulations.\n\n“The payments were made in the currency of issue of the corresponding eurobonds — in US dollars,” Russia’s finance ministry said in a statement. “In this way, the obligations of servicing sovereign eurobonds are being carried out in observance of the conditions laid out in the issue documentation.”\n\nOn April 6, Russia said it had made the payments on those bonds in rubles, leading S&P to declare three days later that Russia was in default on its foreign debt obligations. Although the dollar payments are already overdue, Russia’s late payment in dollars serves as a last-ditch effort to avoid default.\n\nBond payments typically come with a 30-day grace period. For these bond payments, that grace period ends May 4. We may never know if S&P changes its mind about Russia’s default. Because of sanctions, the credit-rating agency pulled its rating on Russian debt on April 15.\n\nRussia has the money to pay its debts. It just can’t access about half of those funds after the West placed unprecedented sanctions on its foreign reserves, totaling about $315 billion.\n\nBut Russia has apparently found a way to pay off hundreds of millions of dollars in debt without accessing its frozen reserves. A US Treasury official said the payment must have come from a new pile of money, because it did not lift its restrictions on Russia’s sanctioned dollars, according to Reuters.\n\nThe news sent the Russian ruble, which has been surging for two months, to a two-year high against the US dollar. One dollar could buy about 68 rubles Friday, less than half the number it could buy in early March. At its peak on March 7, the ruble was trading at 135 to the dollar.\n\nRussia has been able to prop up the ruble despite global sanctions by hiking interest rates, preventing Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners and demanding payment for gas and oil deliveries in rubles, among other actions. These measures have allowed Moscow to artificially manufacture demand for the ruble, even as the nation’s economy remains in tatters.\n\nThe country has since been able to scale back on its dramatic rate hikes, including another surprise rate cut Friday.\n\n— CNN’s Clare Sebastian contributed to this report.", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}]}

But so far, helicopters, drones and dogs searching an ever-shifting perimeter have not gotten the fugitive back behind bars.\n\nHere’s a timeline of what we know of Cavalcante's escape and subsequent vanishing.\n\nCavalcante has eluded police for 9 days:What will it take for him to get caught?\n\nAugust 2023: Cavalcante sentenced to life in prison after 2021 killing\n\nCavalcante faces life behind bars after he was convicted last month of murdering his former girlfriend in front of her two young children.\n\nIt took a jury 15 minutes of deliberation before returning a guilty verdict against Cavalcante for stabbing 33-year-old Deborah Brandao to death in 2021 while her 7-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son were present, according to the Chester County District Attorney’s Office.\n\nIn April 2021, Cavalcante went to Brandao’s home, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and stabbed her 38 times. The two dated for about a year-and-a-half, during which time Cavalcante had \"engaged in a horrific pattern of domestic violence,\" District Attorney Deb Ryan has said.\n\nCavalcante, a Brazilian national and former agricultural worker, is also wanted for a 2017 murder of a 20-year-old man over a car repair debt in his native country, the district attorney's office has said. Investigators learned that Cavalcante fatally stabbed Brandao because she had learned about his open murder warrant in Brazil and had “threatened to expose him to the police,” according to the district attorney's office.\n\nWhen he escaped, Cavalcante was being temporarily held at Chester County Prison, about 25 miles west of Philadelphia, while awaiting transfer to a state facility to serve his sentence.\n\nMore:Prison escapes are rare, and most are soon caught\n\nAug. 31 around 9 a.m.: Cavalcante escapes\n\nCavalcante made his escape around 9 a.m. last Thursday, Aug. 31. His disappearance prompted an immediate search of the area as police and prison authorities deployed helicopters and dogs to locate the fugitive.\n\nAt the time, authorities said Cavalcante was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, grey shorts and white sneakers. A witness also initially spotted him almost an hour after his escape walking on Wawaset Road in nearby Pocopson Township.\n\nRyan had said early on that officials were concerned Cavalcante may get help from friends and family. The concern sprang from the fact that after Cavalcante murdered his girlfriend in April 2021, he was aided by others until he was apprehended in Virginia, authorities have said.\n\nLaw enforcement made it clear from the beginning that Cavalcante is considered extremely dangerous and that anyone who spots him should refrain from approaching him and call 911.\n\nSept. 1: U.S. Marshals join the hunt\n\nAt a press conference last Friday afternoon, it was announced that the United States Marshals Service was joining the search.\n\nAt the time, Ryan said officials no longer believed anyone to be helping Cavalcante evade authorities, and that the assumption was that he was hiding alone in the area. Ryan said Cavalcante has “nothing to lose,” and he could be capable of more dangerous crimes.\n\nLabor Day Weekend: Cavalcante spotted multiple times\n\nThe manhunt soon brought hundreds of law enforcement officers to southeastern Pennsylvania, disrupting the lives of thousands of residents, many of whom remain on edge about the fugitive's whereabouts.\n\nOn Monday, the hunt for the Cavalcante led officials to scour a small area near the prison where they believed the fugitive was hiding.\n\nPolice initially set up a perimeter around Pocopson Township, a residential neighborhood near the Chester County Prison, where Cavalcante had been sighted multiple times over Labor Day weekend. A state trooper even spotted the fugitive, leading to a brief chase.\n\nJust after midnight on Saturday, a residential surveillance camera captured Cavalcante about a mile and a half from the prison with a backpack, according to the Chester County District Attorney's Office.\n\nAnother resident reportedly saw Cavalcante in a creek bed behind their house in Pennsbury Township, a residential area several miles east of a popular botanic garden called Longwood Gardens.\n\nSept. 4 at 8:21 p.m.: Cavalcante seen on trail cam\n\nIn fact, Cavalcante was seen on Monday on a trail camera at Longwood Gardens, a popular tourist destination of about 200 acres of rolling meadows and brimming gardens. The gardens' private trail camera captured the most recent images of Cavalcante, in which he has a backpack, duffel bag and a hoodie.\n\nSecurity at Longwood Gardens notified investigators that a private camera showed Cavalcante walking north around 8:21 p.m. and then south through the same location at 9:33 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens previously said.\n\nSept. 5: Search shifts south\n\nThe sighting prompted officials on Tuesday to shift the search perimeter south of the initial target zone.\n\nFrom speakers in cars and helicopters, authorities have blasted a recording they obtained from Cavalcante’s mother in Portuguese, asking her son “to surrender peacefully.\"\n\nAs the search unfolded, the family of Brandao, the woman slain by Cavalcante, has been barricaded inside their homes under constant protection in case the fugitive decides to come after them.\n\nSept. 6: Released security footage shows escape\n\nOn Wednesday, officials released security footage that showed Cavalcante breaking free by \"crab-walking\" up a wall before he reportedly pushed through razor wire and ran across a roof to freedom.\n\nThe escape was revealed to have taken place while his prisoner block was outside in the exercise yard. An officer in a tower who didn't see him slip away has been put on administrative leave, Chester County Prison Howard Holland previously said.\n\nThe footage begins at about 8:50 a.m. when Cavalcante used his outstretched arms and legs to brace himself between two walls and \"crab walk\" up before disappearing out of sight. From there, he pushed through razor wire, ran across the roof, and scaled a fence lined with razor wire, Holland said.\n\nCavalcante's disappearance was discovered nearly an hour later during an inmate count after the block returned from the yard. Holland has said officials determined that the razor wire was insufficient as planning is underway to better secure the prison with physical barriers and increased staff.\n\nGeorgia:After body slamming student during arrest, Georgia school police chief placed on leave\n\nSept. 7: Search crews battle heat, humidity\n\nThroughout the week, the heat and humidity was posing challenges for the searchers, who Bivens said were dedicated to capturing Cavalcante as they hoped he grew tired, hungry and desperate.\n\nAs temperatures reached 94 degrees Thursday, the hundreds of law enforcement officials combing through the search perimeter were bogged down in not only full uniforms and weapons, but bullet-resistant vests.\n\nThe heat even got to the technology being used to track Cavalcante, Bivens said. For example, it was possible that thermal imaging might pick up additional hot spots, though Bivens assured said it wasn't a deterrent to using the resources.\n\nMeanwhile, the two school districts that had canceled classes Tuesday and Wednesday − Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County and the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District − largely reopened on Thursday.\n\nBoth districts said local law enforcement will provide additional security and that they are excusing absences of students whose families prefer to keep them home.\n\nWhat we know about Ta'Kiya Young:A pregnant Ohio mother's death by police sparked outrage\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

You're dealing with some very bad individuals.

She has pleaded not guilty to charges related to aiding the killers' escape.\n\nThe men split up about a week before the authorities ended the men's time on the lam.\n\nAgents found Matt first.\n\nOn June 26, a resident of Malone, N.Y., told investigators about possible gunshots in the area. The Border Patrol deployed its Tactical Team Special Operations Group to the scene on two A-Star helicopters.\n\nThe choppers landed, and eight to 12 members of the team, known as BORTAC, entered the woods at 3:45 p.m. ET, Pfeifer said.

Jay Cook of New York State Police spotted a man jogging down a road less than 2 miles from the Canadian border in Constable, N.Y., and confronted him. The jogger turned out to be Sweat.\n\nHe fled across a field once Cook recognized him, and the sergeant shot Sweat twice to prevent the escapee from reaching a treeline and potentially disappearing again into the woods.\n\nSweat is being treated at a hospital in Albany, N.Y., and is reported to be providing the authorities with details of his and Matt's escape scheme.\n\nAnnouncing the capture of Sweat, New York Gov.

As each car passed, troopers politely asked drivers to open their trunks – there was apparent concern that Matt and Sweat were trying to move out of the area by car.\n\nBecerra – himself a volunteer firefighter – stopped at the Cadyville firehouse. The volunteer organization holds just one fundraiser a year, a carnival.\n\n\"It was supposed to be this past weekend and they canceled it,\" Becerra said. \"They didn't want all the kids at the carnival with two murderers running around. ... They thought these guys were holed up in the woods between Cadyville and Dannemora. ... They didn't want to take chance.\"\n\nAfter taking more photographs in Cadyville, Becerra headed on to Dannemora, a visibly disrupted village besieged by television news crews and shotgun-toting corrections officers.\n\nEverywhere, cops.\n\n\"So many different cops,\" Becerra said. \"Troopers, Vermont State Police, local cops, border patrol. ... You wouldn't believe all the different jurisdictions up there, involved in this.\n\nA Catholic church had a message board that read, \"Bless all law enforcement.\" A sign at the jail congratulated its employees of the month.\n\n\"There were a lot of roads closed, with cops at the (prison) entrance. ... The only people allowed down the street were residents,\" he said. \"Even with a press ID they wouldn't let me down.\n\n\"There would be cop at the side of the road in front of any wooded area,\" with another officer stationed within sight down the road. If the road turned a corner, there would be another cop at the bend.\n\n\"Each cop was able to see the next cop in case someone came out of the woods,\" he said. \"This was for about a mile leading toward the jail.\"\n\nBecerra tagged along as a group of investigators went from house to house making checks for the prisoners. If a house was cleared, police put a notice on its door indicating it had been checked.\n\nMany of the houses in the area are seasonal, he said.\n\n\"That's what they are afraid of – that these guys are in someone's weekend home sitting there eating food and watching TV.\"\n\nBecerra saw several Dannemora residents offer bottled water or other cold drinks to officers as they emerged from the woods.\n\nAt each turn, another roadblock.\n\n\"I probably opened my trunk 25, 26 times,\" he said. \"Every time you went through a roadblock, even if you just went through it 20 minutes ago, you had to open it again.\"\n\nA hotel employee in Dannemora told him that between law enforcement personnel and media, all of the rooms in the area are booked.\n\n\"I feel bad for the town,\" Becerra said. \"Personally I feel these guys are long gone.

He was awaiting transfer to a state facility when he escaped.\n\nCavalcante escaped Chester County Prison outside Philadelphia just before 9 a.m. on Thursday and a search of the area was being conducted, the office said. Police and prison authorities deployed helicopters and dogs to locate Cavalcante, Chester County Commissioner Josh Maxwell said. He was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, grey shorts and white sneakers, Maxwell said.\n\n“Danelo Cavalcante is considered an extremely dangerous man,\" District Attorney Deb Ryan said in a statement provided to USA TODAY.\n\nOfficials didn't say how Cavalcante escaped, but said he was last seen by an eye witness walking on Wawaset Road in nearby Pocopson Township almost an hour after his escape. The acting warden of the prison, Howard Holland, said Cavalcante \"physically escaped,\" but said he didn't cut any fences to do so.\n\nHe's also wanted for a 2017 murder in his native Brazil, the district attorney's office said. The office announced up to a $10,000 reward for information on Cavalcante.\n\n'Depravity knows no bounds': DA warns escapee is dangerous\n\nRyan told reporters Thursday that Cavalcante has \"nothing to lose\" and said he may be capable of more egregious crimes.\n\nHe had been in a relationship with Brandao for about a year and a half and \"engaged in a horrific pattern of domestic violence,\" leading up to the murder, Ryan said. Cavalcante stabbed Brandao 38 times in broad daylight, she said.\n\n\"His depravity knows no bounds,\" she said.\n\nIt took a jury just 15 minutes to convict Cavalcante of killing Brandao. Prosecutors said he was angry she planned to disclose the murder charge he was facing in Brazil.\n\nWhen authorities showed Brandao's daughter a photo of Cavalcante to identify, she said, \"That’s him, that’s the guy that killed my mom... Please get him and put him in prison,\" the Pottstown Mercury reported in 2021.\n\nRyan also said officials are concerned Cavalcante may be helped by friends and family and warned they will also be prosecuted if that's the case. After the murder in April 2021, he was aided by others until he was apprehended in Virginia.\n\nIt's the second escape from Chester County Prison in a couple of months, officials said Thursday, though they wouldn't say whether the methods of escape were similar.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/02/border-patrol-killing-richard-matt/29617141/", "title": "Copter dropped in, then agent shot Matt", "text": "Adam Silverman\n\nFree Press Staff Writer\n\nU.S. Border Patrol special agents flew in via helicopter following reports of gunshots in northern New York during the manhunt for two escaped murderers, then found one of the killers cowering behind a tree and killed him when he raised a shotgun.\n\nThat detailed account of Richard Matt's death — which came after three weeks on the run and multiple close calls and false sightings — came Thursday from the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Swanton, Vermont, sector.\n\n\"Our agents were obviously expecting the worst on every one of those calls,\" Chief John Pfeifer said. \"Very challenging terrain, challenging weather, lot of stress. You're dealing with some very bad individuals. Can't thank law enforcement enough for bringing these individuals back in.\"\n\nThe killers escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, late June 5 or early June 6 by cutting through their cell walls, navigating the maximum-security prison's labyrinthine catwalks, breaking through a brick wall, sawing into and out of a metal pipe and breaking a chain on a manhole cover beyond the lockup's walls down the street.\n\nThe murderers remained on the run for three weeks before Matt was killed and David Sweat was shot and captured.\n\nLaw enforcement concentrated their search for Matt, 49, and Sweat, 35, on the rugged woods and small towns near the prison after a woman whom police say had agreed to be the getaway driver, prison tailor-shop instructor Joyce Mitchell, failed to show at the arranged time. She has pleaded not guilty to charges related to aiding the killers' escape.\n\nThe men split up about a week before the authorities ended the escapees' time on the lam.\n\nAgents found Matt first.\n\nLast Friday, a resident in Malone, New York, told investigators of possible gunshots in the area. The Border Patrol deployed its Tactical Team Special Operations Group to the scene on two A-Star helicopters.\n\nThe choppers landed, and members of the team, known as BORTAC, entered the woods at 3:45 p.m., Chief Pfeifer said. There were 8-12 agents, he said, declining to be more specific because of an ongoing investigation into the use of deadly force.\n\nAgents heard a cough and knew the sound was human.\n\n\"One of the agents came up on an individual who was lying down behind a fallen tree,\" Pfeifer said in a Thursday call with reporters.\n\n\"Agents verbally ordered the individual to put his hands up. An agent observed the individual fail to comply with the verbal commands and aim what was later determined to be a 20-gauge shotgun at him. The agent discharged his service-issued M-4 rifle, striking the individual, who died at the scene.\"\n\nAn autopsy shows Matt was killed by three shots to the head, according to the New York State Police.\n\nThen on Sunday, New York State Police Sgt. Jay Cook spotted a man jogging down a road less than 2 miles from the Canadian border in Constable, New York, and confronted him. The jogger turned out to be Sweat. He fled across a field once Cook recognized him, and the sergeant shot Sweat twice to prevent the escapee from reaching a treeline and potentially disappearing again into the woods.\n\nSweat is being treated at a hospital in Albany, New York, and is reported to be providing the authorities with details of his and Matt's escape scheme.\n\nAnnouncing the capture of Sweat, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico praised Cook as a hero.\n\nBut the Customs and Border Protection agent who killed Matt has remained anonymous. Chief Pfeifer said agency policy generally requires law enforcement to withhold forever the identity of an agent who kills an individual, but CBP says law enforcement might make an exception following the internal investigation into the use of force.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had said Friday that the agent was from Vermont, but CBP told the Burlington Free Press this week that statement is inaccurate. Pfeifer said Thursday the BORTAC team was composed of specially trained law officers from the Swanton Sector and from El Paso, Texas.\n\nThe El Paso Times reported that the agent who killed Matt was assigned to a BORTAC team based at Fort Bliss, Texas. The group is considered a special national team and was on assignment to the massive manhunt.\n\nPfeifer said he could release few specifics about the deadly encounter in the woods between agents and Matt, including:\n\n•Whether the escapee's shotgun was loaded.\n\n•What firing settings were selected on the M-4 rifle used by the agent to kill Matt.\n\n•Whether the BORTAC team approached Matt from the front or the rear.\n\nNo other agent fired a weapon, Pfeifer said. The Swanton Sector chief also disclosed that Matt said nothing before he was killed.\n\nThere is no standard length of time for Customs and Border Protection investigations into use of deadly force, \"but I don't anticipate this one taking very long,\" Pfeifer said.\n\n\"That investigation is going to look into a lot of different physical evidence, eyewitness accounts of what happened, forensics, to determine that deadly force was appropriate,\" the chief said, noting that he was speaking generally about CBP inquiries.\n\n\"When an individual is confronted that has the means, the capability, and the intent to inflict deadly force on one of our agents or an innocent third party, then we are within our means to use deadly force against that subject.\"\n\nSweat was serving a sentence of life without parole for killing a sheriff's deputy in Broome County in 2002.

Officials urged local residents to be wary and keep homes and cars locked, and police broadcast a plea for surrender from the convict's mother.\n\nA massive dragnet initially focused on an area within a 2-mile perimeter largely around Pocopson Township, a residential neighborhood near the Chester County Prison. Officials on Tuesday expanded the perimeter to encompass an area south of the small town because it appeared Cavalcante had traveled farther away.\n\nCavalcante, 34, escaped from of the Chester County Prison on Thursday, about 25 miles from Philadelphia, where he was waiting to be sent to a state facility. His escape comes a week after Cavalcante was sentenced to life in prison without parole for fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, in front of her children. He's also wanted in connection with a 2017 murder in his native Brazil.\n\nSecurity at Longwood Gardens notified investigators that a private camera on Monday captured Cavalcante walking north around 8:21 p.m. and then south through the same location at 9:33 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said during a news conference Tuesday morning. The gardens, about 200 acres of rolling meadows, brimming gardens and winding paths, is usually packed with visitors but has closed during the search for the escaped inmate, WFMZ reported.\n\nThe photos show that Cavalcante obtained a backpack, a duffel bag, \"clothing and other items,\" Bivens said.\n\nBecause of the expanded perimeter, the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District and the Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County canceled classes for Tuesday.\n\n“That pressure that we’ve been putting on him is working,” Bivens said. “We squeezed him hard enough over a period of a few days and he was not able to get any relief, and (he) managed to find a place to get out.”\n\n“Obviously I wish we would have been able to capture him without him getting through that perimeter, but it's also not shocking,” he added. “It’s dark, it’s a large area. Not to make excuses, it’s just difficult terrain.”\n\nSuspected Cavalcante sightings\n\nThere have been five credible sightings of Cavalcante from witnesses since he fled the prison, including one instance in which a state trooper briefly chased him but was unable to capture the fugitive.\n\nLocal Pocopson Township resident Ryan Drummond told WPVI he believes Cavalcante got into his home and stole food late Friday night. Drummond told the outlet he got up after hearing a noise downstairs and, from his upstairs landing, watched a man matching Cavalcante's description walk out of the house.\n\nBy the time police arrived, the man was gone into the thick brush, Drummond told WPVI.\n\n\"Peaches, apples, green snap peas were missing,\" he said. \"We have a bunch of little steak knives and he could have taken one of those.\"\n\nJust after midnight on Saturday, Cavalcante was seen on a residential surveillance camera about a mile and a half from the prison with a backpack, according to the Chester County District Attorney's Office.\n\nCavalcante's mother aids authorities\n\nFrom speakers in cars and helicopters, authorities have blasted a recording they obtained from Cavalcante’s mother in Portuguese, asking her son “to surrender peacefully,” Bivens said.\n\nBivens urged local residents to familiarize themselves with Cavalcade's appearance, lock their doors, monitor their home security systems and check on their neighbors.\n\n\"You’re dealing with someone who is desperate and doesn’t want to be caught,” Bivens said. “If he can find some shelter, if he can find some food, he’s going to take advantage of whatever he finds.”\n\nA reward of up to $10,000 is being offered for any information that leads to Cavalcante's capture.\n\nHow exactly Cavalcante managed to escape the Chester County Prison remains unknown. A joint investigation into the matter is being handled by the Chester County District Attorney's Office and Pennsylvania State Police.\n\n'We miss normal'\n\nEileen Blass, a former USA TODAY photographer who lives about two miles from the prison, said the presence of law enforcement in her neighborhood over recent days has been constant.\n\nFrom her home in Pennsbury Township, she’s heard and seen police helicopters, drones and security checkpoints up and down the road she lives on.\n\nAccording to the Chester County District Attorney's Office, hundreds of law enforcement officers are involved in the manhunt. Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs and Border Protection were deployed on Monday to help in the search.\n\nBlass is one of many people within a 3-mile radius of the camera that captured Cavalcante on Monday night to receive a reverse 911 text notifying them that the search area had stretched farther south and encompassed Longwood Gardens.\n\n“We miss normal,” she said in an email.\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker, USA Today; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona/2015/07/04/kingman-prison-experiencing-disturbance-abrk/29716859/", "title": "Ducey calls for investigation of Kingman prison riot", "text": "Jerod MacDonald-Evoy, and Craig Harris\n\nKINGMAN --Gov.

Issa Arnita, a Management & Training Corp. spokesman, said the inmates will return once the facility is repaired.\n\nThe 1,055 inmates will be sent to other state facilities, county jails or private prisons, according to Wilder.\n\nArnita added that Management & Training Corp. will reimburse the state for all costs incurred during the riots.\n\nThis month's unrest is the latest in a string of problems at the Golden Valley prison, which opened in 2004. The facility, which houses about 3,500 minimum- and medium-custody inmates, has had several high-profile security breaches in recent years.\n\nIn January, an inmate serving time on drug convictions was beaten to death.\n\nIn 2010, three inmates escaped and killed an Oklahoma couple vacationing in New Mexico. The inmates were caught and received new prison sentences.\n\nEvents of the past week likely will intensify the debate over Arizona's use of private prisons.\n\nDucey, a Republican, and the Legislature have pushed for more private facilities to ease inmate overcrowding, but critics say private prisons are costly to taxpayers and their managers are motivated by profit instead of public safety.\n\nThe state will begin accepting bids July 22 to add 1,000 medium-security beds in the 2016 fiscal year, which began Wednesday, plus an additional 1,000 the next year, pending legislative approval.\n\nA medium-security inmate has been deemed to represent a moderate threat to the public and staff. Those inmates are not allowed to operate outside the safe perimeter of a prison and are permitted only limited, controlled movement inside any institution.\n\nCaroline Isaacs, an outspoken critic of private prisons and Arizona director of the American Friends Service Committee, said the recent disturbances at the Management & Training Corp. facility show the private-prison operator is ill-equipped to house inmates.\n\n\"This is clearly a management issue. If I had to wager, most of the problems in for-profit prisons are related to staffing, and most staffs are new, undertrained and they don't pay their guards well,\" Isaacs said in a phone interview Sunday. \"This is a critical time for the state's leadership to stop and take a very good, long, hard look at what we are doing in corrections in this state.\"\n\nArnita, of Management & Training Corp., said the disturbances had nothing to do with staffing.\n\n\"Operating prisons comes with inherent challenges. Sometimes inmates, for various reasons, will attempt to cause disturbances,\" said Arnita, who added that staff members are well-trained.\n\nScarpinato, the governor's spokesman, declined to comment about whether the state will continue to add private prisons. He said the focus Sunday was to make sure inmates were held behind bars. Wilder declined to comment, saying the use of private prisons is a decision for the Legislature and the governor.\n\nProblems at the Kingman-area prison began Wednesday when a small group of inmates attempted to harm another inmate in the adjoining minimum-security Cerbat Unit.\n\nThe next day, inmates in the medium-security Hualapai Unit were \"non-compliant and caused significant damage\" in two housing areas, Management & Training Corp. said in a statement released Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, inmates in the remaining three Hualapai housing units caused additional disturbances and damage, according to the company.\n\n\"We are currently assessing the damage to the housing units to determine if additional offenders will need to be temporarily relocated until repairs can be made. The motive for these disturbances is still under investigation,\" the company said.\n\nThe DOC spokesman reiterated that contrary to some bloggers' reports, there were no escapes and no inmates breached the prison's perimeter during the weekend riots.\n\nResidents in Kingman had mixed views on the prison situation.\n\n\"They have had their problems and issues,\" said Ron Monerief Sr., who was shopping at the Kingman Walmart. \"It's just stupid.\"\n\nMonerief added that some local residents think twice about applying for work at the private prison because of the problems.\n\nBut Brian Melton, who also was shopping, said the prison company and local officials had the situation under control.\n\n\"No one escaped,\" Melton said. \"That's a plus.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2023/07/10/michael-c-burham-prison-inmate-escape-warren-county-pa-survivalist-investigation-kala-hodgkin/70397272007/", "title": "'Survivalist' Michael Burham remains on run after prison escape", "text": "WARREN, Pa. ― The latest on the search for escaped inmate Michael C. Burham in northwestern Pennsylvania. Return for updates:\n\nEarlier\n\nThe search for escaped inmate Michael C. Burham will stretch into its sixth day Wednesday, as state, federal and local police agencies continue to comb Warren County and areas of the nearby Allegheny National Forest for the homicide suspect and kidnapping defendant whom authorities described as a \"self-taught survivalist with military training.\"\n\nState police late Tuesday afternoon said troopers continue to follow up on leads to try to find the 34-year-old Burham, who escaped from the Warren County Prison in downtown Warren late Thursday night.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday in Warren, Lt. Col. George Bivens, deputy commissioner of operations for the Pennsylvania State Police, said some of those leads included possible sightings Monday night and the breaking-in of unoccupied and unsecured structures or cabins in the national forest.\n\n\"It appears there may have been entry at some point in time in the past,\" Bivens said, referencing public and private cabins and structures associated with oil and gas wells in the forest.\n\n\"Some of these structures are not checked on very often and so the fact that we find one that it appears someone may have been in there, doesn't necessarily mean it was Burham,\" he added. \"That's where we use additional steps to try and determine whether it may have been or not.\"\n\nBivens said none of the possible sightings of Burham have \"panned out.\"\n\nHe added that police continue to find items connected to Burham that indicate he remains in the \"general area,\" which he defined as northwestern Pennsylvania. Bivens declined to identify those items.\n\nBivens reiterated that Burham should be considered armed and dangerous, and that Burham has been able to get a hold of firearms before and is likely to do so while on the run.\n\nBurham is accused of escaping by climbing on a pullup exercise machine in the prison recreation yard, getting on to a roof and then sliding off the prison roof with a rope made of bedsheets tied together, as the Erie Times-News has reported.\n\nBurham is from Russell, near Warren, and is still believed to be in the area of Warren County, east of Erie County. State police said searchers are using police dogs, drones and helicopters.\n\nHow dangerous is Michael Burham?\n\nBurham is wanted in connection with the May 11 fatal shooting of Kala Hodgkin, 34, of Jamestown, in Chautauqua County, New York, north of Warren. Though he has yet to be charged in that case, Burham is a \"prime suspect\" in the killing, the U.S. Marshals Service said. At the time of Hodgkin's death, Burham was wanted a charge that he had raped her, according to court records.\n\nBurham fled the area after Hodgkin's death. He is accused of kidnapping an elderly couple in Sheffield, in Warren County, on May 20, and stealing their SUV, which he used to drive to South Carolina. He was captured there on May 24 after a multi-agency manhunt. The couple was found unharmed in a cemetery in South Carolina.\n\nBurham was eventually returned to Warren. He was placed in the Warren County Prison on $1 million bond on June 19.\n\n\"Burham is a self-taught survivalist with military training and could potentially be holed up in a wooded area,\" state police said in a news release. \"He is to be considered armed and dangerous and we are asking the public not to approach.\"\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service, which is assisting the state police, said \"Burham has an extensive and violent criminal history and should be considered armed and dangerous.\"\n\nWhere might Michael Burham be?\n\nState police have indicated the search of Burham has stretched into the Allegheny National Forest. Stockpiles and small campsites believed to be connected to Burham have been in the area, police also said, without offering specifics.\n\n\"I don't want him to know what we have found or haven't found,\" Bivens said on Monday.\n\nBurham was last known to be wearing a prison-issued denim jacket, an orange-striped jumpsuit and orange Croc-style shoes, \"but it it possible for him to have changed clothing,\" state police said. He is 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 160 pounds, has brown hair and brown eyes and has a tattoo of a tiger on his right arm.\n\nHave any rewards been offered in the search for Michael Burham?\n\nState police urge those with information on Burham to call the state police command post at 717-265-9650. The public can also call the state police barracks in Warren at 814-728-3600.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to $7,500 for information that helps lead to Burham's capture. Warren County Crime Stoppers is offering another $2,000. Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers added an additional $10,000 for a total reward of $19,500, and Bivens said on Thursday that the Marshals Service had also added to the award, bringing the new total to $22,000.\n\nAccording to the Marshals Service, other agencies involved in the manhunt for Burham include the city of Warren police, Warren County Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Border Patrol, Warren County sheriff, Chautauqua County sheriff, Jamestown Police, Bradford police and the Pennsylvania Game Commission.\n\nStaff writer Tim Hahn contributed to this report.\n\nContact Ed Palattella at epalattella@timesnews.com.

They did not say whether they still planned to burn the final piece of the event: the main Temple of the Heart. The event normally ends on Labor Day.\n\nIn place of the raucous parties earlier in the week, attendees spent Sunday striking their camps as techno pumped more quietly.\n\nAttendees had been told on Friday to shelter in place and conserve food, fuel and water amid heavy rains that made driving out of the swampy desert venue almost impossible. Sunday night, organizers said they expected roads out of the event to be passable Monday morning.\n\n\"We have confidence in communal effort and civic responsibility,\" organizers said in a statement. \"This is a good moment to (keep) those principles in mind.\"\n\nSome online statements that participants were barred from leaving were untrue, organizers said. \"Burning Man’s advice is to delay departure to avoid getting stuck, but people are free to leave.\"\n\nStill, some with flights to catch took advantage of a break in the weather to walk out of the event's perimeter in hopes of hitching a ride back to Reno, about 90 miles south.\n\nThey make up a small portion of the 73,257 people who were in attendance Friday night. By Sunday the population was at around 72,000.\n\nMost attendees took advantage of the improved weather Sunday afternoon to walk the desert floor one last time to admire the remaining art. Some visited still-open free bars hosted by other camps, or dismantled their elaborate shade structures and dance stages.\n\nBurning Man is guided by 10 principles, including \"radical self-reliance,\" where attendees are encouraged to \"discover, exercise and rely on their inner resources.\" The entire event's ethos reflects that, and there's no food or merchandise sales permitted during the event, although many camps give out free food via a published schedule.\n\nSitting in the center of the city, Amanda Clark of Portland, Oregon, texted with her husband to let him know she wouldn't be home as planned, and to get their dogs out of boarding when he came back from his own trip. Clark said she's ready to leave but was respecting the driving ban, which was expected to remain in place until Monday afternoon.\n\n\"You get out when you get out,\" she said. \"You want to be safe driving out so you don't make it harder for other people by getting stuck.\"\n\nMonday's weather is forecast to be generally clear with some thundershowers, with temperatures in the mid-70s, a far cry from the sometimes baking heat and dush of the event.\n\nVehicle traffic halted in muddy mess\n\nIt began raining Friday, turning the normally rock-hard desert floor into a muddy mess almost impossible to walk or drive on. Burning Man officials said only four-wheel-drive vehicles with adequate tires appeared capable of navigating the streets.\n\nSunday arrived to more mud, more stranded vehicles and more frustration for people who wanted to leave. Organizers said people are free to walk out of the event but noted it would mean a 5-mile trudge across the mud to reach the nearest paved road. Organizers were deploying buses to nearby Gerlach that could shuttle people to Reno if they were able to trek off the playa on foot.\n\nDespite Burning Man's frequent requests to stay put, a bumper-to-bumper stream of RVs and cars were seen driving south on State Route 447 through the small community of Nixon on Sunday afternoon. Many stopped for gas at the Nixon Store.\n\nReno resident Jean Parraguirre took a chance and started walking to the entrance from her campsite at Burning Man on Sunday morning, hoping to get back to Reno. She was able to get a ride after about 15 minutes from a stranger.\n\nThey stopped at Nixon before heading on to Reno.\n\n“The conditions are really rugged out there,” said Parraguirre, who was at her fifth Burning Man.\n\n– Siobhan McAndrew, Reno Gazette-Journal\n\nOne sticking point – unserviced Porta-potties\n\nBurning Man’s thousands of porta-potties quickly became disgusting, muddy and almost-overflowing messes as conditions kept the event's residents from driving home – and service trucks from accessing the site.\n\nThe portable toilets are normally serviced multiple times a day during the weeklong event, a must given the high demand. Although some people camp in RVs, many people use tents and depend on the portable toilets.\n\nA survey of several porta-potty banks on Sunday revealed thick clumps of mud in almost all of them, toilet paper strewn outside, and nearly full holding tanks. Some were also littered with empty plastic bottles people had used to store their urine overnight and then poured into the porta-potties.\n\nBy Sunday evening, however, organizers said \"sanitation trucks are moving through the city ensuring portable toilets are functional and clean.\"\n\nDespite hardships, a 'lovely' experience\n\n\"I'm not mad at all,\" said repeat attendee Calvin Seleen of Portland. \"I've learned to be prepared. We're just inconvenienced. Although I guess if you have to use the portapotties you're majorly inconvenienced.\"\n\nWalking down a muddy street carrying platform shoes in garbage bags, Martha Diaz of California said her first trip to Burning Man was a success. \"I've had a good time, big time,\" said Diaz as she headed to find her car and leave. \"I'm just a little frustrated because I was supposed to work tomorrow. I'm trying to get out of here and so far I can't.\"\n\nBarbara Wahl, 50, of Eugene, Oregon, sat in a folding chair in the sun reading an Isaac Asimov novel, little betraying her anxiety to get going. A nurse, she said she needs to get back to work soon.\n\nWahl attended Burning Man once 20 years ago and hadn’t been back until now. She said it was a positive experience overall.\n\n\"It’s been lovely. The art has been great the people have been great,\" she said. \"I’m just a little anxious about leaving.”\n\nHiking out to see her cat, daughter and job\n\nFrancheska Cermeno was hiking out Sunday, hoping to catch a ride back to Reno. Still wearing a fur vest and with plastic bags taped over for feet, she said she needed to get home to Tennessee soon.\n\n\"Everybody else from my camp is from California so they are just going to wait it out. But I need to get back,\" she said. \"My cat. My daughter. My job. I need to be in Tennessee by tomorrow so I need to be at the airport today.”\n\nShanell Snyder, of Washington state, walked the roads Sunday with her husband and mother-in-law, hoping to find a clear path out.\n\n“The plan was to leave last night, We all have work,” she said. “We will leave when we can, I guess. ... It’s still a blast. It’s probably all good − until we get stuck here for days and days.”\n\nAs they packed up camp, Mel Cherne and Clint Randolph said they found the overall experience this year to be average. They didn't mind that the highlight of the annual event, the burning of the Man, had not taken place. Cherne said he mostly came to support his son, who had several DJ slots at dance parties.\n\nBurning Man 2023:With no estimate of reopening time, Burners party in the rain and mud\n\nOne death reported\n\nAuthorities on Sunday were investigating a death out of the more than 70,000 attendees at the festival. Organizers said there had been a death on September 1 unrelated to the weather.\n\n\"Our emergency services department reached a call for service extremely quickly for a male, approximately 40 years old, and could not resuscitate the patient. \"\n\nFestival deaths are not uncommon. In 2019, Shane Billingham, 33, of New Zealand, was found dead in his vehicle. Toxicology results later found a lethal concentration of carbon monoxide in his blood. Burning Man was not held in 2020 or 2021 because of the pandemic, although people showed up on the playa anyway for unofficial gatherings.\n\nIn an event that horrified witnesses in 2017, Aaron Joel Mitchell ran into the fire as The Man effigy burned, dodging safety rangers and firemen, and threw himself into the flames. Mitchell, 41, was pronounced dead after being flown to the burn center at UC-Davis.\n\nAlicia Cipicchio of Jackson, Wyo., 29, died at Burning Man in 2014 when she was hit by an art car. The Humboldt General Hospital told the Reno Gazette Journal at the time that at least two others had died at Burning Man since the hospital began providing medical response in 2011.\n\nAnother attendee was killed by an art car in 2003, Burning Man officials told the Reno Gazette Journal. Art cars are like parade floats and include elaborate decorations, lighting and areas for groups of people to sit down or stand.\n\n− Peggy Santoro, Reno Gazette-Journal\n\nWhat is Burning Man?\n\nThe fest takes its name from a giant, humanesque sculpture that is the centerpiece, changing in appearance year to year. Called The Man, the sculpture is ignited and burned to cap off the event.\n\nIt began in 1986, when two men burned an eight-foot tall human-shaped sculpture in San Francisco’s Baker Beach as a small crowd gathered to watch the first annual Burning Man. Today, tens of thousands of people gather in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert each summer for about nine days to create a temporary city known for its communal living and eccentric displays of art and expression. “Burners” create a kind of utopia, building villages, a medical center, an airport and performance stages.\n\nBurning Man co-founder Larry Harvey laid out 10 principles of Burning Man in 2004, among them inclusion of all who wish to take part, unconditional sharing and gift-giving, self-reliance and civic responsibility. Burning Man is all about self-expression and the rejection of corporatism and capitalism − instead of using money, attendees borrow, barter and trade.\n\n− Francisco Guzman, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/07/burning-man-2023-festival-art-photos/70783798007/", "title": "Burning Man 2023: See photos of the art in Nevada's Black Rock ...", "text": "After thousands of people were stranded for days in foot-deep mud because of heavy rains at Burning Man, the annual event has come to an end.\n\nAbout 73,000 people attended the event this year at Nevada’s Black Rock Desert, which featured a variety of different art forms, including sculptures and installations.\n\nBurning Man started in 1986 when founders Larry Harvey and Jerry James burned a human-shaped sculpture at Baker Beach in San Francisco.

But organizers of the annual desert event advised festivalgoers to stick around until Tuesday to ease traffic on the swamped roads.\n\n“Please know that while conditions are improving and roads are drying, the playa is still muddy and may be difficult to navigate in some neighborhoods and down certain streets,” organizers cautioned drivers.\n\nBy 4 p.m. PDT, officials reported that was it taking departing attendees five hours to travel approximately five miles back to the nearest paved road. The Burning Man exodus has been known for its long departure times as thousands of cars and trailers leave the desert, which can take multiple hours.\n\nOn Friday, attendees of the counterculture enclave were told to shelter in place and conserve food, fuel and water amid heavy rains that made driving out of the desert venue almost impossible.\n\nThe culmination of the nine-day event - the burning of a towering sculpture called The Man - is planned for Monday evening, a day after organizers called it off. That is expected to be followed by the burn of the large-scale art piece Chapel of Babel at midnight. The event normally ends on Labor Day.\n\nMany people are delaying their departure until the burning of the towering Man effigy. Organizers said approximately 60,000 remained as of midday Monday, down from an event high of 73,000 reported on Friday.\n\n'We're making the most of it'\n\nBy 8:30 a.m., a growing stream of vehicles headed toward the exit. Hundreds waited in the drying mud to board buses back to Reno or San Francisco. The “burner buses” are intended to reduce vehicle trips to Burning Man and were canceled Friday when driving was banned.\n\nFirst to leave were the trucks and SUVs, followed by brave two-wheel-drive sedans. Although some streets remained virtually impassible, most other roads were well-packed and mostly dry.\n\nSitting in her white Nissan van and rubbing the sleep out of her eyes with her Burning Man-themed fingers, Emily Picart of Denver listened to the Burning Man radio station in hopes of an update.Picart and her campmates are scheduled to fly to California from Denver Thursday and they need to leave with enough time to get home first.“I’m not in a super rush. I’m kind of just rolling with it,” she said with a yawn.Like many attendees, Picart said she always anticipated Burning Man would be a challenge, as it has been every year she has gone. This year was no different.“We have enough resources. We never thought we would run out of food. But there was a time when it was raining where I worried it wouldn’t stop raining,\" she said. “But I always knew we eventually get out. I knew we’d be good.”\n\nMost attendees took advantage of the improved weather to walk the desert floor one last time to admire the remaining art. Some visited still-open free bars hosted by other camps, or dismantled their elaborate shade structures and dance stages.\n\nSitting at a free mobile bar as people drank cocktails and coffee at 8 a.m. Monday, Paul Porras of Arizona laughed at the mainstream media’s breathless coverage of the “stranded” burners. “I feel bad for my family who are worried about me, but I’m legit having the best time of my life,” said Porras, 32. “Rain or shine we’re making the most of it.”\n\nBurning Man 2023:What is Burning Man? What to know about its origin, name and what people do there\n\nWhat is Burning Man?\n\nThe annual gathering attracts tens of thousands of people to Nevada’s Black Rock Desert each summer. Attendees, known as \"Burners,\" create a temporary city in the remote desert and participate in a mix of wilderness camping and avant-garde performances for about nine days.\n\nMore than 700 people help build the layout and infrastructure of Black Rock City, according to the Burning Man website. The group spends several weeks setting up and tearing down the temporary city before and after the event.\n\n\"We also work with Burning Man participants, cooperating agencies, and our worldwide community to ensure that Black Rock City becomes a reality, and then vanishes without a trace,\" according to the festival's website.\n\nThe first event was launched on a San Francisco beach in 1986, where two men burned an eight-foot tall human-shaped sculpture as a small crowd gathered to watch. Now, nearly 80,000 artists, musicians and activists attend the festival.\n\nBurning Man is guided by 10 principles, including \"radical self-reliance,\" where attendees are encouraged to \"discover, exercise and rely on their inner resources.\" The entire event's ethos reflects that, and there's no food or merchandise sales permitted during the event, although many camps give out free food via a published schedule.\n\nThis year's event was marred by a late-summer storm that stranded people for days in foot-deep mud. Authorities on Sunday were investigating a death out of the more than 70,000 attendees at the festival. Organizers said there had been a death on Sept. 1 unrelated to the weather.\n\n\"Our emergency services department reached a call for service extremely quickly for a male, approximately 40 years old, and could not resuscitate the patient.\"\n\nIn recent years, other disruptions have also stalled the festival.

Spooner said his tent got wet on Friday night and he retrieved dry bedding from his car via a long, slippery walk. \"Survival mode, here we go.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management released a statement Saturday, saying Burning Man entry is now closed for good:\n\n\"Officials from BLM and the Pershing County Sheriff’s Office have closed ingress to the Burning Man event effective immediately and for the remainder of the event. Participants inbound for the event should turn around and head home.\n\nRain over the last 24 hours has created a situation that required a full stop of vehicle movement on the playa. More rain is expected over the next few days and conditions are not expected to improve enough to allow vehicles to enter the playa.\"\n\nThe BLM is the federal agency overseeing the public land that Burning Man is held on.\n\nThe sheriff’s office said the death occurred during the festival but provided no further details, KNSD-TV reported.\n\nThere was no estimated time for reopening, and thousands of attendees are facing the potential of missing flights, failing to return rental cars or failing to return to work Tuesday. The event is set to officially end Monday but many people begin leaving Saturday night or Sunday.\n\nThe closures and order to remain in shelter come as the event was supposed to reach its zenith on Saturday night with the burning of the giant wooden Man effigy towering over the temporary city. All vehicle traffic within the encampment has been halted, including servicing for the thousands of portable toilets that make the event possible. Organizers have also begun rationing ice sales.\n\nMany attendees appeared to remain in good spirits, playing beer pong in the muddy streets or splashing in the standing water. Techno continued echoing around the encampment, and spontaneous dance parties kept breaking out. Walking was almost impossible Saturday morning, but started to improve as the ground began to dry. Then it began raining again.\n\nGiven the conditions, which include forecast rain Sunday, it appears unlikely anyone will be permitted to drive out soon. Burning Man officials have not provided a comprehensive update on conditions, departure timing or even the multiple art burns scheduled for Saturday and Sunday. Longtime attendees said they can't remember a burn with this much rain.\n\nEarlier, organizers banned vehicle traffic from the roads Friday afternoon and kept the exit gates closed as Saturday morning. Even walking was treacherous as thick, slimy mud clung to shoes and anything else it touched.\n\nOrganizers on Friday and Saturday warned attendees to conserve their food and water, indicating the closures could be lengthy. The Burning Man radio station known as BMIR and a social media account have been providing updates to attendees.\n\nCell phone service is virtually nonexistent at the event, and only a few people have access to satellite Internet for updates. Burning Man attendees are expected to be completely self-sufficient for the duration of their stay, bringing in all the food, water and shelter they need.\n\nDawn brought a growing realization for attendees that they might not be going home as planned, given rain forecast for later Saturday into Sunday. And while Saturday morning is usually full of anticipation for the Man effigy burn, this Saturday arrived quietly.\n\nOnly a few people braved the muddy roads, trying to find their way back to their camps after a night of partying elsewhere.\n\nAfter using the portable toilets, Angelov Franco of Colombia hiked up the garbage bags on his feet and duck-walked across the muddy street toward his camp.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Monday, the 4th of September 2023. Today, mud and muck at Burning Man. Plus, how a State Department office aims to build relationships with young people around the world, and what's with these latest food recalls?\n\n♦\n\nIt was a rare weekend of rain and mud at Burning Man. Some 73,000 attendees at the festival in the Nevada desert became stranded after rains turned a usually sandy area into deep mud, nearly impossible to walk or drive on. Organizers said people were free to walk out of the event, but the majority stayed hunched down in their RVs or tents. Burning Man takes its name from a giant sculpture that's ignited and burned to cap off the event, and it began in 1986. Today, tens of thousands of people gather each summer for about nine days in Nevada's Black Rock Desert to create a temporary city known for its communal living and eccentric displays of art and expression. Burners create a kind of utopia building villages, a medical center and airport along with performance stages. That utopia was put to the test this weekend. Porta-potty toilets went days without being serviced, despite being the main bathroom options. And amid the heaviest rains, many people were unable to move around even short distances. Authorities said yesterday they were also investigating a death at the festival, though organizers say the man died on Friday, unrelated to the weather.\n\nDeaths at Burning Man are not uncommon. A man died in 2019 after he was found dead in his vehicle with a lethal concentration of carbon monoxide found in his blood. And in a disturbing 2017 incident, a man died after throwing himself into the main fire display.\n\n♦\n\nIt was another foreign trip for former Iowa congresswoman Abby Finkenauer in her new role as special envoy for the Global Youth Issues office, a global office within the State Department that formed after the 2010 Arab Spring anti-government protests. It's focus: build relationships with young people around the world. I spoke with USA TODAY Congress Campaigns and Democracy Reporter Rachel Looker for more. Rachel, thanks for hopping on 5 Things.\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCan you just start by telling us a bit about former Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer's career and story?\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nSo Abby Finkenauer has a really interesting story in how she became involved in public service. She told me from a very young age, she was always interested in what was happening in the world around her. She begged her parents at 10 years old for a subscription to Newsweek. She would always sit around the family dinner table talking politics and current events with her relatives. And it really started for her when she joined the U.S. House Page Program. And when she came back, the interest in politics sort of just stuck. She went to college and then she saw that there was an open State House seat available. She decided to run, and at 24 years old, she was elected to the Iowa State House, which is where she grew up. And then shortly after that, four years later, there was a U.S. House seat available in her district. So Finkenauer decided to run and she won. She became the first congresswoman from Iowa to head to the House of Representatives in Washington D.C. and she was the youngest female to be elected to the U.S. House in DC.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd right on brand, Finkenauer is now special envoy for the Global Youth Issues Office. Rachel, what does this office aim to achieve?\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nSo the Global Youth Issues Office, it formed about 10 years ago under the Department of State. And its main focus is to really build relationships with young people all around the world. So it started following the Arab Spring, which were a series of pro-democracy protests and uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, challenging authoritarianism, basically. So Finkenauer said that this office really came to be as a focus to ensure that young people have a seat at the table when we're looking at diplomacy.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what do some of the program's participants say about their experiences?\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nSo I was able to speak with one of the program participants who called it a life-changing experience. He is from Vietnam. He started his own coffee business where he works to hire youth who come from challenging backgrounds, some who've suffered domestic violence or dropped out of school. And he said the real positive from participating in this program was getting to learn and connect with so many other people around the world, all people who have similar interests in trying to make their communities a better place wherever that may be. And getting to learn from those people and connect with them was something that was really invaluable lessons that he was able to take home with him back in Vietnam.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Rachel, a major barrier toward getting young people involved in politics is this sense of disillusionment with corruption around the world, this feeling that no matter what, you can't get your voice heard. What do young people say about this issue globally and how does this office address those concerns?\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nThat's a great question. So the office really focuses on making sure that young people have a seat at the table. Finkenauer told me as important it is for her to kind of share her story and her experience in public service, she wants to hear from these young people, to hear about what issues matter to them, what are some of the most important things they would like to address or fix in their communities, and then making sure that they have that space to talk about these issues, and that they have the tools to try to take action in the best way that they can.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat other issues do youth care about globally that this office works to address?\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nThree that she highlighted for me were climate change, corruption in government and disinformation. And the office addresses all of those through different programs that they host and initiatives. But she really said it comes down to just providing actionable tools that young people can use to make a difference, and have these conversations to talk about ideas and talk about solutions, and brainstorm together from different backgrounds and different countries all around the world so that young people are equipped to try to address some of the biggest problems our whole entire globe is facing.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nRachel Looker, thanks so much.\n\nRachel Looker:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced yesterday that defense minister Oleksii Reznikov will be replaced this week. He cited the need for \"new approaches and different formats of interaction, both with the military and with society.\" He said that Crimean lawmaker Rustem Umerov would take over the role. Umerov was previously involved with the exchange of prisoners of war and evacuations of civilians from Russian occupied territories. He was also part of the delegation in negotiations with Russia over the U.N.-backed grain deal. The change in leadership comes as Ukraine's counteroffensive has stalled in recent weeks.

I spoke with USA TODAY Senior Reporter Jessica Guynn for more and whether food recalls in general are becoming more common. Hello, Jessica, welcome back to the show.\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nHi. Thanks so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what products has Trader Joe's recalled in recent weeks?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, quite a few of them. This week, Trader Joe's alerted us that some black bean tamales may contain undeclared milk. That seemed pretty innocuous compared to the multi-grain crackers that may contain metal, two different kinds of cookies that may contain rocks, and broccoli cheddar soup and cooked falafel that might contain insects. These are all recalls involving physical contamination. I don't know about you, but I don't really want to chew on bugs and rocks. Trader Joe's is urging all of us if we have these products to throw them away or bring them back to the store for a refund.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat else does the company say about this string of recalls and what do experts say about whether or not Trader Joe's has a bigger recall problem?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nSo the company says that the timing, the close timing of these recalls is just coincidental. It also says the recalls are a direct result of how aggressively and carefully they track these kinds of issues in their products. Their basic message is they don't wait around for regulators to tell them what to do. They just do the right thing by their customers. And that sounds really good.\n\nThe experts say they're a little troubled by just how many recalls there have been in such a short span of time. They say it's true that modern supply chains are long, complex, and there's just lots of opportunities for contamination to take place. But six recalls in the span of five weeks is a lot more than they expected to see from a chain like Trader Joe's, and they say that raises quality control issues.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIt seems like we hear more and more stories about food recalls. Are they becoming more common in the U.S.?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nIt, like most things, depends on who you ask. Yes, we're seeing more product recalls because food products have more ingredients and are more processed than they used to be. But according to PIRG, food product recalls by the FDA and USDA aren't more common, and that in itself could be a problem. There's a shortage of food inspectors working for the government and for companies. People are not going to the doctor as often for ailments caused by food contamination. So we may be missing some of these problems.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJessica, how can people protect themselves from contaminated food?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, one thing you can do, which I am going to do, is sign up for push notifications for FDA and USDA recalls. You can also make sure if you have a loyalty card that your grocery store alerts loyalty card holders to recalls. And there are certain groups of people who should be extra cautious. If you have a food allergy, be careful. 42% of food recalls are for undeclared allergens. And then of course, babies, young kids, people who are older, pregnant, immunocompromised or anyone in fragile health should really take care when purchasing these heavily processed foods.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Jessica Guynn, thank you as always.\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nThank you so much for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFlamingo sightings have popped up all over the Eastern U.S. in recent days, and experts say Hurricane Idalia is to blame. The iconic pink birds first started showing up all over Florida, but by Saturday, three days after Idalia made landfall, flamingo sightings had been reported in Alabama, both Carolinas, Tennessee, Virginia, and even Ohio. Colonies of the birds are found in the Caribbean, including the Yucatan Peninsula and Mexico, where Idalia lingered for days building up strength before barreling into Florida's west coast last week, and then moving across other parts of the South. It's not unheard of for birds to be caught up in hurricanes and then dropped out somewhere else, but it's unprecedented to get this many flamingos in this many places, according to Greg Neise from the American Birding Association. You can read more with a link in today's show notes.\n\nAnd if you didn't know, before Labor Day became a federal holiday, it was recognized by labor activists and individual states. In 1894, Congress passed an act making the first Monday in September of each year a legal holiday and President Grover Cleveland signed it into law.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

{"question_id": "20230908_12", "search_time": "2023/09/09/05:38", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-faq/index.html", "title": "Everything you need to know about Biden's student loan forgiveness ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe fate of President Joe Biden’s federal student loan forgiveness program, which promises to deliver up to $20,000 of debt relief for millions of borrowers, lies with the Supreme Court.\n\nThe justices heard arguments on February 28 in two cases concerning the forgiveness program, and a decision is expected by late June or early July.\n\nAbout 26 million people had already applied by the time a federal district court judge struck down the program on November 10, 2022 – prompting the government to stop taking applications. No debt has been canceled thus far.\n\nThe administration officially launched the application on October 17, 2022, following a brief “beta period” during which its team assessed whether tweaks were needed.\n\nIf the Supreme Court ultimately allows the program to move forward, not every student loan borrower is eligible for the debt relief. First, only federally held student loans qualify. Private student loans are excluded.\n\nSecond, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. Individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. Pell grants are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors including their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and end up in default.\n\nHere’s what else borrowers need to know about the proposed student loan forgiveness plan:\n\nWhat are the legal challenges to Biden’s forgiveness plan?\n\nThe Biden administration faced several lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program, two of which have made it to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs argue that the Department of Education is overstepping its authority.\n\nOne of the lawsuits was brought by six Republican-led states, headed by Nebraska, that argue that the student loan forgiveness program violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations.\n\nA lower court judge dismissed this lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. In November, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and blocked the program.\n\nThe other challenge that the Supreme Court heard was brought by two individual borrowers – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor – who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education’s decision to provided targeted student loan debt relief to some.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed with the backing of a conservative group called the Job Creators Network Foundation. A federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, striking down the program on November 10.\n\nLawyers for the government say that Congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a memo from the Department of Justice.\n\nWhen will I receive my debt relief?\n\nIt’s unclear when, or if, borrowers will see debt relief under Biden’s program.\n\nAdministration officials expected to be able to grant relief before January, when payments were set resume after the pandemic-related pause expired. But now debt cancellation won’t occur until at least June when the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling.\n\nOn November 22, 2022, the Biden administration extended the pandemic-related pause on payments and interest a final time. Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, student loan interest will resume on September 1 and payments will be due starting in October.\n\nA law passed in early June that addressees the debt ceiling prohibits another extension of the pause.\n\nThe White House has said that it has already approved 16 million applications for debt relief. The Department of Education will hold on to that information so it can quickly process those borrowers’ relief if the government prevails in court.\n\nIf and when the program moves forward, an estimated 8 million borrowers may receive debt relief automatically because the Department of Education already has their income on file.\n\nIf the government restarts taking applications, borrowers can apply online here: https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application.\n\nApplicants can expect to receive an email confirmation once their application is successfully submitted. Then, borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer when the debt cancellation has been applied to their account.\n\nBorrowers were expected to have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.\n\nWhat kind of federal loans are eligible?\n\nThere are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief if the program is allowed to proceed. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.\n\nBut federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan by September 29, 2022.\n\nThe Department of Education initially said these privately held loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action – but reversed course last September when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers.\n\nDefaulted Federal Family Education Loans and defaulted Perkins Loans would be eligible for the debt relief even if they are privately held.\n\nWhat year is the income threshold based on?\n\nIf Biden’s program is allowed to move forward, eligibility is based on a borrower’s adjusted gross income for either tax year 2020 or 2021. Adjusted gross income can be lower than your total wages because it considers tax deductions and adjustments, like contributions made to a 401(k) retirement plan.\n\nA taxpayer’s adjusted gross income can be found on line 11 of IRS Form 1040.\n\nHow will the government know what my income was?\n\nThe Department of Education says it already has income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. If the program is allowed to move forward, those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don’t need to apply.\n\nMillions of other borrowers will need to apply for student loan forgiveness if the Department of Education doesn’t have their income information on file. When they submit the application, borrowers are required to self-attest that their income is under the eligibility threshold. They are required to certify that the information provided is accurate upon penalty of perjury.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that applicants who are “more likely to exceed the income cutoff” will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. Officials expect that just 5% of borrowers with eligible federal student loans would not qualify due to the income threshold.\n\nWill I have to pay taxes on the amount of debt canceled?\n\nBorrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed in 2021.\n\nBut it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. Most states will not tax the forgiveness as income.\n\nI’m a current student. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\n\nYes, some current students would be eligible under Biden’s plan if it’s allowed to take effect. Eligibility for borrowers who filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, as an independent will be based on the individual’s own household income.\n\nEligibility for borrowers who are enrolled as dependent students, generally those under the age of 24, will be based on parental income for either 2020 or 2021.\n\nI have student debt from graduate school. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\n\nYes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold and the program is allowed to be implemented.\n\nI’m a parent and took out a Parent PLUS loan. Am I eligible?\n\nYes, you could be eligible if your income meets the threshold. A parent borrower with federal Parent PLUS loans for multiple children is still only eligible for up to $20,000 of loan forgiveness.\n\nBut a parent is only eligible for up to $20,000 in debt relief if he or she received a Pell grant for his or her own education. If only the child received a Pell grant, the parent is eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness.\n\nHow do I know if I ever received a Pell grant?\n\nMost borrowers can log in to Studentaid.gov to see if they received a Pell grant while enrolled in college. Information about Pell grants received is displayed on the account dashboard and on the My Aid page. This is also where borrowers can find out how much they owe and what kind of loans they have.\n\nBorrowers who received a Pell grant before 1994 won’t see their Pell grant information online, but they are still eligible for the $20,000 in student loan forgiveness.\n\nAs long as borrowers received at least one Pell grant, they are eligible.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that eligible borrowers who have received Pell grants will automatically receive the additional debt relief.\n\nAm I eligible for forgiveness if my loans are in default?\n\nYes, defaulted federal student loans would be eligible for debt relief under Biden’s program.\n\nFor borrowers who have a remaining balance on their defaulted student loans after the cancellation is applied, there will be an opportunity to get out of default once payments resume later this year as part of what the Department of Education is calling its “Fresh Start” initiative.\n\nHow will my payments change going forward?\n\nBorrowers who have debt remaining after either $10,000 or $20,000 is wiped away could see their monthly payment amounts recalculated if they are enrolled in a standard repayment plan. Under a standard repayment plan, borrowers pay a fixed amount that ensures loans are paid off within 10 years.\n\nBorrowers who are already enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan are not likely to see their monthly payment amounts change due to the forgiveness, because their payments are based on household income and family size.\n\nBorrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 2020 because of the government’s pandemic-related pause.\n\nWhat about Biden’s new income-driven repayment plan?\n\nAlong with Biden’s August announcement about canceling some federal student loan debt, he also said he would create a new plan that would make repayment more manageable for borrowers.\n\nThere are currently several repayment plans available for federal student loan borrowers that lower monthly payments by capping them at a portion of their income.\n\nThe new income-driven repayment plan proposal will cap payments at 5% of a borrower’s discretionary income, down from 10% that is offered in most current plans, as well as reduce the amount of income that is considered discretionary. It would also forgive remaining balances after 10 years of repayment, instead of 20 years.\n\nBiden is also proposing that the new plan cover the borrower’s unpaid monthly interest. This could be very helpful for people whose monthly payments are so low that they don’t cover their monthly interest charge and end up seeing their balances explode, growing larger than what was originally borrowed.\n\nThe new plan is currently going through a formal rulemaking process, and the Department of Education has said it expects provisions of the new plan to take effect later this year.\n\nCan I get a refund for what I paid during the pandemic pause?\n\nYes. Borrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 13, 2020, because of the pandemic-related pause. But if borrowers did make payments, they are allowed to contact their loan servicer to request a refund.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-status/index.html", "title": "Where Biden's student loan forgiveness plan stands | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program remains on hold while a federal appeals court considers a legal challenge brought by six GOP-led states.\n\nThe Biden administration continues to accept applications for student loan forgiveness, which is worth up to $20,000 per borrower, but it is not currently allowed to cancel student loan debt due to a temporary, administrative hold put on the program by the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals on October 21.\n\nNext, the appeals court will decide whether to grant a preliminary injunction requested by the states. If granted, the student loan forgiveness program could be kept on hold while litigation continues and the court hears from both parties on the merits of the case. If the injunction is not granted, debt cancellation may begin while the appeal plays out.\n\nThe ruling on the preliminary injunction could come at any time.\n\nA lower court judge dismissed the lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the states did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett also rejected a separate challenge to Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, declining to take up an appeal brought by a Wisconsin taxpayers group.\n\nOn November 10, a federal judge in Texas struck down Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, declaring it illegal.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by a conservative group, the Job Creators Network Foundation, in October on behalf of two borrowers who did not qualify for debt relief. The Biden administration is also facing lawsuits from Arizona’s GOP Attorney General Mark Brnovich and the Cato Institute.\n\nMany of the lawsuits claim that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to broadly cancel student loan debt. But lawyers for the government argue that Congress gave the secretary of education the power to discharge debt in a 2003 law known as the HEROES Act.\n\nTwenty-six million people have so far applied for student loan forgiveness with 16 million borrowers approved for relief, the Biden administration said on November 10. The application opened on October 14.\n\nBut borrowers should not expect to see their debts canceled until the appeals court lifts the hold on the program.\n\nHow can borrowers apply for student loan forgiveness?\n\nBorrowers can apply online here: https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application.\n\nApplicants can expect to receive an email confirmation once their application is successfully submitted. Then, borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer if and when the debt cancellation has been applied to their account.\n\nBorrowers have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.\n\nIf the court allows the administration to grant student loan forgiveness, an estimated 8 million eligible borrowers may receive the debt cancellation automatically because the Department of Education already has their income information on file. Those borrowers may begin to see their debt canceled on November 15, at the earliest, if there is not a legal pause in place at that time.\n\nWho may be eligible for student loan forgiveness?\n\nIf Biden’s program is allowed to move forward, individual borrowers who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness.\n\nThere are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief.

Beginning last fall, the federal loans serviced by FedLoan have been transferred in stages to several other servicers. About 2 million accounts still need to be transferred.\n\nIn July, loans held by borrowers enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program will start being transferred to the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, known as MOHELA. These transfers will continue throughout the summer, according to the Department of Education.\n\nIn recent years, FedLoan was tasked with handling the loans for every borrower seeking debt relief from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which cancels the debt of government and nonprofit workers after making 10 years of qualifying payments. Once a borrower indicated they want to enroll in the program, their loans were transferred to FedLoan.\n\nBut FedLoan drew criticism from borrower advocates for making errors and providing misinformation to borrowers about the qualifications. In 2021, PHEAA settled a lawsuit brought by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, alleging the loan servicer violated state and federal consumer protection laws. PHEAA agreed to provide individual audits to all 200,000 Massachusetts borrowers it services.\n\nLast year, the Biden administration temporarily expanded eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to include borrowers who have older loans that didn’t originally qualify as well as those who were in the wrong repayment plan but met the other requirements. By the end of May, the Department of Education had approved forgiveness for close to 145,000 borrowers under this waiver.\n\nWhat borrowers can expect\n\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness borrowers can expect to receive several notices as their loans are transferred.\n\nA notice from FedLoan is expected to be sent at least 15 days before the transfer occurs, followed by a welcome notice from MOHELA once the transfer is complete.\n\nBorrowers’ full account details should be available from MOHELA no later than 10 business days after the loan transfer date included in the transfer notification sent from FedLoan, according to the MOHELA website.\n\nThe loans are being transferred, not sold. That means the change will not impact the existing terms, conditions, interest rates, loan discharge or forgiveness programs, or available repayment plans on the loans. The repayment plan a borrower is enrolled in does not change once transferred unless the borrower opts to make a change.\n\nBorrowers are not required to do anything during the transfer process.\n\nFedLoan also services some non-PSLF borrowers. The vast majority of those accounts have already been transferred from FedLoan to other loan servicers, including Aidvantage, EdFinancial or Nelnet.\n\nTwo other loan servicers also ended their contracts with the Department of Education last year. Loans serviced by Navient were transferred to Aidvantage and loans that were serviced by Granite State were transferred to Edfinancial Services. Those transfers were complete by the end of 2021.\n\nThe Department of Education post updates about PSLF processing and loan transfers to its website Studentaid.gov.\n\nHow to qualify for the PSLF waiver\n\nTo take advantage of the temporary PSLF waiver, some borrowers may need to take action by October 31.\n\nBorrowers who previously had a non-qualifying loan, such as the Federal Family Education Loan, must consolidate their debt into a federal Direct Loan and then submit a PSLF form to show qualifying employment by the October deadline. After the consolidation is complete, the new loan will be transferred to MOHELA.\n\nFor those who are currently serviced by FedLoan and are enrolled in the PSLF program, no action is required. Their loans will automatically be transferred to MOHELA over the summer.\n\nThe Department of Education continues to review PSLF borrowers’ past payments to count those who are newly eligible for the forgiveness program. Due to the temporary waiver, it no longer matters what kind of federal student loan a borrower had or what payment plan he or she was enrolled in. All payments will be eligible for the PSLF program if the borrower was working full time for a qualifying employer.\n\nMore changes could be coming for federal student loan borrowers\n\nThe transfer of federal student loans from FedLoan to MOHELA this summer comes as borrowers await to hear whether President Joe Biden decides to extend the pandemic-related pause on payments, as well as if he will act to broadly cancel student loan debt.\n\nPayments are set to resume on federal student loans after August 31 after being paused since March 2020. Federal student loan borrowers’ balances have effectively been frozen during this time. Interest has stopped adding up and collections on defaulted debt have been on hold.\n\nBiden has already extended the pause several times and is facing political pressure to delay the restart date again, which is currently set two months before the midterm elections.\n\nThe President is also facing pressure to cancel some student loan debt for every borrower. In April, Biden said he was considering some broad student loan forgiveness.\n\nOn the campaign trail, he said he would support $10,000 in forgiveness. White House officials have indicated that he is also looking at setting an income threshold so that high-earning borrowers would be excluded from the debt relief.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/student-loans-joe-biden-white-house/index.html", "title": "Biden announces student loan relief for borrowers making less than ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday announced historic new steps to address student loan debt, which includes forgiving up to $20,000 for millions of borrowers and extending the payment freeze one final time until the end of the year.\n\n“Education is a ticket to a better life. … but over time that ticket has become too expensive for too many Americans,” Biden said during a speech from the White House. “All this means that an entire generation is now saddled with unsustainable debt in exchange for an attempt, at least, at a college degree. The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate you may not have access to the middle-class life that the college degree once provided.”\n\nThe President’s sweeping plan on student loans follows extended, down-to-the-wire negotiations at the White House among stakeholders and lawmakers ahead of when payments were set to resume at the end of this month. The decision is already disappointing many, with those on the left arguing that the President should have provided even more loan forgiveness and those on the right asserting that Biden is punishing Americans who avoided going into debt. But it fulfills one of Biden’s campaign promises, issuing major reforms to America’s student loan system and providing relief to millions of current and future borrowers.\n\nBorrowers who hold loans with the Department of Education and make less than $125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received Pell Grants, which are given to students from low- and middle-income families. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000 in loan forgiveness.\n\nBiden said that the administration’s “targeted actions are for families that need it the most: working and middle class people hit especially hard during the pandemic making under $125,000 a year,” emphasizing that “about 90% of the eligible beneficiaries make under $75,000.”\n\n“I understand not everything I’m announcing is going to make everybody happy,” Biden said. “Some think it’s too much – I find it interesting how some of my Republican friends who voted for those tax cuts think we shouldn’t be helping these folks. Some think it’s too little, but I believe my plan is responsible and fair. It focuses the benefit of middle-class and working families, it helps both current and future borrowers and it’ll fix a badly broken system.”\n\nThe Department of Education will announce details on how borrowers can claim this relief through an application in the coming weeks. Millions of borrowers will be able to receive relief automatically based on existing income data.\n\nAdditionally, the department is proposing a federal rule aimed at making the student loan system more manageable for current and future borrowers.\n\nThe proposed rule would change income-based repayment for student loans, cutting in half the amount borrowers would have to pay each month on their undergraduate loans, “while borrowers with both undergraduate and graduate loans will pay a weighted average rate.”\n\nThe proposal would also “raise the amount of income that is considered non-discretionary income and therefore protected from repayment.” And it would forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments rather than 20 years under many income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less, the department said.\n\nThe proposed rule includes other changes, like simplifying borrowers’ choices among loan repayment plans.\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nBiden on Wednesday argued that “the whole economy is better off” as a result of his new plan.\n\n“By resuming student loan payments at the same time we provide targeted relief, we’re taking an economically responsible course. As a consequence, $50 billion dollars a year will start coming back into the Treasury because of the resumption of debt,” he said, later adding, “There is plenty of deficit reduction to pay for the programs … many times over.”\n\nAlthough student debt cancellation will deliver financial relief to millions of Americans, it would shift the cost to Uncle Sam.\n\nA one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning up to $125,000 a year could cost the government nearly $300 billion, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Additional forgiveness for Pell grant recipients was not included in the estimate.\n\nPlus, loan cancellation won’t address the root of the problem: college affordability. There is currently $1.6 trillion of outstanding federal student loan debt. The amount of outstanding debt would return to that level in just four years after $10,000 per borrower was canceled, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nWhite House officials on Wednesday could not provide a topline price estimate for the plan, saying too many unknowns exist to calculate how much the plan might eventually cost.\n\nSusan Rice, the White House’s domestic policy adviser, said it would depend on how many eligible borrowers sign up through the Department of Education to have their loans relieved.\n\n“If 43 million borrowers take it up, that’ll be different than if 50% of those 43 million take it up,” Rice said.\n\nStudent loan cancellation also could increase inflation – though many experts say the effect would be modest, because borrowers generally pay back their student loans over time. They wouldn’t receive a lump sum of money if some of their debt is canceled. They would instead be required to pay less money each month toward their student loan payments.\n\n“The inflationary impact its certainly positive, but I don’t think it would be much. We’re talking about a pretty small impact,” said Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Commentator reacts to Biden's student loan forgiveness plan 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nWarnings over inflation\n\nLarry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary who served as the director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, argued ahead of the announced plan that relief would contribute to inflation.\n\n“I hope the Administration does not contribute to inflation macro economically by offering unreasonably generous student loan relief or micro economically by encouraging college tuition increases,” Summers tweeted on Tuesday, later adding, “Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation. It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college. It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.”\n\nJason Furman, the chairman of former President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, added, “Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless. Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.”\n\nMarc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget – a nonpartisan group that tracks federal spending – argued against the plan in an interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow on “Newsroom” Tuesday morning.\n\nHe believes that canceling $10,000 of debt for each borrower will likely increase inflation, undermine the stated goal of Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act and will not significantly decrease the racial wealth gap.\n\n“The Inflation Reduction Act saves maybe $300 billion dollars in the first 10 years. If we cancel $10,000 of debt and just extend the pause a few months, we’re going to be at about that much in terms of new cost,” he said. “All the deficit reduction will be wiped out. At the same time, we’re probably going to do more to increase inflation from debt cancellation than any inflation reduction from the Inflation Reduction Act.”\n\nIt’s also not easy to target loan forgiveness to those who need it the most and exclude borrowers with higher salaries. An income threshold that cuts off borrowers who earn more than $125,000 a year could help make sure a bigger proportion of the relief goes to low-income borrowers. But some doctors and lawyers, who will eventually be making high incomes, may also reap the benefits.\n\nThe Penn Wharton Budget Model also breaks down the share of forgiven debt by income group assuming that $10,000 is canceled for borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year and households earning less than $250,000.\n\nIt found that one-third of the canceled dollars would go to households who earn less than $50,795 a year. A little more than half of the debt relief would go to those earning between $50,795 and $141,096.\n\nRoughly 14% of the canceled dollars would go to households earning more than $141,096 a year.\n\nPolitical pressure\n\nBiden has been facing political pressure from the left to broadly cancel student loan debt since taking office.\n\nKey Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, had called on Biden to cancel $50,000 per borrower. The President spoke with Schumer, Warren and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia on Tuesday ahead of the expected announcement.\n\nSchumer and Warren said in a joint statement that the decision is “a giant step forward in addressing the student debt crisis.”\n\n“The positive impacts of this move will be felt by families across the country, particularly in minority communities, and is the single most effective action that the President can take on his own to help working families and the economy,” they added.\n\nEarlier this week amid reports of Biden’s plan, NAACP President Derrick Johnson called the reported provisions insufficient and “not how you treat Black voters.”\n\nA senior administration official on Wednesday suggested that the relief it will help “narrow the racial wealth gap.”\n\nAnd Biden, in his remarks, acknowledged that the burden of student debt “is especially heavy on Black and Hispanic borrowers, who on average have less family wealth to pay for it. “\n\nBiden has consistently pushed back on canceling that much, suggesting he would support wiping away $10,000 for borrowers below a certain income threshold. On the campaign trail, Biden called for immediately canceling a minimum of $10,000 in student debt per person as a response to the pandemic, as well as forgiving all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for those borrowers earning up to $125,000 a year. But he had also said he preferred Congress to take action rather than using executive power to do so.\n\nAnd on the right, Republican lawmakers blasted Biden’s new relief plan.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the plan is “yet another way to make inflation even worse” and “reward far-left activists.”\n\n“President Biden’s student loan socialism is a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college, every graduate who paid their debt, and every American who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces in order to avoid taking on debt,” he continued. “This policy is astonishingly unfair.”\n\nAppearing to counter his critics – particularly Republicans who voted for the Trump tax plan – the President said on Wednesday he would “never apologize for helping … working Americans and the middle class – especially not to the same folks who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations.”\n\nBiden said no one complained that the $700 billion in forgiven small business loans as a part of former President Donald Trump’s Covid-19 relief would make inflation worse.\n\nAsked if the debt cancellation was fair to those who had already paid their loans or never took them out in the first place, Biden responded: “Is it fair to the people who, in fact, do not own multi-million businesses and see these guys getting all the tax breaks?”\n\nBiden has already canceled billions of dollars in student loan debt\n\nIn the meantime, Biden has taken a more targeted approach to student debt relief. Most of his efforts have been meant to expand and streamline existing federal student loan forgiveness programs.\n\nBiden’s administration has authorized the cancellation of $32 billion so far – more than any other administration – largely for borrowers who were defrauded by their for-profit colleges and for permanently disabled borrowers.\n\nHe has also temporarily expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that forgives the debt of government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of payments, and made changes to the income-driven repayment plans, bringing millions of borrowers closer to forgiveness.\n\nBut the programs are complicated and don’t always work the way they should. A recent Government Accountability Office report found that few people have qualified for forgiveness under an income-driven repayment plan, for example. The Department of Education had approved forgiveness for a total of 157 loans as of June 1, 2021. Meanwhile about 7,700 loans in repayment may have already been eligible for forgiveness.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Education said in its statement that the administration is “proposing long-term changes” to the PSLF program.\n\n“Specifically, the Department proposed allowing more payments to qualify for PSLF including partial, lump sum, and late payments, and allowing certain kinds of deferments and forbearances – such as those for Peace Corps and AmeriCorps service, National Guard duty, and military service – to count toward PSLF,” the release states.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Phil Mattingly Katie Lobosco Maegan Vazquez", "Phil Mattingly", "Katie Lobosco", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/11/13/feds-simplifying-biden-student-loan-forgiveness-plan/8257418001/", "title": "With Biden student loan forgiveness blocked, feds seek other options", "text": "The president's plan to forgive tens of billions in student loan debt has been blocked, but the administration has still managed to cancel billions in debt through other relief programs.\n\nSome planned changes, however, could make it easier for future borrowers to find relief.\n\nThose changes depend on whether an administration friendly to borrowers remains in the White House.\n\nThe complexity of paying student loans starts early: The federal government offers a grace period of six months to fresh college graduates in which they’re free to skip their payments, similar to the student loan moratorium, as they establish themselves in the world.\n\nThe price of that postponement, however, at least until now, was that interest kept growing on that debt. The feds then capitalize the unpaid interest, that is, they add it to borrowers’ principal balance. At that point, the loan is often larger than what a borrower first took out. The federal government also has capitalized interest after borrowers paused their loan payments.\n\nThe Education Department estimated it charged nearly $22 billion in interest capitalization in fiscal year 2019 alone. (No new interest has been charged on federal student loans since March 2020 thanks to a pause on student loan payments because of the pandemic.)\n\n“It accelerates balance growth and it’s really confusing,” said Sarah Sattelmeyer, a project director studying student loans at New America, a left of center think tank. “So getting rid of it is a win-win.”\n\nThe administration intends to do away with that practice almost entirely, one of many changes to the student loan program formalized in recent weeks. The changes come as a federal district judge in Texas struck down the president's broad plan for student debt forgiveness on Thursday. The Education Department has stopped taking applications for the one-time debt relief, though the administration has said it's working to overturn the judge's ruling. About 26 million people had already applied, and the administration said it was ready to erase the debt of 16 million people.\n\nLatest news:Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals puts Biden's student loan debt forgiveness plan on hold\n\nMore:US judge in Texas halts President Biden's student debt forgiveness plan; appeal filed\n\nAt the same time, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals is considering a request from six conservative states to block the plan, and it's unclear when it will issue its ruling. But the states already have indicated they will appeal to the Supreme Court if they don't receive a favorable ruling.\n\nRegardless of what happens with the wider debt relief plan, Sattelmeyer said the new regulations are likely to make it easier for borrowers to navigate paying their student loans and protect students from predatory colleges.\n\nWhat does debt relief mean to borrowers? Debt forgiveness will change the lives of some borrowers, but fall short for others\n\nThese changes don’t necessarily come with the multibillion dollar price tag of the wider debt relief plan – though they could be expensive – and they won’t touch every borrower. However, put together, they have the potential to ease paying student loans for hundreds of thousands of Americans in the years to come.\n\nThat is, if a friendly president remains in office.\n\nMany of these changes rely on the federal government using the expanded authority that comes with a national emergency. Others have navigated a complicated and esoteric rule-making process that is heavily subject to the whims of the current administration.\n\n“They have not wasted any time or opportunity to make changes that are really beneficial to student loan borrowers,” said Betsy Mayotte, the head of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a group that offers free advice in repaying student loans. “They’ve taken advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A lot of consumers don’t understand that.”\n\nThe one-time debt relief plan makes borrowers earning less than $125,000 annually – or $250,000 for couples, eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness. It’s widely expected to benefit roughly 40 million borrowers. As of November 3, about 26 million people had applied for relief.\n\nWhat will student loan forgiveness cost? Biden's student loan relief plan will cost US about $400 billion, CBO estimates\n\nThe federal government has frozen student loan payments since March 2020. As part of that, the feds also set interest rates at zero percent and told collection agencies to stop trying to recoup overdue debts. The administration previously encouraged borrowers to apply for relief by mid-November to receive the debt relief before the payment pause ends.\n\nTo that end, the administration continues to urge borrowers to apply and has said the Education Department will “process discharges when we are able to do so and you will not need to reapply.”\n\nHow is the administration forgiving student loans in 2022?\n\nThe recent changes don't face the legal scrutiny of wide-ranging debt relief, yet. Starting July 1st, 2023, borrowers who are disabled won't have to have their earnings reviewed for three years after they claim relief. Those who attended a school that closed suddenly will have their debt forgiven automatically after a year. The Education Department also streamlined a debt forgiveness program geared toward public service workers and simplified the process for qualifying for relief through income-driven repayment plans.\n\nIn addition, the administration has said it will discharge the debts of tens of thousands of students who attended predatory institutions like Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute. And the new rules will make it easier for borrowers to sue universities that defrauded them.\n\nPreviously, borrowers generally had to apply for relief individually through the so-called borrower defense rule. The time-intensive and bureaucratic process has left many behind. As of September more than 392,000 applications were awaiting review by the Education Department. The new rule bars institutions from requiring students to sign non-arbitration clauses and allows legal services groups to take on their cases in class-action suits.\n\nAdvocates for students ripped off by predatory institutions, including the National Student Legal Defense Network, have long been pushing for the administration to adopt this practice.\n\nITT Tech students to receive debt relief:Former students to get $4 billion in federal loan forgiveness\n\nThese changes mean “students will now have an opportunity to hold predatory schools accountable,” said Aaron Ament, president of the National Student Legal Defense Network.\n\nAt the same time, the Education Department is set to forgive an additional $6 billion in student loan debt for borrowers who already applied for debt relief under the borrower defense program. That relief will depend on a judge’s approval of a settlement agreement between a group of student borrower advocates representing nearly 200,000 students and the Education Department. The final hearing was Wednesday, and the judge will issue a written decision on that case within a week.\n\nThe borrower advocates sued the administration under former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos because of the department’s delay in processing tens of thousands of applications for relief. The final agreement will grant debt relief to students who attended one of dozens of universities – including the University of Phoenix, Grand Canyon University and DeVry University – and had applied for debt relief via the borrower defense rule before June 20, 2022.\n\nThe federal government still has to decide how to handle borrower defense applications for students who attended a university not included in the settlement list.\n\nDo income-driven repayment plans qualify for student loan forgiveness?\n\nAlong with the mass debt relief plan, Biden recently unveiled its plans for a new income-driven repayment program. It will reduce borrowers’ payments to 5% of their discretionary income. The lowest rate offered now is 10%, though it can vary depending on a borrower's specific plan.\n\nthe federal government lowers the borrowers’ expected payment to match their wages, though doing so extends the life of the loan, often to 20 or 25 years from the standard 10-year repayment period. Nothing prevents them from paying off their debt more quickly, however.\n\nWhat is discretionary income?:And why it matters in student loan repayment\n\nBorrowers who make 10 years of payments will have their debts erased so long as their balance is below $12,000. The proposed changes would also cover borrowers’ unpaid interest so long as they make their monthly payments. The exact details of that plan are still being developed, and the administration is expected to release them in the coming weeks.\n\nRepublicans including Rep. Virginia Foxx, the ranking member on the House’s committee on education, question the proposal and have requested a full cost of what the income-driven plan would cost.\n\nAt the same time, the Education Department plans to conduct a review of payments under income-driven repayment programs that could mean the erasure of some borrowers' balances. Those who have been paying on their loans for 20 to 25 years through these plans at some point will receive automatic forgiveness, even if they’re not enrolled in such a plan now.\n\nThis review hasn’t attracted nearly the same level of attention as the president’s attempt at broad forgiveness, but of all the regulatory changes, Mayotte said, the income-driven waiver has the potential to affect the most borrowers.\n\nIt depends, she said, on how far back the department goes back when reviewing payments. The feds could start in 1994, when the first income-driven plan was introduced. But Mayotte said the agency hadn’t specified a date, which could mean they’re considering all borrowers for the review.\n\nAs of the third quarter of 2022, there were roughly 9 million federal borrowers who are 50 years or older, and about 1.5 million of them were enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. It's unclear how many have been making payments for more than 25 years.\n\nWhat has changed and who qualifies for Public Service Loan Forgiveness\n\nOne of the department’s most touted accomplishments is the revamp of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Top department officials have repeatedly described previous versions of the program as broken. But the agency has said more than 236,000 borrowers with $14 billion in debt have been approved for forgiveness thanks to the changes announced in October 2021.\n\nThe program promises debt relief to borrowers who work in the public service sector for 10 years while making payments on their student loans. The Education Department is supposed to discharge the debt after a decade, but many borrowers found it was nearly impossible to access relief. When Biden took office, only a few thousand had ever had their debt forgiven through the program, according to the Education Department.\n\nWant student loan forgiveness? Millions of jobs qualify for updated program — and yours might be one of them.\n\nThe increase in borrowers qualifying comes thanks to loosening some of the strict eligibility requirements that had been associated with that plan. For example, borrowers had to ensure they had the right type of loan and that they were enrolled in a qualifying income-driven repayment plan.\n\nThe waiver, which expired Oct. 31, 2022, allowed for all kinds of past payments to count toward a borrowers’ eventual forgiveness.\n\nHowever, the Education Department says borrowers still have time to take advantage of some of the waiver's flexibility. The agency will count past payments toward a borrowers' eligibility for forgiveness through the same one-time review for income-driven repayment plans.\n\nBorrowers with commercially held FFEL loans looking to benefit from the relief will need to consolidate their debts into a federal Direct Loan by May 1.\n\nAnother key change: Borrowers will have to show they currently work in a qualifying public service job to qualify for the debt relief. Those jobs include public school teachers and firefighters, but also government employees and attorneys for nonprofits. (Under the waiver, loan holders only had to prove they had worked in a qualifying job at some point in the past.)\n\nIs that student loan phone call a scam? How to avoid scammers and get debt relief safely\n\nAnd starting July 1, 2023 the government will permanently loosen many of the program’s most restrictive requirements. Payments later than 15 days, for example, will now count toward the total required for forgiveness. Borrowers who pause their payment obligations due to cancer treatment, military service or economic hardship will receive credit for the months they miss. Previously, borrowers who consolidated their Direct Loans would lose all progress they had made toward debt relief.\n\nHow will the Education Department handle student loans?\n\nAll told, the changes made to the department’s current student loan relief programs has meant tens of billions in discharged debt, though that is only a fraction of the hundreds of billions that could be canceled as part of the president’s broad one-time loan forgiveness plan. The regulatory changes are likely to last longer and be available to borrowers who may not benefit from one-time debt relief, including future students.\n\nSome changes, like the Public Service waiver, are possible thanks to the 2003 Heroes Act, which allows the Education Secretary to modify student loan payment requirements during national emergencies.\n\nBut the forward-looking policy changes emerged via a complicated process known as negotiated rulemaking. It’s a lengthy ordeal that requires months of public comments and discussions from groups that may be affected by the rules. And the Education Department is required to craft its rules around student loans via this approach.\n\nSattelmeyer said when Congress passes laws, it can’t account for every permutation of what that law looks like. Negotiated rulemaking, though, allows federal agencies to interpret the intentions of lawmakers.\n\nWho's saying what about Title IX? How schools will treat sexual misconduct is changing.\n\nThe next administration has the ability to undo the rules. The DeVos administration, for example, altered the criteria associated with the borrower defense from the Obama-era and some of the protections tied to the anti gender-discrimination law, Title IX. It’s also the process through which the Biden administration will have to go through to get its new income-driven repayment plan approved.\n\nA more permanent change to how borrowers repay their student loans would require an act of Congress, but with Republicans poised to win the House, and possibly the Senate, that day is likely years away.\n\nContact Chris Quintana at (202) 308-9021 or cquintana@usatoday.com.

Around 770,000 people will be affected by the change, according to an administration official.\n\nThe Department of Education initially said these loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action as long as the borrower consolidated his or her debt into the federal Direct loan program.\n\nOn Thursday, the department reversed course. According to its website, privately held federal student loans must have been consolidated before September 29 in order to be eligible for the debt relief.\n\nBorrowers with privately held federal student loans who have not consolidated yet are currently out of luck, though the Department of Education said it “is assessing whether there are alternative pathways” to provide relief.\n\nBorrowers with privately held federal student loans represent a small portion of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers. There are about 4 million borrowers with Federal Family Education Loans, but not all of those people are likely eligible for the loan forgiveness plan, which also includes an income requirement.\n\n“Our goal is to provide relief to as many eligible borrowers as quickly and easily as possible, and this will allow us to achieve that goal while we continue to explore additional legally-available options to provide relief to borrowers with privately owned FFEL loans and Perkins loans, including whether FFEL borrowers could receive one-time debt relief without needing to consolidate,” the Department of Education said in an emailed statement.\n\n“Borrowers with privately held federal student loans who applied to consolidate their loans into Direct Loans before September 29, 2022 will obtain one-time debt relief. The FFEL program is now defunct and only a small percentage of borrowers have FFEL loans. This is a completely different program than Direct Loans,” the statement said.\n\nLawsuit argues forgiveness will hurt loan servicers\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Missouri by state attorneys general from Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska and South Carolina, as well as legal representatives from Iowa.\n\n“In addition to being economically unwise and inherently unfair, the Biden Administration’s Mass Debt Cancellation is another example in a long line of unlawful regulatory actions. No statute permits President Biden to unilaterally relieve millions of individuals from their obligation to pay loans they voluntarily assumed,” Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson’s office said in a news release.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that student loan servicers – including the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri, known as MOHELA – are harmed by Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. It argues that the plan creates an incentive for borrowers to consolidate Federal Family Education Loans owned by MOHELA into Direct Loans owned by the government, “depriving them (MOHELA) of the ongoing revenue it earns from servicing those loans,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nBut the Department of Education’s move to exclude borrowers with privately held federal loans from the student loan forgiveness plan could weaken that legal argument, said Luke Herrine, an assistant law professor at the University of Alabama who previously worked on a legal strategy pushing for student debt cancellation.\n\nThe White House continues to argue that its student loan forgiveness plan is legal.\n\n“Republican officials from these six states are standing with special interests, and fighting to stop relief for borrowers buried under mountains of debt,”said White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan in an emailed statement.\n\n“The President and his administration are lawfully giving working and middle class families breathing room as they recover from the pandemic and prepare to resume loan payments in January,” he said.\n\nFederal student loan payments have been paused since March 2020, thanks to a pandemic-related benefit. The pause expires on December 31.\n\nEarlier this week, a public interest lawyer who is also a student loan borrower, sued the Biden administration over the student loan forgiveness plan, arguing that the policy is an abuse of executive power and that it would stick him with a bigger state tax bill.\n\nHow Biden’s plan will work\n\nUnder Biden’s plan, individual borrowers who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years will see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. Pell grants are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors that include their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and end up in default.\n\nThe administration is expected to roll out the first wave of student loan forgiveness in October.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated this week – before the administration excluded FFEL borrowers – that Biden’s plan could cost the government $400 billion but warned that the estimate relies on several assumptions and is “highly uncertain.”\n\nEstimating the cost of student debt forgiveness is complicated because loans are generally paid back over several years. The White House argues that the CBO’s estimate should be looked at over a 30-year time frame.\n\nUntested legal waters\n\nBiden announced the forgiveness plan in August, after facing mounting pressure from Democrats to forgive some student loan debt. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren repeatedly called on the President to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower.\n\nBut canceling federal student loan debt so broadly is unprecedented and, until now, has yet to be tested in court. Biden initially urged Congress to take action to cancel some student debt, rather than wade into a murky legal area himself, but Democrats don’t have the votes to pass such legislation.\n\nIn a Department of Education memo released in August, the Biden administration argued that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 – or Heroes Act – grants the Education Secretary the power to cancel student debt to help address the financial harm suffered due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Heroes Act, which was enacted in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, “provides the Secretary broad authority to grant relief from student loan requirements during specific periods,” including a war, other military operation or national emergency, according to the memo.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Thursday argues that the Heroes Act does not grant the President such broad authority.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nAdditional lawsuits challenging Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan could be forthcoming. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, has said he is working on developing the best legal theory to sue the administration over the action.\n\nA conservative advocacy group called the Job Creators Network is also weighing its legal options, planning to file a lawsuit once the Department of Education formalizes the student loan forgiveness plan next month.\n\nBut some legal experts are skeptical that a legal challenge to Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan could be successful.\n\nAbby Shafroth, staff attorney at the nonprofit National Consumer Law Center, previously told CNN that she believes the merits of the Biden administration’s legal statutory authority are strong and that it’s unclear who would have legal standing to bring a case and want to do so. Standing to bring a case is a procedural threshold requiring that an injury be inflicted on a plaintiff to justify a lawsuit.\n\nIf the standing hurdle is cleared, a case would be heard by a district court first – which may or may not issue a preliminary injunction to prevent the cancellation from occurring before a final ruling is issued on the merits of the hypothetical case.\n\nSeveral recent US Supreme Court decisions have touched on executive power, limiting the federal government’s authority to implement new rules. While the Supreme Court takes up a small number of cases each year, lower courts may look at what the justices have said in those cases when assessing the Department of Education’s authority.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/politics/biden-for-profit-student-debt/index.html", "title": "Student loan debt: Biden cancels another $3.9 billion for former for ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Department of Education said Tuesday that it will cancel $3.9 billion in student loan debt for 208,000 students who attended the now-defunct for-profit ITT Technical Institute – bringing the total amount of loan discharges approved under President Joe Biden to nearly $32 billion.\n\nSome former ITT Tech students were already eligible for debt cancellation, but now the department will automatically cancel all remaining federal student loan debt that borrowers took on to attend the school from January 1, 2005, through its closure in September 2016.\n\nITT Tech shut down shortly after the government pulled the plug on its federal funding because it had failed to show it was in compliance with certain accreditation standards. At the time, the school was the subject of several state and federal probes over its recruitment tactics, lending practices and job placement figures.\n\n“It is time for student borrowers to stop shouldering the burden from ITT’s years of lies and false promises,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in a statement Tuesday.\n\n“The evidence shows that for years, ITT’s leaders intentionally misled students about the quality of their programs in order to profit off federal student loan programs, with no regard for the hardship this would cause,” he added.\n\nWho is eligible for student debt relief?\n\nFormer ITT Tech students with federal student loans are eligible for the cancellation even if they have not previously applied for relief under the Department of Education’s borrower defense to repayment program, which offers cancellation to those who can show they have been defrauded or misled by their colleges.\n\nThere may be some former ITT Tech students with outstanding debt who are not eligible because they attended the school prior to January 2005.\n\nIt’s unclear how quickly borrowers will be notified about whether their debt will be canceled. The Department of Education first needs to notify a borrower’s student loan servicer before the cancellation is processed.\n\nOn a call with reporters Tuesday, department officials would not give an exact timeline for ITT Tech students. But some former Corinthian College students, who were granted debt relief in June, have already seen their debt canceled, said Federal Student Aid Chief Richard Cordray.\n\nHe added that eligible ITT Tech borrowers will not have to pay anything more on their loans even if the pandemic-related pause on payments expires before they receive full cancellation. The federal loans borrowed to attend ITT Tech will remain in forbearance.\n\nThe Department of Education also announced Tuesday that it has formally notified DeVry University that it is required to pay millions of dollars for previously approved student debt cancellations for about 1,800 of its students. DeVry University is still operating and the government wants to recoup the cost of the student loan discharges from the institution. It is difficult for the government to get money back from colleges like ITT Tech that have already shut their doors, Cordray said.\n\nDeVry University has received the notice and is reviewing it, according to a statement the school sent to CNN Tuesday.\n\n“We continue to believe the Department mischaracterizes DeVry’s calculation and disclosure of graduate outcomes in certain advertising, and we do not agree with the conclusions they have reached,” it read.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Have student debt?

Elizabeth Warren, have been calling on Biden to cancel $50,000 per borrower. But Biden has consistently pushed back on canceling that much and has suggested he would support wiping away $10,000 per borrower, in line with a pledge he made on the campaign trail in 2020.\n\nUntil now, Biden has taken a more targeted approach to student debt relief. His administration has authorized the cancellation of nearly $32 billion so far – more than any other administration – largely for borrowers who were defrauded by their for-profit colleges and for permanently disabled borrowers.\n\nHe has also temporarily expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that forgives the debt of government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of payments, and made changes to the income-driven repayment plans, bringing millions of borrowers closer to forgiveness.\n\nBiden has also extended the pandemic-related pause on federal student loan payments several times. Borrower balances have effectively been frozen for more than two years, with no payments required on most federal student loans since March 2020 – when the coronavirus pandemic sent many Americans into lockdown. During this time, interest stopped accumulating and collections on defaulted debt have been on hold.\n\nThe pause is set to expire on August 31, but Biden has yet to decide whether he will extend it again.\n\nAmericans’ attitudes toward student debt relief are sharply divided along partisan and generational lines.\n\nA majority of Democrats in a May CNN poll (56%) – and an even wider majority of self-described liberals (69%) – say the government is doing too little on student loan debt, while only a third of Republicans and self-described conservatives alike say the same.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/02/28/student-loan-debt-payment-prepare/11361626002/", "title": "Student loan payments to restart for millions.

The survey also showed that 89% of student debt holders said they weren't ready to restart payments, and that 27% said one-third of their income will go towards their loans.\n\nWith the cost of living climbing amid challenging economic times, borrowers need to prepare as soon as possible.\n\nYour loans:Can you cancel your student debt?\n\nBlueprint for success:What happens if you default on a student loan?\n\n\"If you're just now starting to think about it, I might even say you're pushing the envelope of being too late,\" said Derek Pszenny co-founder and managing partner at Carolina Wealth Management.\n\nHow many Americans with student debt does this affect?\n\nA simple debt forgiveness application was launched around mid-October.\n\nAbout 26 million Americans had already applied for forgiveness and 16 million people already received debt relief approval when the Department of Education stopped taking applications on Nov. 11, the day after a federal judge in Texas declared the debt forgiveness plan unlawful. Two cases against student debt relief are being heard now at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe White House estimated over the summer that up to 43 million federal loan borrowers, including roughly 20 million borrowers who would have had their full remaining balance canceled, would have been eligible for relief.

California, Texas\n\nKey information:Do I qualify for student loan forgiveness? What to know about Biden's debt plan.\n\nWhat is the income limit for student loan debt forgiveness?\n\nThe administration’s plan, announced last summer, would have canceled $10,000 in federal student loans, including Parent Plus loans, for those earning less than $125,000 or households with less than $250,000 in income. Pell Grant recipients, who typically demonstrate more financial need, would get an additional $10,000 in debt forgiven.\n\nWhat should people do to prepare to start repaying again?\n\nThere's not a lot of time between now and when the pause on student debt repayments may end this summer or fall. So people should use it wisely and “get their financial house in order,” said Brian Marks, executive director of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program at the University of New Haven in Connecticut.\n\nHere are some steps to consider:\n\nStart cutting expenses and increasing savings or maybe take on extra work. \"With 3.4% unemployment, try to find a part-time job to come up with the extra money,\" Pszenny said. \"That may be the answer people really don’t want to hear, but it might be the answer they need to hear.\"\n\n\"With 3.4% unemployment, try to find a part-time job to come up with the extra money,\" Pszenny said. \"That may be the answer people really don’t want to hear, but it might be the answer they need to hear.\" Put into a savings account the money you would need each month for your student loan repayment, so it's earning a little interest until it has to be used.\n\nfor your student loan repayment, so it's earning a little interest until it has to be used.

In addition, he’s extended the pandemic-related pause on student loan payments several times.\n\nBut those actions fall short of a campaign pledge Biden made to more broadly cancel student debt. He’s also facing pressure to do more from other Democrats who are urging him to cancel $50,000 per borrower.\n\nHere’s what we know so far about who could benefit if the President takes steps to cancel more student loan debt:\n\nRelief for those earning less than $125,000\n\nExcluding borrowers who earn more than a certain amount is one way Biden could narrow student debt relief.\n\nWhite House officials are leaning toward canceling $10,000 in debt for every borrower who earns less than $125,000 a year, CNN reported earlier this week.\n\nEarlier this year, then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the President is using his campaign comments about providing student loan forgiveness to individuals making less than $125,000 a year as a frame for his current considerations.\n\nHis campaign proposal called for immediately canceling a minimum of $10,000 in student debt per person as a response to the pandemic, as well as forgiving all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for those borrowers earning up to $125,000 a year.\n\nHow many households could benefit?\n\nAbout 19% of households that have total incomes below $125,000 have student loan debt, according to an analysis done earlier this year by Matthew Chingos, vice president of education data and policy at the Urban Institute. He based the estimation on the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances conducted by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThat means about 81% of households who earn less than $125,000 a year don’t have student loan debt and would not see a benefit if Biden takes new action.\n\nMost households would still not benefit even if the President did not put an income threshold in place. Only about 18% of households with incomes above $125,000 have student debt.\n\nHow much debt could be canceled?\n\nBiden has consistently resisted political pressure to cancel $50,000 per borrower. In late April, he reiterated that if he did provide additional loan forgiveness, it would not be as much as a $50,000 reduction.\n\nThe White House has long maintained that the President would support canceling $10,000 per borrower.\n\nThe Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that canceling $10,000 for borrowers earning less than $125,000 a year would cost the government around $298 billion.\n\nChingos estimated earlier this year that the action would result in forgiving a total of $277 billion in student loan debt.\n\n(He assumed that the relief gradually phases out for both married and single borrowers earning between $75,000 and $125,000 a year. That means that borrowers earning less than $75,000 a year would receive $10,000 in forgiveness and the benefit gets smaller as incomes increase, leaving those earning more than $125,000 a year without any debt relief.)\n\nWho would see the biggest benefit?\n\nThe Penn Wharton Budget Model also breaks down the share of forgiven debt by income group assuming that $10,000 is canceled for borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year and households earning less than $250,000 a year.\n\nIt found that one-third of the canceled dollars would go to households who earn less than $50,795 a year. A little more than half of the debt relief would go to those earning between $50,795 and $141,096.\n\nRoughly 14% of the canceled dollars would go to households earning more than $141,096 a year.\n\nForgiveness by race\n\nAdvocates for student debt cancellation argue that it would help close the racial wealth gap, because Black students are more likely to take on student debt, borrow larger amounts and take longer paying them off than their White peers.\n\nBut economist Adam Looney, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, argues that there are better ways to address the racial wealth gap because relatively fewer Black students go to college.\n\nChingos’ model found that 62% of the canceled student loan dollars would go to White borrowers while 25% would go to Black borrowers if Biden canceled up to $10,000 for those earning less than $125,000 a year.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}]}

And could it impact the U.S.?\n\n\"Interests across the Caribbean and along the East Coast from Florida to Maine will need to pay close attention to this feature,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said. \"Depending on the path this system takes, the expected time frame for potential impacts to the United States and Atlantic Canada may be Sept. 13-16.\"\n\nLee, with 65 mph winds, is more than 1,200 miles east of the Caribbean islands, the National Hurricane Center said. The hurricane could bring impacts to the Leeward islands by the weekend, but it's too early to determine how close the storm could approach the islands, hurricane specialist Eric Blake, wrote in the center's 5 pm. Tuesday update.\n\nRapid intensification likely\n\n\"It is becoming a question of when and not if rapid intensification occurs with Lee,\" Blake said. The forecast now predicts Lee will become a Category 4, 140-mph hurricane by Saturday morning east of Puerto Rico and continue strengthening into a 145-mph storm by Sunday.\n\nA reduction in wind shear in its path along with warm ocean water of near 86 degrees will create favorable conditions for Lee to strengthen, Blake wrote, and several models call for higher winds than those in the center's new forecast. Wind shear tears apart developing storms, while warm water acts as fuel to power up storms.\n\nPrediction and timing of winds, as of 5 a.m. Wednesday:\n\n12 hours: 80 mph (Category 1)\n\n24 hours: 90 mph\n\n48 hours: 120 mph (Category 3)\n\n60 hours: 140 mph (Category 4)\n\n72 hours: 150 mph (Category 4)\n\n96 hours: 150 mph\n\n120 hours: 150 mph\n\nTrack forecast uncertain\n\nLatest indications suggest the storm track could vary across a wide swath spanning from the coast northward to eastern Canada, or even skirt away from the coast entirely, AccuWeather said.\n\nMany of the models forecasters use indicate the hurricane is likely to head northward in the Atlantic, but not all. Any bump westward in the track could be disastrous for the Atlantic Coast anywhere from Florida to Nova Scotia.\n\nWhile that thought is alarming, weather models show a deep trough of low pressure over the eastern U.S. next week, and that dip in the jet stream \"should turn Lee more to the north around this time next week,\" said Ryan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at Florida-based Weather Tiger.\n\n\"Unless something very weird happens, that northward movement should occur well east of Florida, and Lee does not look like a threat to the state,\" Truchelut said.\n\nAccording to Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman, \"a combination of factors will determine where the hurricane eventually goes\" as it makes its way across the Atlantic.\n\nT​his includes how strong and expansive the Bermuda-Azores high-pressure area is at the time. \"This acts as a steering wheel for tropical waves, storms and hurricanes in the tropics,\" Erdman said. If the high is weaker, Lee may just recurve out to sea. If it's stronger, then the storm could impact the East Coast of the U.S., he said.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that Lee remains offshore, Truchelut said. \"But with Lee 10 or more days out, there is sufficient uncertainty in the forecast such that the Eastern Seaboard should keep close tabs on Lee, especially as it will be a strong hurricane.\"\n\nWhat is the Saffir-Simpson scale?Breaking down the hurricane category scale\n\nHurricane center's forecast track:\n\nThe forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nTake a look at the spaghetti models\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nMost spaghetti models keep the storm north of the Caribbean. However, Bermuda could face a major hurricane next week.\n\nMore storms for US?Climate change could push more hurricanes toward US coasts, new study suggests\n\nDangerous impacts possible even if it stays offshore\n\nA National Weather Service forecast office in eastern North Carolina reminded residents Tuesday that \"even when tropical systems stay out to sea, there are still distant impacts locally (dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves, etc.).\"\n\nIn addition, the weather service said that \"every system that develops always serves as a reminder to finish general hurricane season preparations if you haven't already.\"\n\nHow is the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season stacking up?\n\nLee is the 12th named storm to form this season. If it does become a hurricane, it would be the season's fourth hurricane and third major hurricane.\n\nAn average hurricane season produces 14 named storms and seven hurricanes. Even before the season started, forecasters said 2023 was likely to be a busier-than-normal season, but in August they bumped up their predictions, calling for 14-21 named storms.\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY Network", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2023/08/22/is-a-hurricane-headed-to-florida-how-to-find-out-and-prepare/70644262007/", "title": "Is a hurricane headed to Florida?

Here’s a step-by-step guide on what to do when a hurricane is headed to Florida.\n\nWhat to do before a hurricane is headed your way\n\nPreparing for a hurricane is typically done in phases: Things to do before a hurricane is on the way (usually done at the beginning of hurricane season) and preparation for when a hurricane is imminent. Here’s a quick look at what to do at the beginning of every hurricane season:\n\nPut together an emergency hurricane kit — An emergency kit, sometimes called a hurricane supplies kit, is a list of items a person or family needs to survive on their own for several days. A kit will include items like food, water, first aid kids, batteries, flashlights and more. Scroll down for a full list of supplies. Know your zone — Do you know if you live in an evacuation zone or a low-lying, flood-prone area? Knowing your zone is crucial in understanding your risk during a hurricane and foundational to creating an emergency plan. Zones have many designations and can be found here. Create an emergency plan — An emergency plan is a useful way to ensure everyone in your family knows what to do during an emergency. Plans can be tailored for any type of disaster and can accommodate the specific needs of your household. Basic plans include a family communication plan, a shelter plan, details on your evacuation route and more. Not sure how to get started? The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has a great template you can use here. Sign up for alerts and warnings — AlertFlorida is a statewide notification initiative that helps people learn how they can receive emergency alerts and other public safety notifications in their community. After entering your county or city, the website will detail how you can ensure you receive alerts. Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) are short emergency messages from authorized federal, state and local authorities that broadcast targeted alerts from cell towers to any WEA‐enabled mobile device. Most modern cell phones have this enabled by default. Review your insurance policy — The worst time to realize you have an issue with your homeowner's insurance policy is right before a storm when property and casualty insurance companies suspend writing new policies. Document insured property — Now is a good time to take inventory of insured property. This should include photos or videos and written descriptions that include the year, make, model numbers and serial numbers. Homeowners should consider scheduled personal property coverage for especially valuable items.\n\nCategory 6 hurricane?:No, a Category 6 hurricane won't hit Florida despite what 'time-traveling' TikToker says\n\nWhat to do when a hurricane is coming your way\n\nPreparing for a hurricane coming your way is a different affair. Here’s what to do, assuming you’ve already followed the previous tips:\n\nSecure your home — You can help mitigate damage from a hurricane by clearing your yard of debris that could become dangerous in strong winds, covering your home with permanent storm shutters or boarding them up with 5/8-inch exterior grade or marine plywood, decluttering your drains and gutters and more.\n\n— You can help mitigate damage from a hurricane by clearing your yard of debris that could become dangerous in strong winds, covering your home with permanent storm shutters or boarding them up with 5/8-inch exterior grade or marine plywood, decluttering your drains and gutters and more. Stay updated with the latest information — One of the best ways to keep track of severe weather is to find a local news source, download its mobile app and turn on notifications (weather alerts, at the very least). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Hurricane Center and National Weather Service are the best sources for weather monitoring.\n\n— One of the best ways to keep track of severe weather is to find a local news source, download its mobile app and turn on notifications (weather alerts, at the very least).

Evacuate if ordered — Anyone living in an area where an evacuation has been ordered should do so immediately.\n\n— Anyone living in an area where an evacuation has been ordered should do so immediately. What to do if not ordered to evacuate — Anyone not ordered to evacuate should still take precautions during hurricanes, as even Category 1 storms are dangerous. Here is what the NWS says to do: Take refuge in a small interior room, closet, or hallway on the lowest level during the storm. Put as many walls between you and the outside as you can. Stay away from windows, skylights and glass doors. If the eye of the storm passes over your area, there will be a short period of calm, but on the other side of the eye, the wind speed rapidly increases to hurricane-force winds coming from the opposite direction.\n\n— Anyone not ordered to evacuate should still take precautions during hurricanes, as even Category 1 storms are dangerous. Here is what the NWS says to do:\n\nWhat supplies should you have for a hurricane?\n\nThe best time to assemble a checklist for hurricane supplies is June 1, when the Atlantic hurricane season begins. Here's a list of emergency management items you should keep secure throughout the season:\n\nFlashlights and extra bulbs\n\nExtra batteries\n\nPortable cellphone chargers. Keep them charged. Be sure to have charging cords and wall chargers in case the power is working in your shelter or other safe place.\n\nClock (wind-up or battery-operated)\n\nBattery-operated radio\n\nNOAA emergency weather radio\n\nToilet paper\n\nMatches (camping stores have waterproof matches)\n\nScissors\n\nPlastic garbage bags\n\nWorking fire extinguisher\n\nClean change of clothes, rain gear, sturdy swamp boots\n\nFully charged battery-operated lanterns. Don’t use candles and kerosene lanterns. They are fire hazards.\n\nList of phone numbers\n\nCopy of insurance policy\n\nWhat food supplies should you get for hurricane season?\n\nGet enough nonperishable food to last two weeks. Then put it in a box and leave it alone. Canned and other prepared foods that are salty or dry or high in fat or protein might make for good provisions, but they’ll also make you thirsty.\n\nWater : Enough for 1 gallon of drinking water per person per day, for one-week minimum. Water for two weeks is ideal. (Also, figure another 1 gallon per person/per day of water for washing hands, flushing toilets and for pets).\n\nEnough for 1 gallon of drinking water per person per day, for one-week minimum.

Hurricane season forecasts and often published in the spring.\n\nStarting on May 15, the NHC will issue tropical weather outlooks four times a day until the end of the season on Nov. 30. Systems can be detected well before they become storms or hurricanes, and these outlooks will indicate the likelihood the system will develop.\n\nHurricane paths can be predicted between 3 to 5 days in advance, leading to the charts showing the dreaded “cone of uncertainty.”\n\nWhen are storm and hurricane updates posted?\n\nStarting May 15 through Nov. 30, NHC issues a Tropical Weather Outlook each day at 2 a.m., 8 a.m., 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT.\n\nFor every active tropical cyclone, NHC issues a complete advisory package at 5 a.m., 11 a.m., 5 p.m., and 11 p.m. EDT. It includes an updated forecast and graphics with the track and intensity forecast, time of arrival of tropical storm and hurricane-force winds, key messages, a potential storm surge flooding map, and a storm surge watch/warning graphic. NHC also posts the same information on Facebook and Twitter to ensure a wide distribution.\n\nWhen hurricane watches or warnings are posted for a portion of the U.S. coastline, NHC opens a television media pool to provide live interviews to national news/weather outlets and those local TV stations in the path of the storm.\n\nNWS provides timely forecasts and decision support services to help local officials determine what public safety actions are needed, such as whether to evacuate, close roads and schools, or open shelters.\n\nStorm and hurricane tracking resources\n\nWhat’s happening in the Atlantic now: Tropical Storm Franklin makes landfall\n\nTropical Storm Franklin was making landfall about 7:30 a.m. along the southern coast of the Dominican Republic near Barahona, according to the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nFranklin is bringing very heavy rain and \"potentially life-threatening flash flooding\" over Hispaniola as it moves from the Caribbean Sea into the Atlantic.\n\nWinds are expected to reach hurricane strength by early Saturday and continue to strengthen, reaching 90 mph by Sunday, making Franklin a strong Category 1 storm.\n\nMeanwhile, Tropical Depression Harold is weakening but is still bringing heavy rain to portions of Texas and northern Mexico. Harold made landfall as a tropical storm at Padre Island, Texas, about 11 a.m. Aug. 22.\n\nElsewhere in the Atlantic basin, forecasters are tracking two other disturbances.\n\nInvest 92L in the eastern Atlantic has a low chance for tropical cyclone development.\n\nIn the central Atlantic, Invest 7, which is the remnant of what was Tropical Storm Emily, is likely to regenerate into a tropical depression or tropical storm late this week or this weekend\n\nContributors: Cheryl McCloud — USA Today Network.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/25/ian-could-become-major-hurricane-targets-florida-what-we-know/8113790001/", "title": "Ian could become 'major' hurricane, targets Florida.

It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph.\n\nIan was forecast to intensify rapidly and become a major hurricane as soon as late Monday.\n\nAs Ian approaches Florida, Accuweather said the storm could reach Category 4 status, which means sustained winds between 130 mph and 156 mph.\n\n\"In just a few days, Ian is likely to be a dangerous, major hurricane,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged residents to load up on food, water, medicine, batteries and fuel. He said it was too soon to determine when or even if Ian will make landfall, but that evacuations may be ordered in coming days.\n\n\"Expect heavy rains, strong winds, flash flooding, storm surge and even isolated tornadoes.

Areas can be uninhabitable for weeks or months, the weather service says.\n\n“Even if you’re not necessarily right in the eye of the path of the storm, there’s going to be pretty broad impacts throughout the state,\" DeSantis said.\n\nIAN COULD BE MAJOR HURRICANE SOON:Statewide emergency in Florida declared\n\nStorm could drive heavy rains all week\n\nHeavy rainfall may affect north Florida, the Florida panhandle and the southeast United States through Saturday, the weather service update said. Flooding and rising area streams and rivers across the region \"can't be ruled out\" later this week, especially in central Florida due to already saturated conditions, the updated warned.\n\nStill no water or electricity:Voices from Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona\n\nEast coast of Florida not in the clear\n\nThough the track had shifted westward, parts of the state's east coast remained solidly within the edges of Ian's forecast cone Sunday. Melbourne resident Pat Alderman wasn't taking any changes, buying ten 50-pound bags of sand, along with 50 empty sandbags, at Lowe's in West Melbourne to fortify her back patio door against floodwaters. She has a backyard pond, and her soils are saturated with recent rainfall.\n\nAlderman, shopping at Lowe's on Sunday, said she had a generator and roll-down shutters – no need to board her windows.\n\n\"This is from decades of living in Florida,\" she said. 'If you've lived here for a while, you need to have all these things. Transplants don't understand.\"\n\nIn Tampa, stocking up on water and sandbags\n\nJohn Cangialosi, a senior hurricane specialist at hurricane center, said Floridians should begin preparations, including gathering supplies for potential power outages, he said.\n\n\"For those in Florida, it’s still time to prepare,\" he said. \"I’m not telling you to put up your shutters yet or do anything like that, but it’s still time to get your supplies.\"\n\nTampa Mayor Jane Castor said city sandbag sites were open. She urged residents to shop for several days of necessities now and to check family disaster kits and plans.\n\n\"Are you #TampaReady?\" she tweeted. \"It’s never too early to prepare.\"\n\nResidents agreed. Shoppers at a Walmart Supercenter Tampa were stocking up on supplies – and wiped out almost 1,000 cases of bottled water in a few hours Sunday, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\nNASA postpones launch, considers stashing rocket\n\nNASA said Sunday that it was monitoring Tropical Storm Ian, but had not determined whether it would roll back the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft to the protection of the assembly building. The agency said it would \"prioritize the agency’s people and hardware.\" NASA managers, who canceled a launch set for Tuesday due to the storm, planned to meet Sunday night to evaluate whether to keep the vehicle at the launch pad to preserve an opportunity for a launch attempt on Oct. 2.\n\nThe latest information provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Space Force, and the National Hurricane Center indicated a \"slower moving and potentially more westerly track of the storm than yesterday’s predictions showed, providing more time for the agency’s decision making process,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nBethune-Cookman University orders evacuation\n\nBethune-Cookman University canceled classes Monday and said they would reconvene remotely on Tuesday.\n\n\"As a precaution, and in the interest of safety for members of our campus community, the university has issued a mandatory campus evacuation,\" the school said in a statement on its website. The school, a private, historically black university in Daytona Beach, has about 2,750 undergraduate students.\n\nThe school told its students that their smartphones are “computers” and that they should continue to use their cellphones to keep up with their studies in the event they do not have access to a tablet, laptop or desktop technology.\n\nFlorida's west coast could take rare hurricane hit\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists are warning that the storm could slam the west coast of Florida – an often-missed target. The U.S. database shows that about 160 hurricanes, excluding tropical storms, have affected Florida. Only 17 have made landfall on the west coast north of the Florida Keys.\n\nMost storms typically travel northeast or northwest, not up the coast, AccuWeather senior weather editor Jesse Ferrell said. There is no record of a hurricane ever having tracked entirely up the west coast of Florida since records began in 1944. But Ian appears likely to take a \"very unusual track,\" he said.\n\nFlorida has had recent storms that were hurricanes, but were downgraded to tropical storms before landfall, Ferrell said. Elsa in 2021 made landfall west of Tampa, and Eta in 2020 made landfall north of Tampa in Cedar Key. Neither had the firepower close to a Category 3 storm, however.\n\nDeSantis declares statewide state of emergency\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a pre-landfall state of emergency for all 67 counties late Saturday. The declaration came a day after DeSantis' 24-county declaration.Florida National Guard members will be activated and on standby.\n\n\"Floridians should remain vigilant and ensure their households are prepared for a potential impact,\" DeSantis said.\n\nIan will then either move inland somewhere over the southeast U.S., or could track near or along parts of the Eastern Seaboard late this week, The Weather Channel said, adding that it's too soon to tell where Ian will end up, but there could be wind, flooding rain and other impacts extending into other parts of the East late next week.\n\nBiden authorizes FEMA to help\n\nPresident Joe Biden also declared an emergency for the state, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to protect lives and property.\n\nBiden postponed a scheduled Sept. 27 trip to Florida due to the storm.\n\nCaymans, Cuba to see Ian's fury first\n\nBut Ian will do damage even before reaching Cuba. Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman by early Monday, with tropical storm conditions expected by Sunday night, the weather service said.\n\nSignificant wind and storm surges in western Cuba are expected as the storm strengthens Sunday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nHurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in Cuba by Monday night or early Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Monday.

Use CNN’s lite site for low bandwidth.\n\nCNN —\n\nTropical Storm Ian, the ninth named storm of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season is forecast to reach up to Category 4 hurricane strength before hitting Florida next week. If it does, it will be the first major hurricane to impact the state since 2018.\n\nIan was located about 255 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica, as of 6 p.m. Saturday and moving west at 16 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. “Significant strengthening is forecast during the next few days,” the center said.\n\nThe forecast shows Ian “as a major hurricane over the eastern Gulf when it is approaching the west coast of Florida,” after briefly passing over Cuba at or near major hurricane strength, the center said Friday. The entire Florida panhandle and nearly the entire western coast of the state could be at risk, according to the most recent forecast cone from the hurricane center.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nAfter strengthening overnight, Ian – earlier known as Tropical Depression Nine – has maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and is forecast to reach hurricane status within the next two days as it approaches the Cayman Islands by early Monday.\n\nIan is then expected to rapidly intensify and become a Category 3 hurricane before it reaches far western Cuba early Tuesday. Conditions are extremely favorable for strengthening and the forecast from the National Hurricane Center now brings Ian to a Category 4 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n“Since Ian is not expected to remain over Cuba long, little weakening is expected due to that land interaction,” the hurricane center explained.\n\nForecast models on Saturday afternoon vary on where Ian may make landfall on Florida’s coast. The European model shows landfall near Tampa on Thursday morning, while the American model shows landfall near Pensacola Friday morning. There also continues to be a considerable amount of uncertainty with the track during the middle of next week.\n\nThe official hurricane center track splits the difference between the models, showing landfall north of Tampa on Thursday morning.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded an emergency order from 24 counties to include the whole state Saturday, citing “foregoing conditions, which are projected to constitute a major disaster.”\n\n“The Florida Division of Emergency Management, working together with the National Hurricane Center to evaluate weather predictions, has determined there is a continuing risk of dangerous storm surge, heavy rainfall, flash flooding, strong winds, hazardous seas, and isolated tornadic activity for Florida’s Peninsula and portions of the Florida Big Bend, North Florida, and Northeast Florida,” the order states.\n\nUnder the state-level emergency order, members of the Florida National Guard will be activated and on standby awaiting orders.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Saturday approved a disaster declaration for the tropical storm, which is forecast to reach the state later this week as a hurricane.\n\n“The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population,” the White House said in a news release.\n\nIan could be Florida’s first major hurricane in four years\n\nIf it strengthens to a Category 3 or higher before reaching Florida, Ian would be the first major hurricane to make landfall there since Hurricane Michael in 2018, which was a monster Category 5 storm when it collided with the Florida panhandle. Michael also underwent rapid intensification before it made landfall, a phenomenon which has been made more likely as ocean temperatures warm due to the climate crisis.\n\nA hurricane warning was issued for Grand Cayman, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Little Cayman and Cayman Brac in the Cayman Islands. A tropical storm watch for Jamaica has been discontinued.\n\nThe governor urged those in the potential path of the storm to prepare.\n\n“This storm has the potential to strengthen into a major hurricane and we encourage all Floridians to make their preparations,” DeSantis said in a news release. “We are coordinating with all state and local government partners to track potential impacts of this storm.”\n\nForecasters urge for residents to prepare\n\nIt has been a slow start to what was forecast to be an above-average hurricane season. Only one storm has made landfall in a US territory, and no hurricane has made landfall or threatened the contiguous states.\n\nNow, a week past the peak of hurricane season, the tropics seem to have woken up, and forecasters are concerned people have let down their guard.\n\n“After a slow start, the Atlantic hurricane season has ratcheted up quickly,” Phil Klotzbach, research scientist at Colorado State University, tweeted.\n\n“People tend to lower their guard and think, oh, yeah, we’re out of the woods,” Maria Torres, hurricane center spokesperson, told CNN. “But in reality, the season continues. We are still in September; we still have October to go.

Idalia had also drifted slightly east at 3 mph with an increased maximum of sustained winds up from 45 mph.\n\n\"More damaging and less damaging outcomes remain on the table,\" said Truchelut, who provides forecasts for the USA TODAY Network. \"But the eastern Panhandle, Big Bend and west-central Florida coasts are at serious risk of surge, wind and rain impacts from a potential major hurricane landfall Wednesday.\"\n\nAccuWeather said several inches of rain could trigger inland flooding in low-lying areas beginning as early as Tuesday in central and northern Florida. Wind gusts of up to 60 mph are likely in much of northern and central Florida with gusts of up to 80 mph along the Florida Gulf Coast.\n\nA high risk for impact was centered around the Big Bend region of the Gulf Coast linking the Panhandle and peninsula, AccuWeather said, warning of \"life-threatening damaging winds, torrential rain and storm surge flooding\" as Idalia closes in on the state, gaining strength as it sweeps across high water temperatures in the Gulf.\n\nThe storm could prompt travel problems, and \"significant airline delays\" are possible for flights in and out of the region Tuesday to Wednesday, AccuWeather said.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾Late Sunday, the storm was about 95 miles east-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico, moving northeast at 3 mph with highest sustained winds of 45 mph, forecasters said.

Although it is \"too soon\" to specify the exact location of these impacts, the center said there is an increased risk of life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds.\n\nTruchelut said significant storm surge will be seen along the nature and west central coast, with a potential for seven to 11 feet of storm surge in the Big Bend area and northern Nature Coast.\n\nScattered flash flooding and urban flooding is also expected in these regions and in portions of the U.S. Southeast from Tuesday to Thursday, according to the hurricane center.\n\nTuesday a 'dangerous day' as storm builds\n\nTruchelut said Tuesday will be \"a dangerous day, and I don’t like what I’m seeing.\" He said a combination of factors could strengthen the storm.\n\n\"I don’t want to pull the fire alarm, but Idalia has infernal potential, and you need to react now while you still have time,\" he said. \"Stay safe, Florida, and keep watching the skies.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tampa Bay warned of tropical storm and hurricane conditions \"mainly\" Tuesday into Wednesday. Truchelut noted that there is an intensification trend currently ongoing which will continue over the course of Monday as Idalia moves north and becomes a \"little bit more organized.\"\n\nHe added that one of the main factors to watch for is the dry air evolution on Monday. Dry air in the mid levels of the atmosphere can impede hurricane development but Truchelut said other weather conditions on Tuesday can set Idalia off and \"push it up to a major hurricane.\"\n\nWhat is storm surge?Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\nFlorida bracing for up to 18 inches of rain\n\nPortions of the eastern Yucatan Peninsula could see 2 to 4 inches, and isolated higher totals of 6 inches are possible, the weather service said. Western Cuba could be hit with 3 to 6 inches, and isolated spots could get 10 inches.\n\nAs the storm rolls into Florida, portions of the state's Gulf Coast, the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia could see 4 to 8 inches, and some areas could be blasted by up to 18 inches of rain over a span of less than 12 hours Tuesday into Wednesday, AccuWeather said.\n\nHeavy rainfall is also likely to spread into portions of the Carolinas by Wednesday into Thursday, the weather service said.\n\nGov.

Emergency management officials were taking precautions \"to ensure Florida’s communities, infrastructure and resources are prepared, including those communities that are still recovering following Hurricane Ian,\" DeSantis said.\n\nIan crashed through the state last September, killing 150 people in Florida alone and causing damage estimated at more than $100 billion.\n\nDeSantis said authorities were moving resources into areas likely to be slammed by the storm, and he urged residents to ensure \"their hurricane supply kit is stocked.\" The declaration includes almost half the state's 67 counties, stretching from Fort Myers north through Panama City in the Panhandle.

Initially shuttered in March, vacation rentals in Florida were allowed to re-open over Memorial Day weekend. Since then, the Kipharts' five-bedroom house on Navarre Beach has been \"slammed\" all the way through the recent Labor Day weekend.\n\n\"It's pretty much our main income now, so we're really glad we made that (income) diversification,\" Kiphart said Tuesday after the long holiday weekend that marks the unofficial end of summer.\n\nState drop:Florida's tourism suffered an estimated 60.5% drop due to COVID-19 in second quarter\n\nFifth cent:TDC recommends fifth-cent bed tax to help with tourism recovery from COVID-19\n\nA rebound in short-term vacation rentals has been one of the few bright sports as the local tourism industry recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor the Kipharts, while revenue from their rental isn't as high as it was in 2019, their house has been consistently booked and they're seeing solid bookings during the shoulder season through mid-October.\n\n\"People want to get away and be somewhere where they feel safe in a private home,\" Kiphart said. \"We're fortunate that we have a pool and a hot tub so then people also wanted that private pool. That was a big deal for them.\"\n\nNicole Stacey, director of marketing and communications for Visit Pensacola, said vacation rentals have seen a strong rebound, perhaps because people feel safer in individual units, rather than ones with shared common spaces like hotels.\n\nThat suits areas like Navarre Beach particularly well, which is a primarily vacation rental market with only one hotel on the beach. Santa Rosa County's July bed tax collections were up more than 12% from the previous year, totaling $650,314.58.\n\n\"The spring was pretty difficult for us, but once the governor lifted the restrictions and our vacation rentals opened up, we bounded back very quick,\" said Nicole Dees, tourist development special with the Santa Rosa County Tourist Development Office. \"Vacation rentals are the majority of our bed tax collections.\"\n\nShe said four RV parks in Navarre, another source of bed tax dollars for the county, have also been almost fully booked for the entire summer.\n\nThe hotel industry, however, hasn't seen the same rebound as vacation rentals, with many hotels reporting shorter average stays and lower rates. But good weather over the long holiday weekend helped give the industry a boost at the end of the traditional summer season.\n\nTed Ent, CEO and president of Innisfree Hotels, said this Labor Day weekend is difficult to compare to previous Labor Day weekends because recent years have been affected by bad weather. He said occupancy and room rates this holiday weekend were much closer to normal than the rest of the summer, and he hoped strong travel would continue through the shoulder season for people looking for long weekend getaways.\n\n\"The summer went OK. We certainly didn't perform to budget or to historical numbers, but we did a lot better than the general hospitality industry so we can't really complain right now,\" Ent said. \"But it's still nowhere near what we've historically done.\"\n\nSaturday was the third-busiest day of the year for cars passing through the toll onto Pensacola Beach, said Escambia County Commissioner Robert Bender.\n\nA total of 21,759 cars passed through the toll Saturday, with a weekend total of 76,169 cars from Friday through Monday. That's higher than the previous three Labor Day weekends, which saw 70,224 vehicles, 62,837 cars and 65,882 vehicles, respectively.\n\nJuly unemployment:Florida's unemployment rate up to 11.3% in July; jobless ranks grow by 122K people\n\nOpting in:Florida opts to give unemployed an extra $300 a week through federal program\n\n\"I don't know if vehicles actually equate to tourism,\" Bender said, adding that tourist development tax dollar figures won't come in for August until late in September. \"But I think what's been holding true for the last few months is that people can spread out on the beach.\"\n\nEnt said Innisfree Hotels hasn't yet done much forecasting into what next year's booking may be like because October is its budget season, which is when that's determined. But he said no matter what, forecasting what occupancy and room rates will be like into next year will be difficult because no one has a handle on when things like corporate or group travel will return.\n\nBender said he believes the county will be able to extend the beach season by a few weeks this year to better support businesses. Visit Pensacola will continue marketing efforts in drive-able markets during the shoulder season to help bolster travel in the off months after Labor Day.\n\n\"We are slowly returning. We are seeing travel sentiment return. We're seeing that our drive markets are speaking to us,\" said Stacey with Visit Pensacola. \"This is traditionally that last weekend of summer, if you will. So that being said, I think that our locals and our vacationers were coming out to just enjoy the beach.\"\n\nThe July bed tax collections, which were received in August, were down about 11% from the previous year and totaled about $1.8 million. That is better than June numbers, which were at $1.588 million.\n\nSo far, the county is about at $8.8 million in collections for the year, Bender said. Last fiscal year, the county collected a total of $12.3 million.\n\nThat makes it difficult for vacation marketing efforts for the area because bed tax dollars fund Visit Pensacola.

Survey after survey has found that more Americans believe Memorial Day marks the unofficial start of summer than any other occasion (e.g., the beginning of baseball season or when pools open).\n\nSo as the calendar turns from the rebirth of spring to the sweltering heat of summer in this part of the world, here are five statistics to mark the occasion:\n\n1. Summer is not most people’s favorite time of the year.\n\nThis one surprised me a little bit. Most people prefer warmer to cooler weather, and I always remembered summer being free time. Yet just 29% of Americans said summer was their favorite season in a 2020 CBS News poll. Fall (27%) and spring (25%) were right within the margin of error. A previous CBS News poll from 2013 had spring and summer tied at 33% for favorite season.\n\nPolling often doesn’t show any of the meteorological summer months (June, July or August) to be the favorite of Americans. Frequently, it’s May, October or December.\n\nOf course, there are regional variations. Americans in the northern part of the country are far more likely to list summer as their favorite season than those in the South. Southerners are more likely to list spring.\n\nI guess New Englanders don’t like the backdoor cold fronts of the spring, while Southerners dislike the sweltering heat of summer.\n\n2. Seventy-two degrees is usually just right.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What NOT to do in a heat wave 01:14 - Source: CNN\n\nOne way to deal with the summer heat is to put on the air conditioning. Around 90% of Americans reportedly have AC, which is more than any country except Japan. About 70% have central AC.\n\nA National Opinion Research Center poll last year asked those who had central AC what temperatures they set their thermostats to during the day and at night. During the day, the most popular answer was 72 degrees. During the night, the most popular answer was 72 degrees.\n\nThere’s a wide range in the data, with some people going as low as 55 degrees and some going as high as 76 degrees. Indeed, 13% of all of those with central AC said they slept in a temperature of 67 degrees or less during the summer. About 40% to 45% of people indicated that they kept their thermostats above 72 degrees during the day and at night.\n\nWhat most Americans do agree upon is that having air conditioning is preferable to not having it. A 2019 CBS News poll inquired about whether Americans preferred having the windows open or the windows closed with the AC during a hot summer day. The clear winner was windows closed with the AC on at 65%, compared with 30% who said windows open.\n\n3. Not going on vacation this weekend? Same here.\n\nThis Memorial Day weekend about 40 million Americans are expected to travel on a vacation, according to AAA. Most of those people (about 35 million) expect to travel by car. That means that most Americans aren’t taking a trip this weekend.\n\nMost Americans do seem to want to take some vacation this summer, however. A Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted in April and May found that 72% of Americans plan to take a vacation away from their home this summer, although only 40% say they will definitely take one.\n\nThe biggest divides in whether someone goes on vacation are, perhaps not surprisingly, age and income. Those under 35 (82%) say they’re far more likely to say they plan on taking a vacation away from home than those who are 65 and older (60%). Those making $100,000 or more are more likely to say they’ll travel (87%) than those making less than $50,000 a year (59%).\n\nTravelers tunnel through some breathtaking scenery near Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah. Andriy Blokhin/Adobe Stock\n\nIf people don’t end up traveling for vacation, it will be because of prices. Gas, flight and hotel and lodging prices were listed as much more important factors in making summer vacation plans than figuring out time off or fear over the coronavirus.\n\n4. Most people just want to take a load off during summer.\n\nIf summer is known for taking vacations, then what do we actually want to do on those vacations? Well, it seems that most of us just want to be lazy.\n\nThat same Washington Post poll found that 76% of Americans said relaxing was a thing they liked to do on vacation. Next up (and within the margin of error of that result) was eating at restaurants (75%). Going to the beach or pool was in third place at 65%.\n\nNo other option hit a majority.\n\nA day at the pool is always a summer option, even for those who don't want to exert too much energy. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, it seems Americans don’t want to exert too much energy in the summer months. Other polling indicates that Americans are far less likely to want to do athletic activities such as playing sports or going running than simply enjoying a meal during this summer vacation.\n\n5. Summer vacation ends at a lot of different points.\n\nJust as quickly as summer has begun, I hate to tell you that it will end just as quickly. When I was a kid, Labor Day marked that point. That’s when school, much to my undying hatred, began anew. Polling shows that more people think Labor Day marks the end of summer than the fall equinox.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that this is sort of a Northern- and Middle Atlantic-centric point of view. A 2019 study by the Pew Research Center found that only 23% of American students go back to school after Labor Day. In New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, over 80% of the studied school districts went back to school after Labor Day.\n\nThat year, 2% of students nationwide went back to school by August 2. Nearly half (43%) were back in school by the middle of August. This included the majority of students in the interior South (i.e., Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas).\n\nThis might explain why I always felt that back-to-school ads were airing too early in the summer. It turns out that for many kids, summer simply ended earlier.\n\nOf course, we probably don’t need those ads airing in late May, as has happened in past years. We should give the kids a break.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/09/16/so-long-summer-hello-pumpkin-spice-season/73663134/", "title": "So long summer, hello pumpkin spice season", "text": "Rebecca Hanlon\n\nYorkDailyRecord\n\nThe bright orange pumpkin pie frappe slowly got sucked up the straw as Hannah Stevens licked the cinnamon kissed whipped cream from her lips.\n\n\"I had to come get one as soon as I saw they posted it on Facebook,\" the 17-year-old Glen Rock girl said as she devoured breakfast one Saturday morning at the Rail Trail Café. \"I love just about everything they make here — but I love pumpkin-flavored stuff even more.\"\n\nDon't fear artificial flavors here.

But before the festivities come to a close, there's one last party: the Rhythm & Roots Festival at Ninigret Park in Charlestown.\n\nThis year’s edition, which runs Sept. 2-4, was initially in jeopardy after festival founder Chuck Wentworth from Lagniappe Productions announced that the organization would be suspending operations back in Februar. But then Hartford-based live entertainment company GoodWorks Entertainment jumped in to secure the festival’s future, with Wentworth still on board as a consultant.

The band has been around since 2009, with drummer Eddie Christmas, bassist Eric Vogel, lead guitarist Jake Eckert, pianist CR Gruver, and saxophonists Brad Walker and Jeff Watkins completing the dynamic lineup. Each of them is highly regarded within The Big Easy’s music scene and beyond, and together they're considered one of New Orleans’ supergroups.\n\nWhy Westerly is worth the drive:Great seafood, delicious cocktails and waterfront views\n\nBlues and Americana from Anders Osborne and Jackie Greene\n\nSept. 3, 6:15 p.m.\n\nTwo of the best singer-songwriters around will be coming through on Saturday when Anders Osborne and Jackie Greene take the stage.

It’ll be interesting to see how they divvy up the set list with their songs, and whether some improvisation will be in store.\n\nMore:Here are the 15 best ice cream spots in RI.

The announcement came amid rising concern over the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nBe aware that congested areas where you may be required to wear a mask outdoors include Moraine Park Road and Horseshoe Park, which attract large crowds to see elk. Other areas include the park's shuttle service stations, popular overlooks along Trail Ridge Road and some parking lots and trails, especially in the Bear Lake corridor.\n\nCameron Peak Fire: COVID-19 had firefighter fighting for his life\n\nRoad conditions in Rocky Mountain National Park\n\nYes, Trail Ridge Road was temporarily closed due to snow and icy conditions at higher elevations Aug. 20, but it was back open later that day.\n\nNormally the highest paved road in the U.S. doesn't close for winter until the third week of October and can remain open longer depending on conditions. But Colorado is known for its autumn snows, so keep a close eye on conditions.\n\nThe gravel Fall River Road is usually closed for winter the first week of October.\n\nFor up-to-date road conditions in the park, call 970-586-1222, or follow the park's Twitter site @RockyNPS or Facebook page at www.facebook.com/RockyNPS.\n\nCameron Peak Fire, East Troublesome Fire impacts\n\nLast year's Cameron Peak and East Troublesome wildfires, which are the two largest wildfires in state history, converged on the park.\n\nDespite that, the two fires only burned about 10% of the park.\n\nThe west side of the park took the brunt of the burn.\n\nPark visitors entering from the Grand Lake Entrance should not stop or park along the roadside from the entrance to the Onahu Trail due to hazard trees along the road from the East Troublesome Fire.

Chris Christie often out of state in his White House bid, New Jersey’s problems are piling up.\n\nThe Labor Day weekend might mark the unofficial end of summer for many, but New Jersey’s Legislature has slowed its typically brisk pace ahead of Election Day, which will feature the Assembly at the top of the ballot for the first time since 1999.\n\nThe break is not out of the ordinary in New Jersey, where legislators typically take this time off. But this year the state is facing serious issues, including a fiscal crunch gripping Atlantic City; the state’s transportation trust fund lurching toward insolvency; and the nearly $80 billion public pension teetering toward unsustainability. The break also coincides with Christie’s frequent out-of-state travels as he seeks the Republican nomination for president.\n\nAside from tradition, another reason for the break is the coming election, which could have record low turnout, according to Rider University political science adjunct professor Ben Dworkin.\n\n“Every time you take a vote in Trenton, somebody might be upset,” he said. “None of these legislators want to do that on the eve of an election.”\n\nSome of the big issues prove thornier than others. For instance, the Legislature has already sent Christie a five-bill package addressing Atlantic City’s struggling economy. The legislation includes a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes plan that aims to stabilize tax revenue in the resort town. The bill is awaiting action from Christie, who does not typically discuss pending legislation.\n\nBut other issues, like transportation funding, could require an unpopular hike in the state’s 10.5-cent-per-gallon gas tax, which has not changed since 1989. At issue is the roughly $1.2 billion transportation trust fund, which was created to pay for road and bridge work, but currently pays for debt. New projects are funded by additional bonding coupled with a loan from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nIt’s one of the top issues for both business and environmental groups, two groups who are not typically in agreement.\n\nStakeholders say it’s urgent for the Legislature and Christie to address the issue, but they stop short of expressing any frustration over the lawmakers’ absence.\n\n“All of us probably would like things to move forward faster,” said New Jersey Chamber of Commerce President Tom Bracken at a news conference announcing a business summit later this month in Atlantic City. “But you know historically they take this time off. With the election coming up I think they realize if they were here not much would get done, so be it.”\n\nThe pension fund is also contentious and prospects for an agreement between Christie — who invites unions and Democrats to re-negotiate a solution — and the Legislature seem bleak. Democrats question Christie’s trustworthiness. The bad blood goes back to the disintegration of a 2011 deal in which union members conceded certain cost-of-living adjustments in exchange for the Christie administration paying more into the pension fund, but lower-than-expected revenues in 2014 resulted in Christie reducing the payment. Unions sued, and eventually the state Supreme Court refused to require Christie to make the payment.\n\nUnions don’t fault the Democrat-led Legislature for taking off, but blame Christie vetoing legislation that would have made higher payments to the pension.\n\n“The Legislature is doing its job in New Jersey,” New Jersey Education Association President Wendell Steinhauer said. “Our problem is a governor who vetoes the common-sense bills they pass and who has abandoned this state at such a critical time.”\n\nA message to Christie’s office seeking comment was not returned.\n\nThe Legislature won’t be totally off. The state Senate has met roughly once a month since July, with the next voting session scheduled for Sept. 24. Legislators have also sent Christie several dozen bills before the summer break began, many of which are still on his desk.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2022/08/31/rose-everyday-if-summer-never-ends-nor-should-rose-and-cocktails/7896506001/", "title": "Rose everyday: If summer never ends, nor should the rose and ...", "text": "Gina Birch\n\nSpecial to The News-Press\n\nLabor Day Weekend marks the unofficial end of summer, even though you wouldn’t know it by local thermometers, which remain deep in the red. The forthcoming holiday, a three-day affair for many, is the last hoorah before the days start getting shorter and the nights begin to cool — if only by a few degrees.\n\nThe holiday weekend has a long tradition of backyard barbecues, beach time and boating, all of which beg for cool refreshing beverages.\n\nAugust is National Rose Month, and even though that celebration wraps up today, rose is still hot, and oh-so-cool, to have on hand for your Labor Day celebration. It comes in boxes, bottles and cans, with bubbles and without.\n\nThe pink drink ranges from sweet to bone dry and comes in prices that vary widely, from less than $10 to more than $100. Enjoyed solo, with food or in cocktails, rose is one of the most versatile wines.\n\nMore:Late summer rum guide: How to choose and sip rum, plus classic recipes\n\nAnd:Can it: Six new canned cocktails to quench the dog days of summer\n\nEvery summer, I find myself with more bottles of rose than I can possibly drink, so I host a Rose All Day Brunch, pop as many corks, tops and screw caps as possible, and see what stands out.\n\nThis year, in the canned category, Jetway is a newly launched wine seltzer. The creators wanted a more natural seltzer product, so they tapped into the power of the grape as a sweetener rather than a bunch of additives. Jetway's rose seltzer comes infused with peach, Fijian ginger, yerba mate and orange peel. Warning: This refreshing beverage goes down fast and easy, and it's $20 for a four-pack.\n\nFor a classic, Provencal-style rose, Rose Gold ($19.99) gets a gold star. It’s dry, pale pink and slightly floral with fresh red fruit and a hint of spice. A blend of cinsault and grenache, Rose Gold is not a passive wine. It went remarkably well with quiche and salad.\n\nAlma Rosa's Vin Gris of Pinot Noir ($35) proved to be another brunch favorite. Perhaps it was the touch of salinity that literally made your mouth water and kept you going back for more. A rose full of tropical fruit flavors, this is perfect for a Sunday funday — or any day for that matter.\n\nAlso:Sip it up a notch: Master food and wine pairings with these summery recipes\n\nRam’s Gate Rose ($38) hails from Sonoma, California and is mostly pinot noir with 25% grenache. This wine is as elegant as the bottle in which it's packaged. The salmon color photographed well with a salmon appetizer, and the flavors blended nicely, too. Ram’s Gate Rose has some strawberry and melon notes, and it proved to be another brunch fave.\n\nOn the sweeter side of life, you'll find Lillet Rose ($20). This iconic French aperitif makes a great addition to Champagne for a sparkling cocktail. Lillet (pronounced lee-LAY) is a wine that is fortified with citrus liqueurs. It’s been made in Bordeaux since 1872 and although sweet, it is not cloying. The rose has flavors of orange that make for a fantastic spritzer, with seasonal fruit for appearance and taste.\n\nTraditionally, Lillet is mixed with spirits such as vodka and gin.\n\nI got this recipe a couple of years ago from the Lobby Bar at The New York Edition, a hotel in Manhattan. Although it might be a little fancy for a Labor Day cookout, it would work when the party moves indoors, and it would be perfect for a holiday weekend brunch.\n\nRecipe: A Martini by Any Other Name\n\nIngredients\n\n2 ounces Hendrick’s Gin\n\n¾ ounce Lillet Rose\n\n¼ ounce Italicus\n\n2 dashes Peychaud’s bitters\n\n3 muddled rose petals\n\nDirections\n\nCombine all ingredients in a shaker. Add ice, stir and then strain into a coup glass. For an extra touch, garnish with a rose petal.\n\nWhile we’re at it, how about this recipe for a less-fussy cocktail that will still have your friends talking. It has a dash of nostalgia, is easy to execute, and it tastes good to boot.\n\nRecipe: Nolet's Silver Firecracker Gin + Tonic\n\nIngredients\n\n1½ ounces NOLET’S Silver Gin\n\n1 Bomb Pop (or other ice pop)\n\nFrozen raspberries, blueberries\n\n4 ounces tonic water\n\nDirections\n\nFill a balloon glass with ice and frozen fruit. Add Nolet's Silver, tonic water and ice pop. Enjoy.\n\nCheers to your Labor Day celebrations and bidding a fond farewell to summer!

Labor Day also has historical significance: It has been a federal holiday since 1894 aimed at celebrating the contributions of American workers. For many, that usually means a long holiday weekend full of traveling, camping trips, and backyard barbecues. And while all of those activities are still possible in 2020, they'll likely look a lot different this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have cautioned against gatherings this Labor Day weekend, as more outbreaks are traced to small gatherings of family and friends.\n\nPrefer to listen?

Williams, the No. 3 seed, will face No. 15 seed Maria Sakkari of Greece in the Round of 16. Williams has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, one short of the all-time record set by Margaret Smith Court.

Washington wants British authorities to extradite Assange to the U.S. to face charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. The Department of Justice has indicted him on 18 counts, alleging 17 forms of espionage and 1 instance of computer misuse crimes connected to WikiLeaks' dissemination of secret U.S. military documents provided to him by former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Assange, 49, denies the charges and claims the U.S. documents WikiLeaks published in 2010 exposed war crimes and human rights abuses by the U.S. military in Iraq. WikiLeaks says the U.S. is trying to criminalize journalistic activity and if Assange is extradited it could have serious implications for First Amendment protections.\n\nExtreme heat is a concern for firefighters\n\nA heat wave is expected to spread triple-digit temperatures over much of California through Monday as a high-pressure system perches over the Western United States.

A record-breaking 117 degrees was recorded in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley on Saturday and temperatures in the Central Valley are expected to be in the triple digits until Thursday. The extreme heat is a cause for concern for firefighters battling wildfires across the state, including the Creek Fire in eastern Fresno County and the SQF Complex fire in Tulare County.\n\nMore than 200 campers rescued by helicopter as Creek Fire prompts state of emergency in California: What we know\n\nShould Americans be concerned about election meddling this November?

Levin, a political scientist at the University of Hong Kong, says he has found that meddling could \"potentially determine the election result in 2020, as it is very likely to have done many times in the past both in the U.S. and elsewhere.\" As Americans reflect on the threat of Russia wading into November's presidential election, the book delivers the score on topics such as election interference, common tactics used by meddlers, which country has meddled the most, and which country is the top target.

Instead, it was more of a combination of role players like Richie James, Darius Slayton and Isaiah Hodgins who each took turns being Jones's preferred choice on a given week.\n\nPLAY TO WIN $10K: USA TODAY's Pro Football Survivor Pool is free to enter. Sign up now!\n\nThat changes this year with the addition of Waller.\n\nThe soon-to-be 31-year-old tight end was widely reported as the Giants' QB favorite weapon and it showed during his only preseason action. In his lone drive versus the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 18, Waller caught three of four passes from Jones' as he was targeted early and often.\n\nThe main concern with the former Raiders' tight end is that after playing in all 32 games in 2019 and 2020, he's played in a combined 20 games the last two seasons.\n\nWhile Waller's only gone over this total once (9 TDs in 2020), I'm betting on him staying relatively healthy this year and finding the end zone at least five times this season as he and Jones build a rapport in the red zone in 2023.\n\nCurrently at +116 (bet $100 to win $116), this is a no-brainer bet to me for the Waller to score at least five times.\n\nNew York Jets: Garrett Wilson OVER 82.5 receptions (-112)\n\nEven with the great value of Waller TDs, my favorite bet of the group belongs to Wilson exceeding this 82.5 reception line.\n\nDespite dealing with a revolving door at the QB position last season, the 23-year-old wide receiver still hauled in 83 receptions for 1,103 receiving yards, earning him the Offensive Rookie of the Year honor in 2022.\n\nNow working with future Hall-of-Fame QB Aaron Rodgers, Wilson looks to build off his rookie success and take that next step in his sophomore campaign. The signs are already there in what we've seen on \"Hard Knocks\" so far and his limited preseason work.\n\nWilson and most of the Jets' first team offense suited up in the preseason finale against the Giants last Saturday night.\n\nRodgers and Wilson connected multiple times on their second and final drive which ultimately led to a beautiful catch-and-throw TD, likely the first of many connections in the end zone for the new duo.\n\nBetween Wilson's talent and a skill group around him that's currently not 100 percent healthy, the former 2022 10th overall pick will clear this number with ease as he establishes himself as one of the best, young wide receivers in the NFL this season.\n\nI'd also place a small wager on Garrett Wilson to win Offensive Player of the Year at 25-1 (+2500) on FanDuel Sportsbook or for the best value of 30-1 odds (+3000) at DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nNFL:NY Giants 53-man roster cuts tracker: NFL deadline nears; are more trades brewing?\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: Devonta Smith OVER 925.5 receiving yards (-112)\n\nAfter a solid rookie campaign, Smith exploded in 2022 as he posted career-highs in targets (136), receptions (95) receiving yards (1,196) and touchdowns (7). He's yet to miss a game in the NFL as he's played in all 34 contests through two seasons and most importantly comes into his third campaign healthy.\n\nWhile Smith's numbers might be inflated because of tight end Dallas Goedert being placed on injured reserve (IR) for four games last season, there's also the factor that there were several times in 2022 where the Eagles didn't throw much at all in the second half of games after taking such a big lead at halftime.\n\nStatistically, that will almost certainly change this season.\n\nEven if Goedert and fellow star wide receiver A.J. Brown don't miss much time due to injury, 925.5 receiving yards is still too low of a number for Smith, who notched 916 yards on only 64 catches in his rookie season.\n\nBet the over here as Smith's ability to stay healthy and produce at a high level continues in year three for the 24-year-old dynamic playmaker.\n\nIf you want more value, I'd wager on Smith to have 1,000+ receiving yards currently at +105 (bet $100 to win $105) on FanDuel Sportsbook.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/05/11/nfl-season-kicks-off-with-super-bowl-champion-chiefs-hosting-lions-jets-rodgers-on-mnf/70207385007/", "title": "NFL season kicks off with Super Bowl champion Chiefs hosting ...", "text": "ROB MAADDI\n\nAP\n\nPatrick Mahomes and the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs will kick off the NFL season against the upstart Detroit Lions in a matchup of high-powered offenses and will host Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles in a Super Bowl rematch on “Monday Night Football” in Week 11.\n\nAaron Rodgers will make his New York Jets debut in the first Monday night game of the season against the Buffalo Bills and later faces the Miami Dolphins in the NFL's first Black Friday game on Nov. 24.\n\nThanks to Rodgers' arrival in the Big Apple, the Jets will have six nationally televised games, including their first Sunday night game since 2011 when they take on the Chiefs on Oct. 1.

After leaving full-time IndyCar series competition with the end of the 2017 campaign, the 44-year-old Brazilian star driver will again race for Team Penske during the month of May in a part-time effort, according to team spokesperson Sarah Bonkowski.\n\nTeam Penske director of communications Merrill Cain also confirmed a report that Castroneves will race for the team in the newly-named GMR Grand Prix on May 9, also at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\n\"That is the plan,\" Cain said.\n\nLast May, when Castroneves finished 18th in the Greatest Spectacle in Racing – just his fourth finish outside the top 15 in 19 appearances – team owner Roger Penske hinted one of the race’s most successful drivers would be back for its 104th running on May 24, but nothing was set in stone.\n\nPenske told The Associated Press before last year’s race that his commitment to Castroneves hanging onto a sliver of his illustrious open-wheel racing career was set to last three years after starting in 2018. After his 2017 IndyCar season where he won once (Iowa), grabbed three poles and fourth in the series, Castroneves left the series full-time to join Penske’s sports car program. That season was also the last that Team Penske ran four full-time entries.\n\nIn the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, Castroneves has finished in seventh and fourth place, respectively, in the series championship the past two years. with seven podium finishes and a 2018 win at Mid-Ohio.\n\nIn his 11th attempt to join A.J. Foyt, Al Unser and Rick Mears as the only four-time Indy 500 winners, Castroneves is coming off two of his three worst finishes at the race, including 18th-place a year ago while a lap down and 27th in 2018 after a crash on Lap 146 while he was driving fifth. The legend has finished second-place three times during his Indy 500 career, including as recently as 2017, during his last full-season stint in the series.\n\nA year ago, Castroneves struggled and finished 21st in the IndyCar Grand Prix after landing top-six in each of the race's first five runnings.\n\nTeam Penske has won each of the past two Indy 500s, with Will Power and Simon Pagenaud sweeping both races held during May at IMS.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/cubs/2012/11/08/chicago-cubs-offseason-report/1693665/", "title": "Cubs: Quick fix not part of plan", "text": "By John Perrotto, Special for USA TODAY\n\nThe Cubs went 61-101 in 2012, which gave them the second-worst record in the major leagues\n\nLast season also marked the 104th anniversary of the Cubs' last World Series title\n\nThe Cubs don't seem close to removing their Billy Goat Curse\n\nTheo Epstein knew trying to reverse a curse with the Chicago Cubs likely would take a lot longer than it did with the Boston Red Sox.\n\nAfter one year as Cubs president of baseball operations, the former Red Sox general manager has been proved correct.\n\nThe Cubs went 61-101 in 2012, which gave them the second-worst record in the major leagues, behind the Houston Astros, who finished 55-107. It marked the Cubs' first 100-loss season since 1966, and Chicago finished two losses from the franchise record of 103 set in 1962 and matched in 1966.\n\nLast season also marked the 104th anniversary of the Cubs' last World Series title.\n\nEpstein took over his hometown Red Sox in 2003, and they won their first World Series title in 86 years the following season, eradicating the so-called Curse of the Bambino. But the Cubs don't seem close to removing their Billy Goat Curse.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say, 'Don't worry about 101 losses because we have a magic plan to win a World Series in 2013, it's going to happen, so be there now,'\" Epstein told news reporters in his season-ending news conference. \"That's not the case. I think we're trying to communicate that there is a plan, there is a vision.\n\n\"It might be a little bit longer term than we all want it to be, but we're committed to it ... and that there's a great reward at the end. We can't guarantee results, but I can tell everybody that we're not going to be satisfied until we're in the postseason year-in and year-out and we're in contention every year.\"\n\nEpstein has the people he wants in place to help carry out his vision in general manager Jed Hoyer, manager Dale Sveum and senior vice president of scouting and development Jason McLeod. All were part of the Red Sox's organization when they won in 2004.\n\nBut the difference between the Red Sox and Cubs is that Boston was in position to win when Epstein took over as GM in 2003. They got within one game of the World Series that season, losing to the New York Yankees in seven games in the American League Championship Series.\n\nThe Cubs, conversely, haven't been to the playoffs since 2008 and haven't won a postseason game since 2003.\n\nEpstein and Hoyer know how far they have to go to be competitive but aren't looking for quick fixes. They didn't hang on to veterans this past season when they fell out of contention, instead trading right-hander Ryan Dempster, left-hander Paul Maholm, catcher Geovany Soto and utility players Jeff Baker and Reed Johnson for prospects.\n\nThe Cubs will listen to offers this offseason for left fielder Alfonso Soriano, who had a career-high 108 RBI in 2012 and hit 32 home runs. The Cubs are willing to eat a large chunk of the $36 million on the final two years of his eight-year, $136 million contract if they get a decent haul in return.\n\nBut the Cubs aren't completely writing off 2013. They know the addition of a second wild card in each league makes the road to the postseason a little easier.\n\nYet the Cubs are only looking to add veterans via trade if they have one year left on their contracts or sign free agents to one-year deals so they will be able to flip those players in July should they fall out of the race.\n\nThey have other reasons to look ahead to next season, most notably to see how much improvement first baseman Anthony Rizzo, catcher Welington Castillo and right-hander Jeff Samardzija make.\n\nAll three look like key parts of the future. Rizzo hit .285 with 15 home runs and 48 RBI in 87 games, Castillo batted .265 with five homers in 52 games and Samardzija went 9-13 with a 3.81 ERA in his first season as a starter.\n\n***\n\nWhere the Cubs stand at each position\n\nCatcher\n\nWelington Castillo took the starting job late in the season as a rookie and looks like a potential keeper. He hit .265 with five home runs in 52 games, providing more pop than Steve Clevenger, a fellow rookie who batted .201 with one homer in 69 games. Clevenger is considered the better defensive catcher, but Castillo shows enough promise with the bat to be the No.1 backstop.\n\nFirst base\n\nAnthony Rizzo was a bright spot in a 101-loss season as he hit .285 with 15 home runs in 87 games after being recalled from Class AAA (Des Moines) Iowa. The 23-year-old left-handed hitter figures to be a fixture in the middle of the batting order for years. Bryan LaHair played well enough in the first half of his first full major league season to be selected to play in the All-Star Game. He hit .259 with 16 homers in 130 games.\n\nSecond base\n\nDarwin Barney won his first Gold Glove Award in 2012 as he made two errors in 731 total chances. Barney hit .254 with seven home runs in 156 games and needs to improve his .299 on-base percentage if he is going to stay in the No.2 spot in the batting order. Adrian Cardenas once was considered an intriguing prospect, but he hit .183 in 45 games in his major league debut in 2012.\n\nShortstop\n\nStarlin Castro, 22, has been selected to two All-Star Games, which is why the Cubs signed him to a seven-year, $60 million contract extension that takes effect in 2013. Castro loses his focus at times in the field, but he has a good blend of power and speed, hitting .283 with 14 home runs and 25 stolen bases this year. Castro blocks strong-armed prospect Junior Lake, who hit .279 with 10 homers in 103 games at Class AA.\n\nThird base\n\nIan Stewart likely will get another crack at the starting job in spring training after having a miserable 2012 following his acquisition from the Colorado Rockies. Stewart is arbitration eligible, and the Cubs could non-tender him if they find a better alternative. He batted .201 with five home runs in 55 games before having season-ending wrist surgery. Utility infielder Luis Valbuena made the majority of starts at third but hit .219 with four homers in 90 games. Prospect Josh Vitters was overmatched in his first trip to the majors, hitting .121 with two homers in 36 games.\n\nLeft field\n\nAlfonso Soriano had one of the best seasons of his 14-year career in 2012. He no longer is a stolen-base threat, and the Cubs would love to trade him for prospects. But Soriano has full no-trade rights as a player with a minimum of 10 years in the majors and five with the same club, and he also has $36 million left on the last two years of his eight-year, $136 million contract.\n\nCenter field\n\nBrett Jackson is expected to start next season in the minors after hitting .175 with four home runs and striking out in 59 of 142 plate appearances in his first trip to the majors. If they can't find a stopgap for center, the Cubs will go with a platoon of speedy left-handed hitting Tony Campana, who has been successful on 54 of 59 stolen bases attempts in two major league seasons, and right-handed batting Dave Sappelt, who hit .275 with two homers in 26 late-season games.\n\nRight field\n\nDavid DeJesus had a decent 2012 after signing a two-year, $10 million contract as a free agent. He batted .263 with nine home runs out of the leadoff spot, but 61 walks helped boost his on-base percentage to .350.\n\nStarters\n\nRight-hander Matt Garza, who led Cubs starters with a 3.32 ERA in 2011, was limited to 18 starts in 2012 because of a stress reaction in his elbow and went 5-7 with a 3.91 ERA. Right-hander Jeff Samardzija was thrust into the ace role and acquitted himself well in his first full season as a starter by going 9-13 with a 3.81 ERA. Left-hander Travis Wood was 6-13 with a 4.27 ERA in 26 starts and is all but assured of a spot in the 2013 rotation. The Cubs need more depth.\n\nBullpen\n\nJames Russell figures to be the top left-hander after posting a 3.25 ERA in 77 games, with Jeff Beliveau possibly serving as a second lefty. The Cubs are excited to get a look at right-hander Arodys Vizcaino, acquired from the Atlanta Braves in a July trade for Paul Maholm. Hard-throwing Vizcaino was recovering from Tommy John elbow surgery at the time of the deal but should be in the mix with several other righties that include Michael Bowden, Zach Putnam, Jaye Chapman, Alberto Cabrera, Lendy Castillo, Rafael Dolis, Carlos Gutierrez and Tony Zych.\n\nCloser\n\nCarlos Marmol is the closer — for now. Despite the ups and downs he has suffered in his three full seasons as the closer, he has 92 saves in that span.\n\n***\n\nProspects to watch\n\nSS Javier Baez: The 19-year-old's time in the Arizona Fall League ended in strange fashion when he suffered a non-displaced break of his right thumb while high-fiving a teammate. Baez, the Cubs' first-round draft pick in 2011, made his professional debut this season and hit .333 with 12 home runs and 20 stolen bases in 57 games for low-Class A Peoria (Ill.) before being bumped to Daytona (Daytona Beach, Fla.), where he batted .244 with four homers in 23 games. Baez is a pure hitter with outstanding bat speed who should hit for power and average.\n\nOF Jorge Soler: The Cubs signed the Cuban defector to a nine-year, $30 million major league contract as a free agent in June, and he hit a combined .299 with five home runs and 12 steals in 34 games with the rookie-level Arizona League Cubs and Peoria. Soler, 20, has big-time power potential and outstanding bat speed. Some scouts think he is one step below Oakland Athletics outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, another Cuban defector.\n\nOF Albert Almora: Chicago's first-round selection in this year's draft had a solid pro debut, hitting .331 with two homers in 33 games with the Arizona League Cubs and short-season Boise. The 18-year-old is lauded as much for his leadership skills and work ethic as he is for his considerable athletic talent.\n\nOF Brett Jackson: He has the potential to be a Gold Glove center fielder with power but has to cut down on strikeouts. Jackson, 24, whiffed 158 times in 407 at-bats with Class AAA (Des Moines) Iowa this year, then was punched out 59 more times in 120 at-bats after being called up by the Cubs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/04/06/texas-longhorn-football-players-former-golfers-make-presence-kirk-bohls/7109599002/", "title": "Texas Longhorn football players, former golfers making presence felt", "text": "While I got ya, here are nine things and one crazy prediction:\n\n1. Accountability. Of all the statements two Texas football players made on a Tuesday virtual call, one stood out to me. Asked about the impression new coach Steve Sarkisian has made, veteran cornerback Josh Thompson said, “He just wants his players to be accountable and disciplined. He's high on discipline, and I really appreciate that because, I mean, every team needs that to be successful.” Amen. Those two qualities should translate into fewer penalties and more toughness. Know that Tom Herman’s four Texas teams ranked 122nd nationally and last in the Big 12 in penalties last year and 120th, 98th and 112th the previous years. Those attributes also show up in total defense (an erratic 64th, 97th, 67th and 41st in the last four years) as well as red zone defense (52nd and 104th) the last two seasons. … Asked who has impressed him, Thompson named LSU transfer linebacker Ray Thornton, McNeese State cornerback Darion Dunn and rookies Jamier Johnson and J.D. Coffey III. Thompson called Dunn “smart, a great athlete and fast” and said of the two freshmen, “Those two came in just ready to compete, and everything they do is with a purpose.

We didn't play well today. We need to be better tomorrow.\"\n\nDetroit (44-104) has lost two of the first three games of the four-game series against the Orioles (49-100), opening a 4½-game advantage for the worst record in the major leagues. Any combination of 10 Tigers losses and Orioles wins would clinch the top pick for Detroit in a draft highlighted by Arizona State first baseman Spencer Torkelson and Georgia pitcher Emerson Hancock.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\nBaltimore took Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman with the top pick this year after finishing 47-115 last season. Detroit selected Auburn pitcher Casey Mize with the No. 1 selection in 2018, a year after going 64-98.\n\nDetroit trailed 6-2 before a 39-minute rain delay in the middle of the sixth inning.\n\n\"The game had no pace, with a lot of walks, and that means our guys are standing around in the field and losing their edge,\" Gardenhire said. \"I think that got even worse after the rain.\"\n\nBaltimore's bullpen took over after the delay, striking out nine in four scoreless innings.\n\n\"They did a really nice job, but we gave them a breather by adding on some runs,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"That hasn't been one of our strong suits this season, so it was good to see.\"\n\nBaltimore won a night after blowing leads in the ninth and 12th innings of an 8-4 defeat that ended with John Hicks' grand slam.\n\n\"I think we've done really well in bounce-back games,\" Rio Ruiz said. \"It is huge to come back today and do what we did.\"\n\nJackson (3-10) gave up seven hits and two walks in five-plus innings, dropping to 0-6 with a 11.47 ERA in his last five starts.\n\nAsher Wojciechowski (3-8) won for the first time since July 26, allowing two runs and eight hits in five innings. He had been 0-5 in his previous eight starts.\n\nTrailing 2-1, the Orioles took the lead in a three-run third that included Dwight Smith Jr.'s two-out triple, Hanser Alberto's run-scoring bunt single and tiebreaking two-run homer by Ruiz. Baltimore broke open the game on two-run singles by Jonathan Villar off Nick Ramirez in the sixth and Anthony Santander against Matt Hall in the eighth. Santander stopped an 0-for-27 slide.\n\nThe game was delayed by rain for 39 minutes in the bottom of the sixth.\n\nTIGERS CLOSE IN ON LOSS RECORD\n\nDetroit is 20-54 at home with seven games left at Comerica Park. The big league record of 59 losses was by the 1939 St. Louis Browns.\n\nHONORING CHACE NUMATA\n\nAll of the Tigers in the first inning walked to the plate to \"Give It Up\" by KC and the Sunshine Band in honor of Chace Numata. The catching prospect, who used that as his walk-up song with Double-A Erie, died on Sept. 2 after a skateboarding accident. His family donated his liver, pancreas, heart and both kidneys to patients in need.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBaltimore LHP John Means (10-10, 3.47) and Detroit LHP Tyler Alexander (0-3, 5.40) are slated to start Monday's series finale. \"This is a weird feeling,\" Hyde said. \"I thought maybe tomorrow was a holiday or something, because staying on a Sunday night and playing at 4 on Monday afternoon is definitely different.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2020/05/28/indiana-sports-coronavirus-reopen-fans-racing-pacers-colts/5231797002/", "title": "Rebuild America: The status of sports in returning in Indiana", "text": "Many decisions by sports leaders about what to do during the pandemic are being made for them.

One of the reasons behind the drought has been his inability to get off on the right foot. In the past eight years, his average in the first round is nearly 2.5 strokes higher than the other three rounds.\n\nIn the Masters in April, McIlroy was kicking himself after opening with rounds of 73-73 and then seeing his weekend rounds of 71-64 - by far the lowest total in the final two rounds - falling three strokes short.\n\n\"It was nice to get off to that good start and sorta keep it going,\" he said.\n\nStarting on the back nine, McIlroy made four consecutive birdies beginning at the 12 th, added two more after the turn at the second and fourth, and finished off his day with a birdie from 18 feet on the last.\n\n\"I feel like this course, it lets you be pretty aggressive off the tee if you want to be, so I hit quite a lot of drivers out there and took advantage of my length and finished that off with some nice iron play and some nice putting,\" said McIlroy, who blasted past the 300-yard barrier with his driver 11 times. He added that he is more comfortable hitting his driver left to right at the moment instead of his powerful tight draw. \"I think just happy with when you get off to a good start like that, sometimes you can maybe start to be a little careful or start to give yourself a little more margin for error, but I stuck to my game plan.\n\n\"I stayed aggressive, hit that driver up 4, took an aggressive line on 5.

IndyStar confirmed reports Sunday night that multiple employees were either laid off or furloughed from both IMS and IndyCar, though a total number of combined full-time staff reduction was not immediately available. A source confirmed, though, that a majority of those who were affected were furloughed, rather than laid-off completely.\n\nAdditionally, a source confirmed that construction work that had been taking place across the IMS grounds related to renovations ahead of this year's Indy 500, as well as the employees involved, have been paused.\n\n“Due to the current economic conditions, we are taking actions which include non-essential expense reductions and staffing-level adjustments,\" said IMS in a statement.\n\nNotably, Penske announced in his letter to staff that he and company president Rob Kurnick would forgo 100% of their salaries for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis, and members of Penske Corp.’s board of directors have agreed to waive their cash compensation for the next six months. In addition, the company is working to reduce controllable costs, including “a hiring freeze, significantly reducing advertising, requesting the deferral of rent and postponing capital expenditures.”\n\nPenske joins NBA commissioner Adam Silver, as well as top NASCAR officials as heads of American professional sports leagues to have taken significant pay cuts during the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier this week, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the NBA's top-earning execs, including Silver and deputy commissioner Mark Tatum, were taking 20% reductions.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that NASCAR president Steve Phelps told employees that track presidents and series execs would receive a 25% slash, with all other employees losing 20%. At the top, at least though, Penske was far more drastic.\n\nThe latest IndyCar news:\n\nThe scaling back comes as all the company’s business operations are shut down across the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain; while those in Germany and Australia have ceased sales operations, though service facilities remain open, despite a decline in business.\n\nIn the United States, as several states have ushered in “shelter in place” orders, Penske confirmed that Penske Transportation Solutions, as well as many of his auto and commercial truck dealers have been deemed “essential” by state governments and remain open, but with limited on-site staffing as they encourage customers to place orders online or by phone.\n\nPenske also confirmed that a “very low” number of his employees have contracted the coronavirus, and that those persons are following quarantine guidelines.\n\nBut as the various business sectors have been hit hard by the steadily declining economy, Penske said he anticipated reductions in normal staff levels would follow unless the impact of the virus eases.\n\n“Your management teams will be reaching out to those impacted with further details regarding your individual situation,” he wrote. “For those of you who may be impacted by a workforce reduction, government programs and unemployment benefits may be immediately available to you.\n\n“Many factors will impact the length of workforce reductions, including federal/local guidelines and the conditions in your individual businesses. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.”\n\nIn IndyCar’s announced schedule upheaval this week, Penske now has the series-opener set for May 30-31 in the street race on Belle Isle, which Penske Corp. officials already serve as promoters for. The Indy 500, originally scheduled for May 24, was bumped to Aug. 23 with a nearly identical two-week ramp-up format.\n\nIn doing so, Penske shuffled races at Mid-Ohio, Gateway and Portland, while he also moved the GMR Grand Prix into a historic slot in the July 4 weekend to create a double-header event with NASCAR with its Xfinity Series race later that day and the Brickyard 400 run July 5.\n\n“I am disappointed that we have had to reschedule the Indianapolis 500,” Penske said Thursday in a release. “However, the health and safety of our event participants and spectators is our top priority, and we believe that postponing the event is the responsible decision with the conditions and restrictions we are facing.”\n\nThe message patterned closely to Penske’s closing of his letter to employees days later, sticking to a motto he’s followed since the early days of his racing and auto dealer ventures.\n\n“Human capital is, and always will be, our most important asset,” he said. “Rest assured, these actions are necessary as we grapple with the current economic impact on our business.”\n\nEmail IndyStar motor sports reporter Nathan Brown at nlbrown@gannett.com.

She tested negative again on a rapid antigen test, but a PCR test came back positive,” said Elizabeth Alexander, her communications director.\n\nThe first lady, who is double vaccinated and twice boosted, is taking Paxlovid, Pfizer’s antiviral drug, according to Alexander, who told CNN that Biden received her second booster shot in April.\n\nA person close to the first lady told CNN Tuesday morning that Jill Biden is “feeling good” and has “common cold”-like symptoms. The first lady is 71 years old, making her the oldest sitting first lady in modern American history. She exercises several times a week, taking classes at local barre gyms.\n\nThis is the first time she has had Covid-19, according to Alexander.\n\nThe first lady is currently in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, with President Joe Biden, who is due to return to Washington for a bill signing later Tuesday.\n\n“She is currently staying at a private residence in South Carolina and will return home after she receives two consecutive negative Covid tests,” Alexander added.\n\nThough she is isolated, the first lady is working on planning for the upcoming fall term for her job as an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, a White House official tells CNN. She is also attending virtually an event to mark the start of the upcoming semester.\n\nThe President, who recently recovered from his own case of Covid-19, continues to test negative, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Twitter. She added that President Biden will follow US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on close contacts and wear a mask for 10 days “when indoors and in close proximity to others.”\n\n“We will also increase the President’s testing cadence and report those results,” Jean-Pierre added.\n\nPresident Biden initially tested positive for Covid-19 on July 21. He isolated while taking a course of Paxlovid, eventually testing negative on July 27. However, on July 30 he tested positive for the virus again as he experienced a rebound case, which happens to some people who take Paxlovid. He against entered isolation and eventually emerged from the White House on August 7 after testing negative for two days in a row. He did not see the first lady during that time.\n\nThe Bidens have been on a vacation on the resort island near Charleston with family – including son Hunter, his wife Melissa and their son, Beau – since last Wednesday. They celebrated Mass on nearby John’s Island on Saturday and rode bikes on the beach on Sunday. The first lady stopped in some local shops by herself on Sunday.\n\nShe did not accompany the President on his outing to the Beach Club in Kiawah Island Monday night, according to a source close to the family. The first lady stayed behind at the residence as she was experiencing her cold-like symptoms, the source said. Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa and baby Beau Biden were seen with the President as they departed the club Monday evening after spending about an hour and fifteen minutes there\n\nThe family members traveling with the President and first lady have all tested negative, Alexander said.\n\nJill Biden has been an active voice encouraging Covid-19 vaccinations since the President took office. She has traveled to 40 states, many of which were for Covid-related events that included discussing vaccines, reopening plans, and the importance of booster shots. She spent several days last summer crisscrossing the southern United States pleading with Americans to get their shots.\n\n“I want to make the point that people don’t think they’ll be affected. They think it won’t happen to them, and then it does – and then it’s too late. I don’t want them to take their health for granted,” she told CNN in an interview last July as she encouraged vaccines in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Betsy Klein Kate Bennett", "Betsy Klein", "Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/politics/joe-biden-covid-19/index.html", "title": "Biden tests positive for Covid-19 and is experiencing mild symptoms ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday that he’s tested positive for Covid-19 but will continue to work while in isolation at the White House despite his mild symptoms.\n\nIn a video posted to Twitter, Biden told Americans that he is “doing well” and that his symptoms continue to be mild.\n\n“I guess you heard, this morning I tested positive for Covid. But I’ve been double vaccinated, double boosted. Symptoms are mild and I really appreciate your inquires and concerns. But I’m doing well, getting a lot of work done. Going to continue to get it done and in the meantime, thanks for your concern and keep the faith. It’s gonna be OK,” Biden, who was unmasked while standing outside on the Truman Balcony, said in the 20-second video the White House says was filmed by a masked and socially distanced videographer.\n\nThe mild symptoms and diagnosis protocol for Biden – a double-boosted 79-year-old at high risk for experiencing severe illness – will mean isolating and “working and resting” at the White House residence for the rest of the day, according to a senior administration official. This is the first time Biden has tested positive for Covid-19, and he last tested negative on Tuesday, per White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nBiden has called several people in the hours since his diagnosis. He wrote on Twitter Thursday afternoon that he is “doing great” following the positive test and said he called Pennsylvania politicians to send his regrets about having to cancel a scheduled trip to the commonwealth. The tweet was accompanied by an image of the President smiling at a desk, without a mask, in the residence of the White House.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is seen in this photo shared to Twitter, after he tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, July 21. White House\n\nIn a memo that was sent to staff obtained by CNN, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Biden will be working over the phone and on video conference for the next few days following the positive result.\n\n“I’ve spoken to him several times this morning already about an array of matters, and he is focused on our pending business,” Klain wrote on Thursday.\n\nDay Zero\n\nBiden tested positive for Covid-19 Thursday morning and has begun taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. It requires a doctor’s prescription.\n\n“Consistent with (US Center for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nThursday marks “Day 0” of the President’s Covid-19 timeline – meaning he will be in isolation until at least next Tuesday in accordance to the CDC’s guidelines.\n\nThe President’s symptoms include “rhinorreha (or ‘runny nose’) and fatigue, with an occasional dry cough, which started yesterday evening,” according to a letter from the President’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor. Biden did not have a fever Thursday morning, White House coronavirus coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told CNN.\n\nJha later told reporters that Biden’s oxygen levels were “normal” as of Thursday morning and that Biden’s Covid-19 virus sample has been sent to a lab to identify the specific variant he is infected with. Results are expected in “less than a week.”\n\nBiden first tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test Thursday morning as part of routine screening, and the positive result was later was confirmed by a PCR test, his physician said.\n\nO’Connor also noted that the President met the FDA’s criteria for use of the antiviral Paxlovid, adding, “I anticipate that he will respond favorably, as most maximally protected patients do.”\n\nDue to his age, Biden is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, although the CDC says older adults being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces their risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nJha said Thursday that Biden has the “full set of protections” to deal with Covid-19 at his advanced age.\n\n“The bottom line is given how much immunity he has from vaccines, given that he was started on treatments right away … I think all of those things very dramatically reduce his risk of serious illness,” Jha told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny during the White House press briefing. “And that’s really the goal here, is to prevent serious illness, to keep that risk as low as possible. I think he’s gotten that full set of protections.”\n\nBiden received his first two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ahead of his inauguration in January 2021, his first booster shot in September and his second booster vaccination on March 30.\n\nStaff takes measures to adapt, Harris and first lady keep their previous schedules\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden tested negative on Thursday.\n\nJean-Pierre indicated that the West Wing will continue to practice its current protocols but that the White House residential staff will be taking measures to create a “very minimal footprint” to avoid infecting others.\n\nThe number of aides who staff the White House residence will be reduced to the “bare minimum” in light of Biden’s positive Covid-19 diagnosis, an official told CNN.\n\nAnd a mid-level West Wing aide who works in close proximity to Biden and was on his recent trip to the Middle East also tested positive for Covid-19, according to two sources familiar. The person is not considered a close contact of the President and tested positive earlier this week.\n\nHarris is expected to keep her normal schedule while Biden isolates. The senior administration official said there are no plans and no need to transfer executive powers to Harris – as was done last November for 85 minutes, when Biden was under anesthesia for a routine colonoscopy.\n\nHarris has been identified as a close contact of Biden, a White House official told CNN. Harris last saw Biden on Tuesday and tested negative on Thursday. She is a close contact, an additional aide says, because they spent more than 15 minutes together while being briefed on the presidential daily brief. The White House official added that Harris will follow CDC guidelines for those who are vaccinated, including wearing a well-fitting mask while around people for 10 days from the date of the last close contact.\n\nThe first lady and the vice president said they had both spoken to the President on Thursday following the diagnosis.\n\nJill Biden told reporters in Detroit earlier Thursday that she had spoken to the President and that “he’s doing fine. He’s feeling good.”\n\nThe first lady, her spokesman Michael LaRosa told CNN, will keep her original schedule on Thursday, which includes a stop in Georgia before heading to Wilmington, Delaware. She is also double boosted, LaRosa said.\n\nAnd Thursday afternoon, Harris said at an event in North Carolina that the President “is in good spirits.”\n\n“He is working from the White House residence and when he spoke he was very pleased that we are all together today,” she told her audience, adding that Biden told her to “tell everybody hello.”\n\nUpcoming presidential travel canceled\n\nA White House official told CNN that Biden’s scheduled travel to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, later on Thursday for a speech on crime prevention has been canceled. A DNC fundraiser Biden was scheduled to headline Thursday night has been postponed, officials said.\n\nIt’s yet to be determined whether the event will be rescheduled or if donors will be asked to make their pledged contributions.\n\nBiden was also scheduled to travel to Orlando and Tampa, Florida, on Monday, but now he’s expected to be isolating.\n\nBiden has ramped up his engagement with the public over the past year as the White House has shifted its approach toward the pandemic. On Wednesday, Biden traveled to Somerset, Massachusetts, for an event on climate executive actions, where he was seen shaking hands and greeting attendees in the outdoor crowd.\n\nThe President’s positive diagnosis comes less than a week after a swing through the Middle East, where he held meetings with world leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia. While abroad, Biden was seen shaking hands, bumping fists and embracing other leaders.\n\nThe White House is currently working on contact tracing for those who may have been close contacts of Biden, per an official, since his positive Covid test. They plan to inform any close contacts on Thursday, including members of Congress and the press.\n\nAt least one member of Congress who was a close contact after seeing Biden in Massachusetts received a contact tracing call from the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe White House reached out to the lawmaker’s office Thursday afternoon, according to a source familiar, and advised the member of Congress to follow the CDC recommendations for what an individual should do when they’re determined to be a close contact.\n\nOne of the recommendations, for example, for someone who is fully vaccinated and was a close contact is to wear a well-fitting mask while around other people for 10 days from the date of last close contact.\n\nWhite House prepared for this moment\n\nWhite House officials have been preparing for months for what many viewed as the inevitability that Biden would come down with Covid.\n\nA wave of cases – including among Harris, White House staffers and members of Congress – has swept Washington through the spring and summer. And as more and more of his top officials and members of his family contracted Covid, officials came to believe it was possible the President himself would get sick, even as they took steps to shield him from the virus.\n\nKlain, in his Thursday memo to staff, wrote that White House officials “have said for some time that there was a substantial possibility that the President – like anyone else – could get Covid, and we have prepared for this possibility. We are now executing on our plan so that the President can continue to work seamlessly from the Residence.”\n\nBiden last underwent an annual physical in November at Walter Reed National Medical Center. O’Connor wrote in a memo at the time that the President remained “fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.”\n\nOfficials had a loose plan in place for the day Biden tested positive, including informing the public when the tests were confirmed and releasing a letter from Biden’s physician – which both took place on Thursday.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump issued a 1 a.m. ET tweet on October, 2, 2020, announcing that both he and then-first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for Covid-19. And Biden officials have been mindful of how the previous administration handled Trump’s diagnosis and have been intent on being more forthcoming about Biden’s condition.\n\nNow, more than two years into the pandemic, Biden has become the second sitting US president to test positive for Covid-19. His mild symptoms so far stand in stark contrast to Trump’s diagnosis before a vaccine was available in 2020 – a Covid infection that led to a multi-day hospitalization at Walter Reed.\n\nCovid emergency continues\n\nThe President’s infection comes as Covid cases are once again on the rise in the US, driven by the most contagious strain of the virus yet – BA.5. More than 1 million people have died of Covid-19 across the country since the pandemic began.\n\nThe Biden administration is continuing the Covid-19 public health emergency as it seeks new funding from Congress for treatments and vaccines. The public health emergency declaration allows many Americans to obtain free Covid-19 testing, therapeutic treatment and vaccines. Medicare has also relaxed the rules governing telehealth so that many more seniors can access such services during the declaration. And states are not involuntarily disenrolling residents from Medicaid during the declaration, in exchange for receiving more generous federal matching funds.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Thursday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Betsy Klein Kate Sullivan", "Maegan Vazquez", "Betsy Klein", "Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/politics/merrick-garland-covid-19/index.html", "title": "Two Biden Cabinet members among dozens of positive Covid-19 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTwo members of President Joe Biden’s Cabinet tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, becoming some of the latest high-profile Washington figures to contract the virus in recent days.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced their positive diagnoses after having attended the elite Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington on Saturday. Other attendees, including first lady Jill Biden’s press secretary, Michael LaRosa; Vice President Kamala Harris’ communication director, Jamal Simmons; Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro; California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff; Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins; and the President’s sister, Valerie Biden Owens, have also announced positive tests.\n\nThe string of positive cases has turned attention in Washington to the Gridiron dinner, an event that brings together some of the city’s most prominent journalists, including from CNN, and the government officials they cover. Attendees had their vaccination status checked, but negative Covid-19 tests were not required to enter.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, 37 positive Covid-19 cases had been reported following Saturday’s dinner, according to a letter from the club to its members.\n\nTom DeFrank, the president of the Gridiron Club, said in a statement Wednesday that “there is no way of being certain about when they first contracted Covid,” DeFrank said.\n\n“But they did interact with other guests during the night and we have to be realistic and expect some more cases,” he continued. “Except in cases of public officials who have on their own disclosed their status, we will protect the privacy of guests who test positive.”\n\nGarland is not experiencing symptoms but asked to be tested after learning he may have been exposed to the virus, the Justice Department said. Earlier Wednesday, Garland had attended a news conference with other officials, including FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, to announce sanctions against Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev.\n\nRaimondo, meanwhile, is “experiencing mild symptoms” but is “confident that the vaccine has prevented her from experiencing more significant symptoms,” according to a statement from the Commerce Department Wednesday. Schiff said in a Tuesday tweet that he was “feeling fine,” and Castro reported in his own of “experiencing mild symptoms.” Owens did not have close contact with Biden or the first lady prior to her test, according to a statement from Celadon Books.\n\nLaRosa, who had tested negative earlier this week after attending the Gridiron dinner, confirmed to CNN on Thursday that he was experiencing mild symptoms and isolating at home.\n\nThough typically in close contact with the first lady, LaRosa only saw her briefly Thursday at the White House. He told CNN his interaction with Jill Biden had lasted less than 15 minutes and that they were several feet apart, which under CDC guidance means the first lady was not considered a close contact.\n\nHarris had been in close contact with Simmons, who tested positive on Wednesday, press secretary Kirsten Allen said.\n\n“The Vice President will follow CDC guidance for those that have been in close contact with a positive individual and will continue to consult with her physician. The Vice President plans to continue with her public schedule,” Allen said in a written statement.\n\nIn addition to having attended the dinner over the weekend, Simmons was also pictured in the East Room of the White House during the Affordable Care Act event with President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.\n\nBiden is not considered to have been a close contact of Simmons, a White House official told CNN.\n\nInside the White House, in accordance with federal public health guidelines, officials and visitors have not been required to wear masks or social distance. Visitors are expected to be tested for Covid-19 before attending official White House events.\n\nSimmons’ case isn’t the first to touch the White House.\n\nLast month, second gentleman Doug Emhoff tested positive for the virus, marking the first known case of Covid-19 among the first or second families since Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took office in January 2021. And White House press secretary Jen Psaki and White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre have also tested positive in recent weeks.\n\nCovid-19 cases in Washington, DC, have declined since their peak in early January, when the country was facing a wave of Omicron variant cases. But Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, said Wednesday that he thinks there will be an uptick in cases of Covid-19 in the US over the next few weeks, and that it is likely that there could be a surge in the fall.\n\n“I think we should expect … that over the next couple of weeks, we are going to see an uptick in cases. And hopefully there is enough background immunity so that we don’t wind up with a lot of hospitalizations,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, when asked by Bloomberg TV’s David Westin about the prospect of another wave of Covid-19 from BA.2 or another variant, given the level of immunity believed to exist in the US today.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc Jasmine Wright Sam Fossum", "Paul Leblanc", "Jasmine Wright", "Sam Fossum"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/15/iowa-legislature-notified-positive-covid-19-coronavirus-case-house-masks/4184902001/", "title": "Iowa lawmakers notified of positive COVID-19 case in first week of ...", "text": "Iowa lawmakers returned to the state Capitol Monday to begin their legislative session.\n\nOn Friday, they received an email notifying them that \"someone associated with the Iowa House of Representatives\" had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nChief Clerk Meghan Nelson emailed Iowa House members and staff Friday evening to inform them of the positive case.

He added that \"any Senator who wants to participate virtually will be allowed to do so.\"\n\nBut just hours after the tweets, another member of his panel also tested positive.\n\n\"Over the last few months, I’ve been routinely tested for COVID-19, including testing negative last Saturday, but tonight my rapid antigen test came back positive,\" Tillis said in a statement Friday evening. \"I will be following the recommendations of my doctor and will be self-isolating at home for 10 days and notifying those I’ve been in close contact with. Thankfully, I have no symptoms and I feel well.\"\n\nLike Tillis, Sen. Lee said he also plans to self-isolate for 10 days. He said in a statement Friday afternoon\n\nLee announced in a statement released Friday morning he received a positive COVID-19 test after \"experiencing symptoms consistent with longtime allergies\" on Thursday. He said he would self-isolate but assured Republican Senate leaders he would be \"back to work in time\" to advance Barrett's nomination in the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate, which has final say on a nominee's confirmation.\n\nMore:Speedy confirmation schedule for Amy Barrett injects urgency into FBI background probe, analysts say\n\nMore:The Senate could confirm Amy Coney Barrett to Supreme Court just days before Election Day, with hearings beginning Oct. 12\n\nLee met with Barrett on Tuesday and Tillis met with her on Wednesday. They both took part in a Wednesday Judiciary Committee hearing with former FBI Director James Comey, pressing him on his handling of the Russia inquiry.\n\nBoth also took part in Wednesday's lunch meeting of Republican senators.\n\nTillis also attended an in-person debate in North Carolina Thursday evening, where he faced off with former North Carolina State Sen. Cal Cunningham, a Democrat. Cunningham said on Twitter he wished Tillis a “quick recovery” and would also get tested himself.\n\nSince Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Sept. 18, Democrats have sought to delay the confirmation process for the Supreme Court seat, citing the proximity to the Nov. 3 election. Democrats hope Joe Biden defeats Trump on Election Day and that Democrats win back the Senate, which would give Democrats control of picking and confirming justices.\n\nBut a majority of senators previously supported moving the nomination forward to fill the seat before the election. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., explained last month that the Senate had plenty of time to get Barrett confirmed before Election Day.\n\nSave for a few delay tactics, the GOP majority in the Senate left Democrats unable to stop Barrett from being confirmed. Then came Friday's news that Trump and Lee tested positive.\n\n\"It’s critical that Chairman Graham put the health of senators, the nominee and staff first – and ensure a full and fair hearing that is not rushed, not truncated, and not virtual. Otherwise this already illegitimate process will become a dangerous one,\" Schumer and Feinstein wrote Friday.\n\nMore:After Trump's COVID diagnosis, a running list of everyone being tested and their results\n\nMore:Which members of Congress have tested positive for COVID-19?\n\nMcConnell told reporters at a news conference Friday in Kentucky the Senate would continue to push forward with Barrett's nomination, and added there were no plans to alter how the Senate operates, including when it came to widespread testing.\n\n\"We've been operating in the same environment now since the first of May, and we've been able to do Senate business. There's no reason why we can't continue to do that,\" he said. \"The disease has not kept us from operating as we would normally, and there's no reason to expect that to be the case in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nMcConnell added that the news had not shifted the timeline for a full Senate vote to confirm Barrett to the Supreme Court. \"I'm planning on moving to the nomination as soon as it comes out of committee,\" he said. Graham has already said that date could be as early as Oct. 26.\n\nMcConnell refused multiple times to say whether he'd been tested for COVID-19 in light of Trump's diagnosis. The Kentucky Republican repeatedly said, \"we're following the CDC guidelines.\"\n\nUnlike the White House, Congress does not have a standardized COVID-19 testing program but on Friday, the Capitol's top doctor announced a new COVID-19 testing strategy that allows more flexibility for lawmakers and staff to receive a test.\n\nThe Office of Attending Physician Brian Monahan announced that his office was providing tests to lawmakers and staff who \"have symptoms suggestive of coronavirus or who are concerned they may have been exposed to a known positive Covid 19 patient.\"\n\nThe new guidance, while allowing for more testing on Capitol Hill by those who request it, does not mandate tests for those who visit the Capitol — a policy that the White House has instituted.\n\nThe White House offered rapid-testing machines to lawmakers earlier this year, but Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined the offer in May, saying the testing equipment could be better used elsewhere.\n\nFor months, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concern about the lack of testing in the Capitol. Those worries were renewed Friday after Trump's diagnosis.\n\n\"I don’t understand why the Speaker would continue to not have testing,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., not often one to agree with McCarthy, concurred on the need for testing.\n\nShe told reporters Friday it might not be a bad idea to mandate testing, adding there was a possibility of a \"super spreader\" event with all members of Congress flying in from districts around the country and congregating at the Capitol.\n\n\"I think it is incredibly important that we would be tested, \" she said.\n\nMore:How safe is Capitol Hill from COVID-19?

President Donald Trump has touted the experimental antibody treatment and took it while he was being treated for the disease.\n\n\"In a clinical trial, the investigational therapy was shown to reduce COVID-19-related hospitalization or ER visits in certain patients who are at high risk for progressing to severe,\" the FDA tweeted Saturday.\n\nThe drug, a pair of monoclonal antibodies, is intended to mimic the natural process of the immune system, providing it with molecules the body normally manufactures to fight off specific diseases.\n\nTrump was able to get it under a \"compassionate use\" exemption, which the company said at the time it has granted to fewer than 10 people, after requests from their doctors and approval by the FDA.\n\nA similar monoclonal antibody treatment was also given emergency authorization earlier this month.\n\nThe FDA has not licensed either drug but instead granted a fast-tracked authorization process that differs from a regular drug license application in several ways, though the companies still needed to prove the drugs are safe and effective.\n\nBoth drugs are intended for patients who have been diagnosed but are not sick enough to be hospitalized. About 9% of the patients in the trial who received a placebo ended up in the hospital compared to 3% who received the active drug.\n\n— Joel Shannon, Karen Weintraub and Elizabeth Weise\n\nCalifornia curfew to begin; experts question whether it will help\n\nStarting Saturday night, California will join other states and nations in trying a partial overnight curfew as its latest desperate attempt to stem a surge in coronavirus cases, though experts said its effect may be more symbolic than real and many law enforcement agencies are refusing to enforce it.\n\nOfficials said what they are calling a limited stay-at-home order is aimed at discouraging late gatherings where people are more likely to let down their guard, their inhibitions — and their required masks — while drinking and socializing.\n\nDr. Mark Cullen, an infectious disease expert who recently retired from Stanford University, said the underlying goal is based on a reasonable interpretation of data blaming gatherings for surging infections. But the point will be lost on most, he fears, partially because California is allowing many exemptions for things like getting groceries, filling prescriptions, picking up takeout, and even walking dogs.\n\nOfficials in London who tried a similar approach found that “if anything, for the young people it may have increased their social gathering activities,” said Dr. Lee Riley, an infectious disease professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. “They can’t go out, so they congregate in somebody’s home or dormitories.”\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nVermont only state with fewer than 10K cases\n\nMaine has reported its 10,000th case of COVID-19, leaving Vermont as the sole state under that mark. Texas and California have both reported around 1.1 million cases, and Florida was on track to hit 1 million cases in one or two weeks.\n\nAs of Friday evening, 42 states reported more new cases in the past week than the week before, and 44 reported a higher rate of tests coming back positive, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\n12M Americans to lose jobless aid after Christmas if Congress fails to act\n\nMillions of jobless Americans could suddenly be cut off from their unemployment benefit the day after Christmas if Congress fails to extend relief programs, with many facing lasting scars as the worst pandemic in a century threatens to deepen their economic pain.\n\nAbout 12 million workers could lose one of two critical unemployment lifelines from the CARES Act on Dec. 26, including 7.3 million who could be cut off from Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and 4.6 million who may lose Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, according to estimates from The Century Foundation, a nonprofit think tank.\n\nThe loss in jobless aid would come as other stimulus relief is set to expire after December, including a federal ban on rental evictions that could put 30 to 40 million people at risk of eviction as moratoriums expire, according to the Aspen Institute, another think tank.\n\n– Jessica Menton\n\nKansas counties that opted out of face mask order saw COVID-19 cases rise\n\nWe already know that wearing face masks in public spaces slows the spread of COVID-19. And now the coronavirus situation in Kansas is providing further proof.\n\nGov. Laura Kelly issued a face mask mandate in early July, and the counties that upheld the order saw a decline in cases, while the counties that opted out saw cases rise, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday.\n\n\"Countywide mask mandates appear to have contributed to the mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in mandated counties,\" according to the report, which analyzed county-level data one month before, and after, the governor's mandate went into effect.\n\nAs of mid-August, 24 of Kansas’s 105 counties had abided by the state mandate or adopted their own mask mandate, and 81 counties had opted out, as Kansas law allows. At that time, the number of new daily cases per capita – calculated as a 7-day rolling average – had decreased an average of 6% among counties with a mask mandate and increased by 100% in counties without a mandate.

Restaurants and bars will only be allowed to offer takeout and delivery. Retail will only be open for curbside pickup or delivery except for big box stores.\n\nThe stricter measures come as Ontario reports 1,418 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, including 393 in Toronto and 400 in Peel Region. Ontario Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams says Ontario flattened the epidemic curve before and he's confident it can be done again.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia on Saturday reported a new daily high in infections and deaths. North Macedonia declared its first-ever nationwide state of emergency. Japan is scaling back on a government-backed campaign to encourage travel and dining out. And cases are surging in South Korea and New Delhi, India.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nFamily members returning home bring higher risk for Thanksgiving gatherings\n\nAt a time when Americans are pondering how to celebrate Thanksgiving safely amid the country's worst surge in coronavirus cases, many families will be faced with yet another complicating factor: the return of students.\n\nColleges and universities have reported 252,000-plus cases since the pandemic began, according to a New York Times tracker. Returning students – whether they lived in dorms or off-campus housing in the fall term – \"exponentially increase the risk (of infection),\" especially if they take some form of mass transportation to get home.\n\nThat's the assessment of Dr. Teresa Bartlett, senior medical officer for the claims management firm Sedgwick, who advises companies about medical strategies and safety practices. Like other specialists in the field, Bartlett is concerned that holiday gatherings, combined with pandemic fatigue and the need to move indoors as the weather gets colder, will exacerbate what’s already a major national spike in COVID-19 cases.

Cuomo, a Democrat whose daily briefings at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic received extensive airplay across the nation, will receive the International Emmy Founders Award.\n\nThe governor is being recognized in part for his use of television to inform people of the latest coronavirus updates at the height of the state's outbreak in March and April, according to The International Academy Of Television Arts & Sciences, which granted him the award.\n\nCuomo held more than 100 consecutive days of COVID-19 briefings, many of which were broadcast on cable news networks internationally. The governor will receive the International Emmy during a virtual award ceremony Monday. It's a separate ceremony from the better-known Primetime and Daytime Emmys, which focus on American television.\n\n– Jon Campbell, New York State Team\n\nCelebrating Thanksgiving amid a pandemic? We've done it before\n\nOn Thanksgiving more than a century ago, many Americans, like today, were living under various phases of quarantines and face mask orders. Millions were mourning loved ones. And health officials in many cities were issuing the same holiday warning: Stay home and stay safe.\n\n\"See that Thanksgiving celebrations are restricted as much as possible so as to prevent another flare-up,\" said a notice in the Omaha World Herald on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 28, 1918.\n\nBy late November of 1918, the U.S. – in the midst of the suffrage movement, Jim Crow and the end of WWI – was battling the ebbing second wave of the H1N1 influenza epidemic, also known as the Spanish flu.

Greg Abbott in the form of leeway to impose some restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19. Samaniego said in a letter to the governor's office that his previous order that was ended by an appellate court was done so erroneously and the order was not inconsistent with Abbott's statewide restrictions.\n\n– El Paso Times\n\nDonald Trump Jr. tests positive for COVID-19\n\nPresident Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week, according to his spokesman.\n\n\"Don tested positive at the start of the week and has been quarantining out at his cabin since the result. He’s been completely asymptomatic so far and is following all medically recommended COVID-19 guidelines,\" his office said in a statement.\n\nTrump Jr. is the latest person close to the president to test positive in recent days. Earlier on Friday, Rudy Giuliani's son, Andrew, announced he also tested positive a day after attending a press conference held by his father at the Republican National Committee headquarters.\n\nThe White House has struggled to contain at least three outbreaks of the virus in recent months. Trump was hospitalized after he tested positive, and several aides have since been infected.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPfizer takes candidate vaccine to FDA for emergency authorization\n\nPfizer said Friday it is filing for emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine, the next step in bringing its candidate vaccine to market. Health and other frontline workers could get the vaccine as soon as December but reaching everyone could take up to a year.\n\nThe move follows an announcement from Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech that its vaccine appears 95% effective against the coronavirus. Also this week, drug company Moderna released positive news, with its vaccine also showing a high rate of efficacy. Both candidates, each of which require two shots, protect more than 90% of those immunized, self-reported results indicate.\n\nThe FDA and an independent advisory board will review Pfizer's application before the vaccine is able to get into peoples' arms.\n\n\"If we do get people vaccinated to a high degree, then you can start talking about this umbrella or blanket of protection on society that would diminish dramatically the risk of a person being exposed or even being infected,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told USA TODAY earlier this week.\n\n– Cara Richardson\n\nFauci says Santa Claus won't be spreading COVID-19 this Christmas\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said Santa Claus is coming to town. And he's not bringing COVID-19.\n\nIt should come as no surprise. As children already know, Santa is superhuman. He flies around the world in one night, delivers millions of toys and eats his weight in cookies.\n\nBut with millions of Americans already sick with COVID-19, children have been worried about Santa, especially this Christmas Eve when he visits millions of homes. And there's no denying that Santa, because he is older and overweight, would at first glance appear to be at higher risk of developing severe disease from COVID-19.\n\nFauci is telling kids not to worry, though. \"Santa is not going to be spreading any infections to anybody,\" he said.\n\n— Adrianna Rodriguez and Grace Hauck\n\nCDC recommends against holiday travel\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending against travel for Thanksgiving. Dr. Henry Walke, the CDC’s COVID-19 incident manager, said the \"tragedy that could happen\" is that family members could end up severely ill, hospitalized or dying. The CDC’s warning is the latest and most high profile about the risks of traveling as coronavirus cases rise nationwide. Officials in California, Illinois and other states have urged residents to avoid nonessential travel even as airlines tout holiday fare deals.\n\n\"These times are tough, it’s been a long outbreak, almost 11 months, and we understand people are tired,\" Walke said. \"But this year we’re asking them to limit their travel.\"\n\n– Sara M.

Chuck Grassley is one of the oldest members of the Senate.\n\nWASHINGTON – As rampant nationwide coronavirus spikes force states to reexamine reopening efforts, Congress is still struggling to maneuver around the pandemic as it encroaches on legislative business and endangers its members.\n\nCOVID-19 has loomed over Congress for much of the year, yet lawmakers are still bickering over wearing face masks and not social distancing. And congressional leaders have refused to make coronavirus testing mandatory for lawmakers traveling back and forth to their home states.\n\nA rash of recent cases has infected a handful of lawmakers and sent several others into quarantine all while the U.S. Capitol welcomed back more than 500 legislators in the House and Senate this week. Sen. Chuck Grassley, one of the oldest members of the Senate, on Tuesday night became the latest senator to announce a positive test.\n\nThe batch of new infections on Capitol Hill and continued resistance to everyday changes to acknowledge the virus' deadly impacts have thrust the spotlight on Congress' efforts to curtail the pandemic both across the nation and inside its own walls .\n\nNew cases, same behavior\n\nIn less than a week, six lawmakers announced that they had tested positive for COVID-19. Grassley, the 87-year-old Iowa Republican who is third in line to the presidency as president pro tempore of the Senate, spent much of Monday on Capitol Hill. He cast votes, spoke on the Senate floor, and attended a meeting with Senate Republican leadership, which includes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Grassley announced his diagnosis the following day.\n\nSeveral other lawmakers announced they were quarantining after coming into contact with someone who had tested positive. It's unclear whether any senators would quarantine after Grassley's diagnosis.\n\nAlong with Grassley, lawmakers who have announced they tested positive over the past six days are Reps. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo.; Don Young, R-Alaska; Cheri Bustos, D-Ill.; Tim Walberg, R-Mich.; and incoming Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa.\n\nThe running list:Which members of Congress have tested positive for COVID-19?\n\n'I don't need your instruction':Sens. Sherrod Brown and Dan Sullivan argue over wearing masks\n\nMore:House Democrat's change new-member dinner to grab-and-go after facing criticism\n\nYoung, at 87 years old, is the oldest member of Congress and is frequently seen without a mask. He was particularly hard hit by the virus and was hospitalized for three days.\n\n“I’ve been shot, I’ve been rolled over, I’ve been hit in the head a hundred times, but I’ve never felt as bad as I did” with the virus, Young told The Washington Post. “This is not good.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida and Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., were forced to quarantine after possible exposure to the virus.\n\nThe absence of Grassley and Scott in the Senate did not go unnoticed Tuesday, as Republicans did not have the votes necessary to move forward a controversial nominee to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\nDespite the infections and exposures, lawmakers have struggled to make changes inside the Capitol.\n\nDemocratic and Republican leadership in the House were broadly excoriated on social media this weekend for planning indoor dinners for newly elected members of Congress, with many noting the dinners set a poor example for the rest of the country.\n\nBoth dinners, one Friday for Democrats and the other Sunday for Republicans, were changed to carryout in response.\n\nLawmakers have also continued to snipe over mask usage and are routinely seen ignoring social distancing guidelines.\n\nSenators have been seen regularly on the chamber floor exchanging words in close contact. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., was seen on Capitol Hill Tuesday without a mask, talking with staff in a hallway for several minutes.\n\nMasks have become divisive on Capitol Hill, like many places in the country, with some Republicans questioning their efficiency and railing against mandates, while Democrats stress the need for Americans across the country to wear them.\n\nWhile most lawmakers wear masks regularly, tensions boiled over on the Senate floor Monday after Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, asked Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, who was presiding over the Senate at the time, whether he would wear a mask.\n\n“I’d start by asking the presiding officer to please wear a mask as he speaks,” Brown said, donning his own mask as he made the request.\n\nAs Brown began explaining that he knows he can’t tell Sullivan what to do, the Republican cut him off, telling him that, “I don’t wear a mask when I’m speaking like most senators … I don’t need your instruction.”\n\nNew testing on Capitol Hill\n\nCongress overall does not have any blanket rules for masks or its operations during COVID-19 as each chamber largely manages itself.\n\nThe House has mandated masks be worn on the floor and in committee hearings, even threatening that members might not be recognized to speak if they are not wearing a face covering. The chamber, which boasts more than 400 members, passed unprecedented rule changes this year that allowed for members to vote through proxy while lengthening voting periods on the House floor to ensure lawmakers can socially distance.\n\nThe Senate has not enacted similar policies. McConnell, R-Ky., has argued members of the chamber have followed public health guidelines and mandates were not needed.\n\nLeaders in both chambers did agree on one thing: Widespread testing on Capitol Hill wasn't feasible.\n\nMcConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected an offer from the administration in May for rapid tests. They cited concerns about the logistics of testing the thousands of people who work at the Capitol daily and concerns that lawmakers would be given preferential treatment at a moment when many Americans could not get testing.\n\nMore:Reports: Capitol physician says he lacks enough tests for all returning senators\n\nMore:Speaker Pelosi mandates wearing masks on House floor after Rep.

I have no symptoms, and I will continue to isolate and follow CDC guidelines. I’m grateful to be both vaccinated and boosted,” Harris tweeted Tuesday afternoon.\n\nKirsten Allen, the vice president’s press secretary, said in an earlier statement that Harris tested positive for Covid-19 on rapid and PCR tests. Harris “will isolate and continue to work from the vice president’s residence,” Allen said.\n\n“She has not been a close contact to the President or First Lady due to their respective recent travel schedules. She will follow CDC guidelines and the advice of her physicians. The Vice President will return to the White House when she tests negative,” she added.\n\nHarris had been scheduled to receive her intelligence briefing at 10:15 am ET Tuesday at the White House alongside President Joe Biden, according to daily guidance sent to reporters Monday evening. She did not participate in any events or meetings at the White House on Tuesday, according to a White House official.\n\nHarris is taking the antiviral coronavirus treatment Paxlovid, Kirsten Allen, the vice president’s spokesperson, tweeted Tuesday, saying: “Today, after consultation with her physicians, the Vice President was prescribed and has taken Paxlovid,”\n\nEarlier Tuesday, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told reporters he wasn’t sure if Harris had been prescribed the antiviral, noting that he is not her physician.\n\nPaxlovid is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. It requires a doctor’s prescription.\n\nThe Associated Press was first to report on the vice president’s treatment.\n\nContact tracing is underway, a White House official said. Officials will notify the appropriate people, but as of Tuesday afternoon, the office had not identified close contacts among staff.\n\nA handful of staff members traveled with Harris to California last week, including deputy chief of staff Mike Fuchs and national security adviser Phil Gordon. It’s unclear whether all staff members listed stayed in California with Harris through the duration of her weeklong trip.\n\nBiden and Harris spoke over the phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the White House.\n\n“He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” a White House statement to reporters said.\n\nThe President last tested negative for Covid-19 on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.\n\nHarris’ isolation will have immediate impact on Senate Democrats. Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Ron Wyden of Oregon both also announced they had tested positive as well on Tuesday, meaning that their absences – along with Harris – will delay Democrats’ plans to confirm a pair of high-profile nominees this week, a senior Democratic aide told CNN.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hoped to confirm Lisa Cook to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board and Alvaro Bedoya to be the chair of the Federal Trade Commission. But because there is broad Republican opposition to them, votes to process those nominations will be put off until Democrats, who narrowly control the 50-50 chamber, are back to full strength.\n\nIn a sign of the partisan combativeness that is so prevalent in the Senate, Republicans will still force a procedural roll call vote on Cook’s nomination – which will fail – later Tuesday and force Democrats to go through the process of breaking a filibuster against her again. GOP senators could have given consent to waive the actual vote but didn’t. Republicans have not said yet if they would do the same with Bedoya’s nomination.\n\n“That is something that members and leaders will work through in Congress,” Psaki told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the dilemma. “We are confident we have the votes to get them confirmed. We’re eager to have them in place. But of course, we need all the people, all members there to do that.”\n\nThe Senate confirmed Lael Brainard to be the vice chair of the Fed Tuesday afternoon. Her nomination is not affected by the absences because she has bipartisan support.\n\nHarris arrived at the White House Tuesday morning, a White House official told CNN, and went straight to take a test. After testing positive on both PCR and rapid tests, she returned home to her residence at the Naval Observatory, where she will be isolating.\n\nSeparately, an official said Harris last saw Biden at the Easter Egg Roll on April 18. She left Washington for California that afternoon and didn’t return until Monday night.\n\nWhile in California last week, she held events on portfolio issues. In San Francisco on Thursday, Harris highlighted the Black maternal health crisis during events and was indoors talking to expecting mothers and health providers without a mask on. Masks are recommended, but no longer required, in most public indoor spaces in the city.\n\nHarris held no public events over the weekend before returning to the nation’s capital.\n\nOne official said Harris tested negative through her “regular” testing up until Tuesday. CNN has asked when the vice president last tested negative.\n\nHarris completed her two-dose regimen of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine in January 2021. She received her first booster dose in late October and a second booster vaccine on April 1.\n\nCovid makes its way through elite Washington\n\nThe vice president’s positive Covid-19 test comes as the US has largely lifted most of its Covid-19 mitigation measures after the Omicron variant spike over the winter.\n\nIn accordance with federal public health guidelines, officials and visitors have not been required to wear masks or socially distance at large White House events. Covid cases in Washington have declined since their peak in early January, when the country was facing a wave of Omicron variant cases, but have been rising recently.\n\nThough the White House has continued to hold crowded indoor events where masks are optional and officials have forgone masks in public, the administration has said they are going beyond federal guidelines to detect Covid-19 in the building. There’s mandatory testing for those who come into contact with Biden and social distancing during meetings, at least when it’s possible.\n\nPsaki said on Tuesday that she does not expect the White House to implement additional Covid-related protocols as a result of Harris’ positive test.\n\n“There’s a regular testing cadence. Obviously, the vice president was tested this morning because of that regular testing cadence. And for the rest of us – anyone who’s going to be around the President, to travel with him, to see him in the Oval Office – is tested that day,” she said, outlining existing White House protocols. “And even if you’re not going to see him, you’re on a regular testing cadence around here.”\n\nPsaki also said some White House staff have taken the additional steps of socially distancing where possible and masking of their own volition. And she confirmed that the President would still attend a number of high-profile events this week, including the White House Correspondents’ Dinner and the memorial for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\nOfficials have acknowledged that it’s “possible” Biden will eventually contract Covid-19, but have emphasized the precautions being taken to prevent infection.\n\n“The bottom line is he is vaccinated and boosted. He is very well protected. He’s got very good protocols around him to protect him from getting infected. But there is no 100% anything,” Jha said on Tuesday.\n\nCovid has also been making the rounds among White House staff and among the Washington elite recently.\n\nIn late March, White House press secretary Jen Psaki cancelled her plans to travel with the President to Belgium and Poland after testing positive for Covid-19 for the second time. Her replacement on the Europe trip, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, tested positive shortly after returning from the trip. Harris’ husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in March.\n\nFollowing the Gridiron Club Dinner, an annual event with members of the press and prominent Washington officials that was held in early April, dozens of attendees tested positive, including two Cabinet members and Harris’ communication director, Jamal Simmons. He was considered to be a close contact of the vice president. Harris was criticized in the wake of that close contact for her seeming disregard of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention masking guidance for those who were exposed to Covid-19, as she did not wear a mask during the Supreme Court confirmation vote for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright Maegan Vazquez Betsy Klein Kevin Liptak Ted Barrett", "Jasmine Wright", "Maegan Vazquez", "Betsy Klein", "Kevin Liptak", "Ted Barrett"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/politics/oath-keepers-juror-covid/index.html", "title": "Oath Keepers trial juror replaced after testing positive for Covid-19 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe trial of five Oath Keepers charged with seditious conspiracy resumed Tuesday morning after a juror who tested positive for Covid-19 was dismissed.\n\nThe juror, a White woman who works at an education nonprofit, tested positive Monday evening, District Judge Amit Mehta said.\n\n“Based on my consultation with medical professionals, the exposure to Covid last Friday.. is fairly minimal,” Mehta said, noting that the juror was asymptomatic.

Greg Abbott and the state of Texas must remove – at least temporarily – the buoys placed in the Rio Grande as part of the state's effort to control the border with Mexico, a federal judge ruled Wednesday, marking a win for the Biden administration.\n\nIn his 42-page order, Senior U.S. Judge David Alan Ezra said he made the ruling after deciding that the U.S. Justice Department will \"likely succeed on the merits\" in the lawsuit it filed against Abbott and the state in July.\n\n\"Texas’s floating barrier is an obstruction to the navigable capacity of the Rio Grande River and required authorization from Congress,\" Senior U.S. Judge David Alan Ezra says in his order.\n\nThe governor ordered the 1,000-foot string of large floating devices placed in the international river near Eagle Pass ostensibly to help discourage migrants from entering Texas without legal authorization and to combat cross-border drug trafficking.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Abbott said the state will appeal the ruling.\n\n\"Today's court decision merely prolongs President Biden’s willful refusal to acknowledge that Texas is rightfully stepping up to do the job that he should have been doing all along,\" the governor said on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"This ruling is incorrect and will be overturned on appeal.\"\n\nIn challenging Texas’ use of the buoys, the Justice Department accused the state of putting a barrier on the international boundary without permission. The Biden administration also said the water barrier raised humanitarian and environmental concerns.\n\n“We are pleased that the court ruled that the barrier was unlawful and irreparably harms diplomatic relations, public safety, navigation, and the operations of federal agency officials in and around the Rio Grande,” Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said in a statement.\n\nTexas governor installed buoys without federal approval\n\nAbbott has stated explicitly that he did not seek federal authorization before issuing his directive as part of his border-enforcement plan he calls Operation Lone Star.\n\nThe Justice Department's suit contends that the move violates Section 10 of the U.S. Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which says the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must sign off on any plans to place a wharf, pier, boom breakwater, bulkhead, jetty or other structures in navigable waters.\n\nDuring a hearing in August, lawyers for Abbott and the state argued that the buoy chain was not an obstruction and that the section of the Rio Grande was not navigable because it was too shallow and narrow.\n\nEzra determined otherwise.\n\nHis ruling cites the Code of Federal Regulations, which states \"navigable waters of the United States are those waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and/or are presently used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible for use to transport interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n\nTEXANS REPLY TO BUOY BARRIERS:Texas Gov. Abbott installing buoy barrier along Rio Grande; opponents decry 'dangerous stunt'\n\nBuoys part of governor’s Operation Lone Star\n\nLast month, Abbott held a news conference with fellow Republican governors where he defended the buoys, claiming that the main reason for the barrier was that Biden was \"not doing his job\" and had abandoned the border.\n\nAbbott said 15 governors had deployed military personnel to assist with Operation Lone Star. Among them are South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Iowa.\n\nThe buoy barrier is one part of Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, a border control program launched in March 2021. The total estimated cost for the operation is about $4 billion, and the price for the first segment of the buoy barrier at Eagle Pass was expected to cost $1 million, USA TODAY reported.\n\nIn addition to the string of buoys, Texas has installed miles of razor wire along the banks of the Rio Grande to deter unauthorized crossings. Migrants, including children, have been trapped and slashed by the wire.\n\nTexas has also deployed shipping containers along the river at Eagle Pass and El Paso, which the governor described as a steel wall along the southern border.\n\nArizona to pay $2.1 million over DOJ shipping container wall lawsuit\n\nTexas is not the only state to install makeshift walls along its border. Last year, former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey stacked thousands of shipping containers to build a border wall.\n\nIn December 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Arizona, Ducey, and other state officials over the wall, saying that the land where the containers were placed could only be used by Arizona if the state received federal authorization, which they had not.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleged that \"the hundreds of double-stacked multi-ton shipping containers\" damaged federal lands, threatened public safety, and hindered the abilities of federal agencies to do their jobs. Under pressure from the lawsuit, Ducey agreed to dismantle the wall in late December.\n\nArizona has agreed to pay the U.S. Forest Service for additional remediation efforts, according to a joint status report filed by the federal government, Arizona, and the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nThe agency sent a bill for about $2.1 million to Arizona on Aug. 22, according to the state’s Division of Emergency Management. Once Arizona has paid the outstanding bill, the federal government and state expect the cases to be dismissed, the joint status report said.\n\nNext steps in Texas legal battle\n\nThe ruling Wednesday comes ahead of a trial on the lawsuit, which has not yet been scheduled. It prohibits the state \"from building new or placing additional buoys, blockades, or structures of any kind in the Rio Grande River pending final judgment in this matter,\" the judge said in his order.\n\nEzra gave Texas until Sept. 15 to \"reposition\" the buoys at its own expense and to work with the Corps of Engineers on the project.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/09/07/heat-weather-climate-change/70783249007/", "title": "Daily Briefing:", "text": "The Earth just sweltered through its hottest June-August on record.

And as federal and state officials clash over Texas' latest border security initiative, the migrants who reach the United States display its toll, in bruises and broken ankles and glinting rows of surgical staples that hold closed their slice wounds. An internal e-mail from a Texas state trooper, revealed last week, raised the alarm that the state's efforts had become \"inhumane.\" On Friday, USA TODAY observed how that razor wire has slashed not just adults but young children.\n\nTortua, 27, from Venezuela, had waded into the Rio Grande early Wednesday at Piedras Negras, Mexico. With him were his wife, Yamilet Castillo, 31, and their sons, Jesús and Elias. The boys are twins, the kind of kids who giggle together at each new sight, wide-eyed and curious about the world.\n\nThe family had already been trekking for weeks. Turning back now was not an option.\n\nThey shuffled, waist-deep, along the river’s edge, maneuvering around coils of lacerating wire in the water and stepping carefully over more that stuck out along the banks.\n\nFrom the Texas bank of the river, men in vehicles trailed them slowly. Whether the agents were state troopers, National Guard, or Border Patrol, the family didn't know. They were simply policías, and they were calling out instructions: Tortua and his family would have to keep going, downriver to a staging area – or return to Mexico.\n\nAs he climbed around one rock in the river, Jesús slipped and stumbled onto a wire coil that jutted out. It slashed into his left calf, leaving a two-inch gash. Blood spilled into the water. Jesús let out a shrieking cry.\n\nThe authorities called out, from the other side of the wire, saying they could help. Tortua reached over the coils and handed his son to them.\n\nThe authorities wrapped the boy’s cut. But they made the rest of the family continue farther downstream before allowing them up on the banks, Tortua said.\n\nSomewhere along the way, a medic treated the boy’s leg. His family was turned over to U.S. Border Patrol, where they were processed and released until their court date.\n\n“It was horrible,” Tortua said Friday from inside the Mission: Border Hope migrant shelter just outside Eagle Pass. He pulled up Jesús’ pant leg to show the four medical staples it took to seal the gash.\n\n“I don’t understand: If they were just going to arrest us and let us go, why do they have to put all that up?” he said. “It doesn’t seem right.”\n\n“All that” is the miles of razor wire Texas has erected on the banks of the Rio Grande to deter unauthorized crossings.\n\nAttention to them has amplified last week along with controversy over Texas’ other attempt at a border barrier: a 1,000-foot string of floating orange buoys the state deployed at midstream. Purchased from a government security contractor, the “floating wall” is designed to trap swimmers, in a river that often runs knee-deep and warm in the summer sun, but where the tranquil surface hides dark pockets of head-high water.\n\nIn the past week, migrants, including many children, have arrived at the Eagle Pass shelter with an array of injuries: lacerations, welts and open wounds. Pregnant women have high blood pressure from stress, said Valeria Wheeler, the shelter’s executive director, and migrants have gashes in their heads and faces. The shelter has also been accepting an unusually high number of migrants recently released from hospitals, she said.\n\n“This is the worst I’ve ever seen it,” Wheeler said. “They’re putting lives at risk.”\n\nRevelations of those injuries have drawn widespread condemnation from immigrant advocates, Democratic leaders and other agencies. By the end of the week, the Justice Department warned Texas that it planned to file suit over the floating barrier.\n\n“The State of Texas’s actions violate federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, present serious risks to public safety and the environment, and may interfere with the federal government’s ability to carry out its official duties,” the department wrote in a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott, which was obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe letter gives Texas until Monday to commit to removing the barrier and warns that, if there is no response, the administration will proceed with a lawsuit.\n\nThe coils of wire also restrict U.S. Border Patrol agents from accessing the river and helping migrants in distress.\n\n“We can enforce the law and, at the same time, ensure that we prioritize the wellbeing of those we encounter,” a Border Patrol spokesperson said in a statement. “We are very concerned by reports of actions that not only make it harder for Border Patrol agents to enforce our nation’s immigration laws, but also put lives in danger.”\n\nAbbott’s border actions brought condemnation from the White House.\n\n\"The governor’s actions are cruel and putting both migrants and border agents in danger,\" White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan told USA TODAY Friday. \"The Department of Justice made clear that it is prepared to take the governor to court if he doesn’t immediately remove the unlawful structures in the Rio Grande.\"\n\nA floating border wall in Texas, and a whistleblower's warning\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety and Texas state guard have been uncoiling miles of concertina wire along the banks of the Rio Grande since 2021 as part of Operation Lone Star, Abbott’s multibillion-dollar initiative to use state resources to curtail unauthorized border crossings. More than 90 miles of the sharp-edged wire has been unfurled throughout South Texas, according to DPS.\n\nThe dangers of the razor wire entered the spotlight, though, when a recent email by a Texas DPS trooper to his superiors was made public. The July 3 email by trooper and paramedic Nicholas Wingate, first reported by the Houston Chronicle, describes how he and fellow troopers came across large groups of men, women and children along the banks of the Rio Grande and were ordered by commanders to push people \"back into the water” toward Mexico.\n\nThe email, which DPS provided to USA TODAY, also described encountering a male migrant with a “significant laceration” on his left leg while extricating his child from the razor wire and a 19-year-old pregnant woman having a miscarriage while stuck in the wiring. He also alleged troopers were directed not to give water or medical attention to migrants.\n\n“I believe we have stepped over a line into the in humane,” Wingate wrote.\n\nTwo weeks later, on July 15, DPS director Steve McCraw dispatched an email to regional directors with the subject line “Incidents Involving Concertina Wire – DPS,” in which he reminded DPS leaders that crossing through “the concertina wire without protective gear is no doubt likely to result in an injury. This is self evident, but we need to ensure that migrants are reminded of this by signage and continued verbal warnings …”\n\nInternal memos show DPS was circulating photos of border crossers wounded by the wire. One shows a migrant with a long gash along the torso that had been medically stapled shut. Others show a bloodied finger and leg injuries. A memo lists seven incidents, between July 4 and July 13, where migrants had been caught in the concertina wire, including a mother and child who had been transported to the hospital with cuts and another migrant who was transported to San Antonio for “treatment with several lacerations that required staples.”\n\nMcCraw’s directive says agents would continue to save lives, and notes that a soldier died during a water rescue – an apparent reference to an incident last year.\n\nBut the directive also echoes the orders Tortua heard as his children approached the razor wire.\n\n“We will be able to prevent migrants from risking their lives by denying them access between the Ports of Entry,” McCraw wrote, “and encourage them to use one of the 29 Texas international bridges where they can safely cross.”\n\nDPS’ Office of Inspector General is investigating the allegations made in Wingate’s email, agency spokesman Travis Considine said. “If our personnel are doing anything that violates policy, they will be held accountable,” he said in an email. “There are no orders from the top that prohibit Troopers from giving water to women and children or attending to migrants who need medical attention.”\n\nIn a joint statement from Abbott’s office, McCraw, Texas Border Czar Mike Banks and the Texas National Guard, state officials said they were taking steps to monitor the safety of migrants and provide medical attention to those in distress. They blamed President Joe Biden’s border policies for the need to ramp up enforcement.\n\n“With migrants from over 150 countries encouraged by open border policies to risk their lives and make this dangerous trek to enter our country illegally, Texas is deploying every tool and strategy to deter and repel illegal crossings between ports of entry,” it said. “The absence of these tools and strategies – including concertina wire that snags clothing – encourages migrants to make potentially life-threatening and illegal crossings.”\n\nBut Texas may be overstepping its authority by deploying the buoys, experts said. Placing the buoys without consulting the U.S. section of the International Boundary and Water Commission violates the 1944 water treaty and 1970 treaty between the U.S. and Mexico, said Stephen Mumme, a Colorado State University political scientist and author of “Border Water: The Politics of U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Water Management, 1945-2015.”\n\nLast week, high-ranking Mexican officials filed a complaint over the buoys. Considine, the DPS spokesman, would not comment on Mexico’s complaints. Neither would the U.S. State Department.\n\nMexico did not previously complain when border walls and fences went up on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande without consulting the commission, also a potential violation of the treaties, Mumme said. The fact that they are now raising complaints points to how serious Mexican officials consider the matter, he said.\n\n“The state of Texas has no authority whatsoever to be doing what it’s doing,” Mumme said.\n\nA border grove fenced like a prison\n\nJust behind Heavenly Farms, a 300-acre pecan grove on the banks of the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass, coils of concertina wire are stacked one atop of the other, stretching for miles in either direction.\n\nSweaters, swim trunks and strands of T-shirts hang from the wires’ pointed barbs, signs of where migrants were snagged by the wire. Humvees and trucks ferrying National Guard troops from Ohio and Missouri, U.S. Border Patrol trucks and DPS cruisers steadily rumble over dirt roads, kicking up clouds of dust.\n\nMigrants are often caught in wire nearly submerged near two islands in the river, or when they climb over the coils to reach U.S. soil, said Magali Urbina, the farm’s owner. Urbina called the concertina wire “sickening” and she and her husband, Hugo Urbina, have repeatedly asked Texas authorities to remove the wire from their property. They’ve refused, she said.\n\n“It’s horrible,” Magali Urbina said. “I can’t imagine how many people have gotten caught in it.”\n\nThe Urbinas bought the land in 2021 as an idyllic retirement location, where they could gaze out at the churning waters of the Rio Grande and occasionally go fishing. Instead, it now more closely resembles a prison camp. Though streams of asylum-seekers stalked through her property last year, those numbers were already dwindling earlier this year before Texas put up the wire, she said.\n\nMagali Urbina questioned if the wire will truly deter migrants.\n\n“If they came from Venezuela, through the Darién Gap\" – a roadless crossing at the border of Colombia and Panama – \"this is not going to stop them,” she said, looking out at coils of stacked concertina wire at the edge of her property.\n\nDPS officials said troopers should not be jeopardizing the well-being of migrants and have shared pictures on social media of troopers assisting migrants. But asylum-seekers at the Mission: Border Hope shelter, some with small children, described scenes of crossing the river only to be told by authorities on the U.S. side to return across the Rio Grande to Mexico or trek for miles downriver.\n\nReyna Gloria Domínguez, 42, from Honduras, crossed the river two weeks ago with her husband, Edemecio, and four children, ages 5 to 22. She was nursing a broken ankle she said she had suffered in Monterrey fleeing gunmen on her trip to the border. As the family arrived on the U.S. side and faced coils of razor wire, authorities told her they would take her since she was injured but her family had to return to Mexico, she said.\n\nDomínguez said she stood on the banks, dripping wet, and cried as she watched her family recross the Rio Grande and return to Mexico.\n\n“I said, ‘God, please, where are you?’” she said through tears at the shelter on Friday, as she hugged a battered Bible. “I didn’t know if my children made it back to Mexico or were here or even alive.”\n\nShe added: “I never imagined that the United States would be so painful, so heartless.”\n\nDiego Molina, 34, fled Honduras with his family earlier this year to flee criminal gangs who he said had shut down his business and extorted money from him. He needed to reach the U.S., he said, to save money and get a heart-valve operation done for his son, Diego, 10, to fix a heart condition.\n\nAs he crossed the Rio Grande earlier last week with Diego, his wife, Heidy Orellano, 33, and their 1-year-old daughter, Camila, he was met with rows of concertina wire. They crossed with a pregnant woman and her husband and a mother with two small children. As they puzzled how to get past the wire, U.S. authorities yelled at them to go further downriver and blared a siren at them, he said.\n\nWith water at times coming up to his neck, Molina led his family downriver.

Reyes\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThe Department of Justice is planning legal action against Texas in response to horrific reports from the southern border. A 4-year-old girl passed out in 100-degree heat after she was pushed back toward Mexico by Texas National Guard personnel. A pregnant woman became trapped in razor wire and had a miscarriage. A state trooper said he was under orders not to give migrants any water. These incidents stem from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s “Operation Lone Star.”\n\nAbbott has had barriers of buoys and razor wire placed in the Rio Grande to deter migrants from crossing. But governors cannot act unilaterally on immigration because the federal government has authority over our borders. The Supreme Court affirmed in 2012 that immigration is a federal matter, noting that states “may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.”\n\nLast year, the federal government sued Arizona after it erected empty shipping containers as a border barrier; the state later agreed to remove them.\n\nBy using buoys, wire and state personnel to turn away migrants, Abbott is potentially violating U.S. law. Our immigration system allows anyone who is fleeing persecution in their home country to make an asylum claim here. This is a legal and human right. In fact, asylum requires physical presence inside the United States or at a port of entry. We're likewise a signatory to international agreements that recognize similar rights for refugees.\n\nAbbott's border policies are endangering lives\n\nAbbott presents himself as a “pro-life” conservative, yet he is overseeing radical policies that can result in serious injuries and drowning deaths.\n\nHaving state officers push migrant children back into the water, as the Houston Chronicle has reported, is beyond cruel. It is a betrayal of our values as a country that welcomes immigrants.\n\nI belong here:What it's like to grow up undocumented and without DACA in Arizona\n\nAbbott’s programs are especially heartless as they harm many migrants who have already made a long, often harrowing trek to seek safety in the United States. Consider that in fiscal year 2022, a record number of migrants died trying to cross the border.\n\nIn response to outrage over Abbott’s border tactics, his press secretary said, “Texas is deploying every tool and strategy to deter and repel illegal crossings between ports of entry as President Biden’s dangerous open border policies entice migrants from over 150 countries to risk their lives entering the country illegally.” The spokesperson added that Joe Biden has unleashed “chaos” at the border.\n\nThe facts say otherwise: The southern border is not open.\n\nThis year, the Biden administration rolled out new restrictions on asylum and embraced tougher border measures. Instead of chaos, this has led to a decrease in unauthorized migration.\n\nAccording to Customs and Border Protection, the number of illegal crossings recently fell to the lowest level in more than two years.\n\nWhy are kids dying in CBP custody?An 8-year-old died in Customs and Border Protection custody. CBP must stop failing kids.\n\nStates can't implement their own immigration policies\n\nMigration is a serious issue for any governor of a border state. But that doesn’t mean Abbott can make his own border policy or circumvent asylum law.\n\nThe governor’s tactics are also harmful because they have led to tensions between federal and state law enforcement officials along the border, hindering their work. Border Patrol agents say the razor wire makes it harder for them to apprehend migrants.\n\nAs a group of Democratic lawmakers outlined in a letter to the president, Abbott’s policies are “clearly hurting the efforts of CBP to enforce U.S. immigration laws.”\n\nIf Abbott were interested in effective immigration solutions, he would support more cooperation with the federal government instead of pursuing a go-it-alone approach. Then again, this is the governor who has sent migrants around the country as a political stunt and who has continued to use “invasion” language even after the 2019 El Paso massacre, in which authorities say the gunman confessed that he had been targeting Mexicans.\n\nThe Department of Justice must hold Abbott accountable for his abuse of power at the border. If unchecked, his actions could embolden other states to pursue similar extreme measures.\n\nAbbott’s border policies are a national disgrace. Vulnerable migrants deserve compassion – and their human rights as prescribed by law.\n\nRaul A. Reyes is an attorney, journalist and television commentator in New York City.

Greg Abbott over the buoy barrier installed in the Rio Grande, the federal judge presiding over the case made clear that any political considerations will get short shrift in his courtroom.\n\n\"This is a United States district court. It's not Congress. It's not the president,\" Senior U.S. Judge David Alan Ezra told the lawyers for both sides Tuesday during the first hearing in advance of a coming trial. \"I am not here to engage in any type ... of political comment in this decision.\"\n\nThe decision before the 35-year veteran of the federal bench is whether the string of buoys floating as a border barrier in the international river near Eagle Pass should be removed pending the outcome of the case.\n\nTestimony from three expert witnesses rested on whether Abbott needed approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before placing the 1,000 feet of giant orange balls that are tethered to 68 concrete blocks weighing 3,000 pounds apiece.\n\nAbbott and lawyers for the state of Texas have insisted the governor acted under his legal authority to protect the state from an \"invasion\" caused by unlawful immigration and drug trafficking.\n\nBut the Justice Department, both in court documents and during witness questioning Tuesday, said that, under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Corps of Engineers must sign off on structures placed in any navigable U.S. waters.\n\nPatrick K. Sweeten, Abbott's general counsel, parried with Joseph Shelnutt of the Corps of Engineers over whether the section of the Rio Grande that flows between Eagle Pass and Piedras Negras, Coahuila, is actually navigable.\n\nSweeten showed a copy of a 1975 study describing the section as shallow and narrow and that no plans were in place to make it more hospitable to commercial boat traffic.\n\nShelnutt, a Corps of Engineers compliance and enforcement manager, insisted that the section still falls under the Corps' definition of a navigable waterway.\n\nState Department witness: Buoys hampering U.S. relations with Mexico\n\nA second witness for the Justice Department, Hillary Quam, who works as the U.S. State Department's coordinator with Mexico on border matters, said the buoys are hampering relations with the two countries.\n\nMexico's displeasure threatens to stall negotiations to update the two countries' water-sharing agreement and is complicating other matters in U.S. interests, Quam said. When Sweeten tried to steer the testimony toward the harm that unlawful immigration and drug trafficking were inflicting on binational relations, Ezra cut him off several times.\n\nAt one point, Sweeten asked Quam about Abbott's decision to help curtail illegal immigration and Ezra stepped in before the State Department official could answer.\n\n\"You are asking her to put herself in Gov. Abbott's mind,\" the judge said. \"I don't think she can do that.\"\n\nInternational agency says most buoys placed on Mexico’s side of river\n\nThe state's legal team also pushed back against the assertion by the International Boundary and Water Commission — a group established in 1899 and made up of representatives of both countries to oversee water agreements and other matters — that about 80% of the buoys had been placed on Mexico's side of the river.\n\nLoren Flossman, a retired Border Patrol agent and a former director of the Border Patrol & Air and Marine Program Management Office who now works for the private company that manufactured the buoys, testified that the commission used dated maps to make its determination.\n\nFlossman also contradicted Abbott's suggestion on Monday that the buoys had \"drifted\" toward Mexico after they had been installed. He said the concrete blocks directly below the buoys, plus dozens more designed keep the string from swaying, make the chain immovable.\n\nThat testimony came after Ezra expressed concern about the devices' location after he noticed that Abbott had said work crews with heavy equipment had gone back into the river to pull the floating barrier back toward the U.S. shoreline.\n\n\"I am concerned if something is moving around in the river,\" Ezra said.\n\nJudge to determine whether buoys must be removed until legal battle ends\n\nThe judge gave the lawyers until Friday afternoon to submit final arguments in writing on whether the buoys must be pulled from the river until the lawsuit is settled. Ezra said he'd act as quickly as possible to make his ruling, which then would pave the way for the lawsuit to move forward.\n\nTo emphasize his judicial neutrality, the judge noted that although he was appointed to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1988, a Democratic Senate confirmed him without controversy.\n\n\"There will be no leaning one way or the other in this court,\" Ezra said. \"Somebody is going to be happy; somebody is going to be unhappy with my decision. That's a fact of life.\"\n\nHistory of Abbott's buoy barrier\n\nThe buoys are part of Operation Lone Star, Abbott's controversial border protection program that started in March 2021. They are connected to form a barricade about 1,000 feet long and are fastened to the bottom of the river with nets underneath so people cannot swim under them. The 4-foot-wide orange buoys rotate to prevent people from climbing over.\n\nThe legal dispute includes accusations of Texas attempting to usurp federal control of national borders. Critics also say the buoys will make dangerous river crossings even more unsafe.\n\nThe buoys are installed in high-traffic areas where people are likely to attempt to cross the river.\n\nThe Texas governor is also coming under fire for erecting miles of razor wire on the banks of the Rio Grande to deter unauthorized crossings. Last month, USA TODAY documented how migrants, including many children, were ensnared and slashed by the wire, left with gashes in their heads and faces, lacerations, welts, and open wounds.\n\nThe sharp-edged barrier also restricts U.S. Border Patrol agents from accessing the river and helping migrants in distress.\n\n“The State of Texas’s actions violate federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, present serious risks to public safety and the environment, and may interfere with the federal government’s ability to carry out its official duties,” the department previously wrote in a letter to the Texas governor, which was obtained by USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/03/bodies-in-rio-grande-near-buoy-barriers/70519719007/", "title": "2 bodies recovered from Rio Grande, 1 along floating border barrier", "text": "Officials in Mexico are investigating after two bodies were found in the Rio Grande along the U.S-Mexican border − one of them spotted this week along a floating border barrier installed by Texas authorities.\n\nOfficers with the Texas Department of Public Safety notified the Mexican consulate about a dead person caught in the southern part of the buoys in the Rio Grande spotted on Wednesday afternoon, according to the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe incident marked the first time a body had been found along the floating barrier recently installed at the direction of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nMembers of the Mexican National Institute of Migration's assistance unit, Grupos Beta, led efforts to recover the body, the agency reported.

Department leaders also said the barrier violates treaties regarding the use of the river and Mexico's sovereignty.\n\n\"We reiterate the position of the Government of Mexico that the placement of chained buoys by Texas authorities is a violation of our sovereignty,\" the Mexican government said in a press release Wednesday. \"We express our concern about the impact on the human rights and personal safety of migrants of these state policies, which run counter to the close collaboration between our country and the United States.\"\n\nThe Mexican agency said the death investigations remain under investigation and \"will maintain contact with the corresponding authorities in Mexico and the United States\" in an effort to gather information about what happened.\n\nLive:Updates of Donald Trump indictment: Ex-president due in court for third arraignment\n\nFeds sue Texas over floating barrier\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department is suing Texas over the barrier after Abbott refused to remove the barrier the Biden administration says was unlawfully put into place.\n\nLate last month, the White House called Abbott's actions \"dangerous\" and \"unlawful\" after the governor defied the Justice Department's request and told the president he would see the Biden administration in court.\n\nOn July 20, the Justice Department sent the governor a letter ordering him to remove the barrier.

Doug Ducey says he got tired of waiting for federal authorities to fill in the holes.\n\nCrews at his direction started stacking shipping containers along portions of the border in August. Now the Bureau of Reclamation is asking the state to remove them – a request that Ducey’s office calls “unacceptable.”\n\nMeanwhile, Arizona is starting to place shipping containers along another section of the border.\n\nHere’s what we know about what’s happening, and a look at the bigger picture.\n\nStacked shipping containers are filling four border gaps so far\n\nDucey, a Republican, issued an executive order in August telling the state’s Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to use shipping containers to fill in gaps along the border. The first project: closing a 1,000-foot gap near Yuma, Arizona.\n\n“Arizona has had enough,” he said at the time. “We can’t wait any longer.”\n\nThe 8,800-pound, 9-by-40-feet containers stand about 22 feet tall when stacked, welded together and topped with four feet of razor wire, the governor’s office said, while border fencing built during the Trump administration is about 30 feet high.\n\nShortly after the project began, two shipping containers toppled. A Univision reporter who shared photos of the fallen containers said contractors in the area had told her strong winds were to blame. Ducey’s office said they suspected foul play. Since then, no similar incidents have been reported, spokesman CJ Karamargin said.\n\nBy late August, 11 days after the first shipping container project began, officials announced that 130 stacked shipping containers were filling four gaps and covering more than two-thirds of a mile along the border in Arizona’s Yuma County.\n\nThat effort, Karamargin said, cost $13 million.\n\nThis aerial photograph taken from a CBP helicopter on September 28 shows the US-Mexico border fence stopping at a mountainside near Welton, Arizona. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nA federal agency says their placement is illegal and calls it trespassing\n\nConstructing a bigger border wall was one of former President Trump’s signature priorities, and among the initiatives most criticized by his opponents. President Biden swiftly halted border wall construction once he took office.\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security has said it plans to close small gaps in the wall. And in July, the Biden administration announced a plan to fill some gaps in the border wall near Yuma.\n\nThis photo from May shows a gap along the border wall in Yuma, Arizona. This gap is one of four the state's governor filled with shipping containers in August. US Customs and Border Protection has said it plans to fill the gaps with its own project starting next year. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation cited those plans in a letter sent to Arizona officials earlier this month. The letter, obtained by CNN affiliate KYMA, asks the state to remove most of the shipping containers to make way for US Customs and Border Protection’s plans to fill in the gaps.\n\nThe letter says 80 containers were placed on Bureau of Reclamation land near the Morelos Dam and 42 were placed on Bureau of Reclamation rights of way on the Cocopah Indian Tribe’s West Reservation.\n\n“The unauthorized placement of those containers constitutes a violation of federal law and is a trespass against the United States,” said the letter from Jacklynn L. Gould, a Bureau of Reclamation regional director.\n\nGould asked Arizona officials to remove the containers and “work with Reclamation, in consultation with the Cocopah Indian Tribe, so that CBP’s project may proceed without unnecessary delay.”\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on the letter.\n\nDucey’s office says the shipping containers will stay – for now\n\nSo far Arizona isn’t backing down from the effort.\n\nThe state’s director of emergency management sent a stern response to the Bureau of Reclamation, disputing allegations that Arizona had trespassed on federal land and stating that the shipping containers would remain in place “until specific details regarding construction are provided.”\n\n“Since December 2021, numerous federal representatives have claimed that construction on the border would begin,” Allen Clark wrote. “However, to date, Arizona has not seen any action by the federal government to do so and was therefore required to take its own action.”\n\nKaramargin told CNN that state officials recently received a letter from CBP describing plans to use mesh fencing to fill the gaps, something he described as “completely unacceptable.”\n\n“From Gov. Ducey’s perspective, the idea that we would take down a temporary measure so that they can replace it with a less effective temporary measure in a nonstarter,” Karamargin said.\n\nMigrants are detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents on May 22 in Yuma, Arizona. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nA description of the project on CBP’s website states that construction will begin in early 2023, with plans to fill gaps “using a combination of barrier and mechanized bollard vehicle gates that allow for access to the riverside of the barrier.”\n\nThe fact that CBP construction isn’t slated to start until next year and the timing of the Bureau of Reclamation’s letter, he says, reveal how seriously federal officials are taking the situation at the border.\n\n“We managed to fill 3,800 feet of gap in Yuma in 11 days. … It took these guys six weeks to write a letter,” he said. “They don’t seem to have a sense of urgency about this.”\n\nUltimately, he said, Arizona wants a permanent solution to fill the gaps – an extension of the 30-foot-tall steel border barriers. And until that happens, he said, the state will continue its efforts.\n\nDucey announced the next phase of the shipping container project began this week, this time in Arizona’s Cochise County, with plans to use 2,770 containers to fill a 10.25-mile wall gap.\n\nThe cost of the project is about $95 million, Karamargin said, coming from a state border security fund.\n\nGOP governors have criticized Biden’s border policies and announced their own measures\n\nDucey has been Arizona’s governor since 2015.\n\nHe’s part of a vocal chorus of GOP governors – along with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – sharply criticizing the Biden administration’s border strategy.\n\nWith midterm elections looming, the criticism has intensified, along with these governors’ highly publicized efforts to take matters into their own hands – such as state-funded buses and flights transporting migrants north to other locations in the US. The White House has called these efforts political stunts.\n\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey, shown here in 2020, is among a group of GOP governors who've criticized the Biden administration's border policies and announced their own efforts to curb illegal immigration. Ross D. Franklin/Pool/AP\n\nAnd Arizona’s top federal prosecutor has mocked the state’s makeshift border wall.\n\n“We’re not dumping a bunch of shipping containers in the desert and calling it a wall to get cheap press,” US Attorney Gary Restaino wrote in an August tweet after a meeting between federal prosecutors and their Mexican counterparts. “It’s about developing comprehensive, data-driven strategies.”\n\nKaramargin says there was a clear reason for the governor to begin the shipping container initiative this year: a marked increase in migrants crossing the border.\n\n“None of this would be happening if the federal government took border security seriously. And clearly they are not,” Karamargin said.\n\nDoubling down on his effort, Ducey filed a lawsuit over control of land along the border this month, asking a federal judge to effectively block federal agencies’ efforts to regulate the shipping container project. Ducey argues a 60-foot-wide swath of land known as the Roosevelt Reservation should be under state control.\n\nThis aerial photo taken September 27 shows shipping containers filling a gap in the US-Mexico border wall in Yuma, Arizona. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nThe governor’s office cites numerous local officials praising the shipping container effort, and points to a Border Patrol official’s recent comment that having more gaps in the wall that migrants can cross through makes things more difficult for agents.\n\nAccording to CBP data, the agency’s Yuma sector has seen the largest increase in migrant encounters over the past year – more than 170%.\n\nIn the month after the shipping containers were placed, the number of migrant encounters in the sector increased around 5%, from 24,226 in August to 25,495 in September.\n\nThis isn’t the first time border wall efforts have faced federal opposition\n\nEfforts to erect border barriers have run afoul of federal authorities before.\n\nIn 2019 another federal body, the International Boundary and Water Commission, forced open a gate in a privately funded wall near the US-Mexico border, saying the group that built it didn’t follow proper permitting procedures.\n\nUltimately the commission filed a lawsuit, but construction was allowed to proceed.\n\nIn recent years we’ve seen numerous conflicts over border barrier construction, from lawsuits to political sparring.\n\nAnd as large numbers of migrants keep crossing, and debates rage over how to handle the situation, we’re likely to keep seeing them erupt.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

President Biden's Department of Justice is suing Texas over a floating border barrier, Israel's parliament passes a law limiting its Supreme Court's power, sparking mass protests, and we go inside Donald Trump's bid to have fake electors overturn the 2020 election.\n\n♦\n\nThe Department of Justice filed suit on Monday against the state of Texas after its governor refused to remove a floating border barrier that the Biden administration says was unlawfully put into place. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre spoke to the issue during yesterday's daily briefing.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre\n\nWhen we moved forward with a plan - a plan of deterrence, diplomacy, and also enforcement with how we were going to move forward after Title 42 was lifted - we actually saw the numbers go down. We actually saw the president's plan working. And what you see the governor doing is dangerous and unlawful and it's actually hurting the process.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThe Department of Justice claims that the presence of the floating barrier has prompted diplomatic protests by Mexico and risks damaging US foreign policy. Republican Governor Greg Abbott defied the DOJ's request and told the president he would see the Biden administration in court. The White House says that Abbott's actions are making it difficult for federal officials to patrol the area and access the Rio Grande River, where four migrants have drowned.\n\n♦\n\nIsrael's parliament approved divisive legislation yesterday that remakes part of the country's justice system. The law weakens Supreme Court oversight of the government, a move that critics claim will erode Israel's democracy and threatens the secular character of its state institutions. It was approved despite months of protests, the biggest in Israel's history, that have engulfed the nation's military, business, and legal communities. Opposition lawmakers who boycotted the vote shouted \"shame\" as the bill was approved. The judicial overhaul has divided Israel, rattling the cohesion of its powerful military and repeatedly drawing concern from its closest ally, the United States. It is being driven by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition, which is made up of ultra nationalist and ultra religious parties. They argue the reforms are necessary so that their rights and interests are protected. Protestors have blocked a road leading to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, yesterday. Police used water cannons to push them back. Businesses across the country shuttered their doors in protest of the vote. The vote passed despite a warning from Israel's President Isaac Herzog, Monday, that Israel was in a \"state of national emergency.\"\n\n♦\n\nDonald Trump's campaign recruited fake electors to overturn the 2020 election in an effort one GOP chairwoman called insane and inappropriate. For more on the fake electors story, we're joined by USA TODAY'S Justice Department Correspondent Bart Jansen. Thanks for coming on the show, Bart.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSo you've been looking into the fake electors story. First, can you give us a snapshot of where we are with criminal cases across the country? Where did this happen and where have there been charges brought?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, the fake elector's plan was hatched in the days after the 2020 election. It covered generally about seven states, seven pivotal battlegrounds where the results were the closest between then President Donald Trump and the Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who of course won the election. The idea was to have alternate slates of electors in seven states that Biden won. The Republican electors show up, vote, and then if they won legal challenges in those states, that those electors could step up and potentially continue to have Trump as president.\n\nThe January 6th committee investigated this. They called the thing, the strategy, illegal. A U.S. judge who reviewed it as part of a civil lawsuit said that it was clearly unlawful. And so several states have been investigating since then. Now, last week, Michigan's attorney general has indicted the 16 Republican electors, fake electors in that state saying that they basically committed forgery and fraud. And the fake electors remain under investigation before a Georgia grand jury in Fulton County, where a district attorney is investigating former President Trump and others for potential election fraud. And more importantly, at the federal level, Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith is investigating fake electors as part of his broad investigation of potential election fraud from the 2020 election.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSo Bart, the electors just met without any authorization and voted for Trump and then sent those votes to Washington, DC?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThey absolutely met and they sent their certificates, basically fraudulent certificates. In one case in Georgia, a guy, one of the organizers, bought a new printer at Target and had a little trouble setting it up. One of the other electors was saying that it took him 20 minutes to set it up and caused some eye rolling at the meeting. But yes, they met. And in several occasions, in contravention of state laws about how these meetings happen. I mean, from the start, the electors are supposed to be the people who are on the side of the winning popular vote in that state. So in each of these seven states, state laws tend to say that they will meet in the State House, in the Capitol building. The meetings nationwide in 2020 were on December 14th.\n\nAnd different laws in different states proved to be hurdles for the Republican electors to meet because in Michigan, for example, the electors were supposed to meet at 2:00 PM on December 14th in the Senate Chamber. And we have a former Republican Party chairman in that state. Laura Cox told the congressional investigators that one of the organizers came to her before this meeting to ask, \"Hey, can we get into the Capitol? Can you help us get into the Capitol the day before, so we could stay there overnight to make sure we're inside the building to hold our meeting on the right day?\" And she told the person that that was insane and inappropriate, and she did not help them do that. So the Republican electors who now have been charged met nearby in the Republican Party headquarters in the basement there. And of course, under state law, that's not in the building, it's not at the right time. So there are these hurdles that are in state law, and that's why even some of the organizers of this strategy acknowledge that some of the phrases that they used with that were it would be \"somewhat dicey to do this strategy in Georgia,\" and \"otherwise problematic in some of the other states.\"\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThanks for being on the show, Bart.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSweeping support for a proposed Ohio constitutional amendment enshrining abortion rights spotlights the potential power of the issue to drive voter turnout and affect races up and down the ballot, even in Republican leaning states. A new USA TODAY Network/Suffolk University survey of Ohio showed the amendment guaranteeing access to reproductive services backed by a double-digit margin, 58% to 32%. Significant support crossed partisan lines, including a third of Republicans and a stunning 85% of Independent women, a key group of persuadable voters. The battle in Ohio, the only state likely to have an abortion measure on the ballot in November's off-year election, is being watched by activists nationwide who are considering a push for state-based initiatives in the next election cycle to codify or restore abortion rights. That could include swing states such as Arizona and red states like Florida, Missouri, and South Dakota.\n\n♦\n\nNeed a job? Climate change is reshaping the employment landscape. With more on that, I'm joined by USA TODAY'S Climate Correspondent Elizabeth Weise. Elizabeth, thanks for jumping on the show.\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nOh, you're so welcome. Glad to be here.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nElizabeth, you write that climate change work is opening up a broad opportunity for job seekers. Don't I have to be a scientist for those kinds of jobs?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nWell, you might think so, but you would in fact be wrong. This story actually came out of two stories I've written. One, which looked at the tremendous number of college students who are going into fields that start with things like ecology and sustainability and climate change and climate; and then another I'd done about people working on wind turbines, which is actually a great and fascinating field, especially if you're not afraid of heights. But I got a lot of pushback from people in other fields who said yeah, we're going to need a certain number of climate scientists. And yes, we're going to need a certain number of people to climb up wind turbines. But really, the things that we need are things you might not think about. So that's how this story came about.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSo should I be thinking about going back to school?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nYou don't necessarily have to. And this is not to say that having a college degree wouldn't get you into a great field. If you're concerned about the climate and you want to spend your workdays doing something to help repair the problem, then there are a whole lot of options out there. Not all of which require that you be a climate scientist. And a lot of them don't even mean you have to go to college.\n\nFor example, plumbers are going to be needed to install all the heat pumps that we are going to install in the U.S. in the next 20 years. There is an incredible dearth of electricians, and as we electrify everything, we are going to need thousands of more electricians. And both of those jobs are ones you can do a two-year course at a community college and then go work for a company and get apprentice training, or you can just go straight out of high school and apprentice yourself at a company and get the necessary certifications. Takes longer, but you're earning money while you're doing it.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAre these jobs all recession-proof jobs?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nYeah. In a way, most of them are because hundreds of thousands of Americans are going to rethink what their yards look like in the next 20 years as droughts become more common. And they realize that that beautiful lawn perhaps doesn't make sense. So people who know how to do zeroscape, people who know how to plant native plants that don't require a ton of water, people who know how to install drip irrigation systems. Those are going to be steady work for a long time.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWhat are the most surprising jobs you found?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nFor those who were in college, thinking of college, talking to young people who are thinking of colleges, there are also jobs that, again, you might not think of as being climate centered, but are really going to be, like engineers. We're going to need a lot of mechanical engineers, people who can design systems that cope with the changes that the climate will bring both to our infrastructure. So there's jobs for folks who are going to college. There's jobs for folks who aren't going to college. They all pay pretty well, and we are going to need a ton of them.\n\nAnd plant breeders. So as we have more drought, one of the things we're going to need is plant breeders, because any farmer will tell you that you're always looking for the latest and greatest seed that's going to give you the best yield for your weather conditions. Well, plant breeders are the ones who sit around and they're working four or five, seven, eight years out figuring out okay, I'm going to create the wheat and the corn and the soy and the canola that can grow in that now, so that we'll have seed for the farmers when they need it. And that's going to be a big field. And people, again, it's not something you think of as climate adjacent, but it really is.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nElizabeth, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nAs always, a pleasure.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

Most recently, Messi's American presence has spurred an increase in members for a certain streaming subscription.\n\nMLS Season Pass, one of Apple TV's latest offerings, allows subscribers to stream live Major League Soccer matches over the course of the full season. According to subscription data analytics company Antenna, there were 110,000 new sign-ups for the MLS Season Pass on July 21, the day of Messi's debut with MLS club Inter Miami CF. It was a 280% increase in sign-ups compared to the late February start to the MLS season.\n\nIn a Tuesday blog post, Antenna dubbed the surge in sign-ups \"The Messi Effect,\" calling it \"both unique and profound.\"\n\n\"Typically, Antenna sees a large portion of total Sign-ups for a league-operated service come before or just at the start of a given season,\" according to the company's blog post, \"with gradual additions over the course of the season largely driven by price promotions and occasional bumps driven by big games/events.\"\n\nThanks to Messi, Apple's MLS Season Pass saw one of the largest influxes ever of new subscribers. To date, nearly half (46%) of all new MLS Season Pass subscriptions began after the Argentine star debuted in July.\n\nIn addition, Antenna's data only includes numbers from U.S. subscribers, so any additional subscriptions outside the U.S. generated from international interest in Messi were not included in the data.\n\nNotably, Messi's deal with Inter Miami includes a share of the revenue Apple brings in with new sign-ups for MLS Season Pass.\n\nApple signed a 10-year, $2.5 billion deal to stream MLS matches internationally in June of last year. It was the company's latest (and biggest) foray into live sports yet.

Despite a lockout and delay in Opening Day, the players are actually going to take the field. When my father, born in 1927, was my age, Opening Day was one of the biggest events on the sports calendar.\n\nFor his son, it’s just another day. It’s not that I don’t like baseball – I do. It’s that baseball is not the sport that stands out above all others in my mind.\n\nMy family’s story is part of a larger one about America’s declining interest in baseball and generational replacement.\n\nThe sport, which was once the most popular in the country, has a bevy of problems that has landed it, at best, a distant second place in America’s hearts. This is especially true among America’s youth.\n\nJust 11% of adults listed baseball as their favorite sport to watch in a 2021 Washington Post poll. That put it well behind football (34%) and tied with basketball for the second favorite sport. Soccer and “something else” (e.g. esports/competitive video gaming) were closely behind at 7%.\n\nWhen examining the poll more in-depth, the problem baseball has becomes both more apparent – and even scarier. A mere 7% of those under the age of 30 say baseball is their favorite sport. This ranked fifth behind football (24%), basketball (17%), “something else” (12%) and soccer (10%).\n\nWhile these fans are overjoyed to be at the ballpark, only 11% of total adults and 7% of people aged under 30 in the US list baseball as their favorite sport. Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n\nTo put baseball’s overall 11% in perspective, there were many more fans of baseball the last time there was a work stoppage in 1994. In an average of Gallup polls that year, 19% of Americans said baseball was their favorite sport.\n\nWhile the 1994 baseball strike may have hurt the sport’s popularity, the truth is baseball had been on the decline for a while. Baseball hadn’t ranked as America’s favorite sport to watch since 1960, when 34% said it was. Soccer that year came in at less than 0.5%, while football picked up 21% support. By the next poll Gallup did on the subject in 1972, baseball was second to football.\n\nThe rise of TV\n\nThe fact that 1960 is the last time baseball reigned supreme is notable. The sports landscape has changed dramatically from 62 years ago.\n\nOne big reason baseball no longer finds itself the darling of American sports is competition and the dawn of the television age.\n\nThe NFL didn’t sign its first league-wide TV contract until 1962; it led to every game being on television and each team receiving a share of the revenue pie. This came around the same time that the AFL – a rival league which would eventually merge with the NFL – started play and signed its own league-wide TV deal.\n\nAfter this point, this meant that over 20 teams had their contests televised, and the country had universal access to the pro game. Additionally, the Super Bowl would begin in 1967. The NFL, of course, is a sport that benefits tremendously from being seen. Baseball, on the other hand, doesn’t gain as much going from radio to television.\n\nAn NBC camera at Yankee Stadium circa 1950 in the Bronx, New York City. MLB/Getty Images\n\nAnother sport which is better visually than audibly is basketball. The NBA was less than 15 years old in 1960. There were just eight NBA teams at that point – half the size of either professional baseball or football. The NBA Finals wouldn’t be aired in their entirety nationally until 1970.\n\nThe country was years away from a successful professional soccer league in 1960 – let alone the incarnation of the MLS. Now, a soccer fan can watch games from here and those across the Atlantic Ocean – the English Premier League and the UEFA Champions League, for example – with ease.\n\nAs for other sports, there were only six NHL teams compared to the 32 today. And the idea of competitive video gaming was a science fiction fantasy and not at all conceivable.\n\nThe increased competition and the use of screens to watch sports came at an inopportune time for baseball.\n\nIf bored, Americans can change the channel very quickly. On social media platforms like TikTok, things go by faster than a bullet train. Baseball is anything but fast as far as Americans are concerned.\n\nCheck out this 2007 Gallup poll when people who weren’t pro baseball fans were asked why they didn’t like the sport. The two top reasons given were boring/uninteresting (31%) and games being too slow/too long (21%).\n\nBaseball boredom?\n\nThe Atlanta Braves' Truist Park during the national anthem prior to Game Four of the 2021 World Series against the Houston Astros. Michael Zarrilli/Getty Images\n\nWhen you look at the data from actual games, you get why people might think the sport is either too boring or too slow.\n\nBalls being put into play have shrunk dramatically, and the strikeout rate has skyrocketed. About 100 years ago, there were well more than twice as many hits than strikeouts in baseball. In 1960, there were 1.7 times as many hits than strikeouts. Last year, there were nearly 3,000 more strikeouts than hits.\n\nIn most sports besides baseball or football, the game is constantly in action. Unlike in baseball, there’s a real rhythm to when each football play starts up with a moving game and play clock.\n\nIncreasingly too, baseball fans need to sit through a game which is taking longer and longer to finish. The length of the average a nine-inning game has gone from two hours and 33 minutes in 1960 to three hours and 10 minutes in 2021. Compare this with a soccer match, which has 90 minutes of play, a 15-minute halftime and some stoppage time – usually two to four minutes.\n\nAdditionally, there simply isn’t a sport that requires someone to sit through more minutes with so little action – so often. While NFL game lengths are similar, remember that an MLB team has 162 regular season games per year. The NFL has just 17.\n\nPerhaps, people might be more willing to sit through long games if they cared about the players. Many people have pointed out the fact that baseball doesn’t have any “stars” as a reason why the sport has struggled.\n\nIn an era in which fans are increasingly rooting for players over teams, this could be a big problem.\n\nOne way we can look at this is through the number of Instagram followers the top athletes in baseball, basketball and football have.\n\nArguably the best MLB player of the last 50 years, Mike Trout still lags far behind his sport competitors on social media. Billie Weiss/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images\n\nMike Trout – arguably the best MLB player of the last 50 years alone – has only about two million followers. This trails NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. and his more than 15 million followers. It’s well behind NBA great LeBron James, who has over 100 million followers. International soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has over 420 million followers, though many of those are outside the United States.\n\nThe inability to be big on social media is just one reason that baseball is likely struggling with today’s youth.\n\nBeyond social media, there was a time when the greatest baseball stars were household names. Consider a 1945 poll from Gallup asking Americans whether they knew who different stars across various industries were.\n\nMore than 90% said they knew who former baseball star Babe Ruth was. The vast majority – 90% of all Americans – not only knew who he was but were able to give a description of what he was famous for. Keep in mind, this poll was taken 10 years after Ruth last suited up to play professional baseball.\n\nRuth was better known at the time than World War II General George Patton. The same percentage of Americans knew who Ruth was as they did future president and five-star General Dwight Eisenhower, who had just helped lead the Americans to victory in Europe.\n\nModern polling indicates that there isn’t any modern baseball player who is anywhere near the level of recognition of Ruth. In fact, some data indicates that less than half of Americans even know who Trout is.\n\nThe lack of star power just isn’t the case in basketball or football. You have stars like James and the recently retired Tom Brady, who have Ruth-level name identification among the American public. Both sports, not surprisingly, have many more athletes known by at least 50% of the public than baseball.\n\nIs there anything baseball can do to reverse the tide? I don’t know.\n\nPerhaps the better question to ask at this point is whether baseball is merely trading on its legacy. As the Greatest Generation – i.e. my father’s – fades into the memory books, it seems quite plausible that baseball’s spot in the top 2 or 3 favorite sports in America may fade along with it.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/football/soccer-popularity-us-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "The US may have lost in the World Cup, but soccer is more popular ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAmerica is known for being at the top of the list at a lot of things. My home country has, however, historically struggled at the most popular sport worldwide: men’s soccer.\n\nAt this year’s World Cup the US Men’s National Team (USMNT) advanced to the round of 16, although the Netherlands defeated it 3-1.\n\nIt the USMNT isn’t quite ready to join soccer’s elite nations, the sport is finding record success at home. “The beautiful game” is far more popular than it has ever been, especially among young Americans.\n\nTake a look at how many people say their favorite sport to watch is soccer. Historically, that percentage has been miniscule. From 1937 to 1972, the figure in Gallup polling was always less than 0.5% of Americans giving the answer soccer when asked which their favorite to watch was. Even through December 2004, the percentage never rose above 2%.\n\nEarlier this year, 8% of Americans answered soccer as their favorite sport to watch in a Washington Post poll. This may seem like a small percentage, but it is huge growth given the baseline. There is no other sport that saw anywhere near this type of improvement in its popularity as soccer during this period.\n\nSoccer is growing in popularity in the US -- and the trend is not slowing down. Clive Mason/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, nearly as many Americans now call soccer their favorite sport to watch as they do basketball (12%) or baseball (11%). Soccer actually has beaten motor racing, hockey and golf the last few times the Washington Post polled the subject.\n\nMy guess is that the number of soccer fans is going to continue to grow over the next few years. Why? Look at the young.\n\nSoccer is most popular among adults under the age of 30. There are actually more adults aged 18 to 29 who say soccer is their favorite sport to watch than those who say baseball is their preferred. Remember that baseball is supposedly America’s pastime.\n\nOf course, American football – the NFL – is still the top sport to watch overall and among all age groups. Over one-third of Americans have for years indicated that it is their top sport to view.\n\nFootball may be getting a run for its money from soccer, though, when you examine the long-term trends among the number of high schoolers playing the game.\n\nForty years ago, soccer was not a terribly popular sport for high schoolers to play. When you combined boys and girls playing the sport, only a little bit more than 200,000 students played the game. For comparison, nearly a million boys played football.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters The best photos of the 2022 World Cup Prev Next\n\nTwenty years ago, over 600,000 boys and girls played soccer. This past year, over 800,000 boys and girls in high school decided to take up the sport with the black and white ball. Put in other mathematical terms, that is nearly 300% growth in the last 40 years.\n\nThere is no other sport in America that has taken off as quickly over the last 40 years as soccer among high schoolers.\n\nAnd while soccer isn’t particularly close to the NFL’s popularity among adults, soccer is closing in amongst high schoolers playing the two sports. What was once an over 700,000-participant gap in the early 1980s between the number of high schoolers taking part in soccer and those playing football has consistently slid downward since. The gap dropped to a little bit more than 400,000 in the early 2000s.\n\nToday, football has just over a 200,000-person advantage over soccer in the number of high schoolers who play the game. Put another way: football has stagnated, while soccer has consistently risen.\n\nWhat has caused soccer to be nipping at football’s heels in terms of participation?\n\nSoccer isn't just popular on the professional level. Maja Hitij/FIFA/Getty Images\n\nThe most obvious is that soccer is played in large numbers by boys and girls. While football does have some girls playing the game on the high school level, it’s almost uniformly a boys game – especially in contact football. Soccer, meanwhile, has nearly 400,000 girl players. In the early 1980s, that number was about 50,000.\n\nThe impact of the success of the US Women’s National Team in America can’t be underestimated. The women consistently do well on the international stage. They’ve won four World Cups to the men’s zero. Less spoken about is that they also rate better on television than the men do in the World Cup.\n\nSafety is a factor as well in soccer’s rise. In an Associated Press poll taken in the 2010s, 86% of parents said they were comfortable letting their kids play soccer given safety concerns. This dropped to 51% for football.\n\nGiven that soccer is primarily a fall sport like football, it’s not hard to imagine a lot of parents pushing their children to kick the soccer ball instead of the football.\n\nThe question going forward is whether the success of soccer on the high school level will ultimately translate into soccer truly closing the gap with football in the number of adult fans.\n\nWe’ll just have to wait and see, though with the US, Canada and Mexico hosting the 2026 World Cup, soccer isn’t going away anytime soon.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2019/07/08/womens-league-seeks-more-fans-sponsors-after-us-title/39664595/", "title": "Women's league seeks more fans, sponsors after US title", "text": "AP\n\nMegan Rapinoe, the lavender-haired icon of women's soccer, maintains that green is the key to her sport's sustainability.\n\n\"For me, it's about the Benjis,\" she said.\n\nWomen's soccer engages the U.S. every four years, then disappears for most fans like a comet leaving the solar system. In the wake of the Americans' record-setting fourth World Cup title Sunday, the hard part remains: the weekly work of boosting the National Women's Soccer League, where average attendance remains at a minor league level.\n\nFans have not handed over a sufficient supply of $100 bills displaying Benjamin Franklin's portrait, and sponsors and broadcasters have not made enough of the six-, seven- and eight-figure agreements needed for the NWSL to rise to the level of men's Major League Soccer.\n\n\"On the men's side in MLS, they have owners with extremely deep pockets,\" defender Crystal Dunn said. \"If the women's game is going to grow, it's going to come down to us not kind of penny-pinching on things and really putting a lot of resources in.\"\n\nThe Women's United Soccer Association, launched as the first fully professional women's league, folded in 2003 after just three seasons. Women's Professional Soccer started play in 2009 and also lasted only three seasons.\n\nNWSL took the field in 2013 and has a management contract with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which has listed nearly $8.5 million as expenses attributable to the league. The USSF pays the salaries of 22 allocated national team players, providing the NWSL a subsidy and the ability to market the top American players.\n\nNWSL launched in 2013 with eight teams, increased to nine the following season and 10 in 2016, then went back to nine in 2018 — of which four share owners with MLS.\n\n\"When the league started, no one expected the league to survive seven seasons,\" Utah Royals coach Laura Harvey said. \"I think the biggest battle has already been overcome a little bit in the U.S. that a lot of women's soccer faces across the world, is that people are willing to pay a ticket price to watch a game.\"\n\nMLS, which started with 10 teams in 1996, expanded, contracted and now has grown to 24 teams this season, with plans to expand to 30. MLS average attendance has risen from the 14,000 range at the turn of the century to about 22,000; the NWSL is between 5,000 to 6,000.\n\n\"The MLS, it's well documented, had its share of growing pains when it was still a toddler and a youth, if you will. So. I don't think any of us involved in the NWSL thought this was going to be an easy journey in establishing a viable women's league,\" said Mike Golub, president of business for MLS's Portland Timbers and the NWSL's Thorns, who lead the league with an 18,000-plus attendance average.\n\nJust a handful of NWSL games were televised nationally from 2013-16 but the league announced a deal with A+E Networks ahead of the 2017 season in which the company would take an equity stake and broadcast a game of the week on Lifetime. But A+E cut short the deal last winter, a season early, and it took NWSL until last week to announce an agreement for ESPN to televise 14 games during the season's second half.\n\nNWSL's staff is small. The league had three to five full-time employees when it started and now has 13, including five in its media office. The goal is to grow teams and staff.\n\n\"Not expansion just to expand,\" said Amanda Duffy, who is in her third season running the NWSL office and in her first year as league president. \"It's expansion to get right with the right ownership, with the right facilities, the right market, the right infrastructure and the right ability to connect with the community and resonating in a market. And if we get that right, that will also at the same time broaden our footprint, broaden the relevancy.\"\n\nNWSL announced a sponsorship agreement Sunday with Anheuser Busch Cos. Inc.'s Budweiser, a deal negotiated by MLS's marketing wing Soccer United Marketing.\n\n\"We identified the fact that there is a national and global attention one month out of every 48 months, and if we really, truly want to act like supporters, if we really, truly want to grow the sport, it's got to be day in, day out, I mean during the actual season,\" said Monica Rustgi, Budweiser's vice president of marketing. \"It's also to use our scale and reach to get more people into the fold and more sponsors into the fold.\"\n\nBudweiser joined a relatively small group of NWSL national sponsors that includes Nike, Lifetime, Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc.'s Cutter insect repellant and Thorne Research Inc., which manufactures nutritional supplements.\n\n\"I think for national sponsorships, that's a process that takes time,\" Duffy said. \"I think right now the larger and broader opportunities from a sponsorship perspective are going to be more at a local level, where there's an immediate connection with the NWSL players and the brand at a local scale in those markets.\"\n\nHouston, Orlando, Portland and Utah have shared owners with the MLS teams in their cities, and defending champion North Carolina has the same owner as the local team in the second-tier United Soccer League Championship. A joint ownership model has been a success in Europe. Lyon has won four straight European Women's Champions League titles, and Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Chelsea reached the semifinals.\n\n\"Europe is doing a very good job in general,\" said Ricardo Fort, vice president of global sponsorships at The Coca-Cola Co. \"A lot of leagues have established in the last couple of years. There is investment from the clubs and sponsors are following the best.\"\n\nBoosted by players developed by the clubs, seven European nations reached the Women's World Cup quarterfinals. The economies of scale help keep down costs.\n\n\"In our case there's some real inherent advantages having one organization run both clubs,\" Golub said. \"We have a staff of 160 people, all of whom are charged with running both the Timbers and the Thorns. ... Teams that don't have more than one club don't necessarily have that scale, those resources that expertise. We also have by virtue of our men a great facility that we can control, a great practice facility.\"\n\nThe league's listed minimum salary charge to a team's salary cap budget this year is $16,538 and the maximum is $46,200, though many players earn far more. Midfielder Rose Lavelle, who scored the second goal in the World Cup final, said that while national team players have higher pay, some of her club teammates need to coach on the side to make ends meet.\n\n\"We need kind of sustainable income so that people can feel like this is their full-time job. I think right now, the reality of just women's sports in general is that they can't devote their whole life to what they love,\" she said. \"I just feel like the next step is that we need to make everyone feel like they are a professional athlete.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/12/10/sarri-uses-napoli-formula-to-ignite-chelseas-title-bid/38708771/", "title": "Sarri uses Napoli formula to ignite Chelsea's title bid", "text": "AP\n\nA midseason tactical switch sparked Chelsea's surge to the Premier League title two years ago under Antonio Conte.\n\nCould the same happen under his successor this season?\n\nFor the first time in his debut season at Chelsea, Maurizio Sarri deployed a lineup without a genuine striker for the match against Manchester City on Saturday. The result? A 2-0 win over the previously unbeaten leaders that brought Chelsea back into contention for the title.\n\nSarri has previous experience here.\n\nAt Napoli, he used diminutive winger Dries Mertens as a makeshift center forward, flanked by two small guys in Lorenzo Insigne and Jose Callejon in a fluid, mobile front three. Mertens responded with 46 goals in two seasons, Napoli was one of the most thrilling teams to watch in Europe, and Sarri's side almost ended Juventus' domination of Serie A.\n\nAgainst City, Sarri dropped Alvaro Morata from the squad, left fellow striker Olivier Giroud on the bench and started with Eden Hazard as the so-called \"false nine\" with Willian and Pedro Rodriguez on either side. Hazard struggled at first — he was seen throwing his arms out in despair at times — but grew into the role and finished the game with two assists.\n\n\"We wanted to try with Eden because, for the first time, there was the possibility to play in counterattacks,\" Sarri said. \"Hazard, Pedro and Willian are really very suitable for this kind of playing, so I think it's a normal choice. I think that it's really a very good option.\"\n\nWhether Sarri opts to use this approach against teams who, unlike City, sit back and defend remains to be seen. It seems ideal for away games — a trip to Brighton is next for Chelsea — and matches against big rivals at home.\n\nGiroud and Morata have alternated as the classic target man for Chelsea this season but neither striker has done enough to make the position their own. Morata, in particular, has struggled in his second season in England, with Sarri having said the Spain striker was mentally fragile.\n\nTwo years ago, it was Conte's switch to a three-man backline that was the catalyst for a 13-game winning run that blew away its rivals and saw the team cruise to the title.\n\nChelsea is eight points behind first-place Liverpool ahead of a kind schedule of games over the busy festive period in England.\n\nIt was a tough weekend for strikers in general in the Premier League.\n\nCity looked increasingly rudderless at Stamford Bridge without the injured Sergio Aguero and the dropped Gabriel Jesus as Pep Guardiola's side fell to its first loss of the season. Tottenham went with winger Son Heung-min over the rested Harry Kane or his backup, Fernando Llorente, for its 2-0 win at Leicester. Wolverhampton Wanderers deployed a front three of attacking midfielders in their 2-1 victory at Newcastle.\n\nThen there was Liverpool, who started Mohamed Salah as the focal point of its attack against Bournemouth — as opposed to Roberto Firmino — and was rewarded with hat trick from the Egypt forward.\n\nThe general trend in the English top flight has been for teams to play with one conventional striker up front in recent years but that is being ripped up in a bid for more fluidity and to better stretch defenses.\n\nLUKAKU RECOVERS\n\nOne of the few strikers to enjoy the weekend was Romelu Lukaku, who was among Manchester United's scorers in a 4-1 win over Fulham.\n\nThe Belgium international now has two goals in three league games as he looks to shrug off a slump in form that saw him go the previous 12 games without scoring for his club.\n\nLukaku said he he'd had \"good conversations\" with United manager Jose Mourinho in recent days because he had not been playing with enough aggression or intensity. He attributed that to bulking up too much at the World Cup in Russia.\n\n\"When you are in the Premier League, I cannot play with the same amount of muscle as international football here in the Prem(ier League),\" Lukaku said. \"That was something that when I came back I knew straightaway, 'No, no, I cannot play in this style like this.'\n\n\"I had to lose muscle basically, yes. So you just stay out of the gym, drink a lot of water, and a lot of vegetables and fish and it helps.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP English soccer: https://apnews.com/PremierLeague and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/01/25/major-league-soccer-delays-season-no-answers-west-end-stadium-opening/6673432002/", "title": "Major League Soccer delays season; no answers on West End ...", "text": "We know when Major League Soccer's 2021 season is going to start but it's not exactly clear when FC Cincinnati is going to open the West End Stadium.\n\nIt's also not clear what FCC's plans are if there are limited or no fans allowed.

This ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDario Otero Jr., affectionately known as DJ, admires Jackie Robinson for making history as the first Black American to play Major League Baseball.\n\nDJ, 13, said Robinson proved that Black players too could excel in professional baseball. But 75 years after the league was desegregated, DJ said he is the only Black baseball player on his youth travel team.\n\nAnd that reality hits the hardest during tryouts and games, said DJ’s father, Dario Otero Sr.\n\n“He knows he’s the only one there,” Otero said. “Whatever he does, however he’s getting looked at, he sticks out like a sore thumb … He’s known for being the one player in our area that is the Black player.”\n\nDario Otero, Jr. Courtesy Brandon Diebold/Black Rose Films\n\nDJ, who lives in Rosemount, Minnesota, said he would love to see more Black youth playing baseball in his age group. Being the only Black player on his team makes him feel “worried” for the future, DJ said.\n\nAnd he’s not the only one.\n\nRecent news of there being no US-born Black players competing in the World Series for the first time since 1950 underscores what advocates for racial equity in sports say is MLB’s decades-long struggle with diversity.\n\nThis comes after a May report by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport found that there is now a smaller percentage of Black MLB players than there’s been in three decades. Black players currently compose about 7% of Major League Baseball teams, in comparison to the 18% of Black players the league had in 1991.\n\nAhead of Game 1 at Minute Maid Park in Houston, the Astros and Philadelphia Phillies announced their 26-man World Series rosters last week, and neither team’s rosters include any US-born Black players. Astros outfielder Michael Brantley, a Black player, likely would’ve been on the roster but suffered a season-ending shoulder injury earlier in the season. Meanwhile, the Phillies had no Black players on their Opening Day roster this year for the first time since 1959. Roman Quinn, who is Black, was a backup outfielder with the Phillies this season, but was released after playing in 23 games.\n\n‘Baseball has actually tried very hard’\n\nRichard Lapchick, director of the institute and author of the report titled The Racial and Gender Report Card: Major League Baseball, said MLB has made some strides in recruiting Black players but the data shows there is more work to be done.\n\n“Baseball has actually tried very hard to increase the number of Black players because, frankly, it’s an embarrassment to them,” Lapchick said.\n\nLapchick credited the league for making history this year. Four of the five top MLB draft picks this year were Black, and they all participated in MLB’s Dream Series designed to increase Black representation on the field.\n\nTony Reagins, MLB’s Chief Baseball Development Officer, tells CNN that what is key is getting players from the youth leagues to college where they can be seen by scouts and further develop their skills.\n\nReagins said the number of Black people participating in collegiate baseball is about 5%. He said while he understands the importance of getting Black players into professional baseball, he feels “getting Black players to college is equally as important.”\n\n“This didn’t happen overnight, and it won’t change overnight,” Reagins said.\n\nWhile no players will be US born African Americans, there will be Black players in the Fall Classic, including Afro-Cuban slugger Yordan Alvarez of the Astros. Players from eight different countries are represented in the World Series this year.\n\nStill, observers say the lack of US-born players on this year’s roster signals that more needs to be done to increase the pipeline for African American players. And despite MLB’s efforts, many fans and league observers are still disappointed that Black American players are underrepresented, said Phil Dixon, a baseball historian and co-founder of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City.\n\n“If I had to give Major League Baseball a grade, I would give them an F,” Dixon said.\n\nHis museum continues to receive millions of dollars in donations from MLB, but Dixon nevertheless believes there is too much investment in the past and not enough in the future.\n\n“Ever since we started the museum, the number of Black players has been decreasing,” Dixon said. “They’re putting their money in the history, big time, but their commitment to the current youth is sorely lacking.”\n\nIt’s an ‘expensive’ sport\n\nOtero, DJ’s father, said Black youth need to learn the history of baseball and receive more guidance on how to get involved.\n\n“I just want to encourage … minor league [and] major league baseball teams to go into the history of their community and see how do you bring young athletes in,” Otero told CNN.\n\nOtero said some Black families also struggle to afford the costs of playing baseball and there isn’t enough investment in fixing up baseball fields in Black neighborhoods.\n\nDario Otero, Jr. Courtesy Brandon Diebold/Black Rose Films\n\n“It’s expensive,” Otero said. “$300 gloves, $300 bats that you got to switch every single year.”\n\nLapchick told CNN that baseball fields are not common in urban areas.\n\nOtero, who previously coached baseball in urban areas, said the fields in Black and brown communities are not maintained as well as fields in White suburban areas.\n\n“It’s not as fun,” Otero said, adding that a rock might fly up and hit a player in the face because of the field’s abysmal state.\n\nExperts say more needs to be done to eliminate the racial barriers to baseball.\n\n“I think that more could be invested into those programs, and I think that municipalities across the country need to partner with Major League Baseball to make those programs as robust as they can be and really support our youth,” said Jessie Hagopian, an author who writes about Black representation in sports.\n\nIf MLB built more fields in Black and brown communities, Hagopian said it would revive interest and recruitment within these communities.\n\nReagins said MLB shares Hagopian’s concerns. The league is working with local leaders to improve conditions of fields in several cities and offering financial assistance to young players to help defray the cost of participating in youth leagues, Reagins said.\n\n“We provide equipment, we provide scholarships, we provide grants in order to start to balance the scale … getting more kids those opportunities that those with resources already have,” he said.\n\n‘There’s blame to be placed on every level’\n\nLack of investment and the high costs to play are not the only problems.\n\nAccording to Dixon, Ebony Magazine and other Black media outlets used to promote and list all the Black professional baseball players in the 1960s and 1970s but they no longer do.\n\n“There’s blame to be placed on every level,” Dixon said.\n\nLapchick said Black children are less likely to choose baseball when they are not seeing themselves celebrated in the sport.\n\nBarry Bonds was considered one of the most popular Black baseball players in the early 2000s, but his reported steroid use and the subsequent media critique overshadowed his accomplishments. This resulted in pushing Black athletes away from baseball and more toward basketball and football, Lapchick said.\n\n“So, if you’re a young Black kid, and you see the best Black baseball player being criticized all the time, and you look at the NBA and see great athletes who are being highlighted on the news and in the community – same thing in the NFL – you’re probably not gonna choose baseball,” Lapchick explained.\n\nDespite the racial disparity in baseball, DJ said he hopes to make it to MLB someday as a starting pitcher.\n\n“I’ve got a big arm,” DJ said. “An arm that someday might be part of the next generation of major league superstars.”", "authors": ["Jalen Brown Justin Gamble", "Jalen Brown", "Justin Gamble"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mls/2021/05/21/mls-schedule-may-22-23-how-watch-games-tv-streaming-info/5174363001/", "title": "MLS schedule May 22-23: How to watch games on TV, streaming info", "text": "More than a month into the 2021 MLS season, the cream is starting to rise to the top.\n\nThe Seattle Sounders continue to be the class of the league, and their next challenger will be a rejuvenated Atlanta United team (Sunday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Fox).\n\nTrying to keep pace with Seattle are the Los Angeles Galaxy, a once-upon-a-time MLS powerhouse that is experiencing a renaissance, thanks to its transcendent playmaker Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez and new coach Greg Vanney. The Galaxy's next test will be road game against the Portland Timbers on Saturday (3:30 p.m. ET on ABC).\n\nIn the Eastern Conference, five-time MLS Cup-winning coach Bruce Arena has turned around the New England Revolution, who are off to a strong start. Revs as \"Team of ESPN+\"?

An early stalemate with Los Angeles Football Club was something of an outlier, as the Sounders (5-0-1, 16 points) have defeated its other five opponents to start the 2021 season and sit atop the Western Conference. After an ACL injury sidelined Atlanta United’s Josef Martinez in a dismal 2020 for the Five Stripes, Atlanta (2-1-2, 8 points) will take the field in Seattle with a healthy Martinez and its own power to showcase.\n\nMLS player to watch\n\nCarles Gil, New England Revolution - The Spanish midfield maestro is one assist shy (3) from the league-most and has played himself into early MLS Best XI consideration to begin the season. Gil has scored a penalty and also leads MLS in key passes (27) – or passes the lead to a legitimate chance at goal, a category that Gil leads by 12.\n\nMLS schedule: What are this weekend's games?\n\n(All times Eastern. ABC/ESPN games available to be streamed on Watch ESPN; Fox games on FOX Sports Live. Games also available on fuboTV.)\n\nSaturday\n\nCF Montreal vs. FC Cincinnati, 1 p.m. (ESPN+)\n\nPortland Timbers vs. Los Angeles Galaxy, 3:30 p.m. (ABC)\n\nChicago Fire FC vs. Inter Miami CF, 6 p.m. (UniMas, TUDN)\n\nOrlando City SC vs. Toronto FC, 7 p.m. (ESPN+)\n\nNew York City FC vs. Columbus Crew, 7:30 p.m. (ESPN+)\n\nFC Dallas vs. Real Salt Lake, 8 p.m. (ESPN+)\n\nNew England Revolution vs. New York Red Bulls, 8 p.m. (ESPN+)\n\nHouston Dynamo vs. Vancouver Whitecaps, 9 p.m. (ESPN+)\n\nSan Jose Earthquakes vs. Sporting Kansas City, 10 p.m. (ESPN+)\n\nLos Angeles FC vs. Colorado Rapids, 10:30 p.m. (ESPN+)\n\nSunday\n\nSeattle Sounders vs. Atlanta United, 4:30 p.m. (FOX)\n\nDC United vs. Philadelphia Union, 7 p.m. (ESPN+)\n\nNashville SC vs. Austin FC, 9 p.m. (FS1)\n\nMLS news and notes\n\nColumbus SC moniker lasts one week: The Columbus Crew rebrand simply didn’t take hold and the club that officially existed for seven days as \"Columbus SC\" not only dropped its new name, but moved on from the name it started the 2021 season with too. The club that appeared in two MLS Cup finales and won one championship as Columbus Crew SC – the \"SC\" was added in a 2014 rebrand - has reverted back to its original name: the Columbus Crew. The switch back to the original name of the very first MLS franchise came after prominent front-office members and ownership met with fans regarding opposition to the since-discarded Columbus SC name.\n\nMLS players in line for Euro 2020 to be staged this summer: With last summer’s European Championship postponed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the 2021 summer will see the competition finally staged and it looks like several MLS players will be involved in the competition. As of Wednesday, six MLS players had been named to their respective national team camps. Przemyslaw Frankowski (Chicago Fire FC; Poland), Szabolcs Schon (FC Dallas; Hungary), Robin Lod (Minnesota United FC; Finland), Jukka Raitala (Minnesota; Finland), Lassi Lappalainen (CF Montreal; Finland) and Daniel Gazdag (Philadelphia Union; Hungary) were all named to their respective countries' preliminary rosters. UEFA Euro 2020 kicks off on June 11 in Rome.\n\nChicharito leading all MLS goal scorers: Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez has gone from feel-good early season story to what appears to be a legitimate MLS Golden Boot contender. After a white-hot start to the season, Chicharito has continued putting the ball in the back of the net for a formidable Los Angeles Galaxy side that’s started out hot in 2021 on a 4-1-0 record. Chicharito has seven goals through five matches – two more goals than Seattle’s Raul Ruidiaz.\n\nBruce Arena back near the top of the MLS table: Now in his third season at New England Revolution, maybe it shouldn’t be a surprise that head coach Bruce Arena’s Revs are sitting atop the Eastern Conference table on a 3-1-2 record. Considering that Arena inherited a New England side that was veering well off course in 2019, though, it’s still impressive. We’ve said it here before and it’s worth saying again: New England’s run to the Eastern Conference final in 2020 was legit. The Revs are using the early days of this season to position themselves well for the long summer ahead.\n\nBig blow to NYRB and USMNT: New York Red Bulls central defender Aaron Long tore his right Achilles tendon during last Saturday's loss to the Philadelphia Union. Not only will the injury be a devastating blow for the Red Bulls, but also the U.S. men's national team in what will be a busy year with Concacaf Nations League, the Gold Cup and qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. Long is the second player who figured to play a role in most if not all of those USMNT events to suffer a significant injury, following Jordan Morris, who tore his left ACL in February playing on loan at Swansea City. Long's absence could mean elevated USMNT roles for Nashville SC's Walker Zimmerman and Atlanta United's Miles Robinson.\n\n40k-plus in Atlanta: Crowds are returning to sporting events in increasing numbers, and nowhere was that more evident than in Atlanta, where an announced attendance of 40,116 was at Atlanta United's 1-0 win over Club de Foot Montreal on Saturday. It was the largest attendance for a soccer game in the world since the COVID-19 pandemic began and the sporting world shut down in March 2020.\n\nStefan steps in for Stefan: The Seattle Sounders continued on their hot start and remained unbeaten after their high-octane showdown with Los Angeles FC on Sunday despite losing their stalwart between the pipes, Stefan Frei. In his stead, Stefan Cleveland earned a clean sheet against the team that features the previous two MLS Golden Boot winners. Seattle will need Cleveland to keep up the good work with Frei expected to miss a few weeks with a knee sprain. Next up for Cleveland: Atlanta United and the 2018 Golden Boot winner Josef Martinez on national TV. No biggie.\n\nCharlotte FC player making progress: Charlotte FC won’t begin play in MLS until 2022 but the club’s roster build started early. Charlotte midfielder Riley McGree saw his loan at Birmingham City of the second-division English Championship extended until January 2022 after making 15 league appearances for Birmingham this past season. After the loan period expires, McGree, a well-traveled 22-year-old, should begin preparations to join Charlotte for the 2022 MLS campaign.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n7: The absence of Jordan Morris hasn't made a difference for the Seattle Sounders. With a win or draw against Atlanta United on Sunday, the Sounders would set a franchise record for best start to a season with seven straight games unbeaten. Early on, the Sounders look poised for a run to their third straight MLS Cup final.\n\nMLS power rankings: Top 10 power poll\n\n1. Seattle Sounders: The sound MLS is hearing are the laughs of Seattle players who heard about their eventual demise before the season. Seattle is the best club in the league and proved it again in a 2-0 win over LAFC thanks to second-half goals by Xavier Arreaga and Brad Smith.\n\n2. Los Angeles Galaxy: The return of Galaxy, and Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernández, to the forefront of MLS is tremendous news for a league that still needs more viewers. The Galaxy made easy work of expansion franchise Austin. Chicharito added his league-leading seventh goal, and it could’ve been eight if not for a penalty save by Brad Stuver in the first half.\n\n3. New England Revolution: Adam Buksa made an instant impact as a substitute in the recent 1-0 win over Columbus. He checked into the game at the 83rd minute mark, then scored the game-winner three minutes later. The Revs are two points clear of the second-place team in the Eastern Conference.\n\n4. Orlando City SC: Orlando is alone in second place of the Eastern Conference with nine points. That would be good enough for fifth place out west. Orlando held off DC United for a 1-0 win on Sunday after Mauricio Pereyra scored a 17th-minute goal.\n\n5. Sporting Kansas City: SKC won two of three matches over eight days, a run that started with a comeback victory over Austin FC on May 9. Sporting closed out the week with a dominant 3-0 win over Vancouver.\n\n6. New York City FC: NYCFC holds a plus-six goal differential after five matches, which is second most in the league behind the plus-11 for Seattle. Consecutive 1-1 draws leave NYCFC in third place in the Eastern Conference behind New England and Orlando. NYCFC ends the month of May with matches against Columbus and LAFC.\n\n7. Colorado Rapids: The Rapids are one of the pleasant surprises of the early season. Colorado has won three straight to start May and move into a tie for third place in the Western Conference with 10 points.\n\n8. Atlanta United: Atlanta has amassed five points over its last three matches, including three from a 1-0 win over CF Montreal on Saturday when Marcelino Moreno scored a thriller in stoppage time in front of 40,000 spectators.\n\n9. Philadelphia Union: The Union had to navigate the early season MLS schedule with Concacaf Champions League matches. Since then, Philadelphia is rounding into form, earning seven points in the last three games. The Union defeated the New York Red Bulls the last time out.\n\n10. Real Salt Lake: RSL only have played four matches, which is tied for fewest in the league along with FC Cincinnati. Still, Salt Lake remains in seventh place in the Western Conference with a trip to FC Dallas looming.\n\nMoving in: Colorado Rapids, Atlanta United, Philadelphia Union, Real Salt Lake\n\nDropping out: San Jose Earthquakes (previously: 4) Columbus Crew (5) Nashville SC, New York Red Bulls (10)\n\nOthers receiving votes: Nashville SC, San Jose Earthquakes, Inter Miami CF, Los Angeles FC\n\nUSA TODAY Sports Network MLS top 10 power poll voters: Pat Brennan, Cincinnati Enquirer; Mike Craven, Austin American-Statesman; Drake Hills, The Tennessean; Jacob Myers, The Columbus Dispatch; Jim Reineking, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/baseball/2022/07/03/savannah-bananas-putting-show-mlb-would-smart-watch/7800003001/", "title": "Savannah Bananas putting on a show that MLB would be smart to ...", "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. — It’s three hours before the first pitch, but the Savannah Bananas already are well into their pre-game routine on a hot, humid day in June.\n\nOn the field at Grayson Stadium, players take batting practice and scoop ground balls. And just outside the lines, other players practice dance routines and watch as the first-base coach works on a stunt that involves launching himself in the air, twisting over three chairs and a picnic table with a player laying on top, and, hopefully, sticking the landing.\n\nHe does.\n\n\"If you ask more people, the Savannah Bananas are the best thing in baseball right now,\" says Bananas manager Tyler Gillum as he hits ground balls to infielders.\n\nGillum, an assistant baseball coach at South Mountain Community College, is biased, of course, but that doesn’t mean he’s wrong. Attending your first Bananas game is like seeing Times Square for the first time. You don’t know where to look, and you’re sure to miss something.\n\nPlayers dance and participate in promotions before, during and after the game. The Bananas have a pep band, their cheerleaders are either women over 65 — the Banana-Nanas — or a heavyset guy who is in worse shape than the “Dad Bod” printed on his shirt suggests.\n\nPart of the pre-game entertainment includes players leading the sold-out crowd — all games are sold out — in singing \"Hey Baby.\" Like the girl in the song, everyone wants to give the Bananas a whirl these days, or to be whirled by the Bananas.\n\nToday, the Bananas have 2.8 million followers on TikTok, more than any Major League Baseball team, 594,000 on Instagram and 96,000 on Twitter. They’ve been featured on several national television networks, and owner Jesse Cole, who always wears a yellow tuxedo in public, is in high demand for podcasts and as a speaker.\n\nThe demand for the Bananas is so great that the organization created a spin-off version of baseball called \"Banana Ball\" that features dramatic rule changes, including a two-hour time limit, no visits to the mound, a called strike for stepping out of the batter’s box, earning a point for winning an inning and no bunting.\n\nThe idea, Cole says, was to get rid of as many boring baseball plays as possible.\n\nBanana Ball debuted two summers ago with a \"world tour\"; the only stop was Mobile, Alabama.\n\nThe 2022 team was managed by former Diamondbacks outfielder Eric Byrnes and its tour was seven stops. There are plans for Banana Ball to continue to grow in 2023, and its barnstorming tour could include a stop at a spring training site in Arizona, Cole says.\n\nClearly, the Bananas have tapped into something other baseball teams haven’t. But what? Cole laughs, which he does often, then pauses to consider the question.\n\n\"It’s something different, unique and fun,\" he says. \"When you have a game like baseball that is so well known, such a traditional game, but to many it’s become a little too slow, too long and too boring. We’ve been able to find something as an alternative.\n\n\"A lot of people have enjoyed seeing the players have fun, and I think that’s what it’s meant to be. When you’re a kid, you came out to the game to have fun. And I think that’s what is happening in Savannah.\"\n\nGrowing Bananas\n\nGrayson Stadium was built in 1926, seats 4,000, is sold out for the summer and there are 60,000 people on the waiting list for Bananas tickets. The ticket window at Grayson is a lonely place because you can’t buy tickets there. They’re only available via the online waiting list, and receiving an e-mail that your turn has arrived is cause for celebration.\n\n\"I brought three people here from out-of-town last week,\" says Keith Royal, a Savannah resident since 1999. \"They had never been to a Bananas baseball game, and they’re like, 'I just watched an entire show for like $20 and the baseball game hasn’t even started yet.' \"\n\nMost tickets are general admission and cost $20. That includes all the hot dogs, cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, popcorn, chips, water and soft drinks you can eat and drink.\n\nTall domestic cans of beer are only $6, and cocktails, including the dangerous \"Slippery Banana,\" are $10.\n\nPeople begin lining up to enter hours before the game is scheduled to start. They race to stake out seats, then fill paper sacks with concessions. The show already is under way.\n\nOn this night, it begins with a song from \"Princess Potassia,\" who is wearing yellow, of course. The new few hours are filled with an array of promotions that includes a toddler race, pies in the face, players dancing and a competition for ladies of a certain age to join the Banana-Nanas for a night. The eventual winner ended her routine by twerking. Game over.\n\nThe song played during the seventh-inning stretch isn’t “Take Me Out to the Ball Game,” it’s “Yellow” by Coldplay, of course.\n\n\"We’re always looking for little moments that might be down time and get rid of those little moments,\" Gillum says. \"How can we make connections with fans? And how can we constantly entertain?\"\n\nThe Bananas are the brainchild of Cole and his wife, Emily, who bought the Savannah franchise in the Coastal Plain League, a summer collegiate league featuring wooden bats, in 2016.\n\nBoth had worked in minor league baseball for a few years — Jesse proposed to her on the field in Gastonia, North Carolina — so they were accustomed to marketing challenges. But not one like this.\n\nThey found a stadium, and a team, in disrepair. They invested every dime they had and sold one season ticket in the first two months.\n\nThe franchise needed a jolt, and they figured a new name might do it. So they held a contest to rename the team and Bananas won. People in the community laughed and scoffed, but soon after the new name was revealed, Savannah Bananas was trending on Twitter.\n\nA thunderstorm delayed the start of opening day, but 4,000 fans stuck around for the delayed start, and similar crowds have been at Grayson ever since.\n\nManaging Bananas\n\nOne of Cole’s many mottos is \"if it’s normal, do the opposite.\" And it takes a special kind of baseball man to be willing to roll with that.\n\nOn the day I meet Gillum, Grayson Stadium is bustling. Employees are stocking the team store. The Dippin’ Dots cart is being wheeled into place. A drill team due to perform is working on its routine. The Banana-Nanas are arriving. The only quiet place is a storage closet that's been converted into \"The World's Smallest Bookstore.\" The capacity is one, and the only books on the shelves are Cole's \"Fans First: Change The Game, Break the Rules & Create an Unforgettable Experience.\"\n\nGillum is in his office, accessed via a few steps down from the dugout. The clubhouse and the office would make those in the movie “Bull Durham” look palatial. An uneaten sandwich is on Gillum’s desk and his boots are under it. A new player has reported and Gillum’s trying to get him outfitted while making sure everyone else is doing what they are supposed to do.\n\n\"Are they throwing BP?\" he asks an assistant coach, who tells him yes.\n\n\"Good, we got fungoes going?\"\n\nAgain, yes.\n\nGillum can now resume answering questions, including this one: What does he look for in a Banana?\n\nGillum has an acronym for it: OKG. Our kind of guy.\n\nAn ideal Banana, Gillum says, is talented, tough, hard-working, selfless and outgoing. He wants a guy who isn’t afraid of big moments on the field, or to karaoke off of it.\n\nAbout a thousand players expressed interest in playing for the Bananas, but they aren’t a fit for everyone. Gillum uses his own knowledge of players and his coaching connections to find just the right guy. Those connections, he says, are his “honey hole.”\n\nIt’s not unusual for a coaching friend to call and say, \"Hey, I think I’ve got a Banana for you.\"\n\nThe Bananas joke around during games, but not when they are actually playing baseball. In 2021, they went 40-10 and won the league title. They were rewarded with championship rings the size of a toddler’s fist. They were 21-8 heading into Saturday evening's game.\n\n\"Some people think we only recruit guys who do dances, or who are crazy and outgoing,\" Gillum says. \"That’s part of it, but you’ve got to be able to play. We’ve had 32 players drafted in the last five years and two big leaguers so far.\"\n\nThis is Gillum’s fifth summer leading the Bananas, and he’s marveled as the franchise developed from a local phenomenon to an international one.\n\nGillum’s a baseball lifer. He played in high school and college. For the last 11 years, he’s been an assistant coach at South Mountain CC, where he also is the health and wellness program director, and he’s spent summers coaching in the Cape Cod League and the Texas Collegiate League.\n\nTo coach at those levels, you have to love the game, and Gillum does. He also is an innovator who is willing to try new things, whether it be an infield drill or a way to make baseball more entertaining to fans.\n\nThat’s why he immediately hit it off with Cole when he first interviewed with the Bananas owner. The two had read many of the same books and listened to the same podcasts. Both dream big.\n\n\"I want to impact one million lives,\" Gillum told Cole in that interview.\n\n\"Well,\" Cole responded, \"I think we have a chance to do that together.\"\n\nFor a hardcore baseball coach, or player, adopting a Banana mindset isn’t easy, and it’s not for everyone, Gillum says.\n\nThe Bananas who compete in the summer league aren’t paid salaries, although some have benefitted from NIL deals with the team. Some live with host families, who also provide some meals. Playing in the CPL usually requires a financial commitment by the players and their families.\n\nBecoming a Banana also requires peeling away the protective layer of your comfort zone.\n\nIt’s not normal to wear cowboy boots with your uniform, as Gillum, who is from Oklahoma, does for home games. Or to imitate Tom Hanks’ character in “A League of Their Own.” Or to have a pep band play your walk-up song to the plate, and then actually follow you to the plate. Or to dance in front of 4,000 people, or agree to participate in promotions like “banana in the pants,” in which fans try to toss bananas into the expanded waistbands of players’ pants.\n\nAnd few baseball teams post two lineups in the dugout: one for the hitting order and one for telling players when and where to be to participate in promotions.\n\n\"It was a shock, to say the least,\" says Bill Leroy, recalling when he first joined the Bananas as a summer player five years ago. \"I fell in love with it and I’ve been here since.\"\n\nLeroy played four summers with the collegiate Bananas and joined the organization full time afterward. His duties include helping to run camps for kids — all three scheduled for this summer are sold out — and playing with the Banana Ball team.\n\n\"We don’t take baseball too seriously,\" he said. \"It’s not a job, it’s not a business. It’s a game that kids play and that’s what people love about it.\"\n\nWhat can MLB learn?\n\nWhile the Bananas’ popularity has soared, Major League Baseball continues to struggle to retain its audience. The games move too slow and last too long. To a TikTok generation, and to many others, there is too much downtime and not enough to look at. Connection with the players is minimal.\n\nContrast that with a Bananas game.\n\n\"We greet our fans at 5:30 (for a 7 p.m. game),\" Gillum says. \"We do the ‘Hey Baby’ dance out front and then we give everybody a high five, a handshake or hug. H3 is what we call that.\n\n\"That’s starts the never-forget moment right there, becoming part of the Banana nation and the Banana family.”\n\nCole knows MLB will never adopt some of the “Banana Ball” rules and shtick. The two-hour time limit. The \"showdowns\" that end games that are tied. A player arriving to the batter’s box in a kid’s electric car while “Ridin’” plays over the sound system. Players participating in promotions during games.\n\nBut doing everything you can to fill dead time? To increase the pace of the game? To improve the connection between players and fans? That can be accomplished, Cole says, and baseball could start by eliminating some rules, including some of the unwritten ones.\n\n\"Speed of the game is the easy one to look at,\" Cole says, “but No. 2, it’s allowing players, and encouraging players, to express themselves and to have more fun. If you flip a bat after a home run or do a celebration after a strikeout, you’re not getting drilled the next at bat. And neither is the next guy.\n\n\"I think now we’re in a TikTok world and highlights and fun are encouraged and seen by everybody, and baseball can jump on that. We’re trying to look at every moment of the game, from a hitter’s walkup to a pitching celebration to a scoring celebration, and take them over the top.\"\n\nFor the Bananas, there is no top, at least not an identifiable one because they’ve flipped the game upside down. People can’t wait to see what the folks who brought them a grandma beauty pageant, a stuff-the-porta-potty contest, a first-base coach leaping over a picnic table and chairs and toddler races will come up with next.\n\n\"People who come to the ballpark,\" Leroy says, \"they want to smile, they want to experience joy, and that’s what playing this game is all about. We do everything in the world that we can to take care of that.\"\n\nReach Kent Somers at Kent.Somers@gannett.com. Follow him on twitter @kentsomers.\n\nSupport local journalism.

The museum then surveyed people about what they liked, and many said they would come back for garden events. Winterthur Executive Director David Roselle asked Strand if he'd ever considered a garden exhibit and sent him some ideas.\n\nThey decided to focus on follies, which are structures such as gazebos placed in the garden to add visual order or interest. To up the ante, they created seven to add to the six that H.F. du Pont included in his gardens as he built them.\n\n\"A story in a story,\" Strand says.\n\n\"Follies: Architectural Whimsy in the Garden\" opened April 1, offering visitors a one-mile track they can walk in about 45 minutes or ride through on trams to see the 13 follies, which include a Gothic-inspired tower, a bright-red Ottoman tent, a Chinese house cribbed from an English estate and the estate's own fairie cottage.\n\nA folly is placed in a garden primarily for decoration. But they also provide a focal point as well as amuse the observer, frame a vista or create a destination for visitors, Winterthur says in a release. It offers a far more erudite definition than an online one cited by Google that described a folly as \"a costly ornamental building with no practical purpose, especially a tower or mock-Gothic ruin built in a large garden or park.\"\n\nStrand says Winterthur experts researched its own follies as well as the history of follies, including a trip to English gardens, before settling on what it would add.\n\nPlanners settled on the unlucky number of 13 as the design was taking shape.\n\n\"One of the goals of the project was to get people to go through the garden,\" Strand said. \"We sort of draped them like the numbers around the edge of a clock, spacing them so they weren't too close but not so far apart so it wasn't like, 'Oh, my gosh. We need to walk that far?'\"\n\nWinterthur has more structures that could be called follies, but they are away from the one-mile circuit. And they were careful not to install anything in what Strand calls the \"sacred space\" of places like the March Bank or Sundial Garden.\n\nSome of Winterthur's existing follies are historical, moved by H.F. du Pont from one place to the estate the Latimeria Summerhouse from a Delaware estate and the 1750 House, which was the facade of an old New Castle, Delaware, home.\n\ndu Pont was well traveled, university-educated in horticulture and worked closely on garden design with childhood friend and architect Marian Coffin to place pieces to draw attention to particular views.\n\nThe estate is not alone in incorporating follies in Delaware. A massive folly stretches from side to side in the garden of Nemours Mansion and Estate. Others in the area include a pavilion at the end of a long allee of tall cypress at Gibraltar and the cast iron gazebo at Mt. Cuba's pond.\n\nWinterthur's follies will be placed in a way to give visitors a good look at about 75 acres of the garden and surrounding area, only a small swath of the 1,000-acre estate.\n\nA new app that details the follies and their route uses GPS to tell visitors exactly where they are standing and \"to make it easier for people — well, to make it easier for teenagers — to navigate,\" Strand jokes.\n\nThe new follies include:\n\n• The Needle’s Eye, inspired by an 18th century in Yorkshire, England, and located on pond near the main drive.\n\n• A Neoclassical Folly made to look like the entrance of a Greek temple or public building.\n\n• A Mirrored Folly, which reflects the surrounding Pinetum and is inspired by the covered entrance of the estate's historic train station.\n\n• A brilliant red Ottoman Tent inspired by Turkish tents and similar to 18th-century tents seen in England, France and Northern Europe.\n\n• A gothic tower that mimics the towers, sham castles and fake ruins popular in European landscapes in the 1700s and 1800s.\n\n• A Chinese Pavilion, inspired by the Chinese House at Stowe Landscape Garden in Buckinghamshire, England, but updated with illustrations taking from the wallpaper in Winterthur's Chinese Parlor.\n\n• A Green Folly, built with Winterthur tree trunks, beech twig thatching and other woodland embellishments.\n\nCurator Carol Long is betting on the Neoclassical Folly to provide the best views, both to it and from it, providing a contrast from its formal design and the always evolving natural world.\n\nThe view of it from the Winterhazel Walk now blooming in purples and golds should be wonderful, says Long, who helped plan the exhibit and traveled to England to research follies there.\n\nOnce at the temple, she said, the view of a large white oak tree in the meadow should be inspiring. And from the oak tree looking back at the temple, viewers will have a spectacular view of the garden with the cherry trees and March bank are in full blossom and the azaleas flowering near Mother's Day.\n\nJoining the tour are these seven Winterthur follies:\n\n• The Latimeria Summerhouse, set in the Peony Garden in 1929 after being saved from destruction in Wilmington.\n\n• The Umbrella Seat and Pagoda Gate, which are also from Latimeria and greet visitors as they enter the garden from the Visitor Center.\n\n• The 1750 House, a facade of a historic house from New Castle, Delaware that moved to Winterthur in the 1960s.\n\n• The Brick Lookout, which includes the tin roof and cast iron eagle of a former shed that stood at the entrance court for the museum in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n\n\n• The Bristol Summerhouse, found Sycamore Hill, was re-created by H.F. du Pont based on a structure he had seen at The Lindens in Bristol, Rhode Island.\n\n• The Faerie Cottage, built with repurposed items from the estate in the children's Enchanted Woods.\n\nLong says the planners expect the follies to express themselves differently as the time of day and the seasons change.\n\n\"For example, yesterday coming in to work we were in a fog, and I was so excited to come in and see the needle floating in the pond,\" she says. \"It was that moment when fog was coming in and that gave it a whole different look.\"\n\nThe Neoclassical Folly, for example, will have paths mowed to it through the meadow.\n\n\"When the grasses are tall and the wind is blowing, it will be a special moment looking at the folly and looking away from the folly,\" she said. \"When the goldenrod turns yellow.

Genuine or fake. Real or faux.\n\nThose aren’t just terms ripped out of today’s wildly skewing political headlines. They are the themes in Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library’s “Treasures On Trial: The Art and Science of Detecting Fakes,” an exhibit that runs through Jan. 7.\n\nThe show places a real Chanel outfit, Tiffany lamp and Paul Revere piece of silver, among others, next to a fake and asks what the viewer sees. The premise cleverly steers the exhibition away from a collection of pieces to be cooed over and into an exploration of the kinds of detective work that can confirm a piece’s pedigree, or uncover its nefarious intentions to deceive.\n\nCurated by Linda Eaton, the John L. and Marjorie P. McGraw director of collections at Winterthur, and Colette Loll, founder of Art Fraud insights, “Treasures on Trial” pulls from off-beat to sensational cases that involve famous art houses, a Koch brother (yes, THAT family), and even fraudsters turned celebrity prisoners turned collectible artists in their own right.\n\nThe methods to decide what was real and what wasn’t range from old-fashioned records searches to cutting-edge chemical and other diagnostic work. And the exhibit is so of-the-moment that labels on items have had to be rewritten as events occurred during planning.\n\nBehind every item is a story.\n\nThomas Jefferson’s wine\n\nWhat could be a juicier story than fake wine? Billionaire fine wine collector Bill Koch (brother to the more politically-minded Charles G. and David H. Koch) unknowingly paid millions for bottles of what he believed was rare fine wine sold at auction by Eric Greenberg.\n\nOnce Koch suspected he’d been duped and could prove it, he sued Greenberg, saying Greenberg should have known the wines were fake, partly because he’d filed an insurance claim for fake wines. Koch won and he continued spending millions investigating fake wines. He hopes to break up what he says is a code of silence among sellers and collectors that keep fake wines being resold and recirculated, even after a fraud is discovered.\n\nOne of the bottles of wine that Koch had bought along the line was said to have belonged to Thomas Jefferson. The supposedly Chateau Lafite was in an old-style of blown glass with no label, but Lafitte engraved into the glass. Through research funded by Koch, investigators were able to prove that the engraving on the bottle was carved with a modern dental tool.\n\nA fake Rothko, and more\n\nIn the entrance to the exhibit, a section dubbed “Intent,” a red, black and gold Mark Rothko welcomes visitors. It’s one of many fakes discovered in a scandal involving the Knoedler Gallery in New York City.\n\nCollectors Domenico and Eleanore De Sole were among those who sued the gallery, saying it should have known it was selling forged works when it sold more than 30 paintings said to be by Rothko, Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning.\n\nThe owner claimed she had been duped, too, buying some for her own collection, including the Rothko on exhibit. The De Sole case and others were settled out of court. But in January of this year, Glofira Rosales, a Long Island art dealer who sold the paintings to the Knoedler, was sentenced in the case, causing one of the exhibit labels to have to be changed.\n\nEven Hermes didn’t see the fake\n\nThe “intent” section focuses on makers and sellers (and maybe gifters) of copies, asking what they mean to convey.\n\nA copy of a Chanel suit or Birken bag, both worth thousands, can be made to defraud someone and trick them into paying the real price. But sometimes copies are made and clearly sold as copies that look like the couture originals, sell for less, and there’s no fraud. Sometimes, a copy can be made for an owner who knows it’s fake but later sold by a collector as real, whether the seller knows the truth or not.\n\nVisitors can compare a real Chanel suit with a knockoff, a real Birken bag with two fake ones and examine a Babe Ruth signature and baseball glove. They also can listen to music played by UD violinist Xiang Gao on a violin that’s a real Stradivarius and then one that was sold as a Stradivarius on eBay for $199 and bought by Winterthur for the exhibit. It had a Stradivarius label but clearly was not a Strad.\n\nThe differences between the Birken bags seem fairly clear – but they weren’t to the wife of a famous sportsman. Neither is named. She wanted to sell her handbags after a divorce and was stunned to discover that none of the Birken bags were real, says Eaton. The bag on display even went through the Hermes spa and was reconditioned without the company recognizing as being a fake.\n\n“If the company itself can’t tell it’s a fake, how could the woman even know?” Eaton says.\n\nThe best tale of intent, though, falls to Dutch painter Han van Meegeren, who was accused of treason for selling famous paintings to the Nazis during World War II. He argued that it wasn’t treason because the paintings he sold the Nazis were forgeries he had painted himself.\n\nTo prove it, he painted in court and was convicted of falsification and fraud in 1947. Van Meegeren was given only a year in prison but died of a heart attack the next month.\n\nThe local fakes\n\nThe exhibit comes back several times to the people who were known for perpetrating art fraud, with local examples.\n\nA fake watercolor said to by Andrew Wyeth came up for auction in 1998 and was sent to Wyeth for authentication. He and Mary Landa, the Wyeth collection manager, both said it was fake and returned it. The auction house returned it to the owner, but it sold privately in 2000. The owner tried to auction it again in 2008. It came back to Landa, who recognized it and called the FBI. It was taken out of circulation. Nobody knows who created it, Eaton says. But it illustrates how owners may not ever know the artwork was a fake, or if they did discover it, they quietly tried to resell it to get their money back.\n\nThe cases include work of Robert Lawrence Trotter, a Kennett Square artist who went to jail for making and selling fake primitive art. He bought old frames, use square nails and ultraviolet light to age paintings. Trotter managed to sell more than 50 pieces in New England and the Mid-Atlantic region, telling buyers they had belonged to someone in his family\n\nWhen Trotter was caught, authorities could only recover about a dozen of the paintings. Some people did not want to give them up or turn them in. It turned out that several pieces had been resold, even though auction houses didn’t believe they were real.\n\nWhen Trotter got out of jail, a New Jersey museum asked him to paint a copy of a work that had been lost in a fire.\n\nThe vampire kit\n\nThe exhibit’s second section, where Koch’s wines are discussed, is called “Evidence” and is devoted to the ways an object can be analyzed through its records of ownership, historical accuracy, expert opinion and scientific analysis.\n\nWinterthur checked the solder in two Tiffany dragonfly lamps and discovered one they thought was real was not because the solder between the pieces of glass didn’t contain lead. Real Chinese porcelain imported plates had decals added to them to make them appear to be valuable originals of a set belonging to members of the Society of the Cincinnati, which claimed George Washington among its members.\n\nThe curators use the third section of the exhibit, Proof, to point out difficulties in formally proving something in court.\n\nIt includes a case of three experts offering dramatically different opinions about a Windsor chair; a potter who clearly sold fake antique ceramics but was acquitted; a painting bought online and believed to be by Willem de Kooning but no one will formally sign off on it. It also relates the curious case of John Myatt of Great Britain, who went to jail for forging works. But when he was released, he created a bustling London business painting signed copies that collectors still want today.\n\nThe final section, You Be the Judge, asks visitors to vote whether a painting is a genuine Winslow Homer and whether a Vampire Killing Kit is genuine.\n\nMany people in the 19th Century, in Europe and in America, believed in vampires and wanted protection.\n\nThe case was brought to Winterthur for authentication by the Mercer Museum in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The green felt and wood-lined interior contains bottles, a magnifying glass, a pistol, pliers, silver bullets and a silver cross that could handily double as a stake.\n\nRight now, visitors are voting fake for both.\n\nContact Betsy Price at (302) 324-2884 or beprice@delawareonline.com\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWHAT: “Treasures on Trial”\n\nWHERE: Winterthur Museum, Gardens and Estate, 105 Kennett Pike (Route 52), Greenville\n\nWHEN: Through Jan. 7, 2018; 10 a.m. - 5 p.m., Tuesdays through Sundays.\n\nADMISSION: $20, adults; $18 seniors and students with ID; $5 ages 2-11.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION: (302) 888-4600 or go to www.winterthur.org.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/03/18/winterthur-exhibit-looks-pennsylvania-german-art/24952543/", "title": "Winterthur exhibit looks at Pennsylvania German art", "text": "Betsy Price and Tammy Paolino\n\nGannett\n\nIt's the camels that will grab your attention in Winterthur Museum's new exhibit about the folk art of the Pennsylvania Dutch.\n\nAnyone even slightly familiar with that art, which is common all over the MidAtlantic, will recognize the birds, tulips and hearts in cheery reds, blues and yellows that appear repeatedly in \"A Colorful Folk: Pennsylvania Germans and the Art of Everyday Life.\"\n\nAnd then they will come across the tulip-poplar chest painted by Heinrich Otto for Johannes Miller of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. Flanking the medallion bearing Johannes' name are two camels merrily trodding across a desert.\n\n\"The camels are totally unique,\" says Lisa Minardi, curator of the exhibition. \"It's been attracting a lot of oohs and ahhs from visitors when they come in.\"\n\nNobody knows why Otto used camels, although whimsy is an important aspect of Pennsylvania German art. There was nothing going on in history or literature at the time to make camels a thing of fascination, Minardi says.\n\n\"If I had to guess, I would guess it was coming from a Biblical image or an almanac. I've seen some German almanacs talking about hippopotamuses along with an illustration,\" Minardi said. \"I wish we knew what the artist was thinking.\"\n\n\"A Colorful Folk\" features 125 objects including painted furniture, textiles, metal work, redware pottery and 51 frakturs, which are elaborately illustrated certificates. They were used by the Lutheran, German Reformed, Mennonite, Moravian and Schwenkfelder faiths.\n\nReminiscent of the illuminated manuscripts created by monks, frakturs became popular in Germany in the 1500s, came to the U.S. with immigrants and were made until after World War II. Created with watercolors and elaborate lettering, they often served as birth and marriage certificates, or marked other occasions such as baptisms and graduations. They were usually painted by school masters, and some ministers.\n\nSeveral of the frakturs in \"A Colorful Folk\" came from a collection donated last year by the estate of Pastor Frederick Sheely Weiser. It included 200 textiles and 121 fraktur, bringing Winterthur's collection of fraktur to 500.\n\nMinardi recommends that visitors seek out an ornate fraktur made by Mennonite schoolmaster Andreas Kolb about 1785 in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to see the power and majesty of the works. The religious text is wound through and around birds, flowers and people.\n\nIt is shown side-by-side with a certificate made by Johann Adam Eyer, Kolb's protégé, with motifs copied from the religious text and additional patriotic imagery.\n\nWhile scholars love to argue about whether the illustrations symbolize anything, Minardi says she falls into the camp that says they mostly are just pretty.\n\n\"There are some cases where it's clearly symbolic, like religious iconography, but I think on most pieces, it's just decorative,\" Minardi says.\n\nAlso of interest in the show are the largest fraktur known to exist, a double-sheet spiritual clockworks by Friedrich Krebs measuring nearly 16 by 25 inches, and the only known fraktur made for a Delawarean, Samuel McNulty, who married into a Pennsylvania German family.\n\nFrakturs also are the stars of the show in two Philadelphia exhibits. At the Pennsylvania Museum of Art, \"Drawn with Spirit, Pennsylvania German Fraktur from the Joan and Victor Johnson Collection\" will be on view until April 26. And the Free Library of Philadelphia will offer \"Framing Fraktur\" through July 16.\n\nWinterthur's last comprehensive exhibit focusing on Pennsylvania Dutch art was more than 30 years ago.\n\n\"There's been a lot of new discoveries and a lot of new research since then,\" Minardi says. Many of the objects in the show have never been on display before.\n\nThis exhibit was chosen to follow last year's blockbuster \"Costumes of Downton Abbey\" because the museum hopes to strike a balance between exhibits that have mass appeal, as the Downton one did, and exhibits that feature collections that Winterthur is known for, such as its Pennsylvania Dutch pieces.\n\n\"We are one of the leading institutions for collecting Pennsylvania German decorative arts, so this is very much a core focus for us,\" Minardi says. \"We certainly are hoping that many of the new members who came to us last year because of Downton Abbey are going to come back to see this exhibit.\"\n\n\"A Colorful Folk\" is divided into five sections: Looking Closely, Home, Church, School and Nation. They are meant to reflect the ways that German immigrants, who made up 40 percent of the area's population by 1795, incorporated art and design into their lives.\n\nThe first section introduces the many groups who made up the community and ranged from the minimalist lifestyle of the Amish to the much more plush life of Quakers and Lutherans. The other four sections look at how decorated objects were used every day.\n\nSome of the items are particularly amusing when contrasted with modern life. Those include a privy bag, used to store scrap paper in an outhouse in York County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe home section looks at cooking, gardening, cleaning and clothing. It includes a vignette made to look like a Pennsylvania German parlor, with a cast iron stove in the corner, complete with table, benches, hangings and more so visitors have an idea of what an interior would look like.\n\nOn display is an exquisitely embroidered handkerchief and wedding apron, which were a tradition of the Lancaster County Mennonites. A decorated hand towel that would have been sewn simply for decoration hangs on an original door, with the original hooks.\n\nThe National section looks at objects with political imagery. A tall maple clock is inlaid with images from the Pennsylvania coat of arms. Nearby sites a chest with a painted spread-wing eagle. On top of that is a remarkable carved and painted statue of an by itinerant artist Wilhelm Schimmel of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile a dozen people and institutions loaned objects to the show, all three of the eagle pieces belonged to H.F. du Pont, who founded Winterthur and was known for his love of American decor. The du Pont family in general likes images of eagles because the ship that carried their family to this country was called \"The Eagle.\"\n\nMinardi hopes people leave the exhibit understanding more about the breadth of Pennsylvania German culture.\n\n\"A lot of people think of Pennsylvania German, and they think of the Amish or the Quakers, and this exhibit really tries to show the full gamut of the culture and how these people had a penchant for decorating everything from a simple fork to the weather vanes on top of their houses,\" Minardi says. \"Everything was decorated. There was this love of beauty and design in the simplest of objects used in every day life.\"\n\nContact Betsy Price at (302) 324-2884 or beprice@delawareonline.com.\n\nIf you go\n\nWHAT: \"A Colorful Folk: Pennsylvania Germans and the Art of Everyday Life.\"\n\nWHEN: 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesday-Sunday\n\nWHERE: Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library, 5105 Kennett Pike (Route 52), Greenville\n\nADMISSION: $20 adults; $18 for students and seniors; $5 for ages 2–11.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION: (302) 888-4600; winterthur.org.\n\nUPCOMING CONFERENCE: Fraktur and the Everyday Lives of Germans in Pennsylvania and the Atlantic World, 1683–1850 will take place March 5-8 with international scholars discussing fraktur and topics ranging feaglerom immigration, education and religious practices to music, farming, medicine and the occult.

Try booking a trip to enliven the cooler months and catch a special museum exhibit. Fashion is the theme at the Met with a jewelry exhibit; in Denver with a show on Dior; and in Winterthur, Delaware — in a former du Pont estate — where costumes from the show \"The Crown\" are featured. Elsewhere, find exhibits on rock ‘n’ roll on television, animals that glow, airmail, European art and more.\n\n'Dior: From Paris to the World' at the Denver Art Museum\n\nThrough March 3, 2019\n\nDon your finest frock: Dior is coming to Denver this winter — in the form of an art museum exhibit covering more than 70 years of the designer’s legacy and influence. \"Dior: From Paris to the World\" features 150 haute couture dresses, accessories, photos, runway videos, original sketches and archival material. Many of these items have never been seen outside of Europe. The show is being called the first major U.S. retrospective of the House of Dior and it will subsequently travel to other cities after its Denver premiere.\n\n'Stay Tuned: Rock on TV' at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland\n\nThrough March 2019\n\nHaving both influenced the American zeitgeist around the same time, television and rock ‘n’ roll are inextricably linked. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’s new exhibit turns back the clock to the 1940s — when rock first became a television fixture — and continues through today. The multifloor, multimedia exhibit includes archival footage, original artifacts and new interviews. It’s narrated by Mike Meyers, Martha Quinn, Kelly Clarkson, Micky Dolenz, Kevin Eubanks, Cyndi Lauper, Paul Shaffer and Darlene Love. Keep an eye out for these highlights: original stage designs from the Beatles’ \"Ed Sullivan Show\" appearance, Sonny and Cher's outfits, and CeeLo Green’s Michael Jackson-inspired jacket worn on \"The Voice.\"\n\n'Creatures of Light: Nature's Bioluminescence' at the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science in Miami\n\nThrough April 21, 2019\n\nFrom fireflies lighting up the summer nights to glowing deep-sea dwellers, bioluminescent creatures capture the imaginations of young and old. These light-producing organisms are the focus of the Frost Museum’s \"Creatures of Light\" exhibit. Guests will move through various environments meant to expose them to the habitats of bioluminescent mushrooms, glowworms, fish and corals. Live flashlight fish, along with other living examples, are part of it too. A composer created a soundtrack to set the scene throughout this immersive exhibit.\n\n'Somalis + Minnesota' at the Minnesota History Center in St. Paul\n\nThrough June 9, 2019\n\nFollowing the civil war in Somalia in 1991, Minnesota became home to the largest population of Somalis in the United States. Now, the Minnesota History Center, in partnership with the Somali Museum of Minnesota, celebrates the contributions and successes of Somali immigrants to the Gopher State in a special exhibition. “Many Somali people, especially youth, don’t know about their past because of the hardships they have faced fleeing the civil war,” said Osman Ali, director of the Somali Museum of Minnesota. “Seeing themselves in this exhibit will help them learn about their past, but also help them know that they belong here in Minnesota, a place they consider their second home.” The story is told through artifacts, photos and first-hand accounts.\n\n'Airmail to Email' at the College Park Aviation Museum in College Park, Maryland\n\nThrough December 2019\n\nTo celebrate the 100th anniversary of U.S. Post Office Airmail Service, the College Park Aviation Museum and the College Park Airport (which just so happens to be the world’s oldest continuously operating airport) have joined forces to recognize the days of sending mail through the skies. At the Aviation Museum (which is a Smithsonian Affiliate), see photographs, artifacts from the airmail era to the beginnings of commercial aviation, and interactive features.\n\n'Ralph Steadman: A Retrospective' at the University of Kentucky Art Museum in Lexington\n\nFeb. 12 — May 5, 2019\n\nIllustrator Ralph Steadman is known for his fantastical cartoons and caricatures, his work with iconic journalist Hunter S. Thompson, and images based on literary classics \"Alice in Wonderland,\" \"Treasure Island\" and \"Animal Farm\" Since he’s also known for work covering the Kentucky Derby, it’s fitting that the University of Kentucky Art Museum is one of only three American museums to host a touring exhibition dedicated to his work. It spans his 60-year career through more than 100 artworks from the 1950s,when he was a student, through today.\n\n'Selections from the Schorr Collection' at the Phoenix Art Museum\n\nThrough Dec. 29, 2019\n\nConsidered a \"museum without walls,\" the Schorr Collection isn’t on permanent display in a museum, but sends works to venues around the world, with the intention of making masterpieces more accessible. More than half of the collection is currently on loan in the U.K. and U.S. The Phoenix Art Museum is one lucky recipient of a long-term loan from the collection that features Old Master and 19th-century paintings. The exhibit includes works by Antony Van Dyck, Bartolomeo Manfredi, Gerrit van Honthorst and more.\n\n'Jewelry: The Body Transformed' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City\n\nThrough Feb. 24, 2019\n\nThe Met’s jewelry exhibit this winter is a treat for the eyes. The museum has pulled more than 230 items from its collections to address this ancient and modern art form. It features headdresses, ear ornaments, brooches, belts, necklaces and rings created between 2600 B.C. and today. The exhibit also includes sculptures, paintings, prints and photographs related to the jewelry — and important moments in jewelry history — in the exhibit.\n\n'Ai Weiwei: Life Cycle' at the Marciano Art Foundation in Los Angeles\n\nThrough March 3, 2019\n\nLos Angeles has been the lucky home to a few Ai Weiwei exhibitions since last fall, including at the Marciano Art Foundation, which is hosting a new work by the Chinese artist and human rights activist. \"Life Cycle\" is being described as “a sculptural response to the global refugee crisis.” The large-scale piece involves an inflatable boat created using a traditional Chinese kite-making technique that employs bamboo. Mythic figures made with silk and bamboo are suspended above. Two more iconic Weiwei works — \"Sunflower Seeds\" (2010) and \"Spouts\" (2015) — will also be on view.\n\n'The Lure of Dresden: Bellotto at the Court of Saxony' at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas\n\nFeb. 10, 2019 — April 28, 2019\n\nFrom the 1700s through World War II (when it was nearly destroyed completely), Dresden was one of the great cities of Europe. Artist Bernardo Bellotto grew famous for his large-scale paintings of the German city completed in the 18th century, when he was the court painter for the elector of Saxony, Frederick Augustus II. “These enormous and expansive paintings cannot be fully appreciated unless you are among them,” said Eric M. Lee, director of the Kimbell. Thanks to a loan from the Gemäldegalerie of the Dresden State Art Collections, Bellotto’s work can be seen in Fort Worth this winter.\n\n'Costuming The Crown' at Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library in Winterthur, Delaware\n\nMarch 30, 2019 — Jan. 5, 2020\n\nThe Netflix original series \"The Crown\" has reignited interest in England’s royal family, while earning 26 Emmy nominations and multiple Golden Globes Awards in its first two seasons. The streaming show, which dramatizes the history of Queen Elizabeth II’s early reign, features carefully fabricated replicas of the dresses, uniforms, crowns and tiaras that are associated with the family. Coming to Winterthur, Delaware — in a former du Pont estate that is now a museum — this winter is the first major exhibition of costumes from the show. There will be 40 costumes on display, as well as exhibits on how the show’s costume designers painstakingly recreate everything from King George’s medals and military ribbons to Queen Elizabeth’s dresses.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/03/winterthur-museum-director-steps-down-position/4920450001/", "title": "Winterthur Museum director resigns after three years", "text": "The director and chief executive officer of Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library, one of the state's most well-known tourist attractions, has resigned from the position after a three-year stint. Her last day is May 31.\n\nChris Strand, director of the Garden & Estate, will immediately take over the role of interim CEO. Strand has been a director at Winterthur for 16 years.\n\nCarol B. Cadou, in a letter to Winterthur employees on Monday morning obtained by Delaware Online/The News Journal, wrote that the museum's board of trustees accepted her resignation.\n\nCadou wrote that she was leaving the position because of family reasons and would be \"returning to our family home in Bethesda, Maryland.\"\n\nCOVID-19 has caused financial pressures for museums across the nation.\n\nIn July 2020, under Cadou's helm, Winterthur laid off employees in four divisions with its public safety department receiving the biggest cuts.\n\nDocuments obtained by Delaware Online/The News Journal showed that 27 positions were eliminated.\n\nJob losses came from Winterthur's museum engagement, facilities services and visitor engagement divisions, as well as its public safety department.\n\nMore:Giddyup: Point-to-Point set to return in 2021\n\nAll were regular, non-seasonal and non-temporary employees.\n\nCadou also took a salary cut, the museum said, but it would not say how much.\n\nCadou in July 2020 told Delaware Online/The News Journal that the pandemic has had an \"absolute devastating effect\" on Delaware's arts and culture industry that contributes $1 billion to Delaware’s economy.\n\nWinterthur Museum, Garden & Library, off Kennett Pike between Greenville and Centreville, is centered on a grand 175-room mansion on a 1,000-acre estate in “Chateau Country,” Delaware’s most exclusive region and for generations the home of extended members of the du Pont family.\n\nIn June 2020, Winterthur had 334 employees. It also is supported by 350 volunteers who serve for free in many departments, supporting paid staff.\n\nCadou has been director and CEO of Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library since May 2018. She was the former senior vice president of Historic Preservation and Collections at George Washington’s Mount Vernon, 13 miles south of Washington, D.C.\n\nCadou succeeded David P. Roselle, who retired after 10 years as executive director, the longest term of any Winterthur chief executive.\n\nShe seemed to be in for the long haul at Winterthur.\n\nA November 2020 article in the New York Times detailed how a Federal-style brick building on the property known as Chandler Farm was renovated and redesigned for the Cadou family with the help of Thomas Jayne, a New York-based interior designer.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Jayne said Winterthur was a major source of inspiration for his work, did pro bono work and called the house “a great opportunity to give back.”\n\nCadou wrote a Sunday opinion article for Delaware Online/The News Journal inviting visitors to return to Winterthur.\n\n\"We are delighted that this year — unlike 2020 — there are no restrictions and everyone can enjoy the gardens in person, as well as our museum galleries.''\n\nIn the opinion piece, Cadou also said she was looking forward to 2022, \"when we will unveil a special exhibition, “Jacqueline Kennedy and Henry Francis du Pont: From Winterthur to the White House.”\n\nBut in her departing letter to employees Monday, Cadou said her husband, Chris Cadou, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park, was returning to the campus in August after working from home during the pandemic.\n\nCadou wrote that the daily commute of four hours would be a hardship for the family.\n\nLaying off employees:Winterthur cuts jobs as museum reopens after 4-month shutdown\n\n\"Chris and I have made the challenging decision that the strain on our family and particularly our children, Lilly and William, will be too great for the long commute to continue.

Booth, chair of the board of trustees in a prepared statement. “We especially appreciate her role in leading the institution through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nobody could have worked harder or with more determination for Winterthur’s success than she did.”\n\nOne of Winterthur Museum's biggest fundraisers, its Point-to-Point steeplechase event, returns on May 30, after being shelved last year.\n\nThe pandemic rendition of Point-to-Point will include pod seating for up to 10 tailgating-guests per tent, race director Jill Abbott told Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nAll attendees are required to bring masks and wear them wherever they can’t maintain a safe distance of 6 feet from others outside of their group/household.\n\nStaff reporter Andre Lamar contributed to this story.

The Delaware State Fair turns 100: One of Delaware's largest events of the year is turning the big 1-0-0! The Harrington-based fair will host a centennial celebration throughout its run in 2019. Want a jump-start on the anniversary fun? Hit the fairgrounds Jan. 12 for the fair's centennial license plate auction at 3 p.m. Fifty-four of the special Delaware plates that bear the state fair 100th anniversary logo will be up for grabs.\n\n2. \"Hamilton\" does Philly: The smash Broadway musical from Lin-Manuel Miranda heads south to Philadelphia's Forrest Theatre from Aug. 27 to Nov. 17. While the subscription packages are already sold out, the rest of the tickets have not yet gone on sale. If you don't want to throw away your shot, go to kimmelcenter.org and sign up for ticket updates to be among the first to know.\n\n3. The Franklin Institute debuts \"Marvel: Universe of Super Heroes\": Kids of all sizes will like this trip to the museum. Opening April 13, this new exhibit will offer up more than 300 artifacts from Marvel Comics, including pages, costumes and props. Organizers say to expect \"a fully immersive design with life-size scenes straight from the comic world,\" rare comics and artwork, including original art for Spider-Man’s origin story. They add: \"Interactive elements including the opportunity to travel through the mysterious mirror dimension of Doctor Strange, digitally transform into Iron Man and pose for selfies alongside life-size representations of Black Panther, Spider-Man and other iconic Marvel characters.\"\n\n4. The opening of Wilmington's DE.CO Food Hall: When will this happen? Your guess is as good as ours. The $3.5-million project — a collaboration between Wilmington's Buccini/Pollin Group and Seawall Development, a company that developed Baltimore’s R. House food hall — was supposed to be open by late 2018. Heck, in August they floated in a newsletter that \"almost all of the stalls are full with chefs working on building their menus and kitchens, but we can't say who just yet!\" Whenever it does open at the DuPont Building (10th and Orange), the 12,000-square-foot space, able to seat 250, should especially be buzzing during the downtown lunch rush. Eight different kitchens are expected, along with a bar. Officials say it certainly won't be open by spring, but chef announcements should start riolling out in the first squartyer of the year.\n\n5. “Costuming THE CROWN”opens at Winterthur: Opening March 30 and running into early 2020, Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library will host a dream exhibition for fans of the Netflix series \"The Crown.\" Get up close and personal with 40 costumes from the show, which snagged an Emmy Award for Claire Foy, who played Queen Elizabeth II on the program. (The show returns for a third season in 2019.) Everything from Queen Elizabeth’s coronation robe to Princess Margaret’s wedding dress will be represented.\n\n6. The opening of U.S. 301: The new cashless toll road is expected to open Jan.1. If you don't have E-Z Pass, you'll get a bill in the mail because your license plate is scanned as you drive by. The new $636 million interstate, which runs 15 miles from Del. 1 to the Delaware/Maryland border, has four lanes. More than 14,000 vehicles are expected each day when cars start rumbling down the long-awaited roadway.\n\n7. Opening of Wilmington's 76ers Fieldhouse: If you have been counting the days until you could finally root for the Delaware Blue Coats in their new Wilmington home, keep counting. The NBA G league team, formerly the Delaware 87ers, had hoped to christen the 76ers Fieldhouse on U.S. 13 on Jan. 4. Construction delays at the $30 million, 2,500-person arena have pushed that moment back to Jan. 23. In the meantime, the Blue Coats will play Jan. 9 and 11 at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.\n\n8. Food Bank of Delaware moves: The nonprofit agency that fights hunger in Delaware is now ready to make the leap. The Food Bank of Delaware will move its warehouse from a 42,500-square-foot facility in Ogeltown to a new 80,000-square foot home at 222 Lake Drive in Pencader Corporate Center in nearby Glasgow. They purchased the building three years ago and are currently retrofitting it. It will also house their culinary school, which will be able to double in size. Donate at fbd.org to help fill the new warehouse.\n\n9. Delaware Art Museum's new Loper exhibit: The work of late Wilmington artist Edward Loper Sr. will sit alongside that of his son Edward Loper Jr. for a new exhibit called \"The Loper Tradition.\" Starting March 23, their paintings will be paired for the first time, drawn from the collections of the Delaware Art Museum, other public institutions, local corporations and private individuals. The elder Loper, who died in 2011 at 95, broke racial barriers as the first African-American to have a painting accepted at what is now the Delaware Art Museum.\n\n10. New-look Firefly Music Festival debuts with AEG as sole owner: Four years after concert giant AEG partnered with Firefly's founders Red Frog Events, AEG bought out Red Frog earlier this year and is running the show solo. Its first big move — announcing the 2019 Dover lineup — was somewhat underwhelming, with plenty of fans griping about the lineup headed by Panic! at the Disco, Travis Scott and Post Malone. (Not that whining about the lineup doesn't happen every year.) The real verdict will come June 21-23 when The Woodlands fills up and the beats start to drop.\n\n11. The 40th anniversary of Yuletide at Winterthur: The annual holiday tour of Henry Francis du Pont’s mansion marks its fourth decade starting in November. This past year's tour included everything from an 18-room dollhouse mansion to a display of antique Santas.\n\n12. Cupid’s Undie Run at The Queen: Get your tighty-whities ready for a good cause. You're invited to prance around Wilmington's Market Street in your underwear on Feb. 16 to raise money for The Children's Tumor Foundation, which fights the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis. Wilmington joins 39 other cities as an estimated 12,000 pantsless people will run nationwide, leaving little to the imagination. Registration costs $35 (cupids.org) to join the fun at The Queen in Wilmington.\n\n13. Delaware Theatre Company does \"Honk!: An Ugly Ducking Musical\": The average age of the theatergoer at DTC will drop a bit April 17 to May 12 when this musical adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Ugly Duckling\" comes to Wilmington to delight the kiddos. \"Honk!,\" which has had more than 8,000 productions in its 25-year history, won the 2000 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical.\n\n14. A decision on the future of Dewey Beach's northbeach: It's been more than two months since we were supposed to have a decision on the waterfront club owned by Dewey Beach Lions Club. A membership vote was held in late October to determine who would run the spot in early 2020 when the current lease runs up. Why is everyone so interested? Not only is it an iconic, hard-partying bar that draws major crowds in the summer, but two of the town's biggest bar owners are gunning for the property, pitting current owners Highway One Group against the team from The Starboard. Dewey Beach Lions Club has not returned calls for an update since the October vote.\n\n15. Sea Witch Halloween & Fiddlers' Festival turns 30: The three-day free Halloween festival that brings everyone back to the beach for boos instead of barbecues will have its 30th anniversary Oct. 25-27. Rehoboth and Dewey beaches will be filled with families for the weekend's costume parades, bonfires, broom-tossing contests, beach games and fiddlers' festival.\n\n16. Brandywine Creek State Park unveils “social hikes”: Have you ever wanted to go for a hike and had no one to join you? Well, this is just for you. The park has a new offering called \"social hikes\" starting Jan. 5 at 1 p.m. The free event starts at the Nature Center where everyone gathers before heading off for an hourlong walk and conversation is encouraged. Two others are currently scheduled: Jan. 19 and Feb. 2.\n\n17. OperaDelaware’s 2019 Festival: This year's theme is \"In Opera We Trust\" with a trio of legal-themed shows April 27 to May 4. First up is \"Dead Man Walking,\" based on the book Sister Jean Prejean. Written by Jake Heggie, this is different than the film adaption but still focuses on an inmate on death row and his spiritual adviser. The second is \"Scalia/Ginsburg\" by composer Derrick Wang. The one-act opera delves into the friendship between Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the late Antonin Scalia. To round out the festival, check out Gilbert & Sullivan's courtroom comedy \"Trial By Jury.\"\n\n18. Middletown gets its own Two Stones Pub: That's right. The guys behind 2SP Brewing Co. — the brewery that recently made a collaborative coffee stout with Wawa — are opening their fourth brewpub in Delaware. Located in Hedgelawn Plaza off U.S. 301, owners say the taps will be flowing at the 4,766-square-foot, 200-person watering hole and restaurant by March or April. The Middletown location will join other Delaware Two Stones Pub locations in Hockessin, Brandywine Hundred and the Newark area.\n\n19. Dover International Speedway celebrates 50 years of NASCAR: It was July 6, 1969 when NASCAR driver Richard Petty won the first NASCAR race on the Monster Mile. For 2019, the track will feature two NASCAR triple-header weekends (May 3-5 and Oct. 4-6). Every Monster Trophy in 2019 will be gold-colored as a symbol of the 50th and both weekends will feature special appearances by legendary drivers, free concerts and an expanded game-filled FanZone to help mark the occasion.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Open through Jan. 11, the exhibition features birds big and small, including the swans guarding the flooded fern floor, cardinals with 30-inch wing spans swarming a lightly flocked tree and delicate blown-glass German avian ornaments.\n\n\"Birds are a symbol of joy and peace during the holiday and they have such a long tradition of being part of Christmas,\" says Jim Sutton, display designer at Longwood. \"You see them on cards. The Germans were blowing glass ornaments of birds. Doves are used at Christmas. There's a partridge in a pear tree. It seemed like a really good connection.\"\n\nThe Longwood display is one of many traditional holiday displays that generations of Delaware-area families take their children to. They include Yuletide at Winterthur, A Hagley Christmas, Christmas at Nemours, A Brandywine Christmas at the Brandywine River Museum of Art and the Historic Houses of Odessa's annual decor designed around a book or book character.\n\nThe exhibitions also serve to bring both people and cash to the institutions.\n\nAt Winterthur, May and December are the busiest months, said director David Roselle.\n\n\"Happily, a portion of December's busy is due it being a time when many friends honor Winterthur by making gifts,\" he said. \"The success of the 'Downton Abbey' exhibition, and the fact that it will only be on view for a few more weeks, have built on our strong holiday foundation to result in our highest December visitation in memory. We are very pleased by this December's attendance and we hope that many of these visitors will return to enjoy the spectacular Winterthur gardens in the spring.\"\n\nWhile Longwood's outdoor sites are festooned with more than 500,000 lights, including a fountain show set to Christmas music, the centerpiece of A Longwood Christmas is the tour through the four-acre heated conservatory. Inside, 16,000 plants, including poinsettias, amaryllis, lilies, begonias, cyclamens and hydrangeas, created merry scene after merry scene.\n\nGreeting guests at Longwood as they step into the east conservatory door this year are a pair of arrangments, complete with feathers, manzanita, glass ornaments and faux branches. They stand in a reflecting pool, which is surrounded by lighted, flocked trees, all set up to lead the eye to the red cardinal tree in the distance.\n\nThe cardinal tree is a 23-foot tall Douglas, sprayed with a medium flock, to better set off the ornaments. It's a technique that anyone can use at home, Sutton says. While Longwood uses a machine it bought last year that makes flock of ground white paper, cans of flock are available at most stores carrying holiday ornaments, he notes.\n\nLongwood bought the cardinals, which have 30-inch wing spans, because they needed big birds so they could be easily seen from points around the east conservatory. \"Even though they seem large, their scale was perfect,\" Sutton says.\n\nGuests walk from there into the winter wonderland of the fern passages. The floor of the room is flooded, providing maximum reflection. Two circles of lights sit on the floor in the middle of the room, with curtains of lights hanging from the ceiling. Two rows of lighted boxwood topiaries run the length of the room, and the display space is banked all the way around a ribbon of pink poinsettias.\n\nAt one end of the fern floor stands the pair of swans, made from preserved lemonleaf over a metal frame made by Longwood's metal shop. When the exhibit is over, Longwood gardeners will remove the leaves and save the frame, perhaps to grow plants over.\n\nAt the other end is the music room, which this year is opulently decorated with jeweltone colors for a peacock masquerade ball. A huge blue piece of paper art hanging above a table set with peacock plates is designed and cut by Melinda Swain. At one glance, it looks like hanging feathers. At another, it looks like plants. At another, it's an abstract piece of art. It was meant to look like a hanging garden, Sutton says.\n\nAcross the room is a mantel covered with a garland of jewel-toned bulbs. Nearby, a huge tree decorated in the same color palette slowly spins on a pedestal. The plates and many of the ornaments were bought last year at Christmas, when Sutton already knew what he would be doing for the 2014 display.\n\n\"It just really speaks to the holidays,\" he says.\n\nThe fern passages feature orchid chandeliers, made to look like bird nests, with orchids spilling out the top. To create them, Longwood craftsmen first created the baskets, lined them, lit them and then filled them with orchids, which seem to like the arrangement.\n\n\"Orchids like having their feet warmed,\" Sutton says.\n\nThe acacia passage leading to the greenhouses is lined with hanging blue hydrangea kissing balls, made from dried blue hydrangea.\n\nTurn right into the Mediterranean room and you'll find a tree that was a play on the bird of paradise. It's filled with natural material, particularly in blue and orange colors.\n\nOther trees in the greenhouses include 12 children's trees decorated by different schools, including four from Delaware, and small trees featuring handblown German glass ornaments. Tucked between them are upcycled bird baths, made from crystal bowls and cake plates by Wilmington artist Al Dixon.\n\nA stunning tableau features the branches of a crepe myrtle that were painted bright red, planted in concrete and then hung with 100 bird houses made of turned wood by artist Jim Bewley. About 200 of those bird houses are on sale in the gift shop for $60 and up.\n\nIn the silver garden, artist Kat McCullough created penguins made out of pinecones to hang on the white tree there, and then learned papier mache to create life-size penguins to slide down the rocks.\n\nBack in the orangerie, where the conservatory tour ends, walkways crisscross two large expanses of lawn. Each walkway has a different color pattern with white, pink or red poinsettias on display. In the center walk are two 18-foot trees covered in live poinsettias and red glass ornaments.\n\nStriking arrangements of branches of holly berries from a variety called winter berry, which drops its leaves early, are paired with begonias, blue coleus and more.\n\n\"We try to do different combinations of plant matter and really make the beds beautiful and interesting with different holiday colors,\" Sutton says. \"People want to see poinsettias at Christmas, but it's fun to mix them up with other plants.\"\n\nHuge topiary balls on the ground in the orangerie feature a combination of begonias and branches of manzanita, which are sprayed white and look like lacy coral poking out of the begonias. Above the lawn sway huge balls filled with white poinsettias, giving the room a textured, layered feeling.\n\nNear the north door is a set of trees designed for families, each of which tells a children's tale. The first is the ugly duckling turning into a swan, the second is a white swan and the last is the goose who laid the golden egg.\n\nReaction from guests has been gratifying, Sutton says.\n\nAs the exhibit was being planned and now has run for a few weeks, he's been interested to find that many guests connect to their own love of or experience with birds, including the cardinals and blue jays that frequent their home bird feeders. They mention chickadees, owls and the rise of the American Eagle. They talk about many kinds of doves.\n\n\"I think the thing that appeals to a lot of people is that there's just such a level of detail,\" Sutton says. \"There's a theme they like. There's something for all ages. Most people like birds have had a very good reaction to birds and have a good memory of watching birds and feeding birds, so it's been very well received, and it was fun to do.\"\n\nSutton won't reveal the 2015 theme, but will say it will have a color palette of blues, silvers and whites.\n\nContact Betsy Price at (302) 324-2884 or beprice@delawareonline.com\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWHAT: A Longwood Christmas\n\nWHERE: Longwood Gardens, 1001 Longwood Road, near Kennett Square, Pennsylvania\n\nWHEN: Through Jan. 11.\n\nTICKETS: Tickets must be bought for specific times.

The tent, which is already sold out, will have it all: Dogfish beers and spirits, a selection of the brewery's new line of bratwusts and a seafood bar with shrimp cocktail, crab claws and oyster shooters.\n\nOver at Twin Lakes, it's their first year with a VIP tent and $100 tickets are still available here. They will have a full selection of Twin Lakes brews will be available, plus baked ziti with meatballs, Greek salad and Twin Lakes cupcakes for dessert. There will also be an acoustic performance by veteran Delaware jam band Montana Wildaxe.\n\n\"It's called Pint-to-Pint now,\" jokes Carol Tedesco, Twin Lakes' administrator and chief financial officer. \"We're very excited. You have no idea. You can throw a stone and hit the brewery from there.\"\n\nNot to be left out of the up-and-coming beer contingent, Point-to-Point officials also now offer Arizona-made Bowser Beer, a non-alcoholic, non-carbonated \"beer\" for dogs in the steeplechase's re-hydration tent. There will even be a \"chugging contest\" for the doggies. (No joke.)\n\nJill Abbott, Point-to-Point race director, says Dogfish approached the event last year about hosting its own tent. They came up with a new sponsorship model that allowed the beer company to cut a sponsorship check and run its own VIP area. Twin Lakes will do the same this year.\n\nFor those who like Point-to-Point's more noble traditions, this year's event will have a \"Downton Abbey\" theme tied to the museum's popular \"Costumes of Downton Abbey\" exhibition, which kicked off last month and runs through Jan. 4, 2015.\n\nThere will also be the horse races, a parade of antique carriages, stickhorse races for the kids and a beefed-up antique car show on the 1,000-acre former estate of Henry Francis du Pont.\n\nFor those with less refined tastes, there will be plenty of cornhole games breaking out at tailgates across the grounds, along with a few additional chugging contests if history is any guide. (And it won't be that non-alcoholic beer, neither.)\n\nWhen the gates close at 4 p.m., the after-parties begin at bars and homes all across the greater Wilmington area.\n\nSanta Fe Wilmington on Pennsylvania Avenue will be the site of a Point-to-Point after-party, which will also double as the restaurant's Cinco de Mayo festival.\n\n\"We'll have people coming in with their Point-to-Point hats mixing with people in their sombreros,\" says Javier Acuna, Santa Fe Wilmington's owner. \"It all blends in really well.\"\n\nThe restaurant has regularly closed its parking lot, which can hold up to 1,000 people at a time, for large-scale events since opening in 2010. Earlier this month, the first Wilmington Craft Beer Festival was held there.\n\nAcuna says his restaurant will host more festivals and outdoor parties, which help lure in new customers and give visibility to the restaurant, which is tucked away in a shopping center at N. Union St. and Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\"There's a lot of people who like to go out and are tired of doing the same thing all the time,\" he says.\n\nAcuna also owns the Santa Fe restaurant on Main Street in Newark and will be opening two more locations in Delaware soon, including a taqueria on Wilmington's Riverfront next month.\n\nPoint-to-Point will not only give Wilmington bars and restaurants a late afternoon Sunday bump on Sunday, but Centereville's Buckley's Tavern will also be hopping.\n\nIt's usually their biggest afternoon of the year, business-wise. And with the restaurant's new rooftop bar opening tied to Point-to-Point, general manager Chuck Lewis knows he will be busy.\n\nFor the first time under new ownership, Buckley's will also offer new $15.95 Point-to-Point to go box lunches that customers can call ahead and reserve. Ham and Gruyère cheese, a turkey BLT and a curried chicken salad sandwich are all available and come with a salad and a penne pasta side.\n\n\"We have all these people from Pennsylvania driving right by,\" Lewis says, \"so we thought we'd take advantage of that.\"\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: 36th annual Point-to-Point\n\nWhen: Sunday.

It’s only one sign that the American master, whose 100th birthday would have been Wednesday, used Helen and George Sipala and their home — which once belonged to illustrator Howard Pyle — as subjects for 20 years starting in the 1980s.\n\nThe Sipalas also have the painter’s apron Wyeth wore while working, complete with a napkin still folded up in the pocket, and a pair of black velvet slippers that Wyeth gave them after depicting them in one work.\n\n“I don’t have size 10 feet,” George Sipala told Wyeth. But he kept the shoes.\n\nThe Sipalas are among dozens of people in the Chadds Ford area who posed as models for Wyeth, who died Jan. 16, 2009.\n\n“I still miss him,” says Dee Parker, an elementary art school teacher who was friends with the family, worked as a nanny for them and posed for several works.\n\nWyeth’s work is the subject of “Andrew Wyeth: In Retrospect,” an exhibit tied to the painter’s 100th birthday at the Brandywine River Museum of Art. It’s open daily until Sept. 17.\n\nSTORY:Andrew Wyeth retrospective in Chadds Ford brings famous, rarely-seen paintings together\n\nIt was hard to tell what drew Wyeth’s attention when he chose people as models, says Joyce Hill Stoner, a conservator with Winterthur Museum who worked with Wyeth and his paintings for about 30 years.\n\nShe notes that Wanda M. Corn, an American art and cultural historian who specialized in the late 19th- to mid-20th centuries movements, called Wyeth a “metaphoric realistic,” meaning that he chose people who reminded him of some aspect of life or part of history he was interested in.\n\nThe Sipalas\n\nHelen Sipala was looking out her kitchen window when she spotted a man in her backyard. His head kept bobbing up and down, and he seemed to be looking down at something. She decided he must be an artist and let him continue his work. A few hours later, there was a knock on the door.\n\n“I’m Andrew Weyth,” he told them. “I don’t know if you know me.” They knew who he was, they told him.\n\nHe told them he’d like to paint more of the house.\n\n“And then he took over their lives,” Wyeth’s son, Jamie, wisecracks before breaking into a knowing laugh when he’s told the story.\n\nAnd Jamie is right. Andrew Wyeth spent a lot of time in the Italianate house built in the late 1800s, mostly in the kitchen where his chair still faces the window.\n\nHe walked around looking at the way the light played in different rooms, sketching various things. He painted the house itself and even painted the Sipalas in bed. That bed has since been moved to another room, but they have it. He would take away elements or add elements, such as a mermaid in a snowfall, or a hill that wasn’t there.\n\nThey also met and entertained a number of celebrities who were interested in Wyeth and art. Comedienne Phyllis Diller, an avid artist herself, once gave the couple a drawing as a thank you for the dinner she had with them and Wyeth.\n\nThe last time the Sipalas saw Wyeth was a week before he died.\n\nToday, they have put the house up for sale because it’s too big for them. Many of the rooms are festooned with prints of art work by Wyeth, or photos related to him. One is filled with prints of Wyeth’s paintings of Helga Testorf, which caused a ruckus in the art world when they were revealed in 1986. She is nude in most of them.\n\n“That’s why we call it ‘the naked room,’” Helen says.\n\nPainting his sons\n\nWyeth’s son Nicholas inevitably ended up in his father’s studio when he came home from school.\n\n“One day I was sitting in my winter jacket and he said, ‘Nicky, just stay there a minute. I want to do a quick sketch.’ I ended up posing for three months. Just a quick drawing.”\n\nBut daddy knew how to keep his son’s attention.\n\n“He was interested in airplanes from the first World War and I built model airplanes back then. And he always promised to take me to a hobby shop afterward,” Nicholas remembers.\n\nAndrew Wyeth helped Nicholas build his first model, a Supermarine Spitfire.\n\n“I would come down in the morning and he would have built a wing or part of the fuselage that evening,” Nicolas remembers.\n\nHis father didn’t ask him to sit absolutely still for hours, like he’s said to have done with other models.\n\n“It wasn’t stationary,” Nicholas says.\n\nHe was not seduced by the art muse and jokes that he’s the black sheep of the family because his brother, father, grandfather, aunts, uncle and cousins are artists. He went into the art business.\n\nSTORY:Museums get social with beer gardens, music and games\n\nIt started one summer after high school when his mother, Betsy, asked if he planned to mow lawns that summer. She suggested that he sell a new series of prints his father had published. That would lead to a job in galleries in New York City and then one of his own, specializing in Wyeth work.\n\nNicholas’s brother, Jamie, didn’t like posing for other people. He wanted to paint himself. But posing for his father allowed him to get a good look at his father’s work processes.\n\n“What did fascinate me is what a wild painter he was,” Jamie says. “He’d throw things, spill water, drop paint on the floor or the ground. You know, everybody’s perception is that Andrew Wyeth started at one corner and worked across. He was a wild painter.”\n\nJamie and Nicholas laugh when told about the paint that’s still on the banisters at the Sipala’s house.\n\n“My mother used to get furious when daddy would work in the house,” Jamie says. “She would say, ‘Andy! Look at the mess you created!’”\n\n“She would put newspaper down and what not,” Nicholas remembers.\n\nWatching his father paint did not prompt Jamie’s focus on art, he says. It was an unconscious decision, he says. When he was a boy, he would draw scenes from books he’d read or movies he’d seen. And when his father would sit or lie on the floor in front of the fire and paint small watercolors for Christmas cards, Jamie would paint his own. That was really the start of his art lessons, Jamie says.\n\nSTORY:5 grand tales behind Winterthur's exhibit of treasures\n\nNicholas reminds Jamie about a painting their father did that showed bags of apples.\n\n“Do you remember that wonderful story about the man who came and thought you and I were in those bags,” Nicholas asks. They both laugh.\n\n“Let ’em out!” Jamie wisecracks. And they laugh again.\n\nBecause Andrew Wyeth’s studio was in the family home, they were all aware of what he was painting and where he was working.\n\n“It would have been odd to see him put on a tie and get in the car and drive away,” Jamie says. “We just didn’t know that world at all.”\n\n“But you know,” Nicholas says, “he would take us to where he was painting. I can remember going to Olson’s in Maine, and we’d spend most of the day there playing in the barn while he was working on a watercolor.”\n\nAsked what they would want people to know about their father, they contemplate a few moments.\n\n“Daddy always said, ‘Why should I talk? Everything I have to say is hanging on the walls in the other room,’” Nicholas remembers.\n\n“I think the other thing is that he was a very strange painter and I hope people look further into it,” Jamie says. “I think a lot of the perception of Andrew Wyeth is old barns and lonely things when in fact he didn’t paint very many old barns.”\n\nPainting his granddaughter\n\nVictoria Wyeth was 6 when she posed for her grandfather the first time. Then 20. Then 25.\n\n“We had made a deal the third time that I’d only pose if I could take notes, and so I just sat there taking notes the entire time,” she remembers.\n\nShe’s happy about the retrospective at the Brandywine and thinks it’s a great way to honor him.\n\n“I miss him terribly and I wish he could be there to see this,” she says.\n\nBut her enduring memory of him won’t be paint and canvas.\n\n“His hugs,” she says. “He gave the best long hugs. He made me feel so special all the time.”\n\nPainting Helga\n\nAndrew Wyeth met Helga Testorf while she served as a nurse for Karl Keurner, a neighbor that Wyeth painted for decades. He asked her to model for him in 1971 and between then and 1985, he made 45 paintings and 200 drawings of her, many of them nudes. The sessions were a secret, even to their spouses.\n\nWhen they were revealed, the art world exploded. The cover of Time magazine on Aug. 18, 1986, was a reproduction of one of the paintings, with a headline that said, “Andrew Wyeth’s Stunning Shocker.”\n\nWyeth and Helga remained close companions until his death, with her serving as his nurse, masseuse and assistant. His will left her life rights to Eight Bells, the Maine farmhouse that had belonged to N.C. Wyeth, and she still follows the Wyeth family schedule of decamping to Maine for the summer, where she grows blueberries and makes jam.\n\nShe is often seen around Chadds Ford, wearing signature outfits of white and gold, her favorite colors, and can be spotted at openings of shows at the Brandywine River Museum of Art. She was there for the opening part of the retrospective.\n\nHelga has seemed appalled when someone has told her that they named a pet Helga because they liked the paintings, and she often refuses to talk about the Wyeth or the paintings, saying, “I am Prussian. I don’t tell secrets.”\n\nHer husband, John, who had worked at Longwood Gardens and helped create the garden’s impressive hanging orchid displays, died two years ago. She still lives on their property, painting, writing poetry and working in a white barn John built her that she calls her gallery. She creates shows of photos of Wyeth and his works on the top floor.\n\nPainting Dee Parker\n\nDee Parker met Jamie Wyeth first, in 1982 at the Chadds Ford Inn, which is now Brandywine Prime. He introduced her to his father and mother, and eventually to Nicholas and his father’s siblings.\n\nAndrew was charming, thoughtful and playful, she says, as was the rest of the family. They loved to play games and wear costumes.\n\n“It was kind of like Halloween all year long,” she says.\n\nEarly on, Andrew painted her portrait and his wife, Betsy, who titled all his paintings, named it “School Teacher,” because Parker was an elementary art teacher. Parker was later invited to Maine, partly to be Victoria’s nanny during the summers, and she lived with Nicholas’s family.\n\nThere, she posed for Andrew in Victoria’s playroom, looking straight at the painter.\n\n“That was amazing,” she says, “because the water color and water color board was leaning on my knees, and I could just look down and see every inch of his work. I was getting a lecture in how Andrew Wyeth worked.”\n\nWyeth started with pencil sketches, she says. She posed for several days.\n\n“It was easy to sit still,” she says. “He was right there in front of me.”\n\nHe would have liked to paint her in egg tempera, but she had to return to Pennsylvania to get ready for school. Wyeth would eventually do six paintings of her, one a nude.\n\nShe knows he liked her sense of humor and that he saw two sides of her, a serious side and a playful side.\n\n“That was what he was trying to accomplish with a painting of me looking right at him,” she says. “One side is in shadow and the other is in light. I have a slight smile on one side of my face. He also liked that I was an artist and he encouraged me to keep up my painting and drawing.”\n\nShe also modeled as Anna Keurner in “Snow Hill,” which shows Wyeth’s longtime characters dancing around a maypole, with a lone ribbon floating through the scene. He always said it was a portrait of his death and the dancing was his models’ jubilee at not having to pose any longer.\n\nParker still has the calico skirt she wore for the painting.\n\n“That was a tough pose,” she says, “because I had one foot up on a stool and I was on tiptoe on another.”\n\nOnly one painting of her ever made it into a book, “Andrew Wyeth, America’s Painter.”\n\n“That was an exceptional thing, to see it in a book,” she says.\n\nContact Betsy Price at (302) 324-2884 or beprice@delawareonline.com.\n\nIn her own words: Working with Wyeth\n\nJoyce Hill Stoner has known the Wyeths for more than 30 years, working as a conservatorwith Andrew’s paintings. She wrote this for The News Journal.\n\nIf you were asked to pose for Andrew Wyeth, it was also an invitation to his “world.”\n\nIn between posing sessions he simply incorporated you into his day: travels to see the newest hanging of his works at the Brandywine River Museum (accompanied by his commentary on frames, wall color, and what pictures work best next to one another), fun lunches with his sons Jamie and Nicky or his then studio assistant, Helga Testorf; travel to see the Aeolian organ at Granogue, and much else.\n\nHow did this come about? In 1997 I was asked to write a companion booklet for the upcoming exhibition “Wondrous Strange” at the Delaware Art Museum, discussing the genealogy of the brushstroke and inherited techniques from Howard Pyle to N. C. Wyeth to his son Andrew and then to his son Jamie.\n\nI read everything I could at the Delaware Art Museum written by Howard Pyle or his students, read more letters and consulted with Christine Podmaniczky at the Brandywine River Museum about N. C. Wyeth, and interviewed Andrew and Jamie in person. Andrew seemed very pleased that I had studied so much about Howard Pyle — he considered Pyle his “spiritual grandfather.”\n\nNext Andrew consulted me about treatment of a number of his works that had been water damaged or over-treated by previous conservators, and I became his conservator. It was delightful to have him visit to comment on in-progress treatments; he would sometimes say “inpaint that scratch, it bothers me; but keep this other scratch — it makes the stone wall look more worn.”\n\nIn spring 1999, on one trip to visit an ongoing treatment at the Winterthur Paintings Conservation Studio, he patted my hair and said, “I like your hair; can I paint you?” “Oh,” I said “YES!” He asked me what time I came in each morning and I [unfortunately] said immediately “8:30.” (I didn’t usually come in that early, but now I had to, for the next four weeks ... hoping he would call).\n\nAndrew Wyeth didn’t call and didn’t call, so I kept coming up with more questions about treatments I was doing, and even bringing small paintings north to Chadds Ford to show him. Anna Kuerner (whom he had painted often) had just died. He had given her eulogy, and the Kuerner family gave Andrew and his wife, Betsy, Anna’s pink raincoat.\n\nIt didn’t fit Betsy and, on one of my hopeful trips to their Mill House, Betsy decided to give it to me. I put it on, and Andrew took my hand and said, “Come on!” and took me over to the Granary next to their house, and started a portrait of me wearing the pink coat.\n\nFirst he did two little sketches that he didn’t seem to like, shut his sketchpad and said, “Let’s go to lunch.” I thought “uh oh.”\n\nAnd then about a week later he arranged for me to come back for a second sitting, and this time he showed me a beautiful pencil sketch of my head and the shoulders of the coat which he then turned into a watercolor. As a conservator, I so wanted to watch him paint, but he had me posed looking away: out of the window at little birds flying in and out of the top floor of their refurbished Mill Building.\n\nI tried to sneak glimpses but was afraid that might annoy him. I had read about Helga posing steadfastly, never moving and never wanting a break. I had also heard from others who had been painted, that sometimes it’s just not working out, and he shuts the sketchpad and says “let’s go to lunch” and that’s that.\n\nWhatever Andrew was painting was always a secret, and I was not to tell anyone I was posing. Betsy knew, but I was told not to tell Helga. Also, he didn’t book ahead the sittings — he’d just call suddenly and say “can you come now?” This kept me near the telephone for the entire month of May in 1999.\n\nAfter three more sittings (he would work on the background when I wasn’t there) it was apparently finished, but he didn’t show it to me. Again other sitters advised me, saying, “You won’t know it’s finished, but then someday you’ll see it at the Whitney.”\n\nHowever, the watercolor was taken to be framed by Mary Landa, the Wyeth collection’s personable curator, and I was stunned when Andrew presented it to me as a Christmas gift in December 1999.\n\n— Joyce Hill Stoner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/07"}]}

Here's what's to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPower outages in the US are climbing, researchers reported Wednesday, as extreme weather gets worse due to the climate crisis, the demand for electricity climbs and the country’s energy infrastructure gets older and more vulnerable.\n\nThe analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group, revealed that from 2000 to 2021, 83% of all reported power outages were caused by a weather-related event, from drought-fueled wildfires to damaging storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes – many of which will only intensify as the climate warms.\n\nAnd those numbers are on an upward trend. Researchers reported that outages in the past 10 years had increased by 64% compared with the previous decade.\n\n“This is really something that we should be concerned about because this is affecting all of us and we’re seeing more of them,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, data analyst with Climate Central who worked on the report, told CNN.\n\n“The system we have right now was not built in a time and climate we’re experiencing now,” she added. “It is not prepared for the climate that we have now, and the climate we’re going to see in the future.”\n\nUsing federal data provided by utility companies and the North American Electric Reliability Corp., researchers found more than 1,500 cases of extreme weather-related power outages since 2000, including those caused by high wind; heavy rain and thunderstorms; winter weather, including snow, ice and freezing rain; hurricanes; extreme heat and wildfires. Climate researchers have noted many of these phenomena are becoming more intense and more frequent as global temperatures rise.\n\nClimate Central\n\nClimate Central found that Texas reported the largest number of weather-related outages since 2000, followed by Michigan, California, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe winter storm and cold snap of February 2021, for example, was the costliest winter weather event on record, resulting in multiple days with below-freezing temperatures that led to several days of power outages for millions of customers in Texas. Nearly 10 million people across the South did not have power at the peak of the outages, according to government figures.\n\nThen in May, a heatwave knocked six natural-gas power plants offline in Texas. The state’s grid operator asked residents to limit electricity use, keeping thermostats at 78 degrees or higher and avoid using large, power-sucking appliances during peak times.\n\nTexas utilities reported around 80 weather-related outages between 2019 and 2021 alone – about 44% of Texas’s total since 2000. Severe weather, winter storms and hurricanes caused a majority of the outages. The report also noted that the state operates its own grid independently from the countries two main grids, which makes it challenging to draw power from elsewhere during disaster events.\n\nIn California, researchers documented 44 weather-related outages between 2019 and 2021 – more than a third of the state’s total since 2000. And, they said, wildfires are a growing threat to stable electricity there. Utilities in California are required to implement public safety power shutoffs to reduce risks of equipment flaring during extreme wildfire days. At least 14 of the state’s 44 outages during that time were due to these preemptive shutdowns.\n\nClimate Central\n\nRomany Webb, a researcher at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said US utility companies need to account for the changing climate — evaluating whether existing stations are located in areas at risk of flooding, how severe droughts may affect the power plant operations, or how power lines might be impacted by increasing temperatures.\n\n“For many, the findings won’t come as a surprise because, all across the United States, people are already directly experiencing climate change-related disruptions to electricity and other services,” said Webb, who was not involved with the report. “As we’ve seen in recent years, those disruptions can have deadly consequences. Things will only get worse if we don’t take action.”\n\nSteven Weissman, an emeritus lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in energy law and policy, said that he would like to see the analysis expand to focus on all aspects of grid operation — and not just the transmission system — as the world looks into cleaner energy sources.\n\n“As we move more toward these intermittent sources of energy like solar and wind, we need to shift to an era where we predict supply and then manage demand, sort of flip it upside down,” Weissman, who was not involved in the report, told CNN. “And how do you manage demand? Well, you set prices that are going to encourage people to use power off-peak. You can also encourage people to have smart appliances that would not have to take power from the grid when demand is highest.”\n\nFirefighters spray water on trees during the Dixie Fire, which was caused by damage to power lines, in August 2021 near Janesville, California. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrudeau said the US needs to create a more resilient and reliable power system to prevent power outages as climate change advances. Building microgrids — small, renewable-powered networks that act as backups for the primary electricity grid, in the event of a major power outage — for example, can help residents weather power outages while also reducing emissions from power generation.\n\nWhen Hurricane Sandy brought heavy rain, strong winds and flooding to Northeast in 2012 and caused significant damage to electrical infrastructure, for instance, microgrids helped residents weather the storm. At the time, 21 states along the East Coast experienced widespread power outages.\n\nShe also said states must invest in smart grid technologies as well as harden the grid to withstand severe storm damages, while also providing customers incentives to reduce energy overuse during peak times.\n\nDespite the uptick in extreme weather, Webb said utilities still haven’t thought ahead.\n\n“Unfortunately, many electric utilities and system operators still aren’t engaging in this sort of planning, and have instead chosen to ignore the reality of climate change,” Webb said. “It is, though, quickly becoming impossible to ignore. The sooner action is taken, the better off we will all be.”\n\nUntil the US makes large-scale investments and pushes to create a more reliable and resilient power grid, the climate crisis will likely lead to more outages and force grid operators to encourage the public to cut electricity use when supply is unable to meet demand, according to Trudeau.\n\n“There is no magic wand that we can wave right now,” Trudeau said. “But ultimately the things that we can focus on are things like cutting our emissions, because it’s the most meaningful action to slow down the rate of warming and the mounting stress on our power grid and really allow us more time to adapt to our changing climate.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/10/29/blooms-sweetheart-deal-del-keeps-givin/92667946/", "title": "The truth behind Bloom Energy's sweet deal in Delaware", "text": "Jeff Mordock, and Molly Murray\n\nThe News Journal\n\nOver the last four years, Delawareans have paid nearly $130 million in energy surcharges – a benefit used to attract fuel cell company Bloom Energy to the state five years ago in exchange for a promise of 900 new jobs.\n\nCounting the surcharge alone, to date, the cost for each one of those pledged 900 jobs for Delmarva Power ratepayers amounts to nearly $145,000 per post.\n\nBut in reality, Bloom didn't create 900 jobs. The real number is 277 positions, meaning each one, to date, has cost ratepayers almost $470,000.\n\nThe median annual household income in Delaware, according to the U.S. Census, is $60,235.\n\nAnd the surcharge continues until 2033.\n\nDefenders of the deal say the surcharge on Delmarva's Delaware customers was necessary to achieve the state's goal of having 25 percent of its energy come from renewable sources by 2025. Had this money not gone to Bloom, they said, it would have gone to an out-of-state wind or solar company that would not have created any jobs in Delaware.\n\n\"The surcharge is paying for energy created in Delaware as opposed to going elsewhere,\" Gov. Jack Markell said.\n\nDan Simmons, vice president of policy at the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that studies government regulation of energy markets, said having ratepayers subsidize a private energy business is unusual.\n\n\"Bloom was given a whole bunch of incentives and the surcharge, which is very strange,\" he said. \"It looks like Delaware was doing everything it could to give Bloom money.\"\n\nSimmons questioned the wisdom of such a deal, noting that since so-called Bloom Boxes are similar to a natural gas power plant, it would have been cheaper just to build a plant.\n\n\"This is a serious sweetheart deal,\" he said. \"It didn't matter if the state took one part of the subsidies away, Bloom would still get money over time. Every business would want that deal.\"\n\nSTORY: Purzycki's business ties: Asset or liability?\n\nSTORY: Report floats Joe Biden for Clinton's secretary of state\n\nThe surcharge was guaranteed by state lawmakers for 21 years under legislation approved in 2011 and enacted in the middle of 2012.\n\nAnd that's not the only benefit used to get Bloom to locate in Delaware. Other incentives included:\n\nTwenty-five years of $1 a year rent from the University of Delaware's 1743 Holding LLC, to attract the company to its STAR Campus as its first tenant.\n\n$12 million, which could increase to as much as $16.5 million, from the Delaware Strategic Fund in exchange for job creation.\n\nDelaware Strategic Fund in exchange for job creation. Expedited permitting.\n\nThe hastily-passed 2011 legislation needed to designate fuel cells, which run on natural gas, as a renewable energy source.\n\nAnd, most recently, a pass from state environmental officials on the way the company handled spent fuel canisters at its power generation facility near New Castle. (In the last few days, state environmental officials have concluded the canisters really are hazardous waste and should be handled as such with state inspection, review and accounting by the company. The pollutant of concern is benzene, a known carcinogen.)\n\nThere were federal grants, too. Under program 1603 of the Recovery Act, Bloom subsidiary Diamond State Generation Partners LLC received $77 million in 2014 in lieu of a federal tax credit for their Delaware fuel cell facility.\n\nFive years later, the Bloom economic development deal has some Delaware lawmakers scratching their heads, questioning whether it was worth the return. Opponents of the deal argue the number of jobs Bloom created does not justify the benefits handed to them. But supporters, including Markell, argue that Bloom has created hundreds of high-wage, technical positions that Delaware would not have otherwise.\n\n\"For the people who have jobs, I'm glad they have jobs,\" said Sen. Gregory F. Lavelle, R- Sharpley, the senate minority whip. \"But it's a hell of an expensive lesson picking winners and losers, particularly when we don't feel we were given the whole story ... The Bloom project, as sold, is not what we got. It is more expensive by a factor of four or five. If I'd known that, I never would have voted for it.\"\n\nLavelle said he is especially disheartened by the increasing surcharge that Delmarva Power customers are paying to support the deal and the fact that the 900 promised jobs have not materialized.\n\nRealistic job goals?\n\nCurrently, Delmarva customers, on average, are paying an extra $5.55 per month to fund Bloom's business in Delaware. When the surcharge was initially imposed in July 2012, it only added 65 cents to customers' bills. The charges are based on a calculation that includes three separate components. But charges went up as Bloom increased the number of fuel cells.\n\nLavelle is not the only one who regrets his Bloom vote. Rep. John Kowalko Jr., D-Newark South, represents the district where Bloom's manufacturing facility is located. Looking back on the deal, Kowalko said he wishes he raised more questions.\n\n\"This deal is an economic disaster,\" Kowalko said. \"It was a failure by the Legislature, including myself, to question the legislation as we should have. It was a rush to have it done in the waning days of the Senate, and that has historically been used as a method where we end up with really bad legislation, including Bloom.\"\n\nDemocrat Sen. Harris B. McDowell III, D-Wilmington North, did not sign the 2011 legislation. At first glance, Bloom's fuel cell sales to high-profile businesses like Microsoft and Adobe seemed impressive, he said. But his enthusiasm soon gave way to serious misgivings.\n\n\"When I analyzed the marketing of Bloom's products in California, there was not a cost-benefit calculation that made sense,\" McDowell recalled. \"Those companies weren't buying fuel cells on the basis of environmental value; they were buying for the public relations value. The companies wanted to be able to say they were as green as they could get, but they didn't monitor the energy savings.\"\n\nSen. David Lawson, R- Marydel, and fellow Republican and gubernatorial candidate Colin Bonini, Dover South, were the two senators who voted against the Bloom bill in 2011.\n\nLawson says he isn't an \"I told you so\" kind of guy. But he said recently, \"I was very skeptical. I still am. I don't think they are going to meet the deadline at the end of the month\" for promised job creation.\n\nOn Friday, Bloom reported to the Delaware Economic Development Office that, as of Sept. 30, it had created 277 jobs in Delaware, earning a total of $45 million. While that represents a 23 percent improvement over the 224 Delaware workers it had last year, it is far below the goal of 900 workers earning a combined $108 million Bloom promised it would bring to Delaware by October 2017.\n\nLawson said he questioned both the legislation – which he described as more of a contract between the state, Bloom and Delmarva Power, than a law – and Bloom's ability to deliver on the promised jobs.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing, he said, \"I asked them how many years they had been in business in California.\"\n\nHe learned that over 11 years there, the company hadn't created 900 jobs there, he said.\n\n\"You're projecting some phenomenal growth,\" he recalled saying at the time. \"It turned out my suspicions have been verified. Everything was an emergency. We had to get it done now. … The ratepayers are stuck with this 21-year plan. … We're not getting any benefit from this.\"\n\nSen. Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View, who, at the time was in the House, called the Bloom bill \"a pig in a poke.\"\n\n\"We did not know what we were getting,\" he said. \"It cost us jobs. It cost us industry.\"\n\nWith higher utility costs, it makes the cost of doing business more expensive than in other states, he said.\n\n\"I thought this was a terrible deal … and the deal goes on.\"\n\nBonini agreed the Legislature wasn't given the complete story in 2011.\n\n\"I believe the Governor's Office and the General Assembly believed the hype about 900 jobs,\" he said. \"It was a good story, but it turned out not be a good deal.\"\n\nIf elected governor, Bonini said, he will make renegotiating the Bloom deal one of his top priorities.\n\n\"Bloom is one of the reasons our utility costs are out of whack,\" he said. \"We need to fix that or businesses aren't going to grow or come here. There is no question businesses don't look at Delaware because of utility costs.\"\n\nHis Democratic opponent, U.S. Rep. John Carney, isn't critical of the deal, suggesting that at the time the state was coming off a serious economic downturn.\n\n\"The question is, how committed are you to creating good manufacturing jobs?\" he said. \"At the time, it looked like a pretty good deal.\"\n\nAs governor, he said, he would strive for balance between environmental good and job creation.\n\nSome still support the deal.\n\n\"I'm still very positive about Bloom,\" said Sen. Brian Bushweller, D-Dover/Central Kent. \"Basically, I'm happy with the way it's working out.\"\n\nEven McDowell said the final chapter of Bloom's Delaware story has yet to be written.\n\n\"I think school is out on whether or not we did a good thing,\" he said.\n\nMarkell remains bullish on Bloom's future. Earlier this month, the company announced a deal with Southern Company, one of the largest utilities in the United States. Under the agreement, Southern Company will buy 50-megawatt fuel cells from Bloom.\n\n\"I would love to see Bloom employ more people, but they are bringing hundreds of skilled and good wage jobs to Delaware,\" Markell said. \"The business continues to grow with a fantastic set of customers. The future looks strong.\"\n\nThe governor also cautioned against judging the Bloom deal without looking at Delaware's overall record on job creation, which he says is stronger than other states in the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\"People may focus on one particular thing, but when they look at all the strategic fund companies, those companies have generated more jobs than they had committed to in totality,\" he said. \"I would urge people to look at all this as a total package.\"\n\nThe heart of the deal\n\nAs Carney suggested, consider the economic climate in 2010 and 2011. The ill-fated Fisker deal to repurpose the old General Motors Boxwood Road plant with a new automaker was falling apart.\n\nIn December 2010, the unemployment rate in the state was at 8 percent. Thousands were unemployed or underemployed, and some of the state's biggest employers were cutting back through buyouts and layoffs.\n\nOn the environmental side, the much heralded Bluewater Wind project, a proposal to build a wind farm in the Atlantic Ocean off the Delaware coast, had fallen apart amid financial uncertainties such as the availability of grants and tax credits.\n\nCollin O'Mara, then the state's DNREC secretary and now chief executive officer of the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation, made a trip to California's Silicon Valley, where he met with Bloom executives and engineered a pitch for Delaware. O'Mara had been San Jose's Clean Tech Strategist before coming to Delaware.\n\nIn early June 2011, Markell's office announced the Bloom Energy deal and said the project could create up to 1,500 high-tech jobs between the company and its suppliers at the site of the former Chrysler factory in Newark. They name-dropped some of Bloom's customers: Google, FedEx, Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart.\n\nAlan Levin ran the Delaware Economic Development Office at the time. He, along with Markell, O'Mara, McDowell and current DEDO director Bernice Whaley toured Bloom headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. He said Bloom was an opportunity to get on the ground floor of a cutting-edge technology.\n\n“Some of the world's largest companies have chosen Bloom Energy to power their growth, and now Bloom has chosen Delaware as the best site for their expansion,“ Markell said at the time.\n\nManufacturing jobs were disappearing, and pressure was on to bring jobs to Delaware.\n\nSTORY: Battle of the outsiders in New Castle County politics\n\nSTORY:Prime Hook Beach Road gets new bridge\n\nKowalko said that when he asked O'Mara questions about Bloom, the DNREC secretary responded by asking if the senator really wanted to take a hard stance against the deal after his district lost so many jobs when the Chrysler plant was shuttered.\n\n\"We were hemorrhaging jobs at that time,\" Kowalko said. \"There was an anxiousness and anxiety to bring good news to Delaware. No one wanted to turn their back on 900 jobs.\"\n\nEdward C. Ratledge, director of the University of Delaware Center for Applied Demography and Survey Research, said the Great Recession, from 2008 to 2014, hit Delaware hard.\n\nRatledge and William W. Boyer, Charles Polk Messick Professor Emeritus of Political Science and International Relations at the University of Delaware, looked at the state's response and recently published a book about it, \"Growing Business in Delaware: The Politics of Job Creation in a Small State.\"\n\nRatledge said with all the job losses there was \"pressure on the governor to do something.\"\n\nThe Bloom deal was complicated and it revolved around renewable energy credits.\n\nBefore 2011, there were two ways a company like Delmarva Power could satisfy its renewable energy requirements. They could deliver energy produced by an eligible source like wind or solar, or they could buy renewable energy credits. The Delaware Electric Cooperative, for instance, built a large solar plant near Georgetown to grow the company's renewable portfolio. Delmarva, meanwhile, was buying renewable energy credits from producers outside the state.\n\nThe game-changer came in 2011 when the Legislature created a special category classifying a qualified fuel cell – like those Bloom manufactures – as a renewable energy source. The catch was it only applied to fuel cells manufactured in Delaware.\n\nWhen O'Mara testified at a public hearing before the state Public Service Commission, he said Delaware was not the only state to certify fuel cells as a renewable energy resource. He said eight other states had taken similar steps.\n\nWhile Bloom Fuel Cells, or Bloom Boxes, can run off renewables such as the methane gas that comes from landfilling trash – in Delaware they are powered by natural gas.\n\nWithout the change in the law, Delmarva couldn't get the renewable energy credits, Ratledge said.\n\nRELATED: Bloom's benzene waste concerned EPA\n\nNew Castle County activist Victor Singer said he laughed out loud when asked whether the Bloom Boxes used in Delaware were powered with a renewable energy resource.\n\n\"I thought it was absurd to begin with,\" he said. \"The governor's philosophy appears to be anything that creates a job is worth doing.\"\n\nRatledge called Bloom's agreement with the state \"a sweetheart deal.\"\n\nIn the jobs report, Bloom Chief Financial Officer Randy Furr blamed the anemic growth on policy uncertainty that is impacting its \"ability to plan for further growth.\" Furr said at the end of last year, an investment tax credit was extended for solar customers, but that same credit was not extended those who purchased fuel cells.\n\nFurr wrote that if Bloom does not hit its 2017 wage and hiring targets, the company will return some of the strategic grant money.\n\n\"Bloom will abide by our agreements and will return the specified grant funds to DEDO to repurpose as the state deems appropriate,\" Furr wrote. \"We remain singularly focused on sustainability while reiterating our commitment to the State of Delaware.\"\n\nIt is hard to know how much of the potential $16.5 million the company could receive that could be returned to the state. The clawback provisions are based on the percentage of salary targets Bloom hits. For example, if Bloom reaches two-thirds of the $108 million, it will have to refund a different percentage of the amount than if it only creates jobs amounting to one-third of that amount.\n\nMarkell said the state will ensure Bloom returns what is required of them if they fail to meet their goals.\n\n\"If they have not met their targets next year, I full expect them to pay what they are supposed to pay,\" he said.\n\nRatledge said the jobs aren't the only issue.\n\n\"They underestimated how much they were going to burn in natural gas,\" he said. And \"there was no discussion on the spent sulfur capture.\"\n\nAs for state regulators \"they were not as careful as they should have been\" during the permitting and review process, he said.\n\nFast-tracked permits\n\nBloom applied for a Coastal Zone Permit in November of 2011. The state held a public hearing in March 2012 and the permit was issued the following month.\n\nThat sounded pretty speedy to Gerard Esposito, president of Tidewater Utilities based in Dover. Tidewater applied for a Coastal Zone permit for a wastewater treatment facility west of Rehoboth Bay. The review process took so long, he said, the project died before it could get started.\n\nState environmental chief David Small said the Bloom project wasn't extraordinary. He pointed to four other recent projects that went through the Coastal Zone approval process even faster than Bloom.\n\nThree people raised questions at Bloom's Coastal Zone hearing. Among them was Middletown resident John Nichols. Since that hearing, Nichols has gone to court to challenge the Bloom project both for the environmental permit process and the decision by the state public service commission to approve the rate surcharge. His cases have been dismissed for lack of standing.\n\nNichols said he continues to question the Bloom deal.\n\n“Bloom is expensive, and it’s dirty,” he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Bloom confidentially filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, according to media reports.\n\nMatt Ross, a spokesman for Bloom, declined to comment on whether the filing is for an IPO.\n\n\"Our focus continues to be on what is important, which is creating a strong company focused on sustainable and long-term growth,\" he said.\n\nThe filing is confidential because of a 2012 law permitting companies with under $1 billion in revenue to quietly file proposed IPO documents with the SEC. Companies typically use the rule to gauge investor interest before going public.\n\nRumors that Bloom would go public have circulated for years, but the company never pulled the trigger. The confidential filing has some wondering why the company might be making a play for investor cash at this time.\n\nKathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based manager of IPO-focused Exchange Traded Funds, said the company's private backers have held their investment much longer than usual. Typically, a private investor cashes out after a few years, but some of Bloom's investors have maintained their investment for the company's entire 15-year lifespan.\n\nThat combined with what Smith described as a weak market for energy IPOs could lead to a situation where the public values the market below what the private investors paid for their share of Bloom.\n\n\"The longer these private investors hold these shares, there is going to be a lower rate of return on them if you look at the time value of money,\" Smith said.\n\nDavid Stevenson, director of the Cesar Rodney Institute's Center for Energy Competitiveness and a longtime Bloom critic, offers a different possibility for why the company could go public at this time. He says Bloom's government subsidies are drying up and they need to meet their debt obligations.\n\nIn late 2014, Bloom raised about $130 million in the form of convertible debt notes, according to an email to clients from Spruce Investment Advisors, a manager of funds that hold Bloom shares. The notes, which are essentially loans provided to investors, carry a term of three years. That means the loans would need to be repaid by December 2017.\n\nThe Spruce email says the notes would convert to preferred stock in the event of an IPO, \"assuming an initial offering price of at least $25.76 per share.\"\n\n\"Their backs are against the wall, and they are throwing a Hail Mary so they can stay viable,\" he said.\n\nSome of the subsidies outside of Delaware are starting to dry up. After winning nearly 75 percent of the available Connecticut contracts in 2013, no additional contracts have been announced. Ross said Bloom has continued to win contracts and deploy fuel cells in the state, but not all contracts have been publicly announced.\n\n\"We believe it is our customers' right to choose when and how they announce their projects,\" he said.\n\nIn June, California modified its $1.4 billion Self-Generation Incentive Program, which had doled out more than $400 million to Bloom. The company was said to be the single largest recipient of funds from the program.\n\nThe Golden State's legislature has begun tinkering with the program to possibly phase out the use of fuel cells and invest more in energy storage. It is also considering changing how the money gets disbursed.\n\n\"Without those California subsidies, Bloom doesn't have a business,\" Stevenson said.\n\nWill they stay?\n\nAs Bloom struggles to find footing in Delaware and animosity from Delmarva ratepayers grows, some wonder what will keep Bloom here after the surcharge expires.\n\nRoss said the company has no plans to vacate the state.\n\n\"The advanced fuel cell systems manufactured by Bloom Energy in Delaware are exported across the U.S. and to markets around the world, thanks to our highly-skilled team in Newark,\" he said. \"We have, to date, invested over $50 million in our Newark facility and are fully committed to continuing to build this new industry in Delaware, and to having the state and the entire region benefit from this growth.\"\n\nMarkell agreed with Ross. The governor said Bloom would not abandon the hundreds of manufacturing jobs it created and the state. He added that the company has become involved in community groups, including one of Markell's favorite programs, Pathways to Prosperity. The program prepares high school students with in-demand jobs skills by having them work at local companies, including Bloom.\n\nStevenson remains skeptical. Under Bloom's agreement with the state, they would have to refund Delmarva customers if they leave. The amount decreases every year Bloom remains. That clause was added to the Bloom contract by the Public Service Commission to better protect ratepayers. If Bloom left after a year, they would be required to pay $20 million. This year that number has dropped to $7.5 million, and it will fall to $3.5 million by 2021.\n\n\"I think the $7.5 million is enough to keep them here,\" Stevenson said. \"But after that, if another state offered them a deal there is no incentive to stay here.\"\n\nFor now, Delaware residents are eagerly awaiting next year's jobs report to learn whether Bloom met its hiring and wage targets or if taxpayers will get back at least some of their money. But that may be of little consolation to the Delmarva ratepayers seeing ever-increasing utility bills.\n\n\"Even if we repeal the fuel cell designation and clawback the money DEDO put out, that won't be a drop in the bucket compared to what the ratepayers have put out,\" Kowalko said.\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or jmordock@delawareonline.com.

That breaks down to about $6.50 per person, according to the annual survey.\n\nThe price of a 16-pound turkey is $28.96 on average this year, up 21% from 2021, according to the survey. Inflation cooled last month but still remains elevated at 7.7% for the year ending in October.\n\n“General inflation slashing the purchasing power of consumers is a significant factor contributing to the increase in average cost of this year’s Thanksgiving dinner,” said Roger Cryan, chief economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nEveryone who wants a turkey should be able to find one this year despite some temporary regional shortages in states where the avian influenza was prevalent in parts of the Midwest. Supply chain issues stemming from the war in Ukraine pushed the cost of Thanksgiving menu items higher, as did higher input costs for farmers and ranchers like feed, fuel, and fertilizer.\n\nEvery Thanksgiving meal item tracked by the Farm Bureau rose in cost this year, except for one: cranberries. A 12-ounce bag of fresh cranberries dropped by 14% to $2.57. The biggest price increases were on stuffing, which is up a whopping 69%, and pie crusts and whipped cream — both up 26%, the survey said.\n\nThe Farm Bureau also priced out an “expanded holiday menu” with additional items: ham, Russet potatoes, and frozen green beans, which would add an additional $17.25 to a meal for 10.\n\nThe survey was conducted by 224 volunteer shoppers who checked prices in person and online at grocery stores across all 50 states and Puerto Rico from October 18-31. The shoppers looked for the best possible prices without using coupons or shopping deals, the Farm Bureau said. Shoppers in the western part of the country saw the highest prices while those in the South found the most affordable Thanksgiving menu items.\n\nSince the survey was taken, there has been some good news for all shoppers on the turkey front: prices for frozen turkeys are dropping by about 14% this week, and most grocery store chains are now offering deals, according to an analysis of United States Department of Agriculture data by the Farm Bureau.", "authors": ["Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2023/01/08/beer-prices-higher-shoppers-buying-less/11007642002/", "title": "Beer prices up amid inflation and Americans are buying less", "text": "Inflation may finally be hitting a staple long been considered recession-proof: beer.\n\nDuring the last 13 weeks of 2022, beer prices at retail (not including bars and restaurants) rose a \"much higher than normal\" average of 7%, according to Bump Williams Consulting of Shelton, Connecticut, which services the alcoholic beverage industry, and uses Nielsen data. Some beers including those such as Bud Light, Miller Lite, Yuengling Lager and Coors Light saw prices rise even higher – by 10% – the data suggests.\n\nDuring that time period, there was also a decline in volume of beer sold. Domestic super-premium beers such as Michelob Ultra saw sales rise 0.8% throughout the year, but fell off 2.3% in the four weeks leading up to Christmas, according to Bump Williams Consulting. Similarly, sales of imported beers such as Corona and Heineken rose 4.2% in 2022, but dipped 0.5% in December.\n\nThat suggests beer shoppers may have opted to buy less beer – a six-pack or 12-pack instead of something larger – or maybe bought a cheaper brand.\n\nFor instance, lower-priced \"below premium\" beers such as Budweiser and Miller High, malt liquor and single-serve beers (16-ounce, 19.2-ounce and other tallboys) saw gains in December, said Dave Williams, vice president of analytics and insight for Bump Williams Consulting.\n\nCES 2023 — the future of vehicles:Cars that can fly and change colors\n\nFederal Trade Commission:Agency files suits to stop companies from making workers sign noncompete restrictions\n\n\"Sooner or later everyone hits a breaking point when it comes to their price sensitivity and are going to alter\" their behavior by spending less or shopping less often, he told USA TODAY.\n\nBeer prices on the rise\n\nInflation has afflicted beer makers with the increased cost of ingredients and shipping, just as consumers have been hit with higher gas and grocery prices.\n\nSo, beer producers have raised prices. The price of beer purchased to drink at home had risen about 7.7% as of November 2022, compared to November 2021, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. That's higher than whiskey (1.7%), wine (3%), and other spirits (1.7%).\n\nBut during the month of November 2022 alone, beer prices rose 1.3%, higher than the price of overall groceries (0.5%). Egg prices – up 2.3% – still outpaced beer, however.\n\nWhile overall inflation appeared to be coming down as the year ended, it was \"less so in beer,\" noted Bart Watson, chief economist for the Brewers Association, in a tweet.\n\nAlso rising: the price of beer away from home, up 6.6% for the year and 0.1% for the month of November, according to the index.\n\nConstellation Brands, which makes Corona and Modelo beers and other alcoholic beverages, said it plans to temper its increased prices after hikes in October slowed sales, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. “The consumer is overly sensitive to pricing actions,” it quoted Constellation CEO Bill Newlands saying. “We need to be careful in balancing our growth profile and our pricing profile.”\n\n'We value the power of family':Iconic chef José Andrés, daughters explore Spain in new show\n\nLawsuits over sweets:Dark chocolate from Trader Joe's, Hershey has 'unsafe levels' of lead and cadmium\n\nAs prices rise, Americans buy less beer\n\nFor now, higher prices are making up for consumers buying slightly less beer.

Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.”\n\nIn the memo, Musk goes on to outline how Twitter will be “much more engineering-driven” and then gives staff an ultimatum. “If you are sure that you want to be part of the new Twitter, please click yes on the link below,” directing staff to what appears to be an online form.\n\nMusk said any employee who has not done so by 5 p.m. ET on Thursday will receive three months severance. The Washington Post was first to report the memo.\n\nThe email, with the subject line “A fork in the road,” comes as Musk has publicly and privately clashed with Twitter employees over his approach to running the company. It also comes after Musk pushed out Twitter’s top execs, eliminated the board of directors and laid off roughly half the staff, including crucial roles in curation, wellness, public policy and other teams.\n\nDuring testimony in a Delaware trial over his Tesla pay package on Wednesday, Musk said that he expects the “fundamental organizational restructuring” at Twitter to be finished by the end of this week. He added that while he has spent the “lion’s share” of his time at Twitter rather than his other companies in the past few weeks, he doesn’t expect that to be the case forever.\n\n“I expect to reduce my time at Twitter, and find somebody else to run Twitter, over time,” Musk said.\n\nIn the meantime, Musk has laid out ambitious goals for how he plans to change the platform and is pushing his staff to achieve them as he attempts to quickly bolster the company’s bottom line. Musk has also reportedly made confusing asks of employees, such as requesting that they print out dozens of pages of code they’d recently written and then reversing course and telling them to shred it.\n\nAt least one Twitter employee also tweeted about sleeping on the floor at the office.

Their ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBig oil companies are spending millions to portray themselves as taking action on climate change, but their investments and lobbying activities don’t live up to their planet-friendly claims, according to a new report.\n\nAn analysis from London-based energy and climate think-tank InfluenceMap found that the amount of climate-positive messaging used by five major oil and gas companies – BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, and TotalEnergies – is inconsistent with their spending on low-carbon activities.\n\nThe report comes as scientists have grown increasingly urgent in their warning that the world must slash the use of fossil fuels to prevent catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis. It also comes amid fresh criticism of oil companies’ growing profits as consumer energy costs soar.\n\nThe think tank analyzed 3,421 items of public communications materials for 2021 across the five companies and found that 60% of their messaging contained at least one “green” claim.\n\nInfluenceMap then calculated the amount of money the energy companies expected to spend on green investments last year and found on average just 12% of their capital expenditure budgets were going toward what the companies themselves consider low-carbon or renewable activities.\n\nIn some cases, those figures are on the rise. Shell, for example, says it plans to spend 12% of its capital expenses on renewable energy this year, up from 10% in 2021. And the company noted the InfluenceMap analysis does not account for investments outside of its Renewables and Energy Solutions division – investments such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, all of which climate scientists have said are important in the effort to wean off fossil fuel.\n\nStill, InfluenceMap says the companies’ imbalance between “green” messaging and investment is striking.\n\nIt appears to be part of a “systematic campaign to portray themselves as pro-climate to the public,” InfluenceMap program manager Faye Holder told CNN. “In the meantime, what we see is continued investment into this unsustainable energy system – predominantly for fossil fuels.”\n\nInfluenceMap also estimated the companies are spending around $750 million each year cumulatively on climate-related communication activities, based on the number of communications staff the companies employ. The think tank said in a statement that figure doesn’t include the cost of external advertising or PR agencies, so the true amount is likely “significantly higher.”\n\n“It seems to be just an evolution in the tactics that Big Oil is using to try to delay action on climate change,” Holder said.\n\nOveremphasis on green messaging\n\nThe five major oil companies are “misrepresenting their primary business operations” by “overemphasizing energy transition technologies” and green campaigns in their public relations, InfluenceMap said.\n\nThe report revealed several different types of “green” claims used by oil and gas companies in their 2021 public communications, the most popular of which was highlighting their support for the effort to transition away from fossil fuel and toward renewable energy. The second most popular type of claim was focused on support for emissions reductions.\n\nSome of the companies’ planet-friendly claims portrayed gas as a climate solution, according to the think tank. Natural gas, which typically emits less carbon dioxide than coal, is still a fossil fuel and is primarily made of methane – a significant contributor to the climate crisis.\n\nAmong the five companies, Shell had the biggest mismatch between pro-climate messaging and investments into “low carbon” activities, according to InfluenceMap, followed by ExxonMobil.\n\nThe analysis found that Shell used “green” claims in 70% of messaging, while only 10% of its spending is on low-carbon investments. Shell says it expects that figure to rise to 12% in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Exxon had green claims in 65% of messaging, compared to 8% of spending on green investments. ExxonMobil told CNN it is “investing more than $15 billion between now and 2027 on lower-emission initiatives,” and the company expects its green investments to triple by 2025.\n\nLobbying reveals focus on fossil fuels\n\nInfluenceMap also noted that these five companies continue to lobby policymakers to lock fossil fuels into climate policy.\n\n“The science is very clear” that “the use of fossil fuels needs to decrease significantly and rapidly,” Holder told CNN, citing the most recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. “But what we see from these companies is – particularly in the US and from industry associations – a real push for fossil gas to be included and to be considered as a ‘green’ or low-carbon solution.”\n\nThe report noted that InfluenceMap “found evidence of each company, with the exception of TotalEnergies, engaging policymakers directly to advocate for policies encouraging the development of new oil and gas in 2021-22.”\n\nShell told CNN it is growing its green investment rapidly. Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nFour of the companies – BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell – are members of the US trade association group American Petroleum Institute (API), which scientists and climate advocates have criticized for opposing regulations aimed at combating climate change.\n\nThe World Resources Institute, which was not affiliated with the analysis, has previously highlighted the issue of major oil and gas companies strategically using trade associations, including the API, to engage in greenwashing – deceptive advertising practices that make companies seem like their products are more climate-friendly than they actually are.\n\n“We urge all companies to re-examine their lobbying, political spending and participation in trade associations to ensure that their actions are fully aligned with their public statements on climate change,” said WRI in a 2021 statement.\n\n“API member companies continue to make investments towards innovation, research, and best practices to further reduce GHG emissions and tackle the climate challenge,” API’s senior vice president of communications Megan Bloomgren told CNN in a statement.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a Shell spokesperson said the company is “already investing billions of dollars in lower-carbon energy.”\n\n“To help alter the mix of energy Shell sells, we need to grow these new businesses rapidly,” the spokesperson said. “That means letting our customers know through advertising or social media what lower-carbon solutions we offer now or are developing, so they can switch when the time is right for them.”\n\nA spokesperson for Exxon told CNN the company is shooting for net-zero emissions in its operations by 2050, and noted that it achieved its 2025 emissions reduction goal four years early.\n\n“ExxonMobil is investing more than $15 billion between now and 2027 on lower-emission initiatives, and we anticipate a tripling of investment by 2025,” the spokesperson said in an email. “This reflects our commitment to reducing our own emissions and confidence in the market adoption of lower-emission solutions, such as [carbon capture and storage], hydrogen, and biofuels.”\n\nA TotalEnergies spokesperson said, “Our public announcements policy reflects the transformation of TotalEnergies in a multi-energy company.” TotalEnergies also noted that the report shows it has the largest forecast renewable energy capacity among the oil companies analyzed.\n\nCNN also requested comment from BP and Chevron but did not receive a response.\n\n“The world will still need oil and gas for many years to come,” the Shell spokesperson added. “Investment in them will ensure we can supply the energy people will still have to rely on, while lower-carbon alternatives are scaled up.”\n\nYet the UN Environment Programme has noted that current worldwide levels of oil and gas production would not meet climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement.\n\n“The world’s governments plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C,” according to the UNEP’s Production Gap report, adding that “most major oil and gas producers are planning on increasing production out to 2030 or beyond.”\n\nThe International Energy Agency has also reported that oil and gas companies must stop drilling now if the world hopes to prevent a climate catastrophe. Investment in new fossil fuel supply projects must stop immediately, the IEA said in 2021, and no new coal-fired plants should be approved.\n\nSoaring Energy Prices\n\nThe InfluenceMap report, which highlights companies’ relatively low levels of spending on green investments, comes as energy prices soar in Europe, while Big Oil continues to report high profits.\n\nEnergy prices have been increasing in Europe since last fall, driven by a spike in demand as countries lifted pandemic lockdowns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent drop in Moscow’s oil and natural gas exports to Europe in 2022, have pushed prices even higher.\n\nMeanwhile, a perfect storm has resulted in windfall profits for the oil industry: the highest oil prices in a decade, huge demand for refining crude so it can be used as fuel, plus governments’ renewed focus on energy security.\n\nExxon made nearly $17.9 billion in profit between April and June, almost four times what it earned during the same period in 2021. Chevron booked a profit of $11.6 billion, while Shell earned $11.5 billion.\n\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from the American Petroleum Institute.", "authors": ["Lauren Kent"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2021/11/25/investors-buying-up-arizona-farmland-valuable-water-rights/8655703002/", "title": "Investors are buying up Arizona farmland for the valuable water rights", "text": "CIBOLA — In fields on the Arizona-California border, farmers draw water from the nearby Colorado River to grow alfalfa, irrigating crops as they have for decades.\n\nThat could change soon. An investment company has purchased nearly 500 acres of farmland and wants to strip it of its water and send it 200 miles across the desert to a Phoenix suburb, where developers plan to build thousands of new houses.\n\nSimilar deals could follow as the demand for water in the growing Southwest outpaces the dwindling supply. Investors have begun buying thousands of acres of farmland to acquire the water, which they view as an increasingly valuable asset.\n\nHere along the western edge of Arizona, the investment company Greenstone bought 485 acres of farmland and now awaits federal approval to sell most of its water entitlement from the land to the town of Queen Creek, one of the fastest-growing suburbs in Arizona.\n\nThe fields that would be left dry represent a small portion of the vast stretches of farmland this company and other water-focused investors have been buying, properties where the water could be taken, partially or entirely, to quench the thirst of growing cities and suburbs.\n\nThese large-scale purchases of farmlands have occurred as years of severe drought and the effects of climate change have contributed to dramatic declines in reservoirs along the Colorado River and throughout the West. As water has grown scarcer, investors have stepped in to try to profit by offering water to the highest bidders.\n\nAn examination of property records by The Arizona Republic found that Greenstone and related companies have bought at least 8,863 acres of farmland in three Arizona counties in recent years. They have amassed enough land in Yuma County to trigger alarms among longtime residents, whose water rights are among the most valuable on the lower river.\n\nThe Republic’s review of county property records in Arizona revealed that two other water-focused investment companies, Water Asset Management and Vidler Water Company, own agricultural lands totaling about 8,642 acres in several areas of the state. These same companies have bought land and water rights in places across the West, amassing a growing list of investments in Colorado, Nevada, California, New Mexico and Idaho.\n\nThe surge of investments in farmland with the primary purpose of selling water has kindled emotional debates about whether the deals will dry up farming towns. On one side are those who argue that landowners should be able to sell water and that free-market forces hold promise to reallocate scarce water supplies. On the other are people who argue that a public resource shouldn’t be sold like a commodity for easy millions and that these profit-driven deals will fuel more urban growth at the expense of rural communities.\n\nCibola is a community of about 300 people surrounded by farm fields and a wildlife refuge of forests and wetlands, a place where residents must drive half an hour to the nearest supermarket, across the river in Blythe, California. There is one main bridge leading from California into Cibola, and on weekends people often bring boats to launch from ramps into the river.\n\nOne of Greenstone’s leading critics is Holly Irwin, a La Paz County supervisor who lives in Cibola near the fields where the company has proposed to stop irrigating and supply water for housing.\n\nShe said this sale of water rights, if endorsed by the federal government, would open the door to other deals in areas along the Colorado River, allowing a wave of water transfers that would leave farming towns with less and damage their economies.\n\n“They feel that they can do a land grab and just flip it and make a make a ton of money off of it,” Irwin said. “I think it's wrong for them to be able to come here and just purchase property for the sole purpose of just making a big buck off of it by transferring the water.”\n\nInvestors have increasingly sought farmland with reliable water supplies in the Colorado River Basin as hotter temperatures caused by climate change have intensified more than two decades of drought and added to the river’s chronic overallocation problem. With the river’s largest reservoirs now at their lowest levels since they were filled decades ago, the federal government’s first-ever declaration of a Colorado River shortage will trigger major water cutbacks next year for farmers in parts of central Arizona.\n\nSome Arizona cities have for years been searching for new sources of water they can buy and import through the Central Arizona Project Canal to ease their reliance on groundwater and enable growth. That’s where Greenstone comes in.\n\nThe Phoenix-based water investment company was established in 2010. It says on its website that it \"has an interest in acquiring and developing water assets located throughout the western United States.\" Its investors include the financial services conglomerate MassMutual as well as various public-employee pension funds.\n\nGreenstone, through the affiliated company GSC Farm LLC, in January secured approval from the Arizona Department of Water Resources to permanently sell its annual entitlement of 2,033 acre-feet of Colorado River water, enough to supply more than 6,000 single-family homes in Queen Creek, where local officials say they need the water to reduce reliance on groundwater and support plans for more growth. The sale price: about $21 million.\n\nExecutives of the investment company now must wait for an environmental review by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Irwin and other local officials in western Arizona have vowed to continue fighting what they call a despicable water grab.\n\n“We have the right to develop as well, and not to rape us of our water so the metropolitan areas can prosper. It's not fair,” Irwin said. “It sets a bad precedent. I think it's opening Pandora's box and it's a very dangerous policy.”\n\nIf the water sale is allowed to go forward, she said, one company after another will try to follow suit to buy more land and strip away the water.\n\n“It's going to be devastating for all the counties that are up and down the river,” Irwin said. “You start letting these fields go fallow and then you're just going to create a big dust bowl.”\n\n‘This gate should not be opened’\n\nWater has been bought and sold in parts of the West for decades. But the deals have often involved small quantities of water and have been limited by various constraints and obstacles.\n\nIn each area of Arizona, investors who are trying to move water away from farmland for development face different rules and limitations.\n\nIn parts of central Arizona where groundwater is regulated, for example, owners of farmland with “grandfathered” pumping rights can stop irrigating and profit from the water by selling “extinguishment credits,” which cities and developers rely on while lining up supplies. Much of the growth around Phoenix has for decades depended on retiring farmlands and converting fields to rooftops.\n\nIn farming areas around Yuma, in contrast, landowners entitled to receive water to irrigate fields are barred — at least under current rules — from selling water for use elsewhere.\n\nBut in rural La Paz County, Greenstone and other landowners have argued they ought to be able to sell and transfer Colorado River water.\n\nGreenstone has invested in farmland in all these areas. In Yuma County, these land purchases have provoked alarm among some in the agriculture business.\n\nProperty records show that Greenstone-linked companies, which appear in public documents under the same corporate address, own at least 2,682 irrigable acres in Yuma County’s Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District, representing about 5% of irrigable acres in the district.\n\nFarms in the district produce lettuce and other crops that, along with farms in California’s neighboring Imperial Valley, supply a large portion of the country’s winter vegetables.\n\nRecords from the county and the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation District show that Gila Seco Farm LLC, one of the Greenstone-affiliated companies, now owns more irrigable acres than any other single entity in the district and has become its fourth-largest single water user.\n\nDefenders of Yuma agriculture have voiced concern about these purchases, saying they raise suspicions that the company could seek to change the rules to make water transfers possible.\n\nDuring a state-convened hearing on Greenstone’s proposal in Yuma in 2019, many stood to denounce the plan.\n\n“This is a company that treats water as an asset to be sold for profit,” said Wade Noble, a lawyer who represents Yuma County agricultural irrigation districts. “The land in Cibola Irrigation District was chosen, not for farming but for its expected transferable water rights.”\n\nAs the rules now stand, Yuma irrigation districts control the water contracts, Noble said, so Greenstone would “have to get control of the irrigation boards.” Noble said once Greenstone’s people do, “then they expect to be able eventually to open up the contracts in Yuma County so that the water can be transferred.”\n\nHe referred to the bestselling book “Barbarians at the Gate” and said that title fits the situation.\n\n“The barbarians are at our gates. They are, in fact, within the walls. This gate should not be opened,” Noble said, and the audience applauded and cheered.\n\nNoble is the coordinator for the Yuma County Agriculture Water Coalition, which includes irrigation districts and a water users association. He stressed that there is reason to be alarmed about investors who see dollar signs in permanently moving water away from agriculture.\n\n“These companies come in, they buy land, they farm it, and then they also express intent to be able to be compensated for transferring the water off of it,” Noble said.\n\n“It also happens with a lot of our local farmers. The siren song of making big money on your water ... that siren song is hard to resist,” Noble said. “But the overall effect is you're crippling economies, you're crippling the food supply of the nation. And that's just not a good thing.”\n\nRepresentatives of Greenstone declined a request for an interview.\n\nGrady Gammage Jr., a lawyer who represents the company, has said the proposal wouldn’t open “any floodgates” for many other such transfers to occur.\n\n\"There is plenty of water on the river for both urban growth and continued agricultural use,” Gammage said in an interview earlier this year. “This is not in any way going to cause some catastrophic result.”\n\nWater investors:Tensions rise over company's plan to sell Colorado River water in Arizona\n\nBuying land for water\n\nIt’s not easy to get a complete picture of the land, and the water that comes with it, owned by investors like Greenstone. The Republic reviewed deeds data to better understand the access to water that Greenstone and other companies have through their landholdings and what this could mean for the future of water markets in the West.\n\nCounty assessors’ records show that 15 limited liability corporations (LLCs) listed under the same address as Greenstone own about 8,863 acres in La Paz, Pinal and Yuma County. Further review of property records like deeds, requests for easements and requests to transfer the irrigation status of land, show documents signed by Greenstone CEO Michael Schlehuber, further linking the company to these LLCs.\n\nThe total purchase price of this land was nearly $66 million, property records show.\n\nGreenstone shares a family tree with other big players in trading water resources in the West. Schlehuber once worked for Vidler Water Company and Water Asset Management was founded by one of Vidler’s cofounders. Those companies own thousands of acres in counties that contain much of Arizona’s irrigated farmland.\n\nThe Republic’s analysis of property records found that Vidler owns about 2,439 acres in La Paz and Maricopa County. LLCs connected with Water Asset Management own another 6,202 acres, mostly in Maricopa and Mohave but also in Yuma County. Property records show the parcel owners are LLCs named after WAM's investment vehicles and list an ownership address that is the same as WAM's.\n\nThe investments by these two companies go beyond the ones in Arizona. Between them, they have assets in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada and New Mexico.\n\nMost of the land owned by the LLCs related to Greenstone lies in Yuma County, where on Nov. 3, 2016, property records show Schlehuber signed off on the transfer of the properties to the LLCs currently listed as the owners. Because those companies are registered in Delaware, there are scant details about who is involved in the companies, but all were formed on the same date, about a month before the transfer, and use the same registered agent. Property data for land owned by the companies registered in Delaware also list the owner’s address as the one used by Greenstone.\n\nUnlike the water entitlements tied to the land in Cibola, which are held by a Greenstone LLC, the water that flows to farmland in Yuma County is based on higher-priority rights and is administered by irrigation districts like the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District and the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District. This means that, under the current rules, a single landowner cannot independently strike a deal to move water to another community like the agreement between Greenstone and Queen Creek.\n\nDecisions about water in the irrigation districts are made by the district boards. Some people critical of water transfer deals, like Noble, say that buying up irrigable land is one way to gain influence on these boards, ultimately paving the way for more transfers.\n\n“They can do that in many ways, by persuading board members or by becoming board members themselves and having others elected to the board position where they can control the board,” Noble said in an interview. “Under those circumstances, regardless of which irrigation district it is, if you have control of the board, then you'll start seeing movement of water itself as they are enticed by the profits to be made.”\n\nFor now, the land the Greenstone-related companies own in Yuma County is being irrigated for farming, records show. Gammage, the attorney who represents Greenstone, has said that on a day-to-day basis, the company is “primarily engaged in farming” on thousands of acres that produce alfalfa, cotton, wheat, citrus and other crops.\n\n“It has its own farm team and has invested millions into its farming operation over the years,” including for farm equipment and ditches, Gammage said in an email.\n\nGreenstone-related LLCs own at least 2,682 irrigable acres in the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District, about 5% of all irrigable acres in the district. One company, Gila Seco Farm, LLC, owns more irrigable acreage than any other single entity in the irrigation district and is the fourth-largest user of water, though the LLC uses less than its minimum allotment of water.\n\nCities and suburbs like Queen Creek have been under growing pressure to buy water supplies from farming communities as they seek to continue rapid growth.\n\nIn 1990, one year after the town was incorporated, Queen Creek's population was 2,667. In 2020, the population was nearly 60,000, and in the last decade, it grew by 126%, more than any other city or town in the state, the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau show.\n\nThe town estimates that its population is even higher, and its water service area goes beyond the town’s boundaries, supplying an estimated population of more than 90,000. To sustain this growth and meet the requirements of the state’s groundwater law, town officials say they plan to draw water from a variety of sources to avoid over-reliance on groundwater supplies, which have been declining in many areas and have posed challenges for other growing suburbs.\n\n“Our water strategy in Queen Creek is largely to diversity our water portfolio,” Queen Creek Town Manager John Kross said. “This relatively small amount that we’re hoping to acquire helps with that larger water sustainability strategy.”\n\nQueen Creek gets a relatively small amount of Colorado River water from the CAP Canal. The amount of water that Queen Creek is slated to receive through the deal would be enough to supply more than 6,000 single-family homes, based on average water use in the Phoenix area.\n\nFree-market forces are playing an increasing role in water management in the West, but water markets don’t necessarily need to threaten farming communities, said Robert Glennon, a water researcher and professor of law and public policy at the University of Arizona.\n\n“As the West enters an era of water reallocation, most of the water will come from farmers, who consume more than 70% of the region’s water,” Glennon wrote in an August article.\n\nMore efficient irrigation practices can allow farmers to produce similar crop yields, even with less water, Glennon said. He said Western states need a process that protects “the long-term viability of rural communities,” and he suggested urban water users could help fund new irrigation technologies for farmers, possibly bringing “a win-win solution to the West’s water crisis.”\n\n‘It’s our water’\n\nThe modern history of farming in Cibola began with farmers who came to the area after World War II, cleared desert brush, built canals and began pumping water from the Colorado River.\n\nPumps beside the river continue to hum in Cibola, sending water flowing through the canals to about 3,500 acres of irrigated land.\n\nOn one of the fields where Greenstone plans to stop irrigating, the alfalfa was ready for cutting one morning in May, the lush plants sprouting purple blossoms. A swather machine rolled across the field, leaving a clean path of fallen hay on the stubble.\n\n“Nothing better than fresh-cut alfalfa, the smell of it,” said farmer Michael Mullion, stopping his pickup beside the field.\n\n“This is second-year alfalfa,” Mullion said. “We'll get this year and two more years out of this, of course, depending on what Greenstone does.”\n\nMullion leases the land from Greenstone. He said much of the hay is trucked to dairies and cattle feedlots in California.\n\nMullion is the president of the Cibola Valley Irrigation and Drainage District, and his family has been farming here since the early 1950s, when his grandfather, Joe McCain, arrived from Mississippi and started clearing land and building irrigation ditches.\n\nBefore the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s, the river regularly swelled in floods, covering the area and depositing sediment. That made for fertile land along this curving stretch of the river, which for decades has produced cotton, hay, wheat and other crops.\n\nMullion said his grandfather used to say the Cibola Valley has “some of the best dirt around.”\n\n“We're farming the bottom of the Grand Canyon. That's what he used to always tell people,” Mullion said. “It's a great valley to farm in.”\n\nMullion is one of a handful of growers who work in Cibola, and he lives across the river in California. To get to his fields from Blythe, he passes through farmland in the Palo Verde Valley and then crosses a narrow bridge into Arizona.\n\nIn the 1950s, before there was a bridge, Mullion said his grandparents bought some old pontoons, put a camper trailer on them and ran a cable across the river. For a toll charge, farmers could transport their cotton and hay across the river on this raft, which someone would drive using the current and a fin.\n\nWhen traffic picked up in the 1960s, the farmers built a bridge. In 1976, during Hurricane Kathleen, floodwaters picked up debris and toppled the bridge. Afterward, farmers rebuilt the bridge. The county has since taken over the bridge and retrofitted it.\n\nToday Mullion and his father farm about 1,800 acres in the Cibola Valley, much of which they lease.\n\nMullion and other members of the irrigation district board voted to approve Greenstone’s proposal. Greenstone Managing Director Michael Malano is on the board but abstained from the vote.\n\nThe company is seeking to permanently transfer a “fourth-priority” water entitlement. Entitlements to Colorado River water in Arizona are divided into six levels of priority based on the doctrine of prior appropriation. The highest levels include some of the oldest “senior” rights, which are first in line in the priority system and are unlikely to see cuts, even in a shortage situation.\n\nThose with the most secure levels of senior water rights include entities such as the Yuma County Water Users’ Association, and a tribal nation, the Colorado River Indian Tribes, where people have grown crops along the river for centuries. Among those with mid-tier rights along the river, fourth-priority water users include farm companies, the Mohave Valley Irrigation and Drainage District, the town of Quartzsite and other entities.\n\nIf Greenstone’s deal secures federal approval and goes forward, it will mean some of the land Mullion now farms will be left largely dry and will be used to build homes. Mullion said he expects that as homes are built, it will bring more money into the community and there will still be a future for farming.\n\n“If this water transfer goes through, we will continue to farm in the Cibola Valley, for generations,” Mullion said. He has three daughters and said he’s confident “my kids will farm down here.”\n\nMullion said farmers in Cibola have long understood that in addition to buying land, they were buying water that would become more valuable in the future.\n\n“They always knew for years and years and years that eventually an urban area, Phoenix in particular,” Mullion said, “would have some interest in this water.”\n\nGrowing suburbs in central Arizona have relied heavily on groundwater, leading to overpumping and declining water levels in many areas. Given the strains on water supplies, growing suburbs will likely continue to search for more sources of water.\n\n“The value of our land is in the water,” Mullion said. “Without the water, the land would be worth nothing. So I think landowners and farmers should have every opportunity and right to market and sell their water.”\n\nOther farmers in the area agree and support Greenstone’s proposal.\n\n“It's their land, their water,” said Ron Swan, an 87-year-old grower. “It’s our water. We developed the water rights. I think we should be able to do what we want.”\n\nProposed water sale sparks fears\n\nIn her work as county supervisor, Irwin has researched the history of La Paz County’s creation after a referendum in 1982. She’s convinced powerful players at the time wanted to carve out the new county to make it a future source of water, a jurisdiction where groundwater could legally be pumped and moved elsewhere by canal to support the growing urban areas of central Arizona.\n\n“We were created because of the water,” Irwin said.\n\nIrwin said three parts of the area were envisioned as potential groundwater sources by state officials when they drew up the state’s Groundwater Management Act in 1980. That law regulated pumping in urban areas at a time when federal officials were imposing conditions for the construction of the Central Arizona Project Canal, which would bring Colorado River water to Phoenix and Tucson.\n\n“They needed to show a future water source in order to continue to get the funding for CAP,” Irwin said. The canal cost about $4.7 billion to build.\n\nThe formation of La Paz County was sold to residents in what then was part of Yuma County with promises of improving services and local government. But Irwin said her theory is that for key figures behind the push, it was really about the water. Voters approved the measure in 1982 and La Paz County was established the following year.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the city governments of Phoenix and Mesa bought farmland — “water farms” they were called — intending to eventually pump and transport groundwater to the cities to supplement their water supplies. Some people voiced concerns about the potential for exportation of groundwater, which led to discussions in the Legislature.\n\nIn 1991, when the Legislature barred the transport of groundwater from most rural areas to the state’s regulated “active-management areas,” three groundwater basins were included on a shortlist of exceptions: Harquahala Valley, McMullen Valley and Butler Valley, all in La Paz County. In those areas, with some restrictions, the rules allowed groundwater to be pumped and transferred elsewhere.\n\nSince then, some water investment firms, such as Vidler and Water Asset Management, have bought farmland in these areas seeking to sell the water.\n\nWhile considering options for augmenting water supplies in Arizona, state officials have recently discussed the possibility of moving water from farms in these valleys to urban areas.\n\n“I think that La Paz County was set up to be the sacrificial lamb,” Irwin said.\n\nAnd this history of establishing the county as a source of water for cities is concerning, Irwin said, because the rural desert communities need the water.\n\n“Not only are they targeting our groundwater basins,” she said, “now they're trying to grab water off the Colorado River.”\n\nIn April, Irwin contacted neighbors in Cibola and invited them to an informal meeting at the park on their street. They sat at picnic tables as Irwin explained her concerns about the Greenstone water deal.\n\n“We all believe that it sets a bad policy. You open the door for this to happen, and then you’re going to have other ones right behind them that are going to want to do the same thing,” Irwin told them.\n\n“You open the door for one, you’re going to have others coming behind. Because it’s all about the mighty dollar. It’s all about them making money,” she said. “They’re going to benefit millions and millions of dollars off this water if it gets transferred.”\n\nIrwin said the fight against the deal is “about the principle of keeping the water here, where it belongs, up and down for the river communities.”\n\nWhen Irwin had finished, one woman at a table asked: “What can we do?”\n\nIrwin said the Bureau of Reclamation would soon hold public hearings, and she urged people to speak out.\n\nLauren Cooley, another resident, said afterward that she shares Irwin’s concerns.\n\n“I don’t mind growth. But I just don’t understand water being taken away from communities and farms,” Cooley said.\n\nMark Bargman said he’s been coming to Cibola from Southern California since he was a boy, for about 50 years. At first, he came to camp, enjoying the remote areas where the Colorado River flows alongside bluffs in the desert.\n\nIn 2000, he and his wife Jeanne bought land and built a home. He and his family come regularly to boat on the river.\n\n“We all stand together on the fact that we don’t want the water to be diverted from our river,” Bargman said. “These big people from Wall Street are going to come here, 'We want that.' And they're going to take it. And I don't think that's right.”\n\nThe river’s flows already get quite low during part of the year, Bargman said, and he worries about how water transfers might affect the levels, which they count on for boating.\n\n“It's opening up a big can of worms. It's going to benefit some people that are doing current development, but it's going to hurt us here,” Bargman said. “We made a life here. We've built these places with our own hands and our backs, and I'm real proud of what we've done here. And now that's in jeopardy.”\n\nBargman said he’s concerned that “they're going to leave these areas dry, and it's going to create a dust bowl down here.”\n\n“It seems to me that the greed is just rampant in this country,” he said.\n\nLater that afternoon, Bargman backed his trailer down a ramp and his boat slid into a lagoon fringed with reeds.\n\nSoon he was speeding upriver. The yellow blossoms on palo verde trees whizzed past as the boat cut through the turquoise water. Bargman steered the boat toward a sandbar that formed an island. He cut the engine and jumped out barefoot on the sand. His cousin pulled up in another boat and two dogs scrambled onto the island.\n\nBargman said the water that flows in this section of the river, headed for farmland, is vital to his way of life.\n\n“We have a really good thing here. We don’t want it to go away,” Bargman said.\n\nWhen GSC Farm submitted its proposal in 2019, it sparked an outpouring of opposition in communities along the river. But the Arizona Department of Water Resources endorsed the proposal in September 2020, recommending the federal government's approval.\n\nInitially, ADWR Director Tom Buschatzke recommended allowing the transfer of only a portion of the water, a little more than half the proposed amount. Buschatzke said the idea was to keep enough water on the property to meet future needs as it's developed for housing.\n\nIn late January, opponents of the plan learned Buschatzke had, after receiving more information from the company, reassessed how much water should remain on the land. This reassessment dramatically increased the amount of water the company would be allowed to transfer, just a little less than its original request.\n\nThat change by the state drew strong criticism from local officials in western Arizona, who argued such a big increase ought to have involved another round of public hearings.\n\nMohave County supervisors have passed resolutions opposing the deal. And in a letter to the federal government last year, nine mayors of cities and towns along the river said the water transfer threatens to kill their agriculture industry and would be devastating for their communities.\n\nRep. Regina Cobb, R-Kingman, has tried to block the deal through a bill that would prohibit such water transfers, but the measure has failed to advance in the Legislature.\n\nCobb has warned that if the deal goes through, it would set a harmful precedent and put \"a big price tag on water,\" clearing the way for more deals to follow.\n\nNow that the state has signed off, the final step is for the Bureau of Reclamation to consider the proposal.\n\nThe rise of water investors\n\nRepresentatives of Water Asset Management declined requests for an interview. In response to a list of questions from The Republic, the private equity firm emailed a statement saying it works with farmers and ranchers to develop and implement “market-based, sustainable solutions to address water resource challenges.”\n\n“There is no single solution to the current situation in the Colorado River Basin, but we adamantly believe it is solvable if there is cooperation between rural and urban interests. It will take a thoughtful combination of improved conservation from every sector, water storage/banking, infrastructure development, institutional flexibility, partnerships among the states and with the tribes, and perhaps most importantly it will require leadership,” the firm said in the statement.\n\nWater Asset Management is headquartered in New York and has gradually expanded its investments in farmland and water over the past decade. It has invested over $300 million in agriculture in the West, Marc Robert, the company’s chief operating officer, said during a webinar last year.\n\n“We own a significant amount of Western agriculture,” Robert said. “And we’re firm believers that in order to solve the water availability issues in the West, you need to compel ourselves and our fellow landowners to operate more efficiently.”\n\nHe said the firm has assets in four states — Arizona, California, Nevada and Colorado — and is pursuing transactions in Texas and New Mexico. Its purchases have included about 2,300 acres of irrigated farmland in Colorado’s Grand Valley, which are being farmed to produce alfalfa, corn and wheat.\n\n“We focus on investing in farms with water-rich assets that have significant opportunities to become more efficient,” Robert said.\n\nThe Wall Street firm generally buys farms with flood-irrigated crops — such as alfalfa, cotton, corn or wheat — and aggregates them in groups of 2,000 acres or more, Robert said.\n\n“We then explore other opportunities to create sustainable businesses around those assets. That can include aquifer storage and recovery. It can include solar development. It can include other infrastructure improvements to the irrigation systems that would conserve water,” Robert said. It can also include land-fallowing programs in which farmers leave a portion of their land dry and unplanted on a rotating basis, freeing up water.\n\n“And to really crack this nut in the Colorado River Basin, you’re going to need the collaboration of the local farming community,” Robert said. “We use both agriculture and water as a way to improve their income statements, their balance sheets, but also to provide long-term supplies for the West.”\n\nDeals that move water away from farmland have bred distrust in some communities. Several years ago, the agency that manages the Central Arizona Project considered buying farmland in Mohave County and leaving some land fallow to put the water into the CAP Canal and send it to cities. Water Asset Management owns land where the water would have been transferred away. After an outpouring of opposition, the agency's directors dropped the proposal in 2018.\n\nRobert said the company began to invest in farmland in the Mohave Valley Irrigation and Drainage District in 2012 and within five years had bought 16 properties for $20 million.\n\n“We worked with our farm partners to put together a fallowing program which was approved not only by 11 neighbor farmers but also the Bureau of Reclamation,” Robert said.\n\nThe voluntary program has helped reduce water use, freeing up water that has been kept in Lake Mead, he said.\n\nThe Mohave Valley Irrigation and Drainage District’s land-fallowing program was approved by the Bureau of Reclamation, which provides the funding, said Kerri Hatz, the district’s general manager. In 2020, the district received nearly $1.2 million for the water that was conserved through fallowing of farmland, Hatz said, and those funds were paid to 11 participating farms.\n\nFarmers in the district left 1,196 acres dry and fallow last year, more than one-fourth of the district’s irrigated land, Hatz said in a letter detailing the program. That conserved water, which totaled 6,173 acre-feet, stayed in Lake Mead to help the reservoir’s levels, which have been dropping to new lows.\n\nThe district has continued the program this year, aiming to conserve more water in Lake Mead, Hatz said.\n\nRobert said the program “shows the level of potential for collaboration between private landowners and the larger community, when properly incentivized.” He said the firm has been involved in fallowing programs in three states.\n\nProperty records show that Water Asset Management and Vidler both own farmland in the Harquahala Valley, one of the groundwater basins where state law allows groundwater to be pumped and transferred to other areas. Emails released by state agencies show these companies and Greenstone have regularly talked with officials about planned water deals.\n\nVidler lists a portfolio of investments in six Western states, from New Mexico to Idaho. In Arizona, the company says on its website that its investments in the Harquahala Valley go back to the mid-1990s, when it bought over 18,000 acres, with its exportable water.\n\n“The project was sold in multiple transactions over several years to a power company, a golf course developer and finally, in June 2005, to a real estate developer,” the company said, generating about $110 million in proceeds.\n\nVidler kept some land in Harquahala and in 2013 sold 1,021 acres and the associated groundwater to two Scottsdale golf courses for $10 million. In 2015, the company agreed to sell 258 acres and the remaining transferable water rights to Scottsdale, leaving the company with water rights that can only be used on Vidler’s 1,926 acres in the Harquahala Valley.\n\nAmong its current projects, Vidler lists its underground water storage facility in Harquahala, where the company has been banking Colorado River water on the expectation that there will be demand for the water in the Phoenix area.\n\nGreenstone has also been involved in a variety of water transactions, according to its website, including sales of Rio Grande water rights in New Mexico, as well as sales of credits for halting groundwater pumping in parts of Arizona and sales of other water-storage credits.\n\nSome representatives of water investment firms say the private sector can be a helpful ally in addressing scarcity as climate change and drought shrink water supplies in the West.\n\nJames Eklund, a water lawyer and former director of the Colorado Water Conservation Board, serves as an adviser to Water Asset Management. Eklund told the Colorado Sun earlier this year that the investment firm purchases farms, pays for upgrades that improve water efficiency and leases land back to farmers.\n\nEklund said these types of investments can help address water challenges while preventing “buy-and-dry” water deals that leave farmland dry.\n\nEklund has advocated what water managers in the Upper Colorado River Basin call “demand management” plans, which would pay farmers and ranchers to voluntarily and temporarily turn over some of their water to help boost depleted reservoirs.\n\nIn an article in April, Eklund wrote that paying farmers to leave some of their water in the river is a “critical tool” that can help “control the system’s descent.” He said this can encourage conservation and innovation, as well as farming practices that can capture carbon in soil to help address climate change.\n\nWithout these sorts of alternatives, rural areas could end up facing more of the sort of “buy-and-dry” land deals that people fear, Eklund told The Arizona Republic. “If you don’t do anything, that’s the fastest path to buy-and-dry,” he said, because cities eventually won’t have other options.\n\nIn Eklund’s opinion, government officials at all levels have been “lethargic in their responses” to the Colorado River crisis. He said he thinks private investors can help.\n\nEklund said that he doesn’t want to see farms eliminated and that he’s turned town potential clients who’ve asked him to work on deals that would leave farmland dry.\n\n“If I could put a moratorium on buy-and-dry tomorrow, I would. But we have private property rights,” Eklund said, and when a farmer or rancher decides to sell, it’s a personal decision.\n\n“I don't begrudge them. I know exactly why they're doing it,” Eklund said. “But it's a tragedy of the commons, that if everybody does that, then nobody's going to the co-op, nobody's going to the school district, nobody's going to the restaurant. And these towns literally dry up.”\n\nIn Colorado, one example of what can go wrong, he noted, is Crowley County, where decades ago many farmers sold their land and water rights and moved away. The water has ended up supplying cities, leaving empty, dusty farmlands.\n\nEklund said he doesn’t want to see this sort of thing happen elsewhere. He comes from a ranching family. His parents own a cattle ranch in Plateau Valley, where he sometimes helps with chores like fixing fences.\n\n“Keeping land in agricultural production should be the focus,” Eklund said. “We should be doing everything we can to encourage that kind of investment.”\n\nProfit and perils\n\nGrowers and residents in rural communities along the river say preserving irrigated agriculture is critical for the food supply and rural economies, but that’s not in the calculus of those who see big profits in the water, said J.B. Hamby, vice president of the Imperial Irrigation District’s board.\n\nThe district in California’s Imperial Valley holds the single largest water entitlement on the Colorado River and delivers it to farms that produce hay and other crops from lettuce to carrots.\n\n“Water as a public resource is at risk of becoming privatized for profit,” Hamby said. “We know the statement, the truism in the West, that water flows uphill towards money, and the concern is that with the rise of these private companies seeking to make big profits off of drought and climate change, that they are going to be profiting at the expense of rural and agricultural communities.”\n\nHamby has joined a coalition of conservation activists who held a news conference at the Hoover Dam in July and declared that the federal government’s business-as-usual approach to managing the Colorado River is failing. He said farming communities will be in trouble if private companies are able to take large quantities of water away to feed more growth in the Southwest.\n\n“Rural agricultural communities are not reservoirs of water to be drained to continue relentless, reckless and unsustainable sprawl,” Hamby said. “It is just simply wrong that you have growth for some supported by the decline of others.”\n\nSome academic researchers say water transfers from farms to cities, if well-managed, can benefit communities on both sides. Doing so requires planning so the transfer of water compensates the region, not just the individuals who decide to sell water, said Dustin Garrick, an associate professor of global water policy at the University of Waterloo in Ontario and research fellow at the University of Oxford.\n\nGarrick and other researchers have studied the reallocation of water from rural to urban areas, and they’ve examined ways of making water trades mutually beneficial.\n\nPotential dangers arise when there is a “buy-and-dry mentality” in transactions that fail to account for risks to agricultural economies, Garrick said.\n\n“A buy and dry mentality concerns me because it means that these deals are happening in the absence of a regional development plan,” Garrick said in an email. “The priority is to involve those who are affected by these deals in the planning for mitigating their impacts. Efforts to rush these deals without attention to those who lose out, or perceive they do, always seems to come back to bite.”\n\nResearcher Elizabeth Koebele said both permanent selling of water rights and temporary water leases “will be an important tool” for adapting in the West.\n\nKoebele is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Reno, who has studied what role water markets can play in adapting to climate change. She said there are potential dangers if water transfers aren’t done carefully, ranging from lost food production to dust blowing from fields.\n\n“When we start talking about big investors,” Koebele said, “these concerns are exacerbated.”\n\nShe said policymakers could consider requiring that a percentage of the water remain on the land when a portion of the water is transferred.\n\nNicholas Schupbach, who leads investments in water rights for Barings, touted the potential for more deals in a 2020 report on water investing.\n\nHe noted that water rights values in Arizona have increased by about 10% per year from 2005 to 2018, \"and water scarcity is driving prices higher in most regions.”\n\nNear the fields that Greenstone plans to leave dry, 77-year-old farmer Claude Cranmer Jr. has been growing alfalfa for decades.\n\nCranmer, who goes by Junior, said he’s interested in selling some of his water and recently discussed the possibility with Malano of Greenstone.\n\n“He said, 'We've got plenty of buyers that want water out here,'” Cranmer said. “He said, 'We can get a good price out of it.’”\n\nCranmer said they met at the irrigation district office months ago when the water sale was being discussed.\n\n“He said he had more water buyers than he needed for his property that was going through,” Cranmer said.\n\nFor many years, Cranmer said he’s been expecting that the Phoenix area would eventually need more water, and he’s continued farming in hopes of being able to sell water.\n\nThe idea, he said, would be to use some of his land to develop and sell houses, and keep some water on the remaining land so he could still farm wheat, which consumes less than alfalfa.\n\nCranmer said he strongly believes Greenstone should be able to sell its water, and so should he.\n\n“I've been out here for 40 years trying to hang on to the water, using it. You've got to use it or you lose it,” Cranmer said, referring to a provision of state law that, with some exceptions, requires growers to keep irrigating or forfeit their rights.\n\n“You've got to keep farming it to keep the water. And that's why I was mainly doing it, was to hang on to the water,” he said. “Because I know it's climbing in price all the time.”\n\nCranmer said he isn’t sure how much his water is worth, but he thinks it should fetch a substantial price.\n\nEnvironmental coverage on azcentral.com and in The Arizona Republic is supported by a grant from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust.

The GOP and gas ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn 2019, the city council in Berkeley, California, held a stunning vote: it would ban natural gas hookups in all new building construction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the city’s impact on the climate crisis.\n\nNo gas furnaces in new homes, the council said. No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law. It’s meant a lot of active outreach to local developers building in Flagstaff, encouraging them to build all-electric housing developments. It’s also reaching out to residents whose gas appliances are at the end of their lifecycles to consider buying electric.\n\n“Our challenge here is we have a 2030 deadline” to get to net-zero, Antonopoulos told CNN. “The urgency is so great so sometimes we don’t have that luxury in time.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Mejia Cunningham was speaking on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/05/10/social-security-cola-2024-smaller-for-retirees/70197168007/", "title": "How will your Social Security COLA change in 2024?

That’s sharply lower than the four-decade high of 8.7% COLA in 2023.\n\nFor the average retiree who got a monthly check of $1,827 this year, the bump would mean an additional $56.64 a month in 2024, boosting the typical payment to $1,883.64.\n\n“Without an accurate cost of living adjustment (COLA) that keeps pace with rising costs, beneficiaries lose purchasing power, especially over the course of a retirement that could last 25 to 30 years,” said Mary Johnson, the league's policy analyst for Social Security and Medicare. This can lead to hardships like lost savings, growing debt and declining health, she added.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nMore 'Golden Girls' than 'Friends':Can home sharing be the answer to America's housing affordability crisis? These housemates think so.\n\nWhat is the current COLA rate?\n\nThe Social Security Administration bases its COLA each year on average annual increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, or CPI-W, from July through September. The CPI-W largely reflects the broad CPI that the Labor Department releases each month but differs slightly. Last month, while the CPI rose 4.9%, the CPI-W increased 4.6%.\n\nThe league uses the most recent inflation data to keep a running projection of what COLA might be next year.\n\nWhat to expect:2023 Social Security COLA increase\n\nShrunken assets:Bear market fears and retirees: Seniors take steps to protect savings against stock plunge\n\nInsufficient COLA:Retirement dreams become nightmares for many older Americans as inflation soars\n\nWhen is Social Security COLA announced?\n\nThe next COLA will be announced in October and be effective starting January 2024.\n\nWho qualifies for COLA increase?\n\nAbout 70 million Americans receive benefits from programs administered by the SSA, with retired workers and their dependents accounting for 76.9% of benefits paid in 2022.\n\nNearly 9 out of 10 people aged 65 and older received a Social Security benefit as of Dec. 31. Among them, 12% of men and 15% of women rely on Social Security for 90% or more of their income.\n\nAll of these people rely on COLA to ensure their purchasing power isn't eroded by inflation.\n\nThough that’s the aim, COLA has failed, Johnson claims.

That was the deepest loss in buying power since the league began tracking this data in 2010.\n\nThis year, it found that the loss of buying power slightly improved – by 4 percentage points – to 36%. “However, that is still one of the deepest losses recorded by this study, exceeded only by the loss in 2022,” Johnson said.\n\nMemories fade:Report: Up to 18% of adults over 60 have early stages of memory loss, cognitive problems\n\nChange needed:Want to live independently into old age?

But the stirrings of political opposition to an endless US role in the war are growing on both sides of the aisle just two weeks before the November midterms.\n\nEven the slightest hint of a softening of American resolve could comfort Putin as the Kremlin strongman prepares to inflict a painful winter on Ukrainian civilians and Europeans reliant on Russian gas.\n\nIn what can only be described as a political debacle on Tuesday, progressive Democrats published, then withdrew, a letter initially signed in June that called on the White House to match its effort to arm Ukraine with a strong diplomatic effort to engage Russia and seek a ceasefire. This came days after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the possible next speaker, warned that Kyiv could not expect a “blank check” on aid if the GOP is in charge next year.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback McCarthy threatens to cut aid to Ukraine if GOP win midterms 02:36 - Source: CNN\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that the GOP leader was forced into a damage control operation with national security leaders in his conference and insisted he didn’t want to cut aid to Ukraine, but merely to ensure tax-payer dollars were not automatically rubber-stamped for the war. The furor over his remarks, reported by CNN’s Melanie Zanona, Kylie Atwood, Jeremy Herb and Katie Bo Lillis, shows the fine line McCarthy will have to walk on the issue if the GOP wins the majority.\n\nFor example, ex-President Donald Trump, a possible future Republican candidate, has been complaining about the cost of supporting a government locked in a struggle with his hero, Putin, and that he dragged into his first impeachment by using military aid in a coercion scheme. Trump will be a huge influence on any future Republican House majority after the midterms.\n\nEx-President Donald Trump, a possible future Republican candidate, has, meanwhile, been complaining about the cost of supporting a government locked in a struggle with his hero, Putin, and that he dragged into his first impeachment by using military aid in a coercion scheme.\n\nIt’s clear that a bipartisan consensus for aiding Ukraine still exists in Washington. But the rumblings that Biden’s hardline on Russia may not always enjoy near unanimous support came at an especially sensitive time as the West seeks to discredit Russia’s latest round of nuclear rhetoric – a warning that Kyiv could use a dirty bomb. The claims have led to high-level talks between US and Russian military chiefs and are widely being interpreted as either more scare tactics or perhaps an attempt by Moscow to create a false flag operation that could be used as a pretext for its own use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Retired general: Russia accusing Ukraine of planning a 'dirty bomb' could be a warning 01:56 - Source: CNN\n\nSeeking to highlight US and Western commitment to Ukraine amid the political chatter, Biden delivered a fresh warning on Tuesday against the use of smaller-yield nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n“Let me just say: Russia would be making an incredibly serious mistake for it to use a tactical nuclear weapon,” Biden told reporters after he was asked whether Russia was preparing to use a dirty bomb. “I’m not guaranteeing you that it’s a false flag operation yet, don’t know, but it would be a serious, serious mistake.”\n\nThe President’s comments were a reminder that the maneuvering in Washington over Ukraine aid is taking place in a critical context, with anxiety still acute over a possible escalation of the war that could spill over into direct US-Russia hostilities and put the world on a disastrous path toward a full-on nuclear escalation.\n\nThis is why signs of fraying political resolve in the United States, and in some allied nations, are so significant. They could convince Putin that a war of attrition over the winter could sooner or later cause fatigue in the West and therefore weaken Ukraine’s ability to fight.\n\nQuestions that need to be asked\n\nAnd yet some of the questions raised by those who are cautious about the US stance are relevant and important. A foreign policy operation that lines up the United States against its former Cold War foe and nuclear rival must be constantly evaluated and justified by the President, given the cost and risks.\n\nThe fact that there is no diplomatic track in the conflict – Biden has several times mused privately that he doesn’t know what Putin’s “off-ramps” might be – is worthy of discussion and, potentially, testing in contacts with Moscow. And at a time of raging inflation and economic hardship in the United States, it is incumbent on the administration and its supporters to demonstrate to American taxpayers why a war on the edge of Europe is sucking up billions in public money, even if it’s not as if Ukraine currently has the “blank check” McCarthy mentioned.\n\nThe risk, though, is that such debates still play into the hands of Putin, who has already demonstrated his capacity to exploit and widen US political divides with his election-meddling scheme in 2016 and the hold he had over Trump, even getting him to denounce US intelligence agencies in a joint news conference.\n\nSooner or later, the political jousting in Washington over how long the US should stay involved in arming Ukraine – and how much it would cost – will stumble on the critical questions that could decide the war and could be the motivation for Putin’s frequent escalation of nuclear rhetoric that raises the stakes.\n\nIs the West as dedicated as Putin, whose political survival may depend on victory or at least not losing, to prevailing in Ukraine? And is it really willing to enter into a dangerous cycle of escalation that could risk wider nuclear war to do so?\n\nPolitical drama on both sides of the aisle\n\nIt is with these questions lingering that the drama over a letter signed by 30 progressives played out on Tuesday. Most of the members did not endorse releasing the letter this week, and some said they wouldn’t have signed it now given the grave turn the war has taken in recent days. The anger over the letter caused Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to withdraw the letter, saying it was drafted months ago and released by staff without vetting.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Liberal Democrats abruptly withdraw letter on Ukraine policy amid anger 02:56 - Source: CNN\n\nThe episode did not just threaten to expose vulnerable lawmakers just two weeks before an election in which Democrats increasingly fear they will lose the House. It could give McCarthy cover in a future Congress to argue that opposition to Biden’s multi-billion dollar arms packages is not just a Republican preoccupation.\n\nAnd while the letter was withdrawn, some of its sentiments could boil up again.\n\nThe letter said that lawmakers were under no illusions about the difficulty in engaging Russia, given its “outrageous and illegal invasion of Ukraine.” But it added: “If there is a way to end the war while preserving a free and independent Ukraine, it is America’s responsibility to pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that the terms that Russia has set for any peace deal involve locking in its battlefield gains. Now that it has illegally annexed several Ukrainian regions, any preconditions that Putin would set would be impossible for Kyiv to agree to. And rolling back such positions would deal the Russian leader the defeat he is desperate to avoid. So while the idea of talking might seem appealing, it’s not clear how the US could shift the calculus of either side. And Biden has repeatedly insisted he will not negotiate over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s head, as Putin would like.\n\nOne progressive Democrat, Rep. Ro Khanna of California, told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga that he did not support the decision to pull back the letter.\n\n“I think the letter was common sense,” Khanna said. “I support making sure we arm Ukraine and provide arms to Ukraine and continue to fund it, but I also believe that the President, as he said, we are at a risk of nuclear war.”\n\n“Don’t you think our counterpart should be talking to Russia? Of course they should to be sure that it doesn’t escalate.”\n\nThere is also a risk that diplomacy at this stage could offer Putin a prize for the human carnage he perpetrated in Ukraine.\n\n“There is moral and strategic peril in sitting down with Putin too early. It risks legitimizing his crimes and handing over parts of Ukraine to Russia in an agreement that Putin won’t even honor,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut wrote in a tweet on Tuesday.\n\n“Sometimes, a bully must be shown the limits of his power before diplomacy can work.”\n\nOne thing that the drama over the Democratic letter on Ukraine did achieve was to show that while support for Ukraine is bipartisan, anxiety about the war is too, even if the skeptics are a smaller group so far.\n\nWhat a Republican House could mean for Ukraine\n\nThe prospect of a House more squarely in Trump’s ideological image after the midterm elections and of more GOP senators who share his “America First” worldview will worry the administration.\n\n“I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,” McCarthy said in an interview with Punchbowl News last week, which was seized upon by Democrats.\n\nBut it did not necessarily mean the California lawmaker was determined to cut off aid. He may simply have been creating some political room for himself in the knowledge of the sensitivity of the issue in his pro-Trump party. In theory, a speaker McCarthy would be able to pass a Ukraine funding bill by using both Republican and Democratic votes.\n\nBut whether his own position in a fractious GOP conference would allow him to do so is another matter. That’s one reason why there is growing talk in Washington that Democrats might try to pass a mammoth bill during the lame-duck Congress, which they will still control after the midterms even if the GOP wins, to carry Ukraine through next year’s fighting.\n\nMcCarthy is not the only Republican sounding skeptical notes. Ohio Republican Senate nominee J.D. Vance said he didn’t really care about what happened to Ukraine before the invasion and that the US should worry about the influx across its own southern border. (His comment has been used by Democratic opponent, Rep. Tim Ryan, who is seeking to make inroads among the state’s significant Ukrainian exile community). Vance is one of a new breed of potential GOP senators that could prove more skeptical to aiding Ukraine than the old guard of senior leaders like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and hawkish South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\nSimilar sentiments to Vance’s are often heard on conservative media. But those opinions usually discount the broader implications of the war in Ukraine. The conflict is so important because it represents more than a territorial spat on the far edges of Europe. It is a fight for democracy itself. If Ukraine falls, Russia will establish the principle that a large authoritarian nation can simply wipe a smaller neighbor off the map.\n\nThis would have grave consequences in other conflicts – for example, over Taiwan amid rising concerns China could try to take back the democratic island by force. And a Russian victory in Ukraine could directly threaten America’s NATO allies and bring the US closer to a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}]}

Col. George Bivens said.\n\nOfficials have said they hope the pressure being put on Cavalcante through the exhaustive search will cause him to make a mistake, leading to his capture, especially as he grows tired, hungry and desperate.\n\n\"I'm quite confident that we're wearing him down,\" Bivens said.\n\nMeanwhile, the heat and humidity was posing challenges for the searchers, who Bivens said were dedicated to the hunt.\n\nCavalcante, a Brazilian national and former agricultural worker, is considered extremely dangerous by authorities. In August, he was sentenced to life in prison for brutally stabbing his former girlfriend Deborah Brandao in front of her two young children. He is also wanted in connection with a murder in Brazil.\n\nBrandao's family has been \"barricaded\" inside their homes during the search and are under protection, District Attorney Deborah Ryan said Thursday.\n\n\"They are terrified,\" Ryan said.\n\nBrandao's sister, Sarah Brandao, told CNN she is caring for the two children and is afraid Cavalcante could come after their family. USA TODAY has reached out to Brandao's family.\n\n\"I haven't slept for many days,\" Sarah Brandao told CNN. \"I have been waking up with fright at night.\"\n\nThe combined total reward for information leading to Cavalcante’s capture is at $20,000 as of Wednesday.\n\n\"We are not going any place until we have him in custody,\" Bivens said. \"We will continue the manhunt.\"\n\nSearch crews are battling heat, humidity in manhunt\n\nThe hundreds of law enforcement officials combing through the search perimeter were bogged down in bullet-resistant vests, full uniforms and weapons while the temperature got up to 94 degrees with humidity making it feel like 103 on Thursday, according to AccuWeather.\n\nSearchers are taking water breaks as necessary and morale is high, Bivens said Thursday.\n\n\"I have not heard a single complaint,\" he said. \"I believe our people are up to the task.\"\n\nBivens said even the technology being used to try and track Cavalcante is being impacted by heat. For example, thermal imaging might pick up additional hot spots that require searchers to \"check a few more things,\" but said it wasn't a deterrent to using the resources.\n\nSchools, Longwood Gardens reopen after most recent perimeter shift\n\nWith the changing area of focus, the two school districts that canceled classes Tuesday and Wednesday largely reopened on Thursday.\n\nKennett Consolidated School District in Chester County reopened all its schools except for one elementary school that remains in the new perimeter. The Unionville-Chadds Ford School District reopened all its schools.\n\nBoth districts said local law enforcement will provide additional security and that they are excusing absences of students whose families prefer to keep them home.\n\n\"We appreciate the impact of prolonged stress and know that normalcy is needed,\" read a statement from John Sanville, superintendent of the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District, to parents. \"We share your hopes that the prisoner is captured today.\"\n\nLongwood Gardens, a popular tourist destination of about 200 acres of rolling meadows and expansive vistas, partially reopened Thursday after the police perimeter shifted eastward. The most recent images of Cavalcante, in which he has a backpack, duffel bag and a hoodie, were shot by a private trail camera at the botanical gardens Monday night.\n\nVideo shows Cavalcante's escape\n\nAn officer in a tower missed Cavalcante's stealthy walk up the wall the morning of Aug. 31 while his prison block was outside in the exercise yard, Howard Holland, acting warden of Chester County Prison, said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nThe guard officer in the tower has been put on administrative leave, Holland said.\n\nSecurity footage shows the moment at about 8:50 a.m. that Cavalcante used his outstretched arms and legs to brace himself between two walls and \"crab-walk\" up before disappearing out of sight. From there, he pushed through razor wire, ran across the roof and scaled a fence lined with more razor wire, Holland said.\n\nIt's the second escape from the facility in recent months. In May, inmate Igor Bolte broke out from the same location in a similar way but was seen by the tower officer on watch and was quickly recaptured. Cavalcante's escape differed in two important ways: He had to get through new razor wire that was added after Bolte's escape and nobody saw him flee.\n\nCavalcante's disappearance was discovered nearly an hour later during an inmate count after the block returned from the yard.\n\nHolland said officials now realize the razor wire wasn't enough, and are working on plans to better secure the prison through physical barriers and increased staff. Instead of a fence with an open top, Holland said engineers are working on a plan to enclose fencing to make it more like a cage that can't be scaled.\n\n“While we believed the security measures we had in place were sufficient, they have proven otherwise,” Holland said.\n\nCavalcante killed ex-girlfriend to silence her about Brazil murder\n\nIn April 2021, Cavalcante went to Brandao’s Schuylkill Township home, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and stabbed her 38 times, killing the woman in front of her 4- and 7-year-old children, according to the Chester County District Attorney’s Office. The two dated for about a year-and-a-half.\n\nParamedics rushed Brandao to a nearby hospital, where she was soon pronounced dead.\n\nWith the help of others, Cavalcante fled but was eventually tracked down and arrested in Virginia.\n\nIn multiple domestic violence attacks, Calvalcante had previously “threatened to kill” Brandao, investigators found. They said Cavalcante fatally stabbed Brandao because she had learned about his open murder warrant in Brazil and had “threatened to expose him to the police,” according to the DA’s office.\n\nRafael Pinto Alamy, a homicide prosecutor in the Brazilian state of Tocantins, previously told USA TODAY that Cavalcante is accused of fatally shooting Válter Júnior Moreira dos Reis on Nov. 5, 2017, in the rural municipality of Figueiropolis.\n\nThe killing allegedly occurred over a car repair debt Moreira dos Reis, a 20-year-old-student, owed to Cavalcante, the Tocantins public ministry said in an email.\n\nThe case was suspended when Cavalcante fled to the United States, Pinto Alamy previously said. He added that Cavalcante, whose first name is listed as \"Danilo\" in his native country's records, lived on a farm and was an agricultural worker in Brazil.\n\nCavalcante first went to Puerto Rico, where he got a fake ID, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. He eventually moved to Chester County in southeast Pennsylvania because he had a sister and friends who were living in the area, the outlet reported.\n\nCavalcante most recently lived in Royersford, a small town 32 miles northwest of Philadelphia, according to court records.\n\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/06/danelo-cavalcante-press-conference-livestream/70775141007/", "title": "Danelo Cavalcante livestream: Police update escaped PA prisoner ...", "text": "Law enforcement is providing an update Wednesday afternoon on efforts to recapture Danelo Souza Cavalcante, a convicted murderer who escaped from a Pennsylvania prison last week.\n\nThe press conference from the Pennsylvania State Police and the Chester County District Attorney's Office will be at 3 p.m. ET.

He passes multiple police checkpoints on short drives around Mendenhall, a small town in southeast Pennsylvania, where he's lived for over two decades.\n\nBuffum is one of thousands of residents whose daily lives have been disturbed by Cavalcante and the exhaustive search to find him. Many remained on edge as the massive manhunt entered its seventh day Wednesday.\n\nHundreds of law enforcement officers from local, state and federal agencies using helicopters, drones and dogs focused their efforts on a perimeter a few miles south of the prison in hopes to force the fugitive into a mistake as he grows more tired, hungry and desperate.\n\nCavalcante made his way out of the Chester County Prison, about 25 miles west of Philadelphia, just days after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for brutally stabbing his ex-girlfriend Deborah Brandao to death in front of her two young children.\n\nCavalcante made his escape while waiting to be moved to a state prison.\n\n'For my children especially, I'm very concerned'\n\nChester County's Unionville-Chadds Ford School District and the Kennett Consolidated School District extended schools closures from Tuesday into Wednesday.\n\n\"This is a difficult scenario to navigate and we appreciate your patience as we try to keep up with events as they unfold,\" read a statement from John Sanville, superintendent of the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District. \"Please know that our desire is to bring students into school – but we must weigh that against the circumstances and logistics that we face in the interest of the safety of our students and community.\"\n\nFour of Buffum’s children, ages 3 to 8, attend schools well within the current search perimeter. They stayed home Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nBuffum has made a habit of checking on his friends and neighbors and has begun to make frequent patrols around his property. He also put up security cameras around his house and has been monitoring them constantly over the past few days.\n\n“For my children especially, I'm very concerned,” he said. “I don't want him to get into my house. I've been on high alert since he got out.”\n\nLocal bakery owner says business has slowed amid manhunt\n\nDeisy Tapia, 30, has owned Deisy’s Cake Shop in the the Kennett Square Historic District for three years. She told USA TODAY on Wednesday that business has slowed since late last week.\n\n“It’s not common for us to be this slow, especially this time of year,” she said. “I guess people aren’t going out.”\n\nTapia said she's had to drive her 9-year-old daughter to and from the private school she attends since her local school district, which provides bus transport, shut down.\n\nHer daughter \"started crying and was scared,\" after Tapia told her of Cavalcante’s escape, the business owner told USA TODAY.\n\n“She's young, so she doesn't understand much but the little that she can understand is definitely impacting her,” Tapia said, adding, “It's definitely traumatizing, to some point, for the younger kids.”\n\nHow common are prison escapes?\n\nResearch shows that prison escapes, while uncommon in general, usually happen in low-security and locally run facilities, said Bryce Peterson, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and senior research scientist at the CNA Center for Justice Research and Innovation. He said it’s hard to estimate how many prison breaks happen in the U.S. because there’s no comprehensive national data on them.\n\nPeterson’s research includes a 2016 report analyzing over 600 inmates who escaped prisons and jails in 2009. He told USA TODAY that in most cases, prison escapes aren’t as sensational as movies make them seem. Low-level offenders may simply walk away, or don’t return if they’re out on a work release.\n\n“That happens much more frequently than people breaking out of a facility, overcoming a barrier, overcoming a guard,” he said.\n\nCavalcante’s case is not the norm, Peterson said.\n\nWhile Cavalcante is on the loose, there’s not a guarantee that he may commit more violence. Peterson said in his research, less than 9% of escapees used violence in the community – but the more motivated someone is to stay out, the more likely they are to use violence.\n\nThe pending transfer to a state facility could have been a “catalyst event” prompting his escape, which Peterson said makes him more motivated to not get caught.\n\n“The two things that are important are: It’s unlikely he will use violence – not to say it can’t happen,” Peterson said, “And, almost always in these situations … people are going to get caught.”\n\nWhere are police searching for Cavalcante?\n\nPolice initially set up a perimeter around Pocopson Township, a residential neighborhood near the Chester County Prison, where Cavalcante had been spotted multiple times over Labor Day weekend. Officials on Tuesday shifted the perimeter south after a trail camera spotted Cavalcante on Monday night at Longwood Gardens, a popular botanical garden usually bustling with locals and tourists that was also closed on Wednesday because of the search.\n\nPennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said during a news conference Tuesday that Cavalcante's recent movement was a positive development because he is \"feeling the pressure\" and is running out of options.\n\n\"You’re dealing with someone who is desperate and doesn’t want to be caught,” Bivens said. “If he can find some shelter, if he can find some food, he’s going to take advantage of whatever he finds.”\n\nResidents warned to keep homes, cars locked and be vigilant\n\nHe encouraged local residents in the area to keep their home and cars locked since Cavalcante is likely looking for supplies and food. Bivens also asked that people check their home surveillance cameras and check on their neighbors while Cavalcante, who is considered extremely dangerous, is still on the run.\n\nFrom speakers in cars and helicopters, authorities have blasted a recording they obtained from Cavalcante’s mother in Portuguese, asking her son “to surrender peacefully.”\n\nA reward offered for information leading to Cavalcante's capture was increased to $20,000, authorities announced Wednesday.\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker, USA Today; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/05/danelo-cavalcante-prison-escape-chester-county-search/70763712007/", "title": "Manhunt for Danelo Cavalcante who fled Pennsylvania prison ...", "text": "The search for convicted killer Danelo Cavalcante who fled a Pennsylvania prison intensified Tuesday on its sixth day after a new sighting was captured on a trail camera at a popular botanic garden.\n\nTwo nearby school districts canceled classes. Officials urged local residents to be wary and keep homes and cars locked, and police broadcast a plea for surrender from the convict's mother.\n\nA massive dragnet initially focused on an area within a 2-mile perimeter largely around Pocopson Township, a residential neighborhood near the Chester County Prison. Officials on Tuesday expanded the perimeter to encompass an area south of the small town because it appeared Cavalcante had traveled farther away.\n\nCavalcante, 34, escaped from of the Chester County Prison on Thursday, about 25 miles from Philadelphia, where he was waiting to be sent to a state facility. His escape comes a week after Cavalcante was sentenced to life in prison without parole for fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, in front of her children. He's also wanted in connection with a 2017 murder in his native Brazil.\n\nSecurity at Longwood Gardens notified investigators that a private camera on Monday captured Cavalcante walking north around 8:21 p.m. and then south through the same location at 9:33 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said during a news conference Tuesday morning. The gardens, about 200 acres of rolling meadows, brimming gardens and winding paths, is usually packed with visitors but has closed during the search for the escaped inmate, WFMZ reported.\n\nThe photos show that Cavalcante obtained a backpack, a duffel bag, \"clothing and other items,\" Bivens said.\n\nBecause of the expanded perimeter, the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District and the Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County canceled classes for Tuesday.\n\n“That pressure that we’ve been putting on him is working,” Bivens said. “We squeezed him hard enough over a period of a few days and he was not able to get any relief, and (he) managed to find a place to get out.”\n\n“Obviously I wish we would have been able to capture him without him getting through that perimeter, but it's also not shocking,” he added. “It’s dark, it’s a large area. Not to make excuses, it’s just difficult terrain.”\n\nSuspected Cavalcante sightings\n\nThere have been five credible sightings of Cavalcante from witnesses since he fled the prison, including one instance in which a state trooper briefly chased him but was unable to capture the fugitive.\n\nLocal Pocopson Township resident Ryan Drummond told WPVI he believes Cavalcante got into his home and stole food late Friday night. Drummond told the outlet he got up after hearing a noise downstairs and, from his upstairs landing, watched a man matching Cavalcante's description walk out of the house.\n\nBy the time police arrived, the man was gone into the thick brush, Drummond told WPVI.\n\n\"Peaches, apples, green snap peas were missing,\" he said. \"We have a bunch of little steak knives and he could have taken one of those.\"\n\nJust after midnight on Saturday, Cavalcante was seen on a residential surveillance camera about a mile and a half from the prison with a backpack, according to the Chester County District Attorney's Office.\n\nCavalcante's mother aids authorities\n\nFrom speakers in cars and helicopters, authorities have blasted a recording they obtained from Cavalcante’s mother in Portuguese, asking her son “to surrender peacefully,” Bivens said.\n\nBivens urged local residents to familiarize themselves with Cavalcade's appearance, lock their doors, monitor their home security systems and check on their neighbors.\n\n\"You’re dealing with someone who is desperate and doesn’t want to be caught,” Bivens said. “If he can find some shelter, if he can find some food, he’s going to take advantage of whatever he finds.”\n\nA reward of up to $10,000 is being offered for any information that leads to Cavalcante's capture.\n\nHow exactly Cavalcante managed to escape the Chester County Prison remains unknown. A joint investigation into the matter is being handled by the Chester County District Attorney's Office and Pennsylvania State Police.\n\n'We miss normal'\n\nEileen Blass, a former USA TODAY photographer who lives about two miles from the prison, said the presence of law enforcement in her neighborhood over recent days has been constant.\n\nFrom her home in Pennsbury Township, she’s heard and seen police helicopters, drones and security checkpoints up and down the road she lives on.\n\nAccording to the Chester County District Attorney's Office, hundreds of law enforcement officers are involved in the manhunt. Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs and Border Protection were deployed on Monday to help in the search.\n\nBlass is one of many people within a 3-mile radius of the camera that captured Cavalcante on Monday night to receive a reverse 911 text notifying them that the search area had stretched farther south and encompassed Longwood Gardens.\n\n“We miss normal,” she said in an email.\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker, USA Today; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/08/danelo-cavalcante-escape-timeline/70795355007/", "title": "Danelo Cavalcante escape: Timeline of search for Pennsylvania ...", "text": "A prisoner's escape from a Pennsylvania prison last Thursday triggered a massive manhunt that is still unfolding as the man continues to elude capture.\n\nHundreds of law enforcement agents have descended in the past week on small suburban communities in southeastern Pennsylvania intent on the capture of convicted murderer, 34-year-old Danelo Cavalcante. But so far, helicopters, drones and dogs searching an ever-shifting perimeter have not gotten the fugitive back behind bars.\n\nHere’s a timeline of what we know of Cavalcante's escape and subsequent vanishing.\n\nCavalcante has eluded police for 9 days:What will it take for him to get caught?\n\nAugust 2023: Cavalcante sentenced to life in prison after 2021 killing\n\nCavalcante faces life behind bars after he was convicted last month of murdering his former girlfriend in front of her two young children.\n\nIt took a jury 15 minutes of deliberation before returning a guilty verdict against Cavalcante for stabbing 33-year-old Deborah Brandao to death in 2021 while her 7-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son were present, according to the Chester County District Attorney’s Office.\n\nIn April 2021, Cavalcante went to Brandao’s home, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and stabbed her 38 times. The two dated for about a year-and-a-half, during which time Cavalcante had \"engaged in a horrific pattern of domestic violence,\" District Attorney Deb Ryan has said.\n\nCavalcante, a Brazilian national and former agricultural worker, is also wanted for a 2017 murder of a 20-year-old man over a car repair debt in his native country, the district attorney's office has said. Investigators learned that Cavalcante fatally stabbed Brandao because she had learned about his open murder warrant in Brazil and had “threatened to expose him to the police,” according to the district attorney's office.\n\nWhen he escaped, Cavalcante was being temporarily held at Chester County Prison, about 25 miles west of Philadelphia, while awaiting transfer to a state facility to serve his sentence.\n\nMore:Prison escapes are rare, and most are soon caught\n\nAug. 31 around 9 a.m.: Cavalcante escapes\n\nCavalcante made his escape around 9 a.m. last Thursday, Aug. 31. His disappearance prompted an immediate search of the area as police and prison authorities deployed helicopters and dogs to locate the fugitive.\n\nAt the time, authorities said Cavalcante was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, grey shorts and white sneakers. A witness also initially spotted him almost an hour after his escape walking on Wawaset Road in nearby Pocopson Township.\n\nRyan had said early on that officials were concerned Cavalcante may get help from friends and family. The concern sprang from the fact that after Cavalcante murdered his girlfriend in April 2021, he was aided by others until he was apprehended in Virginia, authorities have said.\n\nLaw enforcement made it clear from the beginning that Cavalcante is considered extremely dangerous and that anyone who spots him should refrain from approaching him and call 911.\n\nSept. 1: U.S. Marshals join the hunt\n\nAt a press conference last Friday afternoon, it was announced that the United States Marshals Service was joining the search.\n\nAt the time, Ryan said officials no longer believed anyone to be helping Cavalcante evade authorities, and that the assumption was that he was hiding alone in the area. Ryan said Cavalcante has “nothing to lose,” and he could be capable of more dangerous crimes.\n\nLabor Day Weekend: Cavalcante spotted multiple times\n\nThe manhunt soon brought hundreds of law enforcement officers to southeastern Pennsylvania, disrupting the lives of thousands of residents, many of whom remain on edge about the fugitive's whereabouts.\n\nOn Monday, the hunt for the Cavalcante led officials to scour a small area near the prison where they believed the fugitive was hiding.\n\nPolice initially set up a perimeter around Pocopson Township, a residential neighborhood near the Chester County Prison, where Cavalcante had been sighted multiple times over Labor Day weekend. A state trooper even spotted the fugitive, leading to a brief chase.\n\nJust after midnight on Saturday, a residential surveillance camera captured Cavalcante about a mile and a half from the prison with a backpack, according to the Chester County District Attorney's Office.\n\nAnother resident reportedly saw Cavalcante in a creek bed behind their house in Pennsbury Township, a residential area several miles east of a popular botanic garden called Longwood Gardens.\n\nSept. 4 at 8:21 p.m.: Cavalcante seen on trail cam\n\nIn fact, Cavalcante was seen on Monday on a trail camera at Longwood Gardens, a popular tourist destination of about 200 acres of rolling meadows and brimming gardens. The gardens' private trail camera captured the most recent images of Cavalcante, in which he has a backpack, duffel bag and a hoodie.\n\nSecurity at Longwood Gardens notified investigators that a private camera showed Cavalcante walking north around 8:21 p.m. and then south through the same location at 9:33 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens previously said.\n\nSept. 5: Search shifts south\n\nThe sighting prompted officials on Tuesday to shift the search perimeter south of the initial target zone.\n\nFrom speakers in cars and helicopters, authorities have blasted a recording they obtained from Cavalcante’s mother in Portuguese, asking her son “to surrender peacefully.\"\n\nAs the search unfolded, the family of Brandao, the woman slain by Cavalcante, has been barricaded inside their homes under constant protection in case the fugitive decides to come after them.\n\nSept. 6: Released security footage shows escape\n\nOn Wednesday, officials released security footage that showed Cavalcante breaking free by \"crab-walking\" up a wall before he reportedly pushed through razor wire and ran across a roof to freedom.\n\nThe escape was revealed to have taken place while his prisoner block was outside in the exercise yard. An officer in a tower who didn't see him slip away has been put on administrative leave, Chester County Prison Howard Holland previously said.\n\nThe footage begins at about 8:50 a.m. when Cavalcante used his outstretched arms and legs to brace himself between two walls and \"crab walk\" up before disappearing out of sight. From there, he pushed through razor wire, ran across the roof, and scaled a fence lined with razor wire, Holland said.\n\nCavalcante's disappearance was discovered nearly an hour later during an inmate count after the block returned from the yard. Holland has said officials determined that the razor wire was insufficient as planning is underway to better secure the prison with physical barriers and increased staff.\n\nGeorgia:After body slamming student during arrest, Georgia school police chief placed on leave\n\nSept. 7: Search crews battle heat, humidity\n\nThroughout the week, the heat and humidity was posing challenges for the searchers, who Bivens said were dedicated to capturing Cavalcante as they hoped he grew tired, hungry and desperate.\n\nAs temperatures reached 94 degrees Thursday, the hundreds of law enforcement officials combing through the search perimeter were bogged down in not only full uniforms and weapons, but bullet-resistant vests.\n\nThe heat even got to the technology being used to track Cavalcante, Bivens said. For example, it was possible that thermal imaging might pick up additional hot spots, though Bivens assured said it wasn't a deterrent to using the resources.\n\nMeanwhile, the two school districts that had canceled classes Tuesday and Wednesday − Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County and the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District − largely reopened on Thursday.\n\nBoth districts said local law enforcement will provide additional security and that they are excusing absences of students whose families prefer to keep them home.\n\nWhat we know about Ta'Kiya Young:A pregnant Ohio mother's death by police sparked outrage\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Officials urged local residents to be wary and keep homes and cars locked, and police broadcast a plea for surrender from the convict's mother. Officials expanded the perimeter to encompass an area south of Pocopson Township, a residential neighborhood near the Chester County Prison, because it appeared Cavalcante had traveled farther away. His escape comes a week after Cavalcante was sentenced to life in prison without parole for fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, in front of her children.

Delaware reported seven COVID-19-related deaths the entire month.\n\nIt was reasonable to let go of some fear.\n\nNow, the forecast appears more bleak. In the weeks since, the rate of infection in Delaware has more than doubled.\n\nThe delta variant, which is more easily transmissible than other strains of COVID-19 and is fueling surges in cases across the nation, is now the most prevalent strain in the region.\n\nIt passed the alpha variant as the most detected variant in Delaware the second week of July, but no delta variant cases were sequenced in Delaware last week.\n\nThe delta variant's spread is leading local leaders across the country to consider reinstating some of their precautionary measures, including in Philadelphia where the local health department last Thursday recommended everyone, including vaccinated people, wear masks in public indoor spaces.\n\nThe situation has been described by many as a \"pandemic of the unvaccinated,\" as the COVID-19 vaccines appear effective against the delta variant, experts say.\n\nTHE DATA: Tracking coronavirus cases in Delaware\n\nCase and hospitalization levels in Delaware are still far lower than they were during the heights of the pandemic, but Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Division of Public Health, said the recent trends are putting the state at risk of having to \"go backwards.\"\n\n\"The best way to prevent that is more people getting vaccinated,\" Rattay said. \"If for whatever reason you're unwilling to get vaccinated you need to wear a mask when you're around other people.\"\n\nMore than seven months from the start of Delaware's vaccination campaign, 52% of Delawareans are considered fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBehind the rest of the country\n\nThe delta variant is about 50% more contagious than the alpha variant, which was the predominant variant in the U.S. in the spring. The alpha variant is considered about 50 percent more contagious than the original virus first identified in China in late 2019.\n\nThe delta variant has been the dominant strain in the U.S. since the beginning of the July and accounted for 83% of all cases in the week ending July 17, according to CDC data.\n\nIt has fueled stark increases in infection rates in southern states including Missouri, Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana, but only recently became the most prevalent strain in the mid-Atlantic.\n\nThe delta variant accounted for 69% of cases in the region in a two-week period ending July 17, according to the CDC. In the two prior weeks, it accounted for 44% of cases.\n\nThe increased presence of the delta variant in Delaware puts those most vulnerable to infection at greater risk for contracting COVID-19, said Dr. Bill Chasanov, an infectious disease physician at Beebe Healthcare.\n\nAmong those at risk are the 48% of Delawareans who aren't fully vaccinated, as well as residents who are immunocompromised. Those groups should consider practicing mitigation strategies like mask wearing and distancing, Chasanov said.\n\n\"Everyone needs to continue to make individual decisions about what precautions they should take,\" he said. \"There needs to be some individual decisions around what your vaccine status is, who are you around and what do you need to do to keep the people around you safe and you safe as well.\"\n\nChasanov said if conditions looked like \"we were moving backwards,\" the state would have to reconsider its recommendations, perhaps making them more \"aggressive,\" but Delaware isn't at that point.\n\nA Washington Post analysis last week found the current case rate considered among only unvaccinated residents is similar to what the case rate was for all residents on May 25, when 86.9 cases per day were reported. By comparison, when considering only the population at risk Missouri has returned to its case rate from Dec. 16.\n\nInfections are predominately occurring in unvaccinated people\n\nTo date, one-tenth of 1% of Delawareans who are fully vaccinated have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nRattay, the DPH director, said many of the people who have had so-called \"breakthrough cases\" have been asymptomatic. The cases were only detected because the individuals were tested on a regular basis for work or another reason.\n\n\"What the science is showing us is individuals who've had those breakthrough cases if they're otherwise fairly healthy their risk of hospitalization or certainly death are almost nonexistent,\" she said.\n\nEarly research suggests the vaccines made by Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson provide adequate protection against the delta variant, but only after individuals are fully vaccinated (two weeks after their final dose).\n\nIt's possible future mutations of the virus evade the vaccines, the chances of which are made higher the longer the virus circulates through the population, experts say.\n\nDelaware does not currently have a significant enough portion of its population fully vaccinated to minimize the spread of COVID-19, and the emergence of more contagious variants like delta only push the necessary threshold higher.\n\nSINGLE SHOT: Why the Johnson & Johnson vaccine never changed the vaccine game\n\nVaccination rates are relatively low in Kent County, as well as pockets of Sussex County away from the beach towns. Vaccine uptake among children and young adults is lagging compared to older adults.\n\nAs with all respiratory diseases, cooler temperatures in the fall and winter will make it easier for the virus to spread.\n\n\"The best way to squash this and to prevent future mutations and more serious variants is everybody gets vaccinated now,\" Rattay said.\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.

The rolling average for the percentage of tests that are positive also increased, indicating the increase in cases is not due to an increase in tests administered.\n\nPeople 18 to 34 have made up about a third of the cases in Delaware's recent rise. Those 65 and older, of which at least 78% are vaccinated, are comprising a much lower percentage of cases than at previous points in the pandemic.\n\nTHE DATA: A closer look at who’s getting vaccinated in Delaware — and who’s not\n\nState officials on Tuesday identified Wilmington, Elsmere, New Castle, Newark, Townsend, Delaware City, Middletown and Millville as areas of concern within Delaware.\n\nThey said they've observed an increase in traffic and more people – vaccinated and unvaccinated – \"letting down their guard\" too soon.\n\n\"It's very obvious people are feeling spring fever,\" Gov. John Carney said.\n\nPublic health experts say the variant strains of COVID-19, such as those first discovered in Britain, South Africa and New York, are spreading easier and therefore faster than the \"original\" strains in the U.S. at this time last year.\n\nWith limited surveillance, it's difficult to say exactly how widespread the variants are. Delaware had tested 1,152 positive specimens as of Tuesday. About 4% of those samples revealed a variant strain.\n\nDr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Division of Public Health, said Delaware's variant numbers \"look better than expected,\" but she suspects they will rise in the coming weeks.\n\nSo far, the strain discovered in Britain, which fueled Europe's most recent outbreak and is widespread among vacationers in Florida, has been discovered most in Delaware (17 identified cases). The state has found just one case of the South African variant, which Rattay said is likely more contagious and \"more serious.\"\n\nDelaware's vaccination campaign\n\nNext week, Delaware will make everyone 16 and older eligible for vaccination, a move inspired in part by the increased spread of the virus and the prevalence of the COVID-19 variants in the region.\n\n\"We have two competing forces here,\" Horney said. \"We have the variants and the spread, and we have the vaccination numbers. We just have to get as many people vaccinated as we can now that it’s possible.\"\n\nWith nearly 100,000 unused doses in the state and future supply increases expected, state officials say they need more people to be eligible to continue moving vaccine.\n\nMaking everyone 16 and older eligible will also remove the \"friction\" inflicted by the current criteria, Carney said, and allow the state to vaccinate faster across the next several weeks in what will likely be its largest vaccination push yet.\n\nDr. Bill Chasanov, an infectious disease physician at Beebe Healthcare in Lewes, said he has found more people are becoming willing to get vaccinated as they see how the rollout has progressed, an observation in line with recent national polls.\n\n\"People have had time to now think about receiving the vaccine, now that it's been offered to them, that might not initially have wanted it,\" Chasanov said.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how each vaccine will respond to each COVID-19 variant, but \"real world\" studies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines released Monday showed them to extremely effective, reducing infections in fully vaccinated people by 90%.\n\n\"Whenever you have a clinical trial, that’s always the ideal world and then the vaccine or the medication gets released into the real world, and you typically see a drop,\" said Dr. Marci Drees, chief infection prevention officer and hospital epidemiologist at ChristianaCare. \"It was really very reassuring to see that the data was very similar even in the real world.\"\n\nDrees said the data show the vaccines prevent symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, which decreases the chance of transmission because much of transmission occurs from asymptomatic people.\n\nThe clinical trials tested only for symptomatic infection.\n\n\"Somehow that kind of got translated to ‘well the vaccines don’t stop transmission’ and that wasn’t true, we just didn’t know if they did or not,\" Drees said.\n\nScientists estimate at least 70% of a population needs to be immune to COVID-19 to reach herd immunity, the threshold at which enough of the population is vaccinated against or naturally immune to a disease that the disease largely no longer circulates.\n\nTo date, 33.5% of Delawareans have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. According to CDC data, 17.7% of Delaware's population is fully vaccinated.\n\nThe portion of the population protected against the virus is still far too low for Delawareans to \"start to relax,\" Drees said.\n\n\"It's unlikely that COVID's going to go away entirely, so we certainly want to see it to a very low level where it's the exception not the rule when people come with respiratory-type symptoms,\" Drees said. \"And that's only going to happen if enough people get vaccinated and if we continue all of the other measures until we get to that point.\"\n\nWhat should we do now?\n\nAs the race between vaccinations and the spread of the virus plays out, state officials are asking Delawareans to carry on with mask-wearing, social distancing and other mitigation strategies.\n\nOfficials hope by informing the public of the risks of various activities as opposed to making blanket declarations people will make responsible decisions for themselves and others.\n\n\"We need folks to understand what we’re asking them to do, why we’re asking them to do it and think beyond just their own household,\" Carney said.\n\nDelaware on Monday announced it was easing restrictions on outdoor gatherings starting Thursday. It's a move to encourage events that do take place in the coming weeks to be moved outside, where transmission is far less likely than being indoors.\n\n\"We just have to keep on keeping on with mask-wearing and getting people vaccinated as quickly as possible,\" Rattay said.\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.

With the level of community spread seen throughout the country in recent months, it was only a matter of time until the variant became more widespread. Other variants being monitored in the U.S. include mutations from Brazil and South Africa.\n\nFull data is unclear on the U.K. variant, but studies suggest it is more contagious than other variants, perhaps by 50%. The death rate may be higher, too. Prime Minister Boris Johnson caused a stir last week when he said publicly that the variant could have up to a 30% higher mortality rate. But testing and studying are still underway to determine the full scope. And overall, most people infected with the disease recover, especially those under the age of 65.\n\n“While we understand that people may be concerned, it’s important to know that while preliminary data suggests this variant may spread more easily and quickly than SARS-CoV-2, it is not clear if it may cause more severe illness than the more common coronavirus,\" DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay said in a press release.\n\n“Our approach and treatments are not any different, but as this new variant is more contagious, it is even more important that we remain vigilant and continue taking the necessary steps to avoid spreading the virus – wear a mask, wash your hands, avoid gatherings.”\n\nDelaware has in recent weeks seen a downward trend in the rate of positive cases and hospitalizations. Through 6 p.m. Thursday, 320 people were hospitalized due to COVID-19 complications, the lowest amount since Dec. 6. Further, the seven-day average of daily coronavirus cases is down to 533.9 cases per day over the last week, the lowest since the beginning of December.\n\nThe spread of the more transmissible U.K. variant has health officials concerned about the speed at which they're able to vaccinate. Delaware on Thursday announced changes to its approach to second doses, following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that say people waiting for second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine can wait as long as six weeks between vaccinations.\n\nAs of midday Friday, 92,552 people had been vaccinated with at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. There were an additional 28,298 doses on hand.\n\nThe state and partners are resuming vaccinations for phase 1A health care workers, giving priority to emergency personnel, school nurses and health care workers who provide patient care and are at the highest risk of sustained close contact with infected people.\n\nDoses were being delivered to county paramedic units on Friday, and a vaccination event limited to emergency responders is being planned for Monday with appointments made through first responder agencies, DPH said.\n\nANTIBODIES: Test positive for COVID-19 and at high risk? Monoclonal antibodies offer hope\n\nAs has been true since the vaccine rollout began, the number of people waiting to be vaccinated far outnumbers the number of vaccine doses on hand and the pace of delivery from the federal government to states. As of earlier this week, more than 100,000 people were on a waiting list. The combined number of eligible people in phase 1A and 1B is 270,000.\n\nPreliminary studies showed the Pfizer vaccine's first dose was 52% effective. Moderna's, meanwhile, showed 80% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 disease.\n\nThe presence of the virus mutations in the U.S. and the level of community spread nationwide – even as case counts trend downward – is likely to lead to an increase in positive cases, though to what extent is unclear.\n\nPreliminary studies suggest the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work against the U.K. variant and other variants.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said Friday that its single-dose vaccine appears to be about 66% effective overall, but 85% effective against severe disease, data that could potentially be a game-changer to vaccine rollout in the U.S.\n\nContact Jeff Neiburg at jneiburg@delawareonline.com.

Over the past two weeks, the statewide weekly average has remained around 450 cases.\n\n\"I hope we can expect a decline over the next several months,\" said Dr. Jennifer Horney, founding director of the University of Delaware's epidemiology program. \"How much of a continued decline in transmission we see over the fall I think will depend on our continued mask mandates in places like schools and universities, continuing to increase vaccination rates among hard-to-reach populations and a quick and successful rollout of the vaccine once approved for children 5-11.\"\n\nWho is getting infected with COVID-19?\n\nFor the past two weeks, young people in the 5- to 17-year-old age group have had the highest number of COVID-19 cases.\n\nYoung adults ages 18-34 had been reporting the most cases with only 52.8% of the age group vaccinated.\n\nState officials last week attributed the trend to increased testing at schools, although not every school is vigorously testing students and staff. From Sept. 4 to Sept. 24, Delaware reported 886 cases among in-person students and more than 2,000 cases among residents 5-17.\n\nAbout 80% of cases over the past month have been in Delawareans who are not fully vaccinated. Through Friday, the state had reported 3,768 \"breakthrough cases,\" representing 0.7% of fully vaccinated Delawareans.\n\nLong-term care facilities and nursing homes: Residents vaccinated, staff vaccinations increasing\n\nWith 89.3% of nursing home residents fully vaccinated, according to federal data, one of Delaware's earliest hot spots has remained cool during the delta variant surge.\n\nAt long-term care facilities, just over 100 cases have been reported over the past two months, according to state data.\n\nA concern earlier this year was the relatively low number of vaccinated nursing home workers. According to federal data, the percentage of Delaware nursing home staff fully vaccinated has increased from 55% to 75% in the last two months.\n\nHealth care workers who aren't vaccinated must be tested regularly.\n\nPrisons: Active cases down from winter peak\n\nCorrectional facilities were one of Delaware's hot spots in last year's fall and winter surge, but the facilities are now reporting relatively few cases.\n\nAccording to the Department of Correction, there were 21 active cases of COVID-19 among inmates, including three symptomatic cases, as of Friday. There were 20 active cases in DOC staff and contractors.\n\nAs of Sunday, there were 3,301 inmates in Delaware correctional facilities.\n\nCases have fallen dramatically since the winter, according to DOC data, and no large outbreaks have been reported since the delta variant became dominant.\n\nMost inmates are being tested on an as-needed – not a regular – basis.\n\nInmates are tested for COVID-19 at \"intake from the community,\" according to DOC spokesperson Jason Miller. Once in a facility, inmates are quarantined and \"closely observed by medical staff\" if they are exposed to someone who tests positive, Miller said. Exposed individuals may then be tested depending on \"exposure risk,\" Miller said.\n\nAll work-release inmates and select inmate workers such as kitchen workers are tested weekly. Inmates are also offered a test when released.\n\nEvery inmate has been offered the COVID-19 vaccine multiple times, Miller said. The DOC has distributed informational videos and flyers and offers inmates incentives to get vaccinated, including free video calls, snacks or special meals and good time credits.\n\nMiller said 64% of current inmates have received at least one dose. More than 60% of DOC staff this summer reported they were vaccinated, according to Miller.\n\nFace masks are required in correctional facilities for staff, contractors and visitors. Inmates are \"strongly encouraged\" to wear face masks in common areas, Miller said.\n\nTo date, 13 inmates have died with COVID-19, eight from James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna and five from Sussex Correctional Institution in Georgetown.\n\nSchools: Masks and vaccination policies now in place\n\nSchools have among the most extensive mitigation measures, but that children under 12 still can't be vaccinated complicates the equation as officials try to limit community spread while keeping students learning in person.\n\n\"I think we are all keeping an eye on the school numbers,\" Horney said. \"Since many of our students that are back in school full time are not yet eligible to be vaccinated, we rely on vaccination of educators, staff and others in the K-12 setting to help protect students.\"\n\nGov. John Carney last week announced all teachers and school staff of Delaware K-12 schools will have to be vaccinated or tested regularly starting Nov. 1. Masks have been mandated since the start of the school year.\n\nCarney said the state didn't issue the vaccination or testing requirement when it mandated masks because the state had to \"cultivate the ground among educators\" and wanted to first see how the districts would handle the situation.\n\nThe pushback to the mask mandate at school board meetings in August also gave the state pause, but after President Joe Biden announced employers with 100 or more workers will have to require vaccination or testing, the state \"just felt it was the right thing to do,\" Carney said.\n\nThe governor said his team felt they'd get more people vaccinated if they gave the option to be tested instead of mandating vaccination without a testing alternative.\n\n\"The objective is to get as many people vaccinated as possible. What's the best way to do that?\" Carney said. \"The government's telling them they have to get vaccinated or giving them an option and making it uncomfortable or costly to not get vaccinated?\"\n\nDelaware is among 10 states with a vaccination or testing requirement for school staff and one of 16 states mandating mask-wearing in school buildings.\n\nSo far, 886 cases have been reported among students, and 154 cases have been reported among staff members. Those case numbers could be higher. At the beginning of the school year, the state's $15 million school COVID-19 testing program had low enrollment numbers.\n\nVaccinations are required to attend the University of Delaware in Newark. In the week ending Sept. 11, UD reported 376 cases among students, prompting the city of Newark to consider limiting the size of private gatherings.\n\nCases have decreased in each of the subsequent three weeks, coming down to 44 cases last week.\n\nVisitors to campus events must have proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test and must fill out a health screening.\n\nEvents: Tracking exposure as events return near full force\n\nA week and a half ago, Delaware hosted its largest event since the start of the pandemic: the Firefly Music Festival in Dover.\n\nAfter being canceled in 2020, the festival was expected to draw around 50,000 people for each of its four days.\n\nFirefly required attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative test within 72 hours. Staff, artists and other backstage guests had to provide both. So far, no clusters have appeared in Delaware's data.\n\n\"I think we are fortunate that many venues in our region have put in place vaccine mandates and testing requirements,\" Horney said.\n\nDivision of Public Health spokesperson Mary Fenimore said Delaware's contact tracing apparatus in the days following Firefly has operated no different from the way it normally does.\n\nThe state has more than 135 contact tracers who make calls to people who test positive and their contacts.\n\nSince relaunching in late June, Delaware's contact tracers have reached about three-quarters of the state's positive cases. About a quarter of the cases have been traced to another positive case, according to state data.\n\nIn the past two weeks, 29 of the 640 people who reported going to a venue within two weeks of experiencing symptoms or testing positive said they attended a concert, festival or bonfire. The most visited venues in the two weeks were \"parties or other gatherings,\" at the beach and restaurants.\n\nEvents aren't subject to any state limits.\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.

Her chin touched her chest. Her arms hung limp against her body.\n\nShe could probably use some of that overdose-reversing medication naloxone, a couple people said.\n\nBy chance, Dr. Sandra Gibney was giving away doses nearby. As she approached the woman, it seemed too late — Delaware's latest overdose victim.\n\n\"Hello,\" Gibney called. No response.\n\n\"You OK?\"\n\nShe reached out to the woman, touching her arm. The woman's arm shot into the air. Her neck sagged backwards. Her leg jerked into the air.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Gibney asked again.\n\nLt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long was on the tour with Gibney. She tried to soothe the woman, too.\n\nAwkwardly, the woman got to her feet. But she fidgeted and twitched, struggling to stand up.\n\nGibney and Hall-Long tried to steady the woman, telling her why they were out in the downtown Dover community — because of the local drug trade and accompanying heroin overdoses.\n\nGibney told her she wanted to give her naloxone. The doctor and her volunteers were distributing the medication in hopes of saving more lives, especially as Delaware's heroin epidemic moves south where there are fewer resources.\n\nHEROIN: Delaware's deadly crisis\n\nBuried in her senior prom dress, Delaware woman falls victim to heroin's grips\n\nTwo weeks before, they gave out naloxone in Wilmington, which led directly to a life saved a week later.\n\nGibney wanted the woman to have the medication, to keep it, and to know how to use it. The woman, who said her name was Wanda, agreed.\n\nBut Wanda was still struggling. Her eyes were rolling back in her head and her breathing wasn't good.\n\nAs Gibney demonstrated to the woman how to use naloxone, the doctor — trusting her gut and knowing the signs of overdose — administered the spray up Wanda’s nose.\n\nAgain, the woman jerked upright. She rubbed her arms, pulled down her skirt.\n\nGibney put another dose in her hand for later, repeating over and over how to administer the spray.\n\nWanda said she was from Massachusetts, but that she had friends in Dover and was doing OK. She said she would keep the naloxone with her, and said she would get some help.\n\nBecause Gibney's outreach effort happened to be nearby at the time, Wanda survived.\n\n\"That's at least one life saved,\" Gibney said.\n\nLess than an hour later, Gibney instructed another young woman how to use naloxone along New Street.\n\nLike Wanda, the woman agreed to take the free medication, paid for by a Highmark grant which awarded the overdose-reversing drug to atTAcK Addiction as part of the nonprofit's efforts to stem drug-related deaths.\n\nShe said she knew someone who could use it.\n\nOver her shoulder, a woman called out to her. It was Wanda.\n\nBy now, she was smiling and walking more steadily. She had a new shirt on and a headpiece wrapped around her hair. She now had a purse.\n\nAs Gibney finished her instructions, the barefoot woman walked across the street and joined Wanda.\n\nSlowly, they walked down Governors Avenue together.

At the same time, Covid-19 cases, which had been dropping, appear to have plateaued over the last three weeks, Romero said. Cases have flattened as a raft of new variants has been gaining ground against BA.5, the Omicron subvariant that caused a wave of illness over the summer.\n\nThe spikes in viral illnesses have already begun to strain hospitals.\n\nDawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said Friday that her agency was staying in close contact with health care systems and states.\n\n“We are monitoring capacity across the country sharing best practices to reduce the strain on systems and standing by to deploy additional personnel and supplies as needed,” she said, noting that so far, no states have requested this help.\n\n“There’s no doubt that we will face some challenges this winter,” O’Connell said.\n\nFlu, RSV hitting early and hard\n\nSeventeen states, Washington, DC, and New York City, are reporting high or very high respiratory illness activity amid a flu season that’s hitting harder and earlier than usual, according to data published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nInfluenza activity continues to increase in the US – the number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths so far this season nearly doubled in the past week. The CDC now estimates that there have been at least 1.6 million illnesses, 13,000 hospitalizations and 730 deaths from influenza, including two reported deaths among children so far this season. About one in 11 tests for flu were positive last week.\n\n“In fact, we’re seeing the highest influenza hospitalization rates going back a decade,” Romero said.\n\nThe last time flu hospitalization rates have been this high at this point in the season was during the H1N1 pandemic. The latest CDC update tracks data through October 29.\n\nThere’s no real mystery about why viral illnesses are on the upswing, said Dr. Michael Mina, who is an epidemiologist and chief science officer at eMed, a company offering telehealth test-to-treat services.\n\n“We enjoyed the benefit of not having influenza for the last couple of years, primarily because of SARS-CoV-2. Extra mitigation measures like social distancing, masking, and not going out for roughly a year have only delayed the inevitable. Now that we have released the pressures put in place to keep viruses at bay and move into this first real flu season, we, unfortunately, feel its impact,” he said.\n\nRSV cases are also increasing nationally, although there are regional differences in the circulation of these viruses, Romero said. It’s a common respiratory infection that typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but it can cause serious illness, particularly in older adults and infants.\n\nIn the South and Mountain West, RSV cases appear to have peaked in October. In those regions, RSV cases are falling, even as influenza is spiking.\n\nFlu activity is highest in the South, followed by the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the West Coast. Data from Walgreens that tracks prescriptions for antiviral treatments – such as Tamiflu – suggest there are hotspots in Mississippi and Alabama, as well as the Gulf Coast area, including Houston and New Orleans.\n\nRSV hospitalizations were also significantly higher than usual, according to another weekly update published by the CDC on Thursday.\n\nCumulative RSV hospitalization rates have already reached levels that are typically not seen until December in the US. They’re rising among all age groups, but especially among children.\n\nAbout four out of every 1,000 babies under 6 months old have been hospitalized with RSV so far this season – just about a month in. More than two in every 1,000 babies between 6 months and one year have been hospitalized with RSV so far this season, as have more than one in every 1,000 children between age one and two.\n\nOverall in the US, nearly one in five PCR tests for RSV were positive for the week ending October 29, nearly doubling over the course of the month.\n\nWeekly cases counts are less complete for the most current weeks, but there have been more RSV cases detected by PCR tests each week in October 2022 than any other week in at least the past two years. Weekly case counts for the week ending October 22 were more than double any other week in 2020 or 2021.\n\nThere are signs that RSV cases are slowing in the southern region of the US, but test positivity rates and cases continue to rise in other regions, especially the Midwest.\n\nAnd pediatric hospitals remain more full than average with RSV patients and other conditions. According to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services, more than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds and pediatric ICU beds are currently in use nationwide, compared with an average of about two-thirds full over the past two years.\n\nAs of Friday, seventeen states have less than one in five beds available. Five of them are more than 90% full: Rhode Island, Arizona, Maine, Minnesota and Delaware, along with Washington, DC.\n\nVaccination is the best protection\n\nRomero stressed that with holiday gatherings just around the corner, vaccination is the best protection against these infections.\n\n“We have vaccines for two of the three viruses we talked about influenza, and COVID 19,” he said, and he urged Americans to take advantage of them, though not enough have.\n\nAccording to the CDC’s data tracker, just 8.4% of eligible Americans have received a new updated Covid-19 booster.\n\nVaccinations are lower than usual for influenza, too. Based on data from insurance claims, adult flu vaccinations are down about 5 million compared to where they were last year at the same time, said Lynnette Brammer, who leads surveillance for the CDC’s influenza division.\n\nFor children, coverage looks about the same as last year, but those levels represent a 6% drop from what flu vaccinations in kids looked like before the pandemic, Brammer said.\n\nRomero stressed that while most adults only need a single annual influenza vaccine, children who are being vaccinated against the flu for the first time need two shots.\n\nHe also advised people not to try to guess what they had based on their symptoms alone since many of these viruses can cause similar symptoms.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGoing to the doctor for a test as as soon as you start to feel bad could help you take advantage of early antiviral treatments which are available for influenza and Covid-19.\n\nRomero said the CDC was preparing to send doctors more information about who should qualify for these test-to-treat strategies.\n\nIn addition to vaccination, Romero reminded people to cover their coughs and sneezes, avoid other individuals who are sick, wash hands frequently and use alcohol-based hand sanitizers.\n\n“People who also may also choose to wear a well-fitting mask as an added precaution,” Romero said.", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips Brenda Goodman", "Deidre Mcphillips", "Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/coronavirus/2021/01/22/nj-confirms-2-cases-new-more-contagious-covid-strain-state/6673061002/", "title": "NJ confirms 2 cases of new more contagious COVID strain in state", "text": "New Jersey has confirmed its first two cases of a mutation of the coronavirus first identified in the United Kingdom, the state Health Commissioner said Friday.\n\nThe virus variant is much more contagious than the coronavirus strain that has killed more than 400,000 Americans, but current vaccines appear to be effective against it. However, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Friday that the variant may be more deadly.\n\n\"Today we are reporting that two confirmed COVID-19 variant cases involving the B.1.1.7 or U.K. variant have been identified in New Jersey,\" state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said.\n\nThe two cases involved an Ocean County man in his 60s, who recovered without being hospitalized, and a child who traveled to northern New Jersey and never had symptoms, she said.\n\nPersichilli said there was \"no evidence that infection by this variant causes more severe disease,\" citing reports from the federal Centers for Disease Control. But she spoke before reports Friday afternoon from London that the strain detected there in September may cause up to 30% more deaths.\n\nIf the previous strain caused 10 deaths per 1,000 cases among 60-year-olds, the variant appears to cause 13 or 14 deaths, according to Johnson's chief scientific adviser, who stressed that \"there's a lot of uncertainty around these numbers.\"\n\nPotential 'game-changer':Hopes high for Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine if authorized\n\nVaccine:Here's where to get COVID-19 vaccinations in New Jersey, but supplies are scarce\n\nConfirmation that the U.K. variant is present in New Jersey had been expected, with every neighboring state except Delaware reporting cases. More than 20 states have confirmed such cases as of Friday.\n\nThe Ocean County man developed symptoms on Dec. 29 and was tested on Jan. 6, Perischilli said. He had no history of travel or known exposure to a person who was sick with COVID-19. When the sample collected for his PCR test showed results that suggested the variant might be present, it was sent to another lab for a complete genomic analysis.\n\nThe child, who had stayed in New Jersey, was tested Jan. 11 in New York City, and was asymptomatic. The Health Department's communicable disease service is continuing to investigate the two cases, Persichilli said.\n\nThe arrival of the virus variant during a frustratingly slow vaccine rollout in New Jersey and the United States added to the mounting impatience among those waiting for the shots. An increase in the number of patients needing hospital care would strain the health care system.\n\nThe number of people with the newly identified mutation is \"only going to go up,\" Gov. Phil Murphy said. \"Clearly the faster we can get folks vaccinated, the better,\" he said Wednesday.\n\nStory continues after chart\n\n\"It's kind of a race between getting as many people vaccinated versus the virus itself replicating and becoming the dominant strain,\" Dr. Eddy Bresnitz, a former state epidemiologist who is leading the Health Department's professional advisory committee, said earlier this week.\n\n100-mile drive, hours in the cold:Here's what New Jerseyans are doing to get a COVID shot\n\nBumpy rollout:As millions compete for shots, New Jersey seniors struggle with online COVID vaccine system\n\nThe new variant is estimated to be 30% to 70% more transmissible than the current strain. That means that if the current strain infects 10 of 100 people, the new strain will infect 13 to 17 of 100. It is likely to become dominant in the United States by March, according to the CDC's predictive models.\n\nRecent genomic analysis of the virus infecting 1,000 patients in the Hackensack Meridian Health system did not turn up evidence of the U.K. virus mutation, said Dr. David Perlin, the chief scientific officer for the system's Center for Discovery and Innovation. Analysis of an additional 1,000 samples was underway Friday, he said.\n\nThis \"just heightens the need to wear masks, socially distance, and do all the things we’ve been trying to do in terms of prevention of transmission and infection control,\" he said.\n\nNew York State first reported a confirmed case of the variant on Jan. 4, and academic laboratories in New Jersey have been on high alert for the mutation. But only a tiny fraction of the 4,000 to 5,000 COVID-positive test samples collected each day are submitted for a full genomic analysis.\n\nThe state public health laboratory has been screening some samples and sending them to the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to see if they contain the mutation, a spokeswoman said earlier this month. The lab in New Jersey expected to develop the ability to do genomic testing of viral samples soon, she said.\n\nAs viruses replicate billions of times in a pandemic, they develop slight variations in their genetic code, a process known as genetic drift. Some of the variations are insignificant, but others may cause changes in the way the virus binds with human cells or acts in the human body.\n\nLindy Washburn is a senior health care reporter for NorthJersey.com.

Andrew Cuomo said Monday.\n\nThe man has been suffering from symptoms from the virus, but is recovering, Cuomo said. Still, the governor warned that people who visited the store, N. Fox Jewelers at 404 Broadway, to get tested and contact the state if they have symptoms if they visited the store between Dec. 18 and Dec. 24.\n\nIf you've been there, \"you should contact us and get a test immediately,\" Cuomo said. He said the man had not been traveling.\n\n\"He did not travel recently so that suggests it was in the community,\" Cuomo said. \"It was community spread rather than traveling to the U.K.\"\n\nCuomo said the new strain found in New York comes after about 5,000 tests have been done in New York specifically looking for it. This is the first one to come back positive.\n\nThe governor said while it's not surprising the state now has a case, it is a concern: New York's positivity rate is at its highest level since the spring and this strain is more contagious.\n\nAt least three U.S. states and 33 countries have identified the new variant, and there is also another strain that several countries have found.\n\nCuomo said several other workers at the jewelry store have COVID-19, but it is unclear yet whether they also have the new strain.\n\nCuomo said the store had been closed since Christmas Eve.\n\n\"The safety and confidence of our employees and customers have always been of the utmost importance to us so we feel that this is the correct step for us to take,\" the store said of closing through Jan. 3 on its Facebook page.\n\n\"We apologize in advance if you were planning on visiting us this week.
