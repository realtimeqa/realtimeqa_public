Target reported last month its profit for the fiscal first quarter tumbled 52% compared with the same period last year. Sales of big TVs and small kitchen appliances that Americans loaded up on during the pandemic have faded, leaving Target with a bloated inventory that it said must be marked down to sell.\n\nWhy did Target stock drop? Thank high gas prices, inflation\n\nTarget declined to give a dollar amount of merchandise orders that are being canceled and depths of the discounts.\n\nIn aggressively clearing out unwanted goods, Target wants to make room for what is now in demand, including groceries and makeup products. But Target is also facing sharply higher costs for everything from labor to transportation and shipping, and it will offset price cuts where it can with higher prices for goods now in demand.\n\n“Retail inventories are elevated,” Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief financial officer, told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday. ”And they certainly are for us, in some of the categories that we misforecast. We determined that acting aggressively was the right way to continue to fuel the business.”\n\nGroundbreaking collaboration: Tabitha Brown line coming to Target June 11\n\nTarget is working with suppliers to cover costs for their vendors whose orders are being cancelled. In some cases, some of the raw materials that were meant for some goods will instead be used for other products in higher demand, Fiddelke said. Many of the orders for products being canceled have a long production lead time of nine months, he said.\n\nThe Daily Money: Get our latest personal finance and consumer news in your inbox\n\nTarget also announced that it will add five distribution centers over the next two fiscal years.\n\nTarget said the costs related to the moves will hurt the bottom line in the current quarter. Target now expects its second-quarter operating margin rate will be roughly 2%, down from around 5.3% it had expected last month. For the second half of the year, Target expects an operating margin rate in a range around 6%, a rate it said would exceed the company’s average fall season performance in the years leading up to the pandemic.\n\nLast month, Target forecast its full-year operating income margin rate would be in the 6% range. Target didn’t give a new full range prediction. It also said it secured additional space near U.S. ports to hold merchandise to allow for more flexibility.\n\nTarget, however, continues to expect full-year revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digit range and expects to maintain or gain market share for the year.\n\nShares of Target Corp. fell 9% to $145.30 in premarket trading Tuesday and the stock of other retailers retreated with it. Walmart, Nordstrom and Macy’s fell between 2% and 4%.\n\nHiding behind rainbow flags: These companies' political donations don't match their support of LGBTQ issues", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/business/stores-clothing-television-furniture-discounts/index.html", "title": "Stores have too much stuff.

As a result, they plan to mark down prices and step up sales on those items to clear the glut.\n\nIt marks a major reversal from much of 2021, when discounts on big-ticket items were scarce for consumers.\n\nLast year, big chains dialed back on promotions because products were in tight supply due to production bottlenecks and slowdowns at key global ports.\n\nStores and brands were able to sell merchandise at full price to consumers who had built up savings while staying home during the pandemic and were eager to spend big on their homes and wardrobes.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/business/gm-earnings/index.html", "title": "GM reports strong sales but says it's prepared for possible recession ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) General Motors said strong sales and demand for vehicles doesn't suggest any signs of an economic slowdown, but the company is preparing for a possible recession — just in case.\n\nGM reported a sharp drop in earnings Tuesday, but that was caused by Covid lockdowns in China, one of its largest markets, and other supply chain issues. The automaker actually posted an unexpected gain in revenue.\n\nBut executives said that despite the high demand, the company is prepared should the US or global economy fall into a recession , as a growing number of economists fear.\n\n\"While demand remains strong, there are growing concerns about the economy to be sure,\" said CEO Mary Barra in comments to investors. She said the company is preparing for a possible downturn by reducing discretionary spending and limiting hiring\n\n\"We have also modeled many downturn scenarios and we are prepared to take deliberate action when and if necessary,\" she said.\n\nRecessions typically crash demand for new cars and hurt the auto industry.\n\nWalmart WMT The most recent survey of members by the National Association for Business Economics released Monday found that 43% think a US recession in the next 12 months is more likely than not. That's up from just 13% who believed that back in April. And Monday,, the nation's largest retailer, announced it was cutting prices on some goods and trimming its earnings forecast due to softer spending by consumers\n\nGM is not yet seeing any signs of a recession, given the strong demand for new vehicles, said CFO Paul Jacobson in response to questions from media.\n\n\"We're not seeing anything that indicates any near term issues, but we have to be conscious of the noise that is out there and what other people are seeing,\" he said. \"We're going to be very agile and very nimble and respond to that.\"\n\nRecently Tesla has announced plans to trim salaried staff , due partly due to CEO Elon Musk saying he has a \" super bad feeling \" about the economic outlook. And a recent Bloomberg report said that Ford is also planning salaried staff cuts. Ford said it wouldn't comment on \"speculation.\" But Jacobson said that GM is \"not running any scenarios right now where we contemplate layoffs.\"\n\nJacobson wouldn't give an opinion on the chances of a recession during the course of the next year, saying \"I don't like to get into the odds of predicting. Our job is to respond and plan and prepare.\"\n\nHe said that all data on its customers, including credit reports from GM Financial, show a lot of continued strength among US consumers and pent-up demand to buy vehicles.\n\n\"But we're watching and we'll make sure we adjust the business as we need too,\" he added.\n\nGM tried to assure investors, saying it expects to hit its full-year earnings target, despite the economic worries.\n\n\"We feel like we're in really good position,\" Jacobson said. \"We feel like we're on track to deliver the year we [forecast] at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nDrop in profit despite increased revenue\n\nGM GM For the second quarter,reported adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion, down from $2.9 billion a year earlier, falling about $60 million short of forecasts.\n\nBut revenue was up $1.6 billion, to $35.8 billion, easily topping forecasts that called for a drop in revenue. The number of vehicles sold worldwide by GM's dealers and distributors remained roughly on par with first quarter sales but were down 19% to 1.4 million compared to a year ago.\n\nThe limited supply of vehicles and strong demand, especially in North America, drove up prices. The strong pricing environment added $1.8 billion to the company's results during the quarter.\n\nPart of the drop in vehicles sold was because of the lockdown in China, and part of it was due to the continued shortage of computer chips and other needed supplies. The company had 95,000 vehicles that it built in the quarter but couldn't complete due to a lack of parts. About 75% of those are full-size pickups and SUVs, GM's most profitable vehicles. Jacobson said the company expects to complete those vehicles and sell them during the second half of the year, and was already making progress so far this month.\n\n\"We went in thinking we were going to be producing a lot more vehicles in the quarter,\" he said. \"Substantially all those vehicles will come back in the 2nd half of the year.\"\n\nThe Covid shutdowns in China limited production at Chinese factories and brought sales in the country to a near halt . China has been GM's largest market in recent years, although US sales topped Chinese sales in the most recent quarter.\n\nGM lost $87 million in China, it's first loss there since early 2020 at the start of the pandemic.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/investing/target-discounts-stores/index.html", "title": "Target is ramping up discounts.

A U.S. Chamber of Commerce report found that 43% of small businesses believe they will not survive six months in these economic conditions. Large businesses are a mixed bag. Some are flush with cash and able to weather a long-term financial downturn, while other major American brands are saddled with massive debt loads and, without a significant change in conditions, may be forced to close their doors forever.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed corporate filings and industry publications to determine the American brands that might not survive the coronavirus crisis.\n\nWhile every part of the American economy has been impacted by the pandemic, some industries have suffered far greater damage. Brick-and-mortar retailers, theaters, and companies that rely on live events have seen their revenues decimated in the wake of COVID-19.\n\nYour money is important: Money advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nCompanies are turning to a range of different strategies to survive the pandemic. Many retailers are offering curbside pickup, while other shuttered businesses are selling discounted gift cards for a quick infusion of cash. Unfortunately, one of the most common strategies is to furlough or lay off workers to save on labor costs. Workers all across the country have been affected – the U.S. unemployment rate is up to 14.7%. At least 8.5% of workers filed for unemployment since mid-March in every state.\n\n'You're losing money everywhere':Iowa farmers try to hang on through pandemic crisis\n\nCan these 13 retailers survive COVID-19?:Permanent store closings, bankruptcies coming\n\n1. Neiman Marcus\n\n• Industry: Luxury goods\n\nLuxury department store chain Neiman Marcus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 7 in an attempt to restructure debt and survive the harsh economic conditions created by the coronavirus pandemic. The company had been saddled with $4 billion in debt since its 2013 sale to a private equity firm.\n\nIssues had been compounded by the recent precipitous drop in sales of luxury goods, which were likely some of the first purchases to be postponed during the pandemic. At the time of filing, all of the retailer's locations had been closed and most of its 14,000 employees had been furloughed.\n\n2. StubHub\n\n• Industry: Live events ticketing\n\nWith virtually all live events canceled for the foreseeable future, ticket exchange and sale company StubHub is facing an unprecedented situation. StubHub updated its refund policy as more than 20,000 events were nixed. Company President Sukhinder Singh Cassidy told Axios that the company was unable to \"take the risk of giving refunds to buyers before recouping the same refund from the seller.\" This elicited lawsuits from fans who say they never got refunds despite the NBA, NHL, and MLB postponing their seasons and despite the company's own refund policy.\n\nStubHub furloughed most of its staff – around 300 people. The crisis also came at a time that StubHub's $4 billion buyout from Viagogo was halted by U.K. courts in February.\n\nThe National Association of Ticket Brokers say they may have to seek a government bailout to keep the industry afloat. The National Association of Ticket Brokers represents dozens of U.S. ticketing companies, although StubHub is not a member of the organization and has not requested any government assistance.\n\n3. J.C. Penney\n\n• Industry: Retail\n\nJ.C. Penney's multi-billion dollar debt load, combined with the chain closing most of its stores nationwide because of COVID-19, has cast the company's future into doubt. J.C. Penney is reportedly mulling a bankruptcy filing and recently said it did not make a $12 million interest payment due in April.\n\n4. AMC Theatres\n\n• Industry: Theaters\n\nAMC Theaters was reportedly considering entering bankruptcy in April, but then was looking at raising half a billion dollars through a private placement debt offering. This may have staved off the bankruptcy option at least for the time being.\n\nAlthough some states are now allowing movie theaters to reopen at reduced capacity, AMC said it is not anticipating a reopening until late June at the earliest. The company closed all theaters in mid-March and furloughed or laid off over 26,000 employees. With no ticket sales, AMC Theaters told its landlords it would stop paying rent in April.\n\n5. Sears\n\n• Industry: Department store\n\nOnce an American icon, Sears has struggled for years. In the years since 2010, its last profitable year, the retailer reported losses of $12 billion. After filing for bankruptcy in 2018, Sears continued to shrink operations after restructuring its debt, closing another 100-plus stores since, and staying with just under 200 stores, a fraction of the over 3,000 locations it operated at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nThe coronavirus may be a death sentence for Sears, as all locations have remained closed as of early May. While all large brick-and-mortar retailers are facing challenges with the pandemic and the rise of e-commerce, Sears' shaky financial footing makes it uniquely vulnerable.\n\n6. WeWork\n\n• Industry: Real estate\n\nThe new social distancing requirements, which might remain in place for some time, could spell the end for co-working spaces – particularly WeWork. The company's occupancy dropped by nearly two-thirds in April. WeWork stopped paying its rent that month and is reportedly renegotiating its leases.\n\nThe company came into 2020 already in disarray. In September 2019, co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann stepped down after reports of his chaotic management style surfaced and a planned IPO was scrapped. Neumann sued WeWork's new owner, SoftBank, after it announced it would no longer purchase stock from Neumann and others.\n\n7. J. Crew\n\n• Industry: Clothing\n\nWeeks after closing its doors on March 16, J. Crew filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company also said it reached an agreement with its lenders to convert more than $1.6 billion of the company's debt into equity. J. Crew also secured a $400 million loan, though it may be increasingly difficult for the company to pay it back as its credit rating has been downgraded twice by credit rating agency Moody's during the pandemic. The company was planning an IPO for its Madewell brand in early 2020 to help ease the debt burden, but those plans are on hold indefinitely.\n\nYour coronavirus questions, answered:Do I have to give back a deceased person's stimulus?\n\n8. Frontier Communications\n\n• Industry: Communication services\n\nTelecommunications company Frontier Communications entered the pandemic in a dire situation, with a debt burden of more than $17 billion. The telecom provider also carries a credit rating of SD (selective default), meaning credit rating agency Standard & Poor's believes Frontier selectively defaulted on a financial obligation.\n\nIn an attempt to lessen its debt, Frontier declared bankruptcy in April and sold its operations and assets in four northwest U.S. states. Frontier's stock has been in decline for years, and was worth less than 8 cents per share as of May 8.\n\n9. Bed Bath & Beyond\n\n• Industry: Retail\n\nThough some of Bed Bath & Beyond's products, like soaps and toiletries, may have been in high demand since the pandemic hit the U.S., many other of the company's products have likely not sold that well. The company struggled ahead of the pandemic as well. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, which ended February 29, 2020, sales dropped more than 6%.\n\nAs of May 8, stores remained closed, and most Bed Bath & Beyond workers have been furloughed since early April. Bed Bath & Beyond stock, which ended 2019 worth more than $17 per share, fell to under $4 per share in April and was worth less than $6 per share as of early May.\n\n10. Hertz\n\n• Industry: Car Rental\n\nWith nonessential travel all but canceled, car rental company Hertz is struggling with a lack of income. The company was reportedly considering bankruptcy to restructure an estimated $17 billion in debt, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHertz reached an agreement with its lenders that would give it until May 22 to \"develop a financing strategy and structure that better reflects the economic impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic,\" the company said in a filing. Hertz announced a plan cut nearly 10,000 jobs in April, but the company still failed to make some lease payments that month.\n\n11. Steak 'n Shake\n\n• Industry: Restaurant\n\nJust before the coronavirus shut down much of the U.S. economy, Steak 'n Shake was already closing restaurants. Facing declining sales, the burger chain temporarily closed over 100 locations in February to convert them into counter-service only restaurants to save on labor costs associated with having a waitstaff. The company reported an operating loss of $18.6 million in 2019.\n\nSteak 'n Shake is seen as a bankruptcy risk because of its restaurant closures and the resulting lost cash flow, as well as the struggles associated with operating during the COVID-19 crisis and the coming maturity of a $181.5 million loan in 2021.\n\n12. Nordstrom\n\n• Industry: Clothing\n\nLike many other retailers, department store chain Nordstrom has been in trouble since governments nationwide ordered the closure of nonessential businesses. The company shut down all of its physical stores and furloughed the majority of its workforce.\n\nOn April 8, Nordstrom issued a note to investors about the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic had on its operations. In the note, the company said, \"The longer our stores remain closed to the public, the greater impact it will have on our results of operations and financial condition, and if our physical locations remain closed to customers for an extended period of time our financial situation could become distressed.\" On May 6, the company announced it would be closing 16 locations permanently in nine states and Puerto Rico.\n\n13. GNC Holdings\n\n• Industry: Health and fitness products\n\nEven though food products have been in high demand during the pandemic, nutrition-related products seller GNC has not been able to capitalize – in part because it relies heavily on in-person sales instead of online sales. GNC furloughed \"a significant portion\" of its 12,400 employees, and the company's credit rating was also recently downgraded by rating agency Fitch.\n\nGNC's stock, which was over $2 per share in mid-February, has fallen to below 60 cents as of early May, with the NYSE threatening to delist GNC as the stock has traded at under $1 per share for more than a month. GNC could also face a class action lawsuit after a law firm announced it was investigating the company's board for \"fraud and breach of fiduciary duty,\" claiming board members would reap the benefits of any bankruptcy that results at the expense of shareholders.\n\n14. Ruby Tuesday\n\n• Industry: Restaurant\n\nCasual dining restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday had been struggling financially long before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the nation's restaurants to temporarily close. The company's nationwide presence has been declining for years – from 945 U.S. locations in 2007 to less than 500 today. As the nationwide lockdown continues, already a number of closed Ruby Tuesday locations have announced that they will not be reopening.\n\n15. Gold's Gym\n\n• Industry: Fitness\n\nBans on crowds of more than 10 people across the nation spelled disaster for large gym chains like Gold's Gym. The gym company filed for bankruptcy in early May. CEO Adam Zeitsiff pledged that Gold's Gym would reopen but it already had to permanently close 30 company-owned locations amid the pandemic.\n\nSome Gold's Gym locations have begun reopening, with enhanced safety measures in place. Still, it remains to be seen how willing consumers will be to share a confined space after turning to at-home alternatives like Peloton, which has skyrocketed in popularity since social distancing measures have been implemented.\n\n16. Chesapeake\n\n• Industry: Energy\n\nThe global oil industry has been devastated by a historic plummet in oil prices stemming from a lack of demand during the global shutdown and a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. In April, the price of West Texas Intermediate oil futures set for May fell below zero for the first time. A number of smaller oil operations are at risk of going under, and even larger energy companies are at risk.\n\nReuters reported on April 30 that Chesapeake Energy, a shale gas drilling company that was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the fracking boom in the United States, is preparing to file for bankruptcy.\n\n17. Norwegian Cruise Line\n\n• Industry: Cruise\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line, headquartered in Miami, said in a May 5 filing there was \"substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue\" as a result of COVID-19. The cruise industry has taken a beating since the Grand Princess cruise ship became one of the earliest major outbreaks among Americans in late February.\n\nBefore that incident, Norwegian Cruise Line stock traded at more than $50 per share. As of May 8, the stock was trading below $13 per share. All U.S. cruises were hit with a no-sail order, and Norwegian suspended all voyages through the end of June.\n\n18. Dave & Buster's\n\n• Industry: Restaurant\n\nUnlike many other businesses that offer food, Dave & Buster's relies on customers coming inside and paying for arcade games. Games and other amusements account for almost 60% of the restaurant and entertainment company's revenue. Even when locations begin to reopen, customers may be hesitant to come back and use games that others have touched.\n\nDave & Buster's in April furloughed over 15,000 employees and did not pay rent. As of May 8, the company's stock price was less than a quarter of its share price of $46 in mid-February. To help bolster its financials, the company announced an agreement to sell $100 million in stock to Jefferies LLC.\n\n19. Party City\n\n• Industry: Retail\n\nWith in-person events canceled nationwide, Party City's potential earnings have virtually evaporated. Since the pandemic hit, the company's stock price has hovered between 50 and 60 cents per share, down from nearly $3 per share in late February. The party-supplies manufacturer and retailer furloughed 90% of in-store workers and 70% of manufacturing and corporate employees. As of early May, all retail locations remained closed, and there is no word as to when they would reopen, though some locations are offering curbside pickup.\n\n20. Modell's Sporting Goods\n\n• Industry: Sporting goods\n\nWhile many of the companies listed here are hoping to survive the coronavirus crisis, Modell's Sporting Goods is already gone for good. After more than a century in business, the sporting goods retailer announced in March it filed for bankruptcy and would close all stores. Ironically, the pandemic may actually keep Modell's open longer, as the company said it halted its liquidation amid the closure of nonessential businesses. It is now seeking to postpone its bankruptcy through the end of May.\n\nIt could be difficult for Modell's to sell merchandise if pro and amateur leagues are still not operating. Complicating matters, Modell's only operates in the Northeast, where communities have been especially hard-hit by coronavirus.\n\n21. Best Buy\n\n• Industry: Consumer electronics and appliances\n\nConsumer electronics retail giant Best Buy is one of many brick-and-mortar chains that could potentially face bankruptcy during the COVID-19 crisis. Though the company reported a surge in sales of home appliances like freezers at the beginning of the outbreak, Best Buy reported a 5% decline year-over-year in sales for the nine-week period ending April 4, 2020. On April 19, Best Buy furloughed some 51,000 employees, implemented substantial executive pay cuts, and did away with several benefits for employees.\n\nIn mid-March, Best Buy suspended appliance installation service and reduced its physical location sales services to curbside pickup only. The company has yet to reinstate normal in-store shopping.\n\n22. Revlon\n\n• Industry: Cosmetics\n\nNew York-based cosmetics company Revlon has reportedly been able to close a $1.8 billion refinancing package that would restructure most of its debt, according to The Business of Fashion. Revlon has been struggling with declining revenue during the coronavirus pandemic and in addition to refinancing, the company arranged a $65 million revolving credit facility in order to improve liquidity. Revlon also announced cost cutting measures, the majority of which will come in the form of layoffs. The company is one of many in an industry that has faced reduced demand even before COVID-19 has kept most Americans confined to their homes.\n\n23. Gogo\n\n• Industry: Communication services\n\nGogo is an in-flight broadband connectivity provider based in Chicago. As nonessential travel has been effectively halted during the COVID-19 pandemic and airlines have grounded many of their planes, the company's revenue has also taken a hit. As a result, in late April, the company announced plans to furlough 60% of its workforce – a total of about 600 employees. Executive pay at the company was also slashed. CEO Oakleigh Thorne said in a statement that these cuts were necessary to ensure the long-term health of the business.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Ukraine\n\nRussian missile strikes hit the southern Ukrainian port of Odesa , just one day after Ukraine and Russia agreed on a deal that would allow the resumption of vital grain exports from the region. \"Russia agreed to some deal on grain export, but immediately after this attacked it -- showing they want to continue to threaten the world's food security,\" Ukrainian member of parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko told CNN. The deal promised to unblock ports on the Black Sea to allow the safe passage of grain and oilseeds -- some of Ukraine's most important exports . Russia has been blocking maritime access to those ports, meaning that millions of tons of Ukrainian grain have not reached the many countries that rely on the food source. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia's missile attack \"casts serious doubt\" on the grain deal.

Tens of thousands of people were evacuated in France as firefighters battled wildfires that ripped through over 78 square miles in the country's wine region of Bordeaux, authorities said. The blaze comes as huge swaths of Europe have been charred by wildfires this week amid an extreme heat wave.\n\nHEAT WAVE FORECAST:Dangerous heat will continue all weekend across the US\n\nPilots die while battling Moose Fire\n\nThe two pilots who died in the crash were contracted to help fight the Moose Fire, Cernicek said.\n\nMore than 700 firefighters were battling the blaze Saturday as it burned about 21 miles north of Salmon, Idaho, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nA red flag warning was issued Saturday as high temperatures, low humidity and gusty winds threatened to worsen the fire, which had spread to over 45 square miles as of Saturday evening.\n\nHEAT WAVE IN EUROPE:'National emergency' in UK as historic temps forecast and wildfires rage\n\nNine helicopters were supporting ground crews with water bucket drops Friday, according to an incident report from the center.\n\nCernicek said the National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the cause of the crash.\n\nIdaho Gov. Brad Little ordered that all U.S. and State of Idaho flags be flown at half-staff Friday in honor of the two pilots killed in the helicopter crash.\n\nNEW MEXICO CRASH:4 dead after New Mexico sheriff's helicopter crashes while helping battle wildfires\n\nYosemite wildfire prompts evacuations, damages structures\n\nA wildfire that erupted Friday is spreading quickly, growing into one of California's largest wildfires of the year. The Oak Fire, which started southwest of Yosemite, prompted evacuations and damaged at least 10 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nIt erupted as firefighters made progress against an earlier blaze that burned to the edge of a grove of giant sequoias in the southernmost part of Yosemite park. The Oak Fire has burned through nearly 15 square miles and was 0% contained Saturday evening, Cal Fire said.\n\nEvacuation orders were put in effect Saturday for over 6,000 people living across a several-mile span in the sparsely populated, rural area, said Daniel Patterson, a spokesman for the Sierra National Forest. Lushmeadows, a subdivision of about 1,700 residents in the Sierra Nevada foothill area, was among those under mandatory evacuation orders.\n\nFirefighters make progress on previous Yosemite blaze\n\nThe Oak Fire raged as firefighters made significant progress against the Washburn Fire, which burned from Yosemite National Park into the Sierra National Forest, threatening Mariposa Grove, home to hundreds of giant sequoias.\n\nThe Washburn Fire was 79% contained Saturday afternoon after it burned almost 7.6 square miles. After starting July 7, the fire forced the southern entrance of Yosemite to shutter and led to the evacuation hundreds of people in the community of Wawona.\n\nGIANT SEQUOIAS THREATENED:Thick wildfire smoke hangs over Yosemite; flames reached notable giant sequoia grove\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service also announced Friday plans to take emergency action to save giant sequoias threatened by increasingly intense wildfires exacerbated by climate change and aggressive fire suppression methods.

Firefighters were forced to withdraw in many areas as one large wildfire raged on and another remained under control.\n\nOn Thursday night, hundreds of people watched from a ridge top as orange flames tore through the Rock Creek neighborhood of Superior, and numerous other fires dotted the horizon.\n\nFirefighting conditions were expected to improve overnight with decreasing winds. The National Weather Service said a high wind warning was extended through 8 p.m. but winds were expected to lessen overnight. Snow that's expected Friday could also help douse the blaze, a National Weather Service meteorologist told USA TODAY.\n\nAbout 600 homes, a Target shopping complex and a hotel have been destroyed by fire in the area, according to Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle.\n\nOne fire had burned over 1,600 acres in a suburban area as of Thursday evening, Pelle said at a press conference. At least one first responder was injured and a hospital reported treating several burn victims.\n\nThere have been no reports of missing people or fatalities yet. But Pelle said he would not be surprised if there were injuries or fatalities resulting from the fires.\n\nGov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency to allow the state to access emergency funds and services.\n\n\"This area, for those who don't know this area of Boulder County, is right in and around suburban sub-developments, stores – It's like the neighborhood that you live in,\" Polis said at the press conference. \"1,600 acres near a population center can be, and is in this case, absolutely devastating.\"\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, a cloud of dark gray smoke could be seen blowing over the town of Superior, located about 20 miles northwest of Denver. The entire town of about 13,000 residents was ordered to evacuate. About 210 homes were lost in the Old Town area of Superior.\n\nNEWS AT NIGHT: For an update later tonight, sign up for the Evening Briefing.\n\nPHOTOS:Wildfires near Denver force thousands to evacuate, vehicles and buildings burned\n\nThe city of Louisville, with some 20,000 residents, was also ordered to evacuate. All 370 homes in the Sagamore subdivision of Louisville also burned, Pelle said.\n\nLate Thursday night, Louisville issued a boil water advisory for the entire city in coordination with Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment.\n\n\"Protect yourself by using bottled water or boiling any water to be used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, washing dishes, and food preparation until further notice,\" the advisory said.\n\nSix people were hospitalized with burns at UCHealth Broomfield Hospital, spokeswoman Kelli Christensen told USA TODAY. She could not elaborate on their conditions or the severity of burns due to HIPAA, a health care privacy law, but said all six were being treated currently.\n\nCentura-Avista Adventist Hospital, just northwest of Broomfield, evacuated its patients and employees as the flames grew closer. The hospital was fully evacuated by 4:15 p.m. and sent patients to two sister hospitals. Before the hospital was evacuated, videos posted to social media showed flames just across the street with homes on fire. One video showed hospital workers in a field outside the hospital with a hose nearby that had been used to wet the grass.\n\n\"Patients should not attempt to go to Avista Adventist Hospital; nearby roads have been closed. Patients should go to the nearest hospital to receive services or call 9-1-1 if it is emergency,\" said Lindsay Radford, a spokeswoman for the hospital.\n\nThe Broomfield Detention Center, about 20 miles northwest of Denver, was evacuated late Thursday night. All inmates were evacuated to another facility and are safe, Broomfield police tweeted.\n\nAs of 5 p.m., the fire was hopscotching through several neighborhoods in Superior, setting ablaze some houses and leaving others untouched. Almost all that burned were completely unchecked, firefighters powerless to stop the flames being driven by the howling wind.\n\nPat Kilbride, who has lived in the Old Town area of Superior for 30 years said his house burned down, killing his dog and cat. He said he believed many other homes were also destroyed.\n\nKilbride rushed toward his house when he heard the fire was approaching the area, but couldn’t get close because of road closures. By the time he arrived on foot, it was already engulfed.\n\n“It’s all gone. The whole Old Town,” he said. “I’m going to head back to my truck and feel sorry for myself.”\n\nStrong winds were helping fuel the blaze with gusts as strong as 115 mph measured earlier in the day just south of Boulder, Bruno Rodriguez, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service told USA TODAY. Constant winds were being measured around 40 mph with higher gusts throughout the region.\n\nOfficials suspected some of the fires may have been sparked by downed power lines.\n\nRodriguez said the winds were unlike anything they've seen this season. Coupled with six to seven months of incredibly dry conditions, he said, it was \"the worst, most terrible combination that just allowed a fast-moving fire like this.\"\n\nThe region only saw about 1.6 inches of rain since August, which was \"well below normal,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nAs firefighters continued to battle the raging fire, the area was also placed under a winter storm warning with several inches of snow forecast overnight and into Friday. The wet snow should help douse the blaze, along with winds forecasted to slow into the evening.\n\n\"We're going to thankfully see rapidly changing weather conditions,\" Rodriguez said. \"We've been waiting for this snow for a while, and it couldn't have come at a better time.\"\n\nHughes reported from Boulder.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/03/06/florida-panhandle-wildfires-acres-evacuations/9405934002/", "title": "2 massive wildfires burn thousands of acres, force evacuations in ...", "text": "PANAMA CITY, Fla. — Florida firefighters and emergency workers are still battling two massive wildfires Sunday that have burned thousands of acres and forced over 1,000 evacuations in an area of the Florida Panhandle that was still recovering from the destruction caused by a Category 5 hurricane more than three years ago\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, the growing Bertha Swamp Road fire had burned 9,000 acres, or 14 square miles, and was 10% contained and. The Adkins Avenue fire was 35% contained and had shrunk from its largest size of 1,400 acres, or just over 2 square miles, to 840 acres.\n\nThe Adkins fire, believed to have been started by a homeowner burning trash that got out of control, destroyed two structures, and damaged another 12 homes late Friday. Officials said Saturday they were not aware of any damage caused by the Bertha fire, but it crept toward Bear Creek Sunday, threatening the community of 2,000 consisting of mostly elders.\n\nIn his second trip to Bay County this weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a news conference Sunday afternoon that the Bertha Swamp Road fire is \"a big boy and is raging very quickly.\"\n\n\"Today's the perfect day for these types of fires to move, unfortunately, (because) you have very dry conditions, and you have a lot of wind,\" DeSantis said. \"We have deployed at the state level four firefighting engine strike teams (that) are assembled to support local firefighting resources ... and they can do both structural and wildland protection.\"\n\nLocal officials said Monday that no first responders have been injured while fighting wildfires in Bay County, correcting a weekend statement from DeSantis, who said there had been reports of injuries.\n\n\"Contrary to national media reports, there are no fatalities and no injures (from) the wildfires in Bay County,\" a post on the Bay County, Florida Emergency Services Facebook page states. \"All first responders are safe.\"\n\nIn a separate conference Saturday, DeSantis also said eight homes had been engulfed by the Adkins Avenue Fire, but officials remain adamant that only two are confirmed destroyed so far.\n\nNEWS DEVELOPING INTO TO THE EVENING:For an update later tonight, sign up for the Evening Briefing.\n\nA third fire broke out Sunday afternoon, which has grown from 40 to 163 acres as a result of high winds and dry weather conditions, the Florida Forest Service-Chipola said Sunday via Twitter. Evacuations are underway for the Clifford Chester Sims State Veterans Nursing Home.\n\n'One thing after the other'\n\nBay County was hit hard by Hurricane Michael in 2018, which was directly responsible for 16 deaths and about $25 billion in damage in the U.S., and left behind 72 million tons of destroyed trees that have provided fuel for the Bay County wildfires, according to the Florida Forest Service.\n\n\"After Hurricane Michael, you had a massive amount of this basically dried tinder that was left in its wake, and so these fires were something people have been discussing for many years now,\" DeSantis said Saturday. \"And so this was not a surprise given that was sitting there, and you have very low humidity and the winds, and so it's been kind of a perfect storm.\"\n\nLike other families in the eastern Bay County area, Paul and Laurie Shuman were getting settled into a new residence after losing their home during Hurricane Michael in October 2018.\n\nOn Saturday, they were once again stifled with panic and uncertainty as they watched glimpses of their home go up in flames through ADT security camera system videos.\n\nBy the time the couple arrived as close to their home as they safely could — about a mile out — the home was charred to pieces, with only the garage door, part of the brick frame, and the frame to the pool covering still standing. They lost everything.\n\n\"When you talk about starting over, there's starting over and then there's starting from the beginning. In three years, I've lost two houses,\" Paul Shuman said, adding he also lost his job in that time period after the county closed the incinerator at which he had worked for 25 years. \"It's one thing after the other.\"\n\nLocal authorities said they didn’t know when residents would be able to return to their homes.\n\n“It is NOT safe to return home at this time.

People come from all over the world to see these trees.\"\n\nThe KNP Complex started as two fires during a Sept. 9 lighting storm before merging into one and exploding in size, forcing the park to close and communities to evacuate. The KNP Complex had scorched nearly 37,000 acres with 0% containment as of Friday morning, according to fire officials.\n\nFirefighters have gone to extraordinary lengths to save the big trees, including wrapping General Sherman's 37-foot-wide trunk in a fire-resistant wrap that brought national attention to the wildfire.\n\nWhat is going on with the weather? Tackle deep climate issues and current events with the Climate Point newsletter.\n\nBut the most successful measures to protect the sequoias, firefighters said, happened years before the KNP Complex sent crews from across the country scrambling to the slopes and ridges of California's Sierra Nevada, the trees' only natural habitat.\n\nDecades of prescribed fire – highly controlled burns carried out and overseen by professionals – have cleared the groves of brush and fuels that cause wildfires to get established and grow out of control. Flames shrunk from 20- to 30-foot tall to just 2 or 3 feet at the grove's entrance, allowing crews to focus on protecting the monarchs.\n\n\"Thirty years of prescribed fire made the difference protecting these natural wonders,\" said John Wallace, KNP Complex operations chief. \"It made our job so much easier.\"\n\nKNP Complex: 'A tale of two fires'\n\nPark officials describe the situation unfolding within the KNP Complex as \"a tale of two fires.\" Low-intensity fires, or \"good fire,\" keeps low to the ground and helps the forest stay healthy.\n\nBad fire torches entire swathes of dense and desiccated forest, running from crown to crown and can kill giant sequoias. Bad fires, scientists say, are becoming more frequent across the Sierra because of a \"perfect storm\" of climate change-driven drought and poor forest management.\n\n\"It's a huge loss ecologically. [Giant sequoia] store a lot of carbon and are great habitats, but it's also an emotional loss,\" said Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science for Sequoia National Park. \"The only reason they're threatened now is because of climate change and poor forest management, and that to me is heartbreaking to see a 2,000-year-old tree turned into a matchstick.\n\nFire is an essential part of the sequoia lifecycle, causing the tree's pinecones to burst and spread seeds to the newly cleared forest floor. Sequoias have several other adaptations that make them among the most fire-resistant species globally, including 12-foot-thick bark and crowns that grow hundreds of feet above the forest floor.\n\nHistorically, lightning sparked fires in sequoia groves every 10 to 20 years, and Indigenous tribes continued the tradition with cultural burning. However, when white settlers arrived in California and the Sierra, fire was virtually eliminated from the landscape.\n\n'Firefighters are going to stay busy':Crews battle California wildfires nearing giant sequoias, world's largest tree\n\n'It's definitely not working':Wildfires are burning up trees meant to fight climate change\n\nOver the next 100 years, overzealous fire-suppression policies transformed John Muir's vistas into overgrown tinderboxes, Brigham said. In the last decade, climate change and a mega-drought provided the match.\n\nThe Castle Fire in 2020 tore through about two dozen groves, killing 10% to 14% of the world's mature sequoias, an unprecedented die-off that jolted scientists into action.\n\nNow, the race is on to protect and preserve the remaining sequoia trees, Brigham said. The Windy Fire, currently burning just south of the KNP Complex, has entered the Giant Sequoia National Monument in Sequoia National Forest and severely burned at least one famous monarch.\n\nTo that end, Sequoia National Park and other sequoia managers have formed the Giant Sequoia Lands Coalition to protect the world's remaining monarchs from the threat of climate-changed fueled mega-fires through forest treatments prescribed burning, and other techniques.\n\nAs sequoia managers call for more resources to complete prescribed burns and forest treatments, Gov. Gavin Newsom visited Sequoia National Park on Thursday to sign into law a $15 billion climate package \"to combat the climate crisis, tackle catastrophic wildfires and help build a resilient California of the future.\"\n\nIt's the largest such investment of any state, the governor's office said in a press release.\n\n\"The package includes investments to support immediate drought response and long-term water resilience, promote sustainability and protect communities across the state from multi-faceted climate risks, including extreme heat and sea-level rise,\" the announcement said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/08/22/california-wildfires-updates-saturday-map-redwood-trees-burn-big-basin/3419083001/", "title": "About 600 wildfires have burned a million acres in California in a ...", "text": "Hundreds of wildfires are burning in California, nearly one million acres have been torched in a week, and more critical fire weather conditions are being forecast for the region.\n\nSince thousands of lightning strikes began hitting the state on Aug. 15, firefighters have responded to 585 wildfires, according to the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.

Lightning Complex, was spreading through Napa, Sonoma, Lake, Yolo and Stanislaus counties. The fire has burned more than 490 square miles and is 15% contained, according to Cal Fire.\n\nEast of Silicon Valley, the S.C.U. Lightning Complex was burning in Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties. The fire has burned more than 450 square miles and is 10% contained.\n\nThe L.N.U. and S.C.U. fire complexes grew to be the state's second and third largest wildfires ever on Saturday, trailing the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire, which burned more than 700 square miles, according to Cal Fire.\n\nFarther west, a third complex – the C.Z.U. Lightning Complex in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties – has burned about 100 square miles and is 5% contained.\n\n\"We have wildfires burning ... the size of the state of Rhode Island. The size of the state of Rhode Island,\" U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Saturday. \"It’s very, very sad. ... All of us salute our firefighters.\"\n\nHundreds of trees burn at Big Basin Redwoods State Park\n\nCalifornia's oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods, has been damaged by the fires, which have charred hundreds of massive ancient coast redwoods – some more than 1,000 years old.\n\nThe fires have also damaged the park’s headquarters, historic core and campgrounds, according to the California Department of Parks and Recreation. All campers and staff had been evacuated.\n\nDozens of other state parks, beaches and nature reserves have also been closed.\n\nYosemite National Park remains open, but multiple park gateway communities are under wildfire evacuation orders.\n\nWhere will the West's next deadly wildfire strike? The risks are everywhere\n\nHow lightning storms started California wildfires\n\nMany of the fires were caused by a mass of lightning strikes last week – sparks that lit a tinder box of vegetation left dry and crunchy by months of persistent heat and low humidity. Read more about how those conditions evolved here.\n\n\"We’ve definitely had lightning complex fires before,\" said Rick Carhart, Cal Fire public information officer for Butte County. \"The scope of this one, just the fact it's so many fires in such a large area of the state ... is an anomaly.\"\n\nThis particular surge of lightning-caused fires has been one of the most noteworthy in a decade, said Scott Rowe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.\n\nNewsom on Friday attributed the phenomenon to climate change.\n\n\"These lightning strikes, this unprecedented heat dome, these world record temperatures, unprecedented in human history – we’re experiencing more and more of that because of climate change, and as a consequence, these fires are more ferocious, and they’re moving at much more rapid speeds,\" Newsom said.\n\nThe fire season in California and across the West is starting earlier and ending later each year, and climate change is considered a key driver of this trend, according to Cal Fire.\n\n\"Warmer spring and summer temperatures, reduced snowpack, and earlier spring snowmelt create longer and more intense dry seasons that increase moisture stress on vegetation and make forests more susceptible to severe wildfire,\" the departments says on its website.\n\nThese factors have lengthened the fire season by about 75 days across the Sierra Nevada, according to Cal Fire, which predicts that, in Northern California, \"above-normal large fire potential\" will persist through October. In Southern California, the department predicts there will be an above-normal large fire potential in October and November.\n\nWildfires in Colorado, across western states\n\nFires were also burning in Colorado, Utah, Montana, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico and Wyoming, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group on Saturday.\n\n\"The heat dome that we experienced over the course of last week has not only impacted the state of California – it’s impacted the entire western United States,\" Newsom said. \"As a consequence of that, our mutual aid that goes outside the state of California has also been stretched.\"\n\nIn Arizona, three lightning-caused wildfires forced the evacuation of multiple communities on Saturday. The Salt, Gin and Griffin fires burned a combined 50 square miles. The fires each remained uncontained.\n\nIn Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis on Friday, activated the Colorado National Guard to assist the State Emergency Operations Center and incident commanders fighting wildfires. Voluntary evacuations were underway in parts of the state.\n\nWhat is the air quality and why don't cloth face masks help?\n\nSmoke from the fires is making the air quality in parts of California some of the worst in the world. A blanket of smoke – visible from satellite images – is covering parts of California, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has listed air quality in areas across the state as \"very unhealthy.\"\n\nAnd people in the area might not be able to smell the dangerous pollutants in the air.\n\nAir quality experts measure the amount of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) in the air. According to the EPA, those particles come from a variety of sources, including fires. Smoke from fires can send large amounts of PM 2.5 into the air and over large areas.\n\n\"Whenever things burn there’s a mixture of gases and particles,\" said University of California, San Francisco pulmonologist Dr. John Balmes, an expert on the respiratory and cardiovascular effects of air pollutants. \"When you smell smoke, you are smelling the gases in the air, not PM 2.5. ... They go hand-in-hand near the fire source, but the particulates travel in the upper atmosphere.\"\n\nIt’s possible to have bad air — air high in PM 2.5 — without smelling gases.\n\nYour coronavirus mask may not protect you, unless you have a mask designed to filter PM 2.5, like an N-95. Those masks are scarce worldwide because of the pandemic. What residents really need are respirators.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Elinor Aspegren, Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Joel Shannon, USA TODAY; Matt Brannon, Redding Record Searchlight; Brett McGinness and Amy Alonzo, Reno Gazette Journal; Kristin Scharkey, Palm Springs Desert Sun", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/09/10/oregon-wildfires-beachie-creek-santiam-fire-now-182-000-acres-weather-improving-riverside-lionshead/3458265001/", "title": "Oregon wildfire updates: United Way opens hub for donations to ...", "text": "Editor's note: This article contains wildfire updates for Thursday, Sept. 10.

Hood National Forest Supervisor.\n\nSantiam Canyon wildfire now 182,000 acres\n\nThe wildfire that terrorized the Santiam Canyon earlier this week continued to grow Thursday, and is now heading north and northwest.\n\nThe good news is Stayton remains on a level 2 evacuation and the forecast indicates slowing winds, which should lead to some moderation, even if fire conditions are still prime for spread.\n\nThe fire, which was originally named the Beachie Creek Fire, then renamed the Santiam Fire, has returned to the name Beachie Fire, officials said.\n\nWhatever it’s called, the Santiam/Beachie Creek Fire is 182,000 acres, up from 157,000 Wednesday morning, with most of that growth toward the Scotts Mills and Drake’s Crossing areas.\n\n“We’re trying to get ahead of it, making sure that the people in Scotts Mills and Drake’s Crossing are evacuated and that we’re responding to 911 calls and preparing that area,” fire spokesman Stefan Myers said.\n\nUPDATE 5:45 p.m.\n\nEighteen Salem firefighters deployed to Beachie Creek Fire\n\nEighteen Salem firefighters were sent to the Beachie Creek Fire following a request from the State Emergency Operations Center.\n\nThe firefighters are part of “Task Force 44” made up of a command vehicle, two engines, two grass units, a water tender and a deployment support trailer, according to Salem Fire Department officials.\n\n\"Our firefighters are well-trained and prepared to help protect families and businesses in the path of the fires,\" Fire Chief Mike Niblock said in a statement Thursday. \"The Salem team, Task Force 44, will join other firefighting crews as they work to combat this fire.

And in the meantime, conditions are still favorable for fire spread.\n\nSantiam/Beachie Creek Fire: working to search for the missing, prepare towns\n\nThe priority for fire crews on the Santiam/Beachie Creek Fire remains preparing towns and people where the fire is advancing, while also searching for missing people and stabilizing power lines.\n\n“In some cases, we’re literally still finding people who were down in creeks to avoid the fire, so making sure we get to everyone like that is the top priority,” Myers said. “In other cases, we’re clearing road so we can get to those people or allow people to evacuate. There remains a lot of work to do just getting trees off Highway 22.”\n\nLionshead Fire grows slightly to 109,223 acres\n\nThe Lionshead Fire, which burns from Mount Jefferson to Detroit, linking up with the Beachie Creek Fire, is continuing to show active growth around the west side of the Cascade Range.\n\nThe fire has already burned across many iconic Mount Jefferson area destinations, including Jefferson Park, but it could spread to more areas before its finished.\n\n“Fire personnel continue to scout the northern and southern edges of the fire area, identifying where the fire has grown and looking for potential locations for containment lines,” fire crews said.\n\nTrack the fires:Map traces current fires burning across northwest Oregon in real-time\n\nThe fire is burning in higher elevation terrain, and today, winds are expected to shift to the northwest this afternoon, promoting fire spread back to the south and east on Thursday, crews said.\n\n“Temperatures will be in the 70s with minimum relative humidity,” fire crews said. “Drought conditions, higher temperatures and low relative humidity will continue to contribute to the active fire behavior.”\n\nZach Urness has been an outdoors reporter, photographer and videographer in Oregon for 12 years.

In June, the World Health Organization recommended that scientists continue to research all possible origins of the coronavirus outbreak, including a lab leak. In one of the new studies published Tuesday , researchers determined that the earliest Covid-19 cases were centered at the Wuhan market among vendors who sold live animals or people who shopped there. Another study said the first animal-to-human transmission probably happened around November 18, 2019, and that an early version of the virus was found only in people who had a direct connection to the Wuhan market. Meanwhile, authorities in Wuhan today shut down a district of about 1 million people after detecting four asymptomatic Covid cases. All restaurant dining, entertainment venues, places of worship, and public transportation have been suspended for at least three days as \"temporary control measures,\" the government said.\n\n2. Trump\n\nFollowing eight public hearings held by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a new CNN poll shows the hearings haven't changed opinions much . About 79% of respondents believe former President Donald Trump acted unethically in trying to hold on to his office after the 2020 election. All told, the poll finds that 69% of Americans consider the January 6 attack to be a crisis or major problem for American democracy. That's up slightly from 65% earlier this year. This comes as the House Select committee released new testimony on Tuesday from Trump's former acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller . In the video deposition, Miller said Trump never gave him a formal order to have 10,000 troops ready to be deployed to the Capitol to intervene during the violence. Trump had previously said he requested thousands of National Guard troops be ready for January 6 because he felt \"that the crowd was going to be very large.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Hear ex-Trump acting defense secretary contradict Trump under oath Replay More Videos ...

Alabama’s preliminary, seasonally adjusted jobless rate for April was 3.6%, down a bit from March and nearly 10 percentage points below April 2020, when shutdowns prompted by the coronavirus outbreak decimated businesses. The number represents about 80,000 unemployed people statewide compared to nearly 290,000 at the same time a year ago. The number of people employed increased by 253,632 over the year to 2.2 million, according to a statement from the Alabama Department of Labor. With more open jobs than unemployed people, average weekly earnings for business rose to $968 in April, up more than $67 over the year. “Wage growth is astounding in Alabama,” Labor Secretary Fitzgerald Washington said. “We hit record highs in both hourly and weekly wages for all sectors, and the leisure and hospitality sector, which has been clamoring for workers, also hit record highs. Employers in Alabama are responding to labor shortages by raising wages, as to be expected.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Residents could soon access their vaccination records through their phones and other devices. The state health department is working to adopt technology that would give residents easy access to immunization records, which could also provide proof of COVID-19 vaccinations, Alaska’s News Source reports. The state plans to use the consumer access portal MyIR Mobile, whose technology is already available in Arizona, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Dakota, Tennessee, Washington, West Virginia, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. After people register, they can access their state immunization records. “I would really like people to think of MyIR Mobile as your old yellow vaccination card, and that is what it is,” said Matt Bobo of the state health department. Officials are working with the state’s information technology department to make sure the program is secure. Just last week, the health department took its website offline to investigate what it said was a malware attack. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy opposes any so-called vaccine passports and has said the state will not require anyone to show proof of vaccination. But businesses, nonprofits and employers with certain limitations can require people to be vaccinated. There’s no timeline on when MyIR Mobile will be operational, Bobo said.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A weekly Pima County-sponsored event called Vax After Dark is immunizing people whom health clinics, physician’s offices and large vaccine sites have missed. “We’re in the difficult part of getting people immunized,” said Dr. Theresa Cullen, director of the Pima County Health Department, which started the effort last month. “Every person we get vaccinated helps us control and get out of the pandemic.” The outdoor pop-up sets up tents and chairs – this time in the parking lot of Antigone Books in Tucson – plays Top 50 music, and puts a lot of resources into inoculating a relatively small number of people. About 20 people were working out of the unit at its most recent three-hour event Thursday from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., and a total of 36 people were vaccinated, which hardly compares to the hundreds per hour who can get shots at large-scale sites. Still, Pima County officials consider the effort a success because Vax After Dark reaches people who otherwise might not get a COVID-19 shot – people who don’t have a regular health provider, feel disconnected from the health system, don’t have a way to get to a large-scale site or have lingering questions about the vaccine. “If not for this, I might still be wondering where to go,” said Justin McCawley, 46. “I’m not very adult when it comes to my health.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The city has received more than $10.6million of an expected $21.2million in federal funding from this year’s coronavirus relief package, and some of that could be used for sewer line work required in the city’s federal consent decree. “There are regulations on how the funds can be spent, and infrastructure for water/sewer is included,” Fort Smith’s Deputy City Administrator Jeff Dingman wrote in an email. “Staff is working on how those funds might be incorporated into the project and rate planning we already have underway.” Dingman said when city administration staff has an approach for the Board of Directors to consider, it will be presented for approval. The funds are kept in a separate bank account for “transparent tracking and monitoring,” he said. The city entered a $225 million-plus, 12-year consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Justice in late 2014 to improve wastewater runoff that was getting into the Arkansas River. A five-year extension was granted in May 2020. The city estimated $22 million in consent decree-related capital improvements were needed in 2021. Another six years in extensions are being requested due to issues that arose during the 2019 flood and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The huge Los Angeles Unified School District will start the new school year next fall with on-campus, in-person instruction for all students five days a week but will retain an online option, Superintendent Austin Beutner said Monday. Elementary school students will have full days of instruction with their teacher and classmates, while middle and high school students will change classrooms for each period, said Beutner, who leads the nation’s second-largest school district. After-school programs will be available to students from the end of the school day until 6 p.m. Beutner said, however, that an online option must remain in place for the next school year for students who are unable or choose not to come to schools for in-person instruction. “Some students and some staff members may need to stay at home until all at schools are vaccinated due to health reasons because they live with an immunocompromised family member,” Beutner said, adding that he expects the majority of students and staff to be at school every day. Students and staff will wear masks until more children are vaccinated, he said. The superintendent reiterated his assertion that Los Angeles Unified has in place the highest safety standards of any school district in the nation.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Democrats outlined their priorities Monday for $3.8 billion in federal coronavirus relief destined for the state under the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan, and budgetary support, workforce development, affordable housing and mental health top their agenda. Gov. Jared Polis, majority Democrat legislative leaders and the four Democratic members of Colorado’s congressional delegation gave an overview of the plans at a Capitol news conference. Polis and others emphasized that the outline came after virtual and in-person meetings with Coloradans across the state in recent months. Polis said roughly $1.3 billion will be used to shore up current and future state and local spending; another third will go to workforce development, affordable housing, and mental and behavioral health; and a similar amount will support transportation and rural development and agriculture spending. Some of the state budget support will be unveiled in legislation currently being drafted for consideration this legislative session, said Sen. Dominick Moreno, chair of the Joint Budget Committee. A bipartisan legislative task force will study how to invest the coming pandemic relief funds in housing, behavioral health and job creation over the summer, said House Speaker Alec Garnett.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: After months of limited public access amid the pandemic, some of the last municipal buildings in the region have reopened to residents. As of Monday, Norwich City Hall is opening its doors to public traffic from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. five days a week. Mayor Peter Nystrom said the reopening decision was made based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and comes at a time when the rest of the state is also seeing a relaxing of gathering strictures. In addition to the municipal building, the police department headquarters’ lobby reopened to the public, and the Rose City Senior Center will resume some programming June 1. According to the center’s website, a limited number of classes will be offered at first, and other programming will be “slowly re-introduced,” with more visitors allowed into the facility over time. Municipal buildings in Killingly and Plainfield have been open to the public for several months with only brief public shutterings since the spring of 2020, while Griswold reopened its town hall in April. Pomfret Town Hall will reopen to the public June 2 from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. – but only on Wednesdays at first.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Sailors aboard the Chiquita Passion cargo ship received their first and only dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine Thursday in an effort to protect the crew in their international travels. Officials from the Delaware Division of Public Health alongside the Seamen’s Center of Wilmington boarded the ship to inoculate a couple dozen crew members at the Port of Wilmington. Sailors expressed their gratitude and relief to be able to get vaccinated before returning to their home countries. Kasyan Yuriy, captain of the Chiquita Passion, said the vaccine would help him and his crew feel more protected against the coronavirus while they perform their essential work. The sailors’ jobs help fuel a global exchange of goods, including food products, produce and cars. The Ukrainian maritime crew traverses the world to transport these goods, greatly increasing their chances of contracting COVID-19. The crew arrived in Wilmington after a five-day voyage from Guatemala. In April 2020, sailors were confined to their ships because companies weren’t switching out crews at the time due to COVID-19. Today, the situation isn’t much different. Sailors aboard the Dole Ecuador ship, whose crew was vaccinated May 19, are not allowed to leave their ship.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As the city reopens from its COVID-19 restrictions, the D.C. History Center is trying to capture stories from the past year and a half in a time capsule, WUSA-TV reports. Anne McDonough, deputy director of the D.C. History Center, said it’s important to hear directly from Washingtonians about what it was like to live through the pandemic in real time. “When you’re in the middle of something, it can be really hard of course to think about how this is going to be perceived or researched or examined in the years to come,” McDonough said. The collection, “In Real Time,” is a collecting initiative of the D.C. History Center that began in April 2020. It asks the public to help in documenting the historic events that took place during the past year. In its 127-year history, this is one of the first times the D.C. History Center has focused on collecting stories of an event while it is still occurring. Other institutions such as the D.C. Public Library, Humanities D.C., and the National Museum of African American History and Culture are also saving stories from the pandemic. To contribute to the collection, residents can upload a picture or story to the D.C. History Center. Optional prompts ask how COVID-19 has impacted families and what acts of kindness have been witnessed during this time.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis agreed to temporarily suspend sales taxes on back-to-school supplies; emergency preparedness purchases and recreational activities meant to encourage people back into the outdoors; music venues; museums; and other post-pandemic endeavors. But so-called tax holidays he signed into law Friday are being offset by the taxes the state will now collect on online purchases, to take in an estimated $1 billion annually. Some of the early proceeds would be transferred to the state’s unemployment trust fund and reduce unemployment taxes for businesses. The first holiday arrives this week during a 10-day period in which Floridians can prepare for the upcoming hurricane season without paying sales taxes on certain purchases. In late July and early August, Floridians won’t have to pay sales taxes for school supplies, some clothing and the first $1,000 for a computer. New to the “tax holiday” lineup this year is a “Freedom Week” during the first week of July on recreational purchases, as well as for purchasing tickets for concerts, athletic events and museums. The Republican governor used the bill signing event at a Home Depot in Pensacola to criticize other states he said put “repressive polices” in place during the coronavirus outbreak that “locked down their people.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state will use federal coronavirus relief money to temporarily pay all the costs of child care for 50,000 children enrolled in a program that subsidizes care for lower-income families. The state Department of Early Care and Learning said the plan will cost an estimated $95 million and last until Oct. 2, 2022. The extra money, which began with payments to child care facilities last week, is being offered to current and new participants. The payments will be made automatically, and parents don’t have to do anything to enroll. Normally, parents have to pay a designated family share of tuition in the Childcare and Parent Services program, in tiers up to 7% of their income. Parents also normally have to pay any difference between the weekly maximum the state is willing to pay under CAPS and what a child care facility actually charges. An annual survey of costs by ChildCare Aware of America finds that child care centers charge an average of $168 a week to care for an infant in Georgia. DECAL estimates in that scenario that parents would save $35 a week, or $1,820 a year. Parents will still be charged for transportation, meals or other fees. DECAL officials say they are trying to help families whose incomes may have declined during the pandemic and help more people get back to work.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state will once again require people receiving unemployment insurance benefits to search for work as a coronavirus testing program for travelers and growing vaccinations fuel a recovery of the tourism industry, Gov. David Ige says. Those filing for unemployment will need to report at least three steps they took to look for work from May 30 through June 5 when they submit their weekly claim June 6, said Anne Perreira-Eustaquio, director of the state Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. Those steps can include filling out job applications, interviewing for jobs and registering at the jobs website HireNetHawaii.com, she said. Hawaii’s unemployment rate was 9% in March, the highest in the nation and above the national average of 6%. But the rate has improved since peaking at 23.8% in April 2020. Ige said he would maintain other pandemic-era unemployment insurance benefits, including a weekly $300 federal supplement. The Democratic governor said he believed the extra payment helps unemployed residents pay rent and other expenses, which helps the economy. “As you know, the cost of living in Hawaii is higher than in other jurisdictions. And we have heard of many in our community who continue to struggle to find work and who continue to be unemployed,” Ige said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Anti-government activist Ammon Bundy is running for governor, according to documents filed Friday with the Secretary of State’s office. Bundy, best known for leading an armed standoff at an Oregon wildlife refuge five years ago, is running as a Republican in the 2022 Idaho gubernatorial primary, according to campaign finance documents. Current Gov. Brad Little, Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin and four other Republicans – Jeff Cotton, Edward Humphreys, Lisa Marie and Cody Usabel – have also filed campaign documentation needed to run for governor. So far no Democratic candidates have entered the race. Bundy garnered international attention when in 2016 he led a group of armed activists in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to protest the federal control of public lands. He was eventually arrested and later acquitted of all federal charges in that case. Bundy currently has two misdemeanor criminal trespassing cases pending against him in Idaho, and he’s representing himself for both. The cases stem from events during a protest of coronavirus restrictions at the Idaho Statehouse last August. He’s pleaded not guilty in one case and has not yet entered a plea in the second.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Amtrak is resuming full passenger rail service across the state as the number of COVID-19 cases falls. Gov. J.B. said Pritzker last week that the full long-distance interstate schedule restores service on four state-sponsored lines. Service on the Hiawatha line between Milwaukee and Chicago resumed Sunday. Routes connecting Chicago and Quincy, Chicago and Carbondale, and Chicago and St. Louis will operate at full capacity by the middle of July. Tickets for travel on those lines can be reserved now. Amtrak has stations in 30 Illinois communities and served more than 1 million riders per year before the coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker’s office said an Illinois capital development program includes $1.1 billion for rail improvements, including $78 million to upgrade rail crossings and improve safety.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana AFL-CIO is criticizing Gov. Eric Holcomb’s decision to withdraw the state from federal programs providing an extra $300 in weekly payments to unemployed workers and expanded jobless benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The labor union said it cost the state nothing to remain in the programs, arguing that they have provided millions of dollars a week to families who could soon face having no income. Holcomb announced last week that the state would leave those federal programs effective June 19. Many businesses blame their difficulty filling job openings on the extra $300 weekly payment and programs that provide jobless aid to self-employed or gig workers and to people who have been unemployed for more than six months. Indiana AFL-CIO President Brett Voorhies said Holcomb was “trying to coerce Hoosiers into low-paying jobs.” “If he really wants to get Hoosiers back to work, he should focus on making sure parents have affordable child care, more Hoosiers are fully vaccinated, and the available jobs are good, union jobs that pay living wages and provide good benefits,” Voorhies said. “Choosing to eliminate financial aid to Hoosier families is cruel and unnecessary.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The coronavirus pandemic may have hastened the state’s shift toward an unwanted milestone – fewer births than deaths each year. Iowa, like much of the nation, has been going through a “baby bust” for more than a decade, and the decline accelerated during 2020 and the first two months of 2021. Meanwhile, the number of deaths in the state spiked 16% last year, to 35,651, as a wave of COVID-19 infections accelerated a years­long increase in deaths. The death total nearly equaled the 36,057 children born last year to Iowa parents. Preliminary reports suggest March 2021 brought a bit of a rebound in Iowa births, reflecting pregnancies that began early last summer. A total of 3,106 babies were born in Iowa in March 2021, compared to 3,026 in March 2020. But overall, the state’s birth rates have been sliding since 2007, the year before the country’s last big recession. Laura Lindberg, a research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, said some Americans who delayed starting or expanding families because of the pandemic might try to become pregnant in the next few months or years. But she doesn’t expect a dramatic baby boom that would suddenly push the birth rate up to where it was more than a decade ago.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A public school district is trying to figure out how to keep school board meetings accessible online without hindering public comments after YouTube concluded that a video of a recent meeting spread misinformation about COVID-19 and removed the video. The Shawnee Mission school board’s meeting last Monday saw several parents and a state lawmaker call for the district to remove its mask mandate, The Kansas City Star reports. Several residents of the district in Johnson County have spread misinformation about COVID-19 and mask-wearing at county, city and school board meetings during the past year. But district spokesman David Smith said it was the first time that the district learned a video was removed. More than two dozen residents gathered before the meeting to protest the district’s mask mandate, which officials have said will stay in place. State Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican who’s argued for ending coronavirus pandemic restrictions, was in the crowd and spoke during public comments. YouTube’s community guidelines list COVID-19 fallacies it will remove, including that the coronavirus is not real or that children cannot get infected. Smith said the district is still talking about how to manage the issue. “We really don’t want to lose our ability to broadcast,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: More residents need to get vaccinated to avoid a bump in COVID-19 cases, health officials say, or the city could be in for a “rough fall.” Louisville Chief Health Strategist Dr. Sarah Moyer said during a news conference Wednesday that she’s “frustrated” that only 38.7% of people in the city are fully vaccinated. A little more than 48% of residents have received at least a first dose. “We have plenty of vaccine available in every ZIP code in the county, as well as transportation access,” Moyer said. She said the city will take suggestions on how to break through to those resistant to vaccines and will hold more education events and talk to employees because “until we can get that number up, none of us are truly safe.” Louisville had 542 new COVID-19 cases the week of May 10-14, the fewest since July 2020, but “if people choose to go maskless before they are vaccinated, we will see that number go up,” she said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now said fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks in many situations, and Gov. Andy Beshear will largely drop a mask mandate for vaccinated Kentuckians on June 11. Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer of U of L Health, said it’s possible to get to 70% vaccinated over the next two months or so.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: House lawmakers rejected a modest increase in the state’s jobless benefits and a return-to-work incentive payment aimed at driving people to exit unemployment and go back to work. Only 44 legislators voted for the bill by Rep. Rodney Lyons, while 54 House members voted against it Thursday. Lyons, D-Harvey, initially proposed to raise Louisiana’s maximum weekly unemployment benefits – currently set at $247 – by $28. That was a deal struck by some business and labor associations to raise benefits that are the second-lowest in the nation. But Republicans on the House labor committee also added a provision by GOP Rep. Mike Echols into the bill that would have given residents receiving unemployment a lump sum payment of $500 or $1,000 to go back to work, if they gave up their right to claim jobless benefits for six months. Some opponents objected to raising unemployment benefits. Others objected to giving a bonus payment to jobless people who are required to search for work in order to receive unemployment.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: New mask guidance took effect in the state Monday, which means residents no longer need to wear face coverings indoors in most situations. Mainers, with the exception of state employees, can go maskless in most indoor settings, except for schools and day care. State officials are still recommending that people who are not yet vaccinated against COVID-19 wear a mask indoors. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, made the decision in mid-May to align the state rules with the latest guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state is also lifting physical distancing requirements at indoor public settings where people are eating or drinking, such as bars and restaurants. But state employees will have to wear masks in shared indoor work spaces until at least July 7, the state budget commissioner said in a Friday memo. Businesses, meanwhile, are free to set their own rules, but one major supermarket chain already relaxed its mask rules. Hannaford announced that vaccinated customers no longer had to wear masks effective Monday in Maine. Customers who have not been vaccinated are asked to continue to wear a mask inside stores. Monday was also the first day for several other newly relaxed pandemic requirements, including a removal of all capacity limits in public settings, whether indoors or outdoors.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Federal authorities in the state have seized the domain name of a website accused of fraudulently offering to sell COVID-19 vaccines. The U.S. Attorney’s office for the District of Maryland said “COVIDReliefSociety.org” is the 10th virus fraud-related domain name that it has seized since the pandemic began. In a news release Thursday, prosecutors said the website promised same-day delivery of COVID-19 vaccines anywhere in the world but actually collected visitors’ personal information to launch phishing attacks and deploy malware. The site now bears a message that the federal government has seized it. “In a time when we are urging people to get vaccinated for COVID-19, it is reprehensible that fraudsters are trying to prey on unsuspecting residents and their families,” acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan Lenzner said in a statement. Investigators believe the site’s domain name was created in December. It included an image of what appeared to be a screen capture of vaccine developer Moderna’s website and trademarked logo, according to prosecutors.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Fans are being allowed to return to the TD Garden in greater numbers this coming weekend, just in time for Bruins and Celtics playoff runs, arena management announced Monday. Even though the arena will open to “near full capacity” Saturday, fans will still be required to wear face coverings and follow other COVID-19 safety protocols, management said in a statement. “The Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics have confirmed with their respective leagues that TD Garden is permitted to align with city and state guidelines and return to near full capacity beginning May 29, 2021,” the statement said. TD Garden has been permitted to host fans at 25% capacity since May 10. The Celtics have home playoff games against the Brooklyn Nets scheduled for Friday and Sunday. The Bruins finished off their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series against the Washington Capitals 3-1 on Sunday, and their second-round opponent will be either the Pittsburgh Penguins or the New York Islanders.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer apologized Sunday after apparently violating state-mandated social distancing guidelines at an East Lansing bar and grill. It was the latest pandemic-related misstep for the Democratic governor, who waited weeks to disclose partial details of a private jet trip she took to visit her father in Florida after two of her top aides headed south as coronavirus cases surged in Michigan and as residents were cautioned against traveling south for spring break. A photo circulated on social media of Whitmer with a large group of unmasked people at a bar-restaurant, The Landshark Bar & Grill. The photo, which shows Whitmer seated with about a dozen others, was posted on social media by one of the attendees but later deleted. “Throughout the pandemic, I’ve been committed to following public health protocols,” Whitmer said in a statement Sunday. “Yesterday, I went with friends to a local restaurant. As more people arrived, the tables were pushed together. Because we were all vaccinated, we didn’t stop to think about it. In retrospect, I should have thought about it. I am human. I made a mistake, and I apologize.” Michigan restaurants and bars remain subject to capacity limits and social distancing requirements. Current orders require six people or fewer at tables and distances of 6 feet between tables.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has accelerated after several sluggish weeks. The pace of inoculations remained above 40,000 shots a day Sunday, a level not previously seen for more than two weeks. Data shows a big increase in first vaccine doses, which now average nearly 18,000 a day, up from about 10,000 a day a week ago. Some of the increase can likely be attributed to 12- to 15-year-olds who are now eligible for the vaccine. Minnesota was averaging 60,000 shots a day at one point last month before the numbers began dropping, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Officials continue to encourage Minnesotans to keep their guard up during proms, graduations and other spring events, noting that more coronavirus variants are driving new cases across the state. The state’s largest portion of confirmed cases is among people in their 20s, more than 110,000 since the pandemic began. The number of infected high school-age people has also grown, with more than 49,000 15- to 19-year-olds known to be infected throughout the pandemic. Experts say young people are less likely to feel the worst effects of the disease but worry they can spread it to older or more vulnerable people. The latest numbers show about 63% of Minnesotans 16 and older have received at least one vaccine dose, and 56% have been fully vaccinated.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state could see more than $700million in federal funding for broadband over the next few years, thanks to pandemic aid, Federal Communications Commission grants and a possible infrastructure bill. That doesn’t include indirect funding sources such as Paycheck Protection Program loans for broadband-related businesses, subsidies for ratepayers, grants for 5G development and older grant opportunities like the FCC’s Connect America Fund. The large influx of investment is likely to dramatically alter the digital landscape of Mississippi, which has long been a broadband desert, ranking last in the nation for internet connectivity. According to U.S. census data, Mississippi has the lowest rate of broadband subscribers per capita. Broadband in rural areas has long been a large contributor to the digital divide – the gap between who benefits from reliable internet connections and who doesn’t. As the pandemic pushed schools into online learning, many school districts and colleges were faced with the struggle of ensuring everybody had access. For some, this meant mailing out mobile Wi-Fi hot spots to students, opening school parking lots for Wi-Fi access, or even sending out homework by mail.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A series of COVID-19 vaccine clinics will be held at public park facilities in the next eight weeks, a Springfield-Greene Park Board spokesperson said Monday. Clinics are coming soon to taxpayer-owned locations like Rutledge-Wilson Farm Park, Dickerson Park Zoo and the Mizumoto Japanese Stroll Garden. To sweeten the deal for folks getting their arms jabbed, “special incentives” are available, including free admission to facilities on the days clinics are held for those who choose to get vaccinated, Park Board spokesperson Jenny Fllmer Edwards said. Similar “givebacks” include a “thank-you card” that offers a variety of discounts for park board services like boat rentals, Edwards said. The Springfield-Greene County Health Department said in a news release that it identified locations in places with relatively low vaccination rates where it appeared that the largest number people could be reached as part of a strategy to meet people “where they are.” The clinics are available for walk-ins, but individuals may save time by registering on the Missouri Vaccine Navigator. Preregistered individuals are asked to bring their ID and patient identification number from the website. A parent or guardian’s consent is required for children ages 12 through 17, the health department said.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: City-County Health Officer Trisha Gardner received a standing ovation from commissioners, staff and attending citizens for her leadership throughout the COVID-19 health crisis during last week’s Great Falls City Commission meeting. “It was very unexpected,” Gardner said. “It’s an honor to serve this community.” Commissioner Owen Robinson recognized Gardner stepped into her job in late 2019, just months before COVID-19 became a reality in Great Falls, which he described as “probably the most critical time for a public health officer in Cascade County, ever.” Commissioner Mary Sheehy Moe commended Gardner for her service to the community during the pandemic. “By February of this year, nearly 1 in 6 Americans was living in a community at the height of a pandemic without a public health officer,” Moe said. “Great Falls, Montana, was not one of those communities.” Moe recalled how COVID-19 reached its peak last fall and said how despite how much pushback the Board of Health received, Gardner focused on what would keep the city safest in the short term and coronavirus-free in the long term.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state will end a $300-a-week unemployment bonus that has been going to jobless workers during the pandemic, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Monday, declaring a “return to normalcy” and rescinding the last of his coronavirus-related executive orders at what he called his last pandemic-related news conference. Nebraska joined at least 22 other Republican-led states that are halting the additional unemployment benefits, including assistance for gig workers and the self-employed, who don’t normally qualify. Ricketts said the extra benefits will end June 19. Ricketts pointed to Nebraska’s status as the state with the lowest unemployment nationally last month and one of the lowest overall throughout the pandemic. He said he also believes the $300 benefit creates a disincentive to find a job when the state’s online job portal has 39,000 open positions. Workers’ advocates have disputed that argument and countered that employers should offer higher pay if they want to attract quality employees. Ricketts, who has opposed prior minimum wage increases, said employers should pay what the free market dictates. “I certainly think the employers should pay what the market demands to hire people,” he said. “The government should not be interfering with that by artificially driving that number up.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Long-simmering disputes over coronavirus restrictions in the Legislature boiled over Thursday when the Democratic majority voted to punish Republican lawmakers for refusing to comply with rules in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Under rules announced Wednesday, people in the state Capitol can roam the building without face coverings as long as they have been vaccinated. Republican Assemblywomen Annie Black and Jill Dickman went mask-free on the Assembly floor Thursday but refused to make known whether they had received COVID-19 shots. Dickman was escorted out of the Assembly floor after staff told her that she would have to prove she had been vaccinated. She refused. In a party-line vote, the Assembly elected to strip Black of her right to vote on measures and address the chamber until she apologized for violating legislative rules. She remained on the Assembly floor. “This is WAY out of control!” Black tweeted after the incident. Democratic Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson said the Assembly rules allowed people to forgo masks but required they wear them if they have not been vaccinated. “We were informed that there were persons who had not confirmed they were vaccinated and would not wear masks, so they didn’t comply with our rules,” he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College is increasing mental health support and loosening some COVID-19 restrictions in dorms amid concerns about students feeling isolated. “The pandemic has exacerbated many problems, but foremost among them has been mental health,” Dartmouth President Phil Hanlon and other officials said Friday in message to students, employees and parents of undergraduates. “On this critical issue, we must do more to support our community.” Under the new rules meant to increase socialization, students are now allowed to host two guests who also live on campus in their dorm rooms at the same time, the Valley News reports. The college also is adding a second nurse to the on-call staffing at its health center and plans to add new counselors and a student wellness coordinator to expand mental health services. The two counselors will also receive suicide prevention training following the deaths of multiple students throughout the pandemic. The changes were announced two days after the death of a freshman at her home in New York. Two other freshmen and a junior also have died this academic year. A candlelight vigil for all four will be held Tuesday night.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state will lift its indoor mask mandate for people vaccinated against COVID-19 beginning Friday, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. The announcement comes about a week after Murphy, a Democrat, rejected similar mask guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying he wanted “more time on the clock” for people to get vaccinated. Also on Friday, the state is lifting the requirement for maintaining 6 feet of distance between patrons at all indoor and outdoor businesses such as restaurants, retail stores, gyms and casinos. New Jersey had been an outlier, with neighboring Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania aligning with the CDC soon after its advice came out. The state’s vaccination rates have been climbing, with Murphy pledging to fully inoculate 70% of the population by June 30. Murphy faced a torrent of criticism over the delay, especially from Republicans who are hoping to defeat him in November as he seeks reelection to a second term. He dismissed it, though, and said the decision focused on avoiding more deaths from COVID-19. Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli pointed to daily deaths still in the double digits and the daily infection rate hovering above lows seen last summer as rationales for continuing the mask mandate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The September spectacle featuring funnel cakes, turkey legs, livestock and art exhibits, and carnival rides plans an in-person return this year. The New Mexico State Fair was scrapped in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, although some events took place virtually. The event drew about 475,000 visitors from around the state and region to Albuquerque in 2019. Spokesman Wyndham Kemsley said Thursday that officials are confident the fair can be held safely in person, with more hand-washing and sanitation stations, as well as social distancing. “We have one of the biggest properties in New Mexico, so we have a lot of open space,” he said. The fair is scheduled for Sept. 9-19. Organizers are looking to hire hundreds of employees. Ticket sales for another big event, the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, are expected to start in July. The fiesta, too, was canceled last year. Its early morning mass ascensions, fireworks shows and launches of special-shaped hot air balloons attract hundreds of thousands of spectators from across the globe and hundreds of balloon pilots and their crews. The fiesta is set for Oct. 2-10. The New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs announced Thursday that all the state museums have reopened and several historic sites.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio promised a return to normal for the nation’s largest public school system Monday as he announced that classrooms will open for in-person instruction in September with no remote option. “It’s time for everyone to come back,” said de Blasio, a Democrat. “It’s time for us all to be together. It’s time to do things the way they were meant to be done. All the kids in the classroom together getting a great education from educators who care, staff members who care.” He said the roughly 1 million students who attend traditional public schools will be in their classrooms with some version of the coronavirus protocols that have been in place in the current academic year, including mask-wearing and testing for the virus. After closing schools in March 2020, New York City was one of the first large U.S. cities to reopen school buildings in the fall of that year, but the majority of parents chose online-only learning for their children. Children and staff members who have been in physical classrooms have been randomly tested for the coronavirus, and the city has reported very low rates of virus transmission in the schools. The head of the union that represents city teachers said that while there is “no substitute for in-person instruction,” some students might still need a remote option next fall.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Interested in a little extra spending money for the upcoming holiday weekend? Health officials in four North Carolina counties will offer $25 incentives for those who’ve yet to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The state Department of Health and Human Services announced a pilot program starting Wednesday at certain vaccine sites in Mecklenburg, Guilford, Rowan and Rockingham counties. Adults who get their first dose at the sites or drive someone for that first-dose appointment will receive $25 cash cards, DHHS said in a new release. The “Summer Cash Cards” will be available through June 8 while supplies last. The State Employees Credit Union is providing the cards for the pilot. The incentive is another effort by DHHS to boost vaccination rates entering the summer. The North Carolina Zoo offered last week a free ticket for those who received their first COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic on the zoo property. A similar offer will occur June 10-12. More than 52% of the adult population in North Carolina had received at least one dose as of late last week, according to DHHS data.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Air travel has picked up in the state, but it has not returned to the level recorded before the coronavirus pandemic hit. The state’s eight commercial service airports saw a significant increase in passenger numbers last month compared to April 2020. The state Aeronautics Commission said the airports in Bismarck, Minot, Williston, Dickinson, Grand Forks, Fargo, Devils Lake and Jamestown collectively had 62,163 passenger boardings last month. That compares with 92,063 in April 2019. Just 4,964 passengers traveled by air in April of last year as the pandemic spread. That was the lowest monthly total since record keeping began four decades ago, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “Our airports and aviation industry have endured a long road to recovery since last April, when passenger levels dropped 95% as our country worked together to slow the spread of COVID-19,” state Aeronautics Commissioner Kyle Wanner said. “Leisure travel has been growing and allowing for an initial recovery in air travel demand. As the nation’s recovery from the pandemic continues, we would also like to see additional business travel begin to cycle back into the market.” Millions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid have been sent to North Dakota airports. The latest is a $1.2 million award to the Williston airport.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans have reported nearly 6,000 medical issues arising in the days and weeks following their COVID-19 vaccinations, but it’s impossible to know which problems, if any, were actually caused by the shots. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allows anyone to submit a report to its Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System online. That means reports are not verified, and many of the symptoms people report, beyond the expected mild side effects, might have no direct link to the injection, said Dr. Susan Koletar, director of the division of infectious diseases at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. In recent months, Ohioans reported everything from abnormal X-rays and colonoscopies to concussions, pink eye, general feelings of apathy and, on the more serious side, suspected blood clots. “It is absolutely not a reason to not get it,” Koletar said. “A lot of (the reports) are expected side effects. People should expect that their arm should hurt a little bit. … Is getting the vaccine worth not feeling great? I think the answer is ‘yes.’ ” In fact, the most common events reported to the CDC in Ohio were fever and chills, arm pain and an assortment of body aches. Such side effects can actually be a sign that the immune system is working to create protective antibodies, experts say.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: When the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a grinding halt in March 2020, the leaders of the city’s agencies dedicated to helping those experiencing homelessness had no choice but to push forward. The number of people served by those programs fell from 10,171 in 2019 to 9,874 in 2020, according to the city’s Homeless Management Information System. Closures and capacity reductions meant fewer people were able to receive services. Staff, volunteer, and supply shortages meant less manpower and fewer goods to go around. The day shelter at the Homeless Alliance’s WestTown Campus went from serving at least 350 people a day to being able to allow only 64 people inside at a time, according to Kinsey Crocker, director of communications. “It’s been a rough 15 months,” said Jerod Shadid, program planner for homeless services for Oklahoma City. The city showed its highest levels of homelessness in more than a decade in the city’s 2020 point-in-time count, when the community had not even started to see the effects of COVID-19. No point-in-time count was conducted this year because of the pandemic, making it harder to see some trends, but numbers collected by the Homeless Alliance showed a rise in unsheltered homeless people fairly early in the pandemic.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: State officials are betting that the desire to win $1million will boost the percentage of Oregonians vaccinated against COVID-19. With only half of residents either fully or partially vaccinated, Oregon Lottery officials approved a plan Friday to hold a special drawing. Those who have been vaccinated by June 27 will be eligible for the drawing the following day. “It’s never been easier to get a vaccine, so don’t miss your shot to enter,” Gov. Kate Brown said. She said the effort aims to raise the percentage of adult Oregonians who get vaccinated to 70% in order to fully reopen the state. The Oregon Health Authority said 50% of Oregonians were vaccinated as of Friday. Residents who have received at least a first dose are automatically entered to win through the state’s vaccine database. Brown, responding to a question at a Zoom news conference, said people who are in Oregon illegally and have been vaccinated are also eligible to win the prize. Other states are also trying the tactic, including New York, Maryland and Ohio. Oregonians 18 and older will have the chance to win $1 million or one of 36 $10,000 prizes, with one winner in each county. Residents ages 12 to 17 will have a chance to win one of five $100,000 Oregon College Savings Plan scholarships.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will resume work-search requirements in July for hundreds of thousands of residents receiving unemployment compensation, a top Wolf administration official said Monday. Gov. Tom Wolf’s acting labor and industry secretary, Jennifer Berrier, told a state House of Representatives committee hearing the requirement will resume July 18, meaning people claiming jobless benefits will have to search for work during the previous week. She also said a work registration requirement will resume in September. The rules have been waived by Wolf under his emergency disaster authority invoked during COVID-19 pandemic. Republicans in Pennsylvania’s GOP-controlled Legislature have pushed Wolf to reinstate the requirements, and Rep. Torrin Ecker, R-Cumberland, urged Berrier to resume the work-search requirement earlier than July. Employers in Pennsylvania and across the country say they are struggling to find enough workers and put the blame on jobless benefits that are padded with a $300-a-week federal pandemic benefit. Wolf’s office said it has not found the extra cash benefit or the suspension of the work-search requirement to be primary factors in a “perceived labor shortage.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Lippitt House Museum, one of the best-preserved Victorian interiors in America, plans to reopen for tours early next month, officials said Monday. The semi-private, staff-guided tours that resume June 4 will follow COVID-19 safety best practices. Advance reservations are required. The tours take visitors through the elaborately decorated rooms in the context of the home’s residents and workers and the roles they played in industry, immigration, design and civic engagement. “The elaborate decor, spacious rooms, and the large windows of Lippitt House make it an attractive destination for people looking for a safe way for the entire family to explore one of New England’s cultural treasures,” museum Director Carrie Taylor said in a statement. The house that dates to 1865 is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: “I am from a place I can’t go back to; This year on the Island has felt like a new life, that I am still waiting to begin.” That’s the opening line of 10-year-old Vince Mathison’s poem “Where I’m From,” written for an assignment in his virtual fourth grade class at Hilton Head Island Elementary School, The Island Packet reports. He was told to write based on a poem with the same title by George Ella Lyon, including descriptions of his family, his food and his feelings on the pandemic. His classmates did the same: “I am from the computers which I face every day, and the teachers so close, yet so far away,” one wrote. “No friends around, no more playdates, no more BBQs,” wrote another. But Vince might have had the most unique answer to “where I’m from”: His hometown is Shenzhen, China. He wrote that what was meant to be a two-week visit on Hilton Head in February 2020 has turned into a 15-month stay. Vince got “about two weeks” of in-person school before Gov. Henry McMaster moved schools to virtual classes through the end of the year. Since 2015, the Mathison family has come to Hilton Head Island to celebrate Chinese New Year and, belatedly, Christmas with mom Linzi’s grandparents. Most commercial air carriers reduced or suspended routes to and from China in February 2020.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge will decide next month whether three members of the U.S. Marshals Service should be found in civil contempt over his requirement to have everyone in his courtroom vaccinated against COVID-19. Judge Charles Kornmann notified courthouse employees in March that the inoculations would be required in order to provide the safest environment for everyone. The U.S. marshal for South Dakota, Daniel Mosteller, responded to the judge by telling him that the U.S. Marshals Service is not requiring employees to get the vaccine and that they will not provide their vaccination status to the court. Kornmann held his first courtroom session for the year May 10. The U.S. marshal who brought the first defendant into the courtroom refused to disclose her vaccination status, Aberdeen American News reports. As a result, Kornmann told the marshal to leave and pulled in a different deputy marshal to sit in the courtroom. The chief deputy marshal, Stephen Houghtaling, told Kornmann by phone that the remaining defendants scheduled for hearings had been removed from the courthouse because the marshals service didn’t think it could keep the courtroom secure without two marshals in the room. Kornmann noted that the Marshals Service hasn’t followed that practice in the past.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A slew of tenants left their downtown homes at the height of the pandemic, some following a national trend of trading urban core living for the space and relative affordability of the suburbs. Downtown’s occupancy rate plummeted from 95% in the first quarter of 2020 to about 78% as the year came to a close, according to data from the Greater Nashville Apartment Association. But in the first few months of 2021, downtown Nashville went from the city’s worst-performing neighborhood to its most in-demand for apartment living. Apartments in downtown, the Gulch and SoBro saw a staggering 5.2% increase in the number of occupied units, according to Apartmentdata.com. “Everybody’s coming back to the downtown area. Since Jan. 1, the price of an apartment downtown has gone up, on average, $124,” said Cindi Reed, the site’s vice president of sales and development. And the greater Nashville area apartment market’s rapid recovery isn’t limited to downtown. From January to April, tenants moved into 2,413 of the metro area’s available units – what real estate professionals call absorption. Apartments took a hit in 2020, absorbing just 3,600 units during the entire year. In 2019, the area absorbed 5,681 units.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: About 60% of the COVID-19 vaccine doses that have spoiled since the state’s vaccination program began in December were wasted in roughly the past two weeks, according to an analysis of state data released last week. A Houston Chronicle analysis of the roughly 60,000 doses spoiled since December found about 36,000 were lost in the prior two weeks, indicating plummeting demand for the vaccine in Texas. The number of wasted doses through spoilage of the highly perishable vaccine was still a minute fraction of the state’s vaccine allotment. The state has been administering an average of about 144,000 vaccinations daily. Even so, that was less than half of the 290,000-dose-a-day peak last month. Just 1 in 3 Texans was fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Thursday, mostly with the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, while 42% have received at least one dose. More than 51,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Texas during the 15-month pandemic out of the more than 3.2 million positive coronavirus test results reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 1,910. That’s down 13.8% from the previous week’s tally of 2,215 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Utah ranked 20th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Cases fell in four counties, with the best declines in Salt Lake, Utah and Davis counties. Utah ranked 34th among states in share of people receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 44.1% of its residents at least partially vaccinated. The national rate is 49.2%, a USA TODAY analysis of CDC data shows. In the week ending Sunday, Utah reported administering another 130,930 vaccine doses, including 61,780 first doses. In the previous week, the state administered 119,890 vaccine doses, including 40,475 first doses. In all, Utah reported it has administered 2,514,415 doses. Meanwhile, 32 people across the state were reported dead of COVID-19 in the week ending Sunday. The week before that saw 34 deaths recorded. A total of 2,290 Utahns have died from the disease, Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Amtrak service in the state will start running again July 19 after being suspended for more than a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tickets are currently available for the Vermonter and the Ethan Allen Express state-supported train service, officials said, according to WCAX-TV. “The trains will be running on the same schedules that were in place when the state suspended service on March 26, 2020,” Transportation Secretary Joe Flynn said in a statement last week. “We appreciate the patience of all of our customers, including the many Vermonters who relied on these trains for transportation when the pandemic struck.” The train service was suspended last March after the the governor issued a state of emergency. The Vermonter runs between Washington D.C. and St. Albans, and the Ethan Allen Express runs between New York City and Rutland.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Hampton University will give financial assistance to graduates in the classes of 2020 and 2021. WAVY-TV reports university President William R. Harvey announced the assistance in a letter to graduates Friday. Graduates with federal student loans will be given $500 toward repayment of their loans. The payment will go directly to the U.S. Department of Education loan servicer that oversees the loans. Students who do not have federal student loans will be reimbursed their graduation fee of $150. The pandemic has taken a toll on all aspects of campus life, and a virtual commencement that wasn’t up to the university’s standard of excellence only added to concerns, Harvey said. He understands what graduates missed by not having an in-person ceremony, he said. Graduates will be honored at an in-person ceremony on campus in December. Students will be provided details by the end of June.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: In another hopeful sign that the state’s travel industry is bouncing back after pandemic-induced lows last year, Amtrak says it’s restoring daily service on 12 long-distance routes across the country, including two that run through Seattle. Starting Monday, both the Empire Builder – Chicago to Seattle/Portland – and Coast Starlight – Seattle to Los Angeles – routes resumed daily service, giving passengers on the West Coast more travel options, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports. The routes had previously only been operating three times a week because of low ridership during the pandemic. The Amtrak Cascades route was also adding a second round-trip between Seattle and Eugene starting Monday, and a third round-trip on the Seattle-to-Portland segment will also be added. Service to stations north of Seattle – Everett, Mount Vernon and Bellingham – remains suspended. Trips to British Columbia on the Cascade line have also not been restored due to the ongoing border closure. Following COVID-19 health protocols set by the state as part of its reopening plan, capacity for train cars has been set to 50%. The service restoration is expected to bring back 1,200 furloughed employees.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Women and children who participate in a nutrition program will receive a temporary benefit boost this summer for the purchase of additional fruits and vegetables, state health officials said. The Women, Infants and Children program will increase the benefit amount to $35 per month for each eligible participant from July through September. The current benefit is $9 per child, $11 for pregnant or postpartum women, and $16.50 for mothers who breastfeed, the Bureau for Public Health’s office of nutrition services said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture offered the increase through $490 million from the federal coronavirus relief package passed this year. “Investing in WIC helps address food insecurity, a critical issue faced by many West Virginia families during the COVID-19 pandemic,” state program director Heidi Staats said. “The USDA funding more than triples the fruit and vegetable benefit to allow purchase and consumption of more canned, frozen and fresh fruits and vegetables.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nLa Crosse: A priest who has been ignoring gathering restrictions at his Masses and criticized Democrats for their stance on COVID-19 vaccines says the leader of the Diocese of La Crosse has asked him to resign. The Rev. James Altman announced the request from Bishop William Callahan during his sermon Sunday at St. James the Less Catholic Church in La Crosse. The sermon was recorded and posted to YouTube. “As the bishop has stated to me: I am ineffective. So for the record, dear family, Bishop Callahan has asked me to resign as pastor as of this past Friday, two days ago, because I am divisive and ineffective,” Altman said. Audible “no” sounds from the crowd can be heard during the video, the La Crosse Tribune reports. Altman came under fire last fall for calling Democrats godless and warning they would go to hell if they don’t repent. Later, he called COVID-19 protocols “Nazi-esque controls.” “Let us be clear, God damns every single one of those godless moves, whether it be in civil government or worse, in the complicity of many in the church,” Altman said during a Palm Sunday Mass. “In fact, if hell itself has many levels, the lowest, hottest levels are the final burning place for those shepherds who were complicit in the godless restrictions.” Altman said his lawyer is challenging the bishop’s request.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Wyoming Department of Health has announced the likely final phase for statewide public health orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the immediate removal of one of the two remaining orders that affected indoor events of more than 500 people. Mask-wearing and physical distancing requirements in an order related to K-12 schools will remain through May 31, while the same requirements for colleges are immediately eliminated. “We are making these changes now because we are confident in the effectiveness of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines,” said Dr. Alexia Harrist, state health officer and state epidemiologist with WDH. “We are seeing excellent results among those who have been vaccinated. The vaccines are doing their job very well.” Department data shows more than 28% of residents are fully vaccinated, with more people choosing to get COVID-19 shots every day. “I strongly encourage anyone who is eligible but who hasn’t yet been vaccinated to do so as soon as possible,” Harrist said. She said she expects specific protocols for the safe operation of K-12 schools will be determined at the school district level past June 1.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/24/indigenous-food-boycott-anniversary-herring-disaster-news-around-states/49431999/", "title": "Indigenous food, boycott anniversary: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The city is planning a week of events to commemorate the 66th anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. In 1955, a dedicated group of people began standing firm against racist segregation in a boycott that spanned 382 days. Activities and events starting Dec. 1 will take place across the city that are designed to honor those who dedicated and risked their lives. This event is being led by Mayor Steven L. Reed, who recently stood with civil rights attorney Fred Gray to expunge the arrest record for Claudette Colvin. While the bus boycott was officially sparked by the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man, Colvin was arrested months earlier for the same thing. A unity breakfast will be held Dec. 1 at St. Paul AME Church, and the Rosa Parks Museum will offer free admission all day on the anniversary of her arrest. Free tours of the apartment where she lived from 1951 to 1957 will also be available through the Montgomery Housing Authority. Items inside the home have been preserved or recreated to showcase where many important meetings were held during the civil rights movement. For a full list of activities and events throughout the day next Wednesday and beyond, see mgmbusboycott.com.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A man charged with threatening the lives of the state’s two U.S. senators pleaded not guilty Monday, and a judge decided he will remain in custody. Jason Weiner, an attorney for Jay Allen Johnson, entered the plea on his client’s behalf during Johnson’s arraignment in U.S. District Court in Fairbanks. Johnson, from the small community of Delta Junction, was indicted last week on six criminal counts – including threatening to murder a U.S. official, being a felon in possession of firearms, threatening to destroy property by fire and threatening interstate communications. The government is also seeking to confiscate two pistols, three revolvers, a rifle and a shotgun found on Johnson’s rural Alaska property because he is a felon who is not legally allowed to possess firearms. If convicted, Johnson could face a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines, assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Tansey said. Johnson, at an earlier hearing, said he is “a senior citizen, and I am highly disabled, and I will not be carrying out any of these threats.” Johnson’s wife testified during a detention hearing in October that her husband was was in pain after recent surgeries and “gets very angry listening to politics on the news.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Volunteers gave out hundreds of free Thanksgiving turkeys Monday as the holidays approach and charities work to help people get what they need to celebrate. The event at the American Legion’s Post No. 65 in south Phoenix helped out about 1,000 families. The 18th Annual Thanksgiving Turkey Giveaway was organized by the Sons of the American Legion and the nonprofit HeroZona Foundation. Gov. Doug Ducey Ducey stopped by to help and said in a statement that he was grateful to the volunteers and community groups that came together to help needy families. “It took teamwork to persevere through all the challenges of COVID-19, and events like the Thanksgiving Turkey Giveaway show us all that Arizona will have that same sense of camaraderie for decades to come,” Ducey said. The governor’s office said about 50 volunteers joined AP Powell, HeroZona’s founding chairman, to hand out the free food. Powell said the group wanted to ensure that “underserved families in South Phoenix have the opportunity to enjoy Thanksgiving with their loved ones – no matter their circumstances.” Charities and nonprofit groups routinely ramp up their efforts around the holidays to provide food and holiday gifts to low-income Arizonans.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A longtime legislator who left the Republican Party earlier this year following the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol says he won’t run for reelection next year in the state Senate. Sen. Jim Hendren announced Monday that he would not seek another term representing northwest Arkansas. Hendren is a former president of the state Senate who has served in the chamber since 2013. Previously, he had served in the state House of Representatives from 1995 until 1999. He is the nephew of Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Hendren left the GOP in February, citing the deadly riot at the Capitol and then-President Donald Trump’s rhetoric. In his announcement Monday, Hendren did not offer specifics on his future plans but said he planned to do more work with his nonprofit, Common Ground Arkansas. “Of course, that drive to serve isn’t gone,” he said in a statement. “I believe Common Ground has real solutions for Arkansas, and I’m dedicated to helping us build a more unified future together.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles have again postponed imposing fees on containers left on docks too long, citing progress in moving the cargo from marine terminals. The decision was made after a meeting Monday among the U.S. port envoy, John D. Porcari; industry stakeholders; and officials of the adjacent ports, the Port of Long Beach said in a press release. The “container dwell fee” will now not be considered before Nov. 29. “Since the fee was announced on Oct. 25, the two ports have seen a decline of 33% combined in aging cargo on the docks,” the statement said. “The executive directors of both ports are satisfied with the progress thus far and will reassess fee implementation after another week of monitoring data.” The fee was imposed by the harbor commissions of both ports as a measure to help ease congestion that has left dozens of ships waiting offshore.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The president of a suburban police union has been placed on paid administrative leave by the police department after he sent an email to the group’s 240 members calling diversity provisions in an agreement between the city and the state “sexist and racist.” Officer Doug Wilkinson sent the email Nov. 16 and was placed on leave the following day after multiple officers complained to human resources, Lt. Chris Amsler, an aide to Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, told KCNC-TV. “To match the ‘diversity’ of ‘the community’ we could make sure to hire 10% illegal aliens, 50% weed smokers, 10% crackheads, and a few child molesters and murderers to round it out. You know, so we can make the department look like the ‘community,’ ” Wilkinson wrote in the email. The email was prompted by an agreement announced the same day that set up reforms for the Aurora police and fire departments. The consent decree followed a lengthy state investigation that found a pattern of racist policing and excessive use of force. It calls for updated hiring practices so the police and fire departments better reflect the city’s racial makeup. Wilkinson told KCNC-TV his missive was intended to be “a private email message to the members” and should not have been made public.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is ramping up efforts to get older residents COVID-19 booster shots by bringing special clinics to nursing homes, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday. The move comes as the state has seen its highest infection rates since early September. While many homes had boosters administered shortly after extra vaccine doses received the federal go-ahead, these latest clinics will help those facilities that haven’t finished getting residents and eligible staff another dose. “What we’re talking about now is some of the stragglers. As we’ve seen in the past, unfortunately some homes take a little longer to get organized. And so Dr. Juthani and her team are pushing those homes hard to get those clinics done and making sure that everyone in those homes who is eligible (gets a booster shot),” said Josh Geballe, Lamont’s chief operating officer, referring to Department of Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new coronavirus cases in Connecticut has risen by 397, an increase of about 117%, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins. Juthani said the state is on target to have had a booster clinic for residents and staff at 70% of long-term care facilities, including assisted living locations, by Thanksgiving. She said the rest will be finished by Dec. 15.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: At a rally Monday, the Rev. Al Sharpton called on lawmakers to open police up to public scrutiny via the controversial Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights and lambasted the state for its handling of officer-involved shootings. “It seemed to me ironic, if not insulting, as I was coming in that you have the nerve to name a street after Martin Luther King while the people of Dr. King are being abused by police, and you will not hold them accountable,” Sharpton said outside Legislative Hall. He spoke alongside police reform activists Lakeisha Nix, sister of Lymond Moses, shot and killed by New Castle County police earlier this year; Keandra McDole, sister of Jeremy McDole, a Black man in a wheelchair who was shot and killed by Wilmington police in 2015; and Blaine Hackett, a pastor at St. John African Methodist Church Inc. Sharpton and the local activists criticized Delaware for upholding the decades-old Bill of Rights law that lets police decide how to discipline bad-acting officers and limits how much the public can know about any punishment. The rally, hosted by quasi-grassroots advocacy company Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware, was held in favor of legislation to amend the Officers’ Bill of Rights by opening up internal affairs records to the public and striking out certain provisions about how officers may be investigated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The regional train system serving the capital region will remain on drastically reduced service levels through at least the end of this year, as authorities grapple with a safety problem that has forced the majority of the trains out of service. Paul J. Wiedefeld, general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, announced Monday that there were no set timelines for the return of the 7000-series train cars to service. The trains are the newest in service, and the 748 cars compose about 60% of the fleet. The Metro authority’s safety commission abruptly ordered the withdrawal of the entire 7000-series line of trains in mid-October after a derailing revealed chronic problems with the wheels and axles. “We are intentionally not setting deadlines so that safety and good data drive our decisions, but we are mindful that customers want the best service we can provide as soon as we can deliver it, and we are committed to building back up in phases,” Wiedefeld said in a statement Monday. The original plans to bring older 6000-series trains out of retirement to help fill in the service gaps have been delayed by the global supply chain crisis, which has prevented the arrival of necessary parts.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The families of most of those killed and wounded in a 2018 high school massacre have reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the federal government over the FBI’s failure to stop the gunman even though it had received information he intended to attack. Attorneys for 16 of the 17 killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and some of those wounded said Monday that they have reached a monetary settlement with the government over the FBI’s failure to investigate a tip it received about a month before the massacre. The 17th family chose not to sue. The attorneys said the settlement’s details are confidential, but a person familiar with the deal, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the government will pay the families $127.5 million overall. “It has been an honor to represent the Parkland families who, through their immeasurable grief, have devoted themselves to making the world a safer place,” their lead attorney, Kristina Infante, said in a statement. Andrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter, Meadow, died in the shooting, commended the FBI for accepting responsibility for its inaction, comparing it to the Broward County school district and sheriff’s office, the school security staff and the psychologists who treated the shooter. He believes they all failed to stop the shooter and have ducked responsibility. “The FBI has made changes to make sure this never happens again,” Pollack said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s public university system won’t rename any of the 75 buildings or colleges an internal committee had recommended for changes mostly because of their association with slavery, segregation or mistreatment of American Indians, officials voted Monday. The system’s regents voted not to make any name changes, more than a year after they established a committee to study that issue. “History can teach us important lessons, lessons that if understood and applied make Georgia and its people stronger,” the regents said in a statement unanimously adopted by the board at a specially called meeting. The regents added that while the board would not pursue name changes involving the buildings and colleges as recommended by the advisory group’s report, it acknowledged there were many viewpoints on the matter. “Going forward, the board is committed to naming actions that reflect the strength and energy of Georgia’s diversity,” the statement said. Georgia passed a law in 2019 prohibiting state and local agencies from renaming any buildings named after a “historical entity” or removing any historical monument. Several regents released statements after the vote, but none directly explained why they supported making no changes. Many were appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who supported the 2019 law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A male Hawaiian monk seal has died at a Big Island marine mammal hospital after a five-week battle with toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease spread by cat feces, officials said Monday. Toxoplasmosis is the biggest disease threat facing the Hawaiian monk seal, a critically endangered species numbering just 1,300 animals. The seal that died last week was known as RW22, the Marine Mammal Center said in a news release. The center called on cat owners to keep their feline pets indoors and dispose of litter in the trash to protect the species. Feral cat feces is also a concern. Stray cats have no predators in Hawaii, and their numbers have ballooned. Marketing research commissioned by the Hawaiian Humane Society in 2015 estimated Oahu alone had 300,000 feral cats. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received a report early last month that RW22 had a fishing line in his mouth off Oahu. An X-ray revealed the seal had swallowed some fishing gear. He also showed signs of partial facial nerve paralysis and a corneal ulcer to his left eye, a suspected symptom of toxoplasmosis. The Coast Guard flew RW22 to the seal hospital in Kailua-Kona, where veterinarians treated the seal in hopes of slowing the rate of infection. He regained some stamina and movement but continued to deteriorate.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s top health official has deactivated crisis guidelines for rationing care at most of the state’s hospitals. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen issued the decision Monday after health officials said the number of COVID-19 patients remains high but no longer exceeds health care resources in most areas. Crisis standards remain in effect for northern Idaho. During a news conference, Jeppesen and other health care officials warned of possible future outbreaks. “We are not sharing a ‘mission accomplished’ message,” said James Souza, chief medical officer for St. Luke’s Health System. “We don’t believe this will be our last surge of COVID. We hope it’s the worst one.” Crisis standards of care give legal and ethical guidelines to health care providers when they have too many patients and not enough resources to care for them all. They spell out exactly how health care should be rationed to save the most lives possible during a disaster. Idaho activated the crisis standards for northern Idaho on Sept. 7 and statewide Sept. 16. Officials didn’t have a timeline for when crisis standards might be lifted in the northern Idaho district, which covers five counties and includes Kootenai Health in Coeur d’Alene. Health officials said it will take time to catch up on routine surgeries that have been put off.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Former President Barack Obama’s foundation said Monday that it has received a $100 million donation from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the largest individual contribution it has received to date. The Obama foundation said in a statement that the gift from Bezos is intended “to help expand the scope of programming that reaches emerging leaders” in the United States and around the world. The donation, it said, was also given in honor of John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights icon who died last year. As part of the gift, the foundation said Bezos has asked for the plaza at the Obama Presidential Center, under construction in Chicago’s South Side, to be named after Lewis. Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to Obama who serves as the foundation’s CEO, said in a statement that the foundation was “thrilled” by that idea. Construction on Obama’s legacy project is expected to cost about $830 million and be completed by 2025. In the meantime, the foundation said it’s giving donors the opportunity to “honor and elevate the names of those who have fought for a more just and equitable world” by naming public spaces in the center. “Freedom fighters deserve a special place in the pantheon of heroes, and I can’t think of a more fitting person to honor with this gift than John Lewis, a great American leader and a man of extraordinary decency and courage,” Bezos said in the statement released by the foundation.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Biking advocates reeling from the deaths of seven people this year in collisions between vehicles and cyclists are calling for the city to do more to try to prevent such crashes. About two dozen cyclists held a moment of silence for seven minutes – one for each crash victim – at a downtown plaza Sunday evening to mark World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. The candlelight vigil was organized by Bike Indianapolis, a nonprofit group that says seven cyclists, by its count, have received a fatal blow from a vehicle in the capital city since mid-July. “This was too many deaths,” said Sylva Zhang, Bike Indianapolis’ marketing director. In each of the previous six years, the city recorded between one and five fatal crashes with cyclists, according to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization’s crash dashboard. Biking advocates want the city to establish a crash response team of city-county employees and independent citizens to examine crash sites involving cyclists and pedestrians and recommend preventive infrastructure and policy improvements. They also want the city to respond to those recommendations with plans and to create a database of crash data and reports immediately after they are submitted.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A law that prohibits Medicaid coverage for sex reassignment surgeries for transgender Iowans violates state law and the state constitution, a judge ruled in a decision made public Monday. Judge William Kelly ordered the Iowa Department of Human Services to provide coverage for sex reassignment surgeries when ordered to treat gender dysphoria, a psychological distress that results from an incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity. It often begins in childhood, and some people may not experience it until after puberty or much later, according to the American Psychiatric Association. About 12 states exclude the surgeries in Medicaid coverage; 18 specifically include gender-affirming care; and others do not address it. The ruling is a victory for Aiden Vasquez and Mika Covington, two residents represented by the ACLU of Iowa. Kelly said state and federal courts in the past 16 years have found that gender identity discrimination is a form of sex discrimination, which is prohibited under civil rights laws. He also found the law violated the equal protection clause of the state constitution. It is not challenged in the record that surgical treatment for gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition, and the surgery is recommended for Vasquez and Covington by medical professionals as necessary and effective, the judge said.\n\nKansas\n\nMinneapolis: Dale “Duster” Hoffman didn’t want a sorrowful funeral, so instead he got a parade. KWCH-TV reports residents of the small town of Minneapolis, Kansas, turned out Sunday for a parade honoring Hoffman, who died this month at age 71. Hoffman had said he wanted his friends and family to remember him with a fun and joyful gathering. More than 100 cars took part in driving down Main Street as part of the parade. One relative said it was believed to be one of the largest parades ever in Minneapolis, a town of about 2,000 residents about 180 miles west of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A judge has ruled against a police union in a lawsuit that sought to stop a ban on no-knock warrants in the city. A Fayette County judge agreed Friday to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the local police union, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. The Fraternal Order of Police Bluegrass Lodge No. 4 filed suit in July against the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government over the no-knock warrant ban it enacted following months of debate after Breonna Taylor was killed by police in Louisville during a raid at her apartment. The union said in the lawsuit that banning the warrants is unsafe and that the organization has the right to bargain on behalf of Lexington officers over changes that affect officers’ “health and safety.” Circuit Judge Kimberly Bunnell said elected officials had the right to enact public policies without bargaining. The FOP may appeal the decision, local representative said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Nearly 15 months after Hurricane Laura struck, the state is kicking off $11.3 million in housing repair and rebuilding programs for the southwestern city of Lake Charles while it waits for hundreds of millions in promised federal aid to arrive. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter, a Republican, announced the plans at a joint press conference Monday. The effort will be financed with federal housing and disaster recovery funds available to the state and city through various programs. The dollars largely will pay for home rehabilitation work for low- to moderate-income homeowners, with grants capped at $50,000 per household. A $1 million share of the money will help landlords rebuild housing if they are willing to rent to low- to moderate-income tenants. “The housing situation in Lake Charles is absolutely dire,” Hunter said. “This is going to help.” The city of Lake Charles will administer the program. Hunter didn’t immediately provide information on how people can apply, saying the city is still working out logistics. Edwards and Hunter acknowledged the money is nowhere near the amount needed to address the gaps in insurance coverage and blight of abandoned houses destroyed by Laura in Lake Charles alone, plus the needs of the southwestern region.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The herring fishing industry in the Northeast qualifies for federal assistance because its 2019 season has been declared a disaster. The federal government has the ability to declare a “fishery disaster” when adverse circumstances in a fishery cause economic hardship. A recent scientific assessment of the herring population found the species population has fallen, and tighter fishing quotas have made herring fishing more difficult. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced the disaster declaration Monday. Members of the herring fishing industry will be eligible for disaster assistance, and some fishery-related businesses might also qualify for federal loans, the commerce department said. The commerce department said the allocation of money will be determined soon. Herring are economically important because they’re widely used as lobster bait, as well as for food. The species is also critical to the health of the ocean because of its role in the food chain. Herring fishermen caught more than 200 million pounds of herring as recently as 2014, but the 2019 catch was less than 25 million. The fishery is based mostly in Maine and Massachusetts.\n\nMaryland\n\nSharpsburg: The vice mayor is facing federal firearms charges, authorities said. An indictment unsealed last week charges Jacob Martz, 41, with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and possession of a machine gun in connection with 16 firearms and multiple machine-gun conversion devices found at his home, according to a U.S. Attorney’s Office news release. The indictment alleges Martz knew he was prohibited from possessing firearms due to previous felony firearms convictions, but he had 16 guns and about 5,200 rounds of ammunition on Oct. 6. It also alleges he possessed devices used to convert AR-15-style rifles into machine guns, officials said. Martz, vice mayor of Sharpsburg, a small western Maryland town, turned himself in Thursday and pleaded not guilty at an arraignment in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, defense attorney David W. Fischer said. “We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations,” Fischer said. U.S. Attorney’s Office spokeswoman Marcia Murphy said information about the investigation and what led to the charges wouldn’t be made public. Martz was released to his residence, she said. Martz faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each charge, although sentences are typically less than the maximum, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Mayor Michelle Wu signed an ordinance Monday designed to divest the city from fossil fuels. The ordinance will prohibit the use of public funds from being invested in the stocks, securities or other obligations of any company that derives more than 15% of its revenue from fossil fuels. The ordinance also extends to companies deriving more than 15% of revenue from tobacco products or private prison industries. Wu, a former city councilor sworn in as mayor last week, said the move is the culmination of a years­long push to distance Boston from the fossil fuels that are helping drive the climate change that is threatening the coastal city. “This is deeply personal for many of us and urgent,” Wu said during a signing ceremony at Boston City Hall. “My older son, Blaise, was born in the first year that I served in this building and the first year that we started to hear it was the hottest year ever on record. Since then, his six years alive on this planet have each been our hottest on record. ... We’re moving quickly to make sure that Boston will set the tone for what is possible for that brightest greenest future for all of our kids.” The ordinance will pull $65 million immediately out of the fossil fuel industry, said Boston City Councilor Lydia Edwards, a supporter of the ordinance, unanimously approved by the City Council last week.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: At least one person died, and a 3-year-old child remained missing Tuesday, after an overnight explosion and fire destroyed three homes, damaged several others and sent debris falling onto a neighborhood, authorities said. Flint Fire Chief Raymond Barton said Tuesday that two people were rushed from the scene Monday night to area hospitals, where one of them – a 70-year-old man – was pronounced dead. The father of the missing child was in critical condition, Barton said. Another person reported minor injuries following the explosion, which destroyed three homes in the neighborhood on Flint’s west side, WJRT-TV reports. Barton said a Michigan State Police cadaver dog and fire crews with specialized equipment were searching for the 3-year-old. “This is a tragic time for our community,” Mayor Sheldon Neeley said during a Tuesday morning news conference. Three houses were fully engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived at the scene after 9:30 p.m. Monday. Officials said about 20 houses sustained damage, including broken windows from debris thrown across an entire block by the explosion, which was felt miles away. The cause of the explosion, which left the neighborhood littered with splintered wood and other debris, was under investigation, Neeley said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: The USDA Office of Tribal Relations announced this week that it will partner with several Native American-led organizations on projects to raise awareness of Indigenous perspectives about food and agriculture. “The United States government hasn’t always incorporated Indigenous views and values into our work. And that’s particularly true within the food and agricultural space,” said Heather Dawn Thompson, director of the Office of Tribal Relations and a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe. “We’re taking this moment to rethink how the United States Department of Agriculture interacts with and thinks about Indigenous foods and Indigenous farming and ranching techniques.” Two regional seed processing centers will be created through the Minnesota-based Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. USDA will help fund equipment for the facilities, one in Minnesota and one in the southwestern U.S. “Some of this equipment is quite pricey and difficult for the average producer or seed saver to acquire on their own,” Thompson said. “So these will become regional hubs that will be available to Native producers to share and use in a cooperative fashion, in order to process their seeds and save them.” Minneapolis-based North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems will develop recipes using traditional Indigenous foods and foods provided to tribal communities through the federal Emergency Food Assistance Program, said co-founder and executive director Dana Thompson.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A post office now bears the name of an Air Force colonel who was held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam for nearly a decade. During his captivity, Carlyle “Smitty” Harris wrote a letter to his wife, Louise, that ended up at the same post office, the Daily Journal reports. It was renamed for him at a ceremony Friday. “This post office has been in our lives for about 57 years,” Harris said. He still had the letter he sent his wife and pulled it from his coat pocket as he spoke. The letter was delivered to the post office in 1965. Harris was shot down over North Vietnam on April 4 of that year and spent the next eight years as a prisoner of war. A bill to rename the post office was introduced in Congress by U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly and signed into law by President Joe Biden in August.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A former police officer convicted of beating a Black undercover detective during a 2017 racial injustice protest has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison – far more lenient than prosecutors and the victim had sought. Dustin Boone was sentenced Monday in U.S. District Court after being convicted in June of a federal civil rights violation related to the attack on Luther Hall. Boone, 37, was one of five white officers charged in the beating. Boone’s sentence was less even than his own lawyers requested. While prosecutors sought a 10-year sentence, defense lawyers asked U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber to sentence Boone to 26 months. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the sentence appeared to stun Hall, his relatives and his supporters, who walked out of the courtroom before Webber finished pronouncing the sentence. They declined comment after the hearing, as did prosecutors. Hall, in a statement to Webber before the sentence was announced, said he thought Webber’s sentencing of two other officers charged in the case was too lenient, “leniency that’s not shown to African American defendants.” Boone’s attorneys had argued that he did not participate in the initial Sept. 17, 2017, beating and held Hall down only because other officers were “acting as though” they were making an arrest.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: An investigation into a complaint that public officials tried to intimidate hospital employees into treating a COVID-19 patient with unapproved medications uncovered a voicemail left by a former state senator in which she said she didn’t think “senators would be too happy to hear about” the hospital’s care of the patient. Jennifer Fielder, now a member of the Public Service Commission, told the Legislature’s special counsel she left the voicemail with St. Peter’s Health on Oct. 11 as a personal matter on behalf of the patient, whom she described as a friend. Senate Minority Leader Jill Cohenour argued Tuesday that if Fielder were leaving a personal message, she wouldn’t have identified herself as a senator in the call. Attorney General Austin Knudsen has acknowledged he intervened in the case and later said Chief Deputy Attorney General Kristen Hansen brought the issue to him, but he denied intimidating anyone. In Fielder’s voicemail, she identified herself as a state senator, and later a former state senator, and said the patient was a Senate staffer. The patient previously served as a temporary state Senate staffer and was not working for the Legislature at the time of her hospitalization, according to the special counsel Abra Belke’s report, released Monday night. The patient, who was admitted to the hospital Oct. 9, died Oct. 26. She was 82.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts railed Monday against the chancellor of the University of Nebraska’s flagship campus, saying he was misled about a plan designed to address racial disparities on campus, even as the university system’s president tried to deescalate the situation. Ricketts said he has “lost all faith” in University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Ronnie Green, who has endorsed the plan as a way to make the campus more diverse and inclusive. Ricketts said Green told him the plan was an effort to increase the number of minority faculty, staff and students on campus, which Ricketts said was “a good thing.” But he said Green didn’t tell him about other parts of the initiative, including a “call to action” statement that says structural racism in society is the cause of disparities between races and isn’t limited to individual beliefs or actions. The statement says the plan is intended to transform the university into a place where every person matters and gets “equitable outcomes.” The Republican governor has blasted the idea as “ideological indoctrination” that will encourage people to see each other through the lens of race instead of as individuals with unique strengths. Just hours before Ricketts spoke, University of Nebraska President Ted Carter released an open letter in support of the plan. “These are uncomfortable conversations, with passionate opinions on many sides,” he said. “Not every Nebraskan, not every member of the university community, will agree with every element of the plan.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Two Las Vegas-area elected officials are using the same word, “scary,” to describe weekend demonstrations outside their homes involving people expressing opposition to government COVID-19 vaccine and mask mandates. “The scary thing – it was dark, and I couldn’t really see what was going on out there,” Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Segerblom, a Democrat, said Monday that about 20 protesters stayed about two hours outside his home Sunday, holding flags, honking and speaking into bullhorns. He said one repeated chant was: “No mask, no vax.” Outside Clark County School District Board President Linda Cavazos’ home in Henderson, as many as 40 demonstrators showed up about 4:30 p.m. and stayed for about two hours, Clark County School District Police Lt. Bryan Zink said. In photos provided by Cavazos, people can be seen carrying American flags, a yellow “Don’t tread on me” flag and a banner reading, “Let’s go, Brandon” – a term that has become code for a vulgar insult against President Joe Biden. Another man is draped in what appears to be a Confederate flag. Cavazos described the demonstration as “just scary.” “It’s more like bullying,” Cavazos said. “It’s more like intimidation. It’s just not OK.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is getting more than $8.3 million to support marketing, workforce and other projects to boost business and travel. The funding was allocated through the American Rescue Plan. The state’s congressional delegation announced the funds last week. “Travel and tourism are core industries that fuel local economies across New Hampshire – these sectors are key to our state’s recovery following the pandemic,” U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement. The grant comes from the Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration, which makes investments in economically distressed communities in order to create jobs, promote innovation and accelerate long-term sustainable economic growth.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The state has moved closer to withdrawing from a bi-state commission formed to monitor corruption at the New York region’s ports. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a lawsuit filed by the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor that had sought to block New Jersey’s move. If the state of New York doesn’t step in to file a legal challenge, the commission would effectively be dissolved. The commission was formed in the 1950s to combat entrenched organized crime influences at the ports. But in recent years, New Jersey has contended that organized crime has largely been driven out of the ports and that the commission was impeding job growth by over-regulating businesses there and making hiring more difficult. Under New Jersey’s plan, state police would take over investigating criminal activity at the ports. The New York-New Jersey port system, among the busiest in the country, includes container terminals in Newark, Elizabeth and Bayonne in New Jersey, as well as Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York. The New Jersey terminals handle the bulk of the port’s business. “The Governor is pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to reject the Waterfront Commission’s appeal,” Michael Zhadanovsky, a spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy, said in an email Tuesday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Major repairs to a northern New Mexico dam will mean irrigation water will have to be stored elsewhere. Repairs on El Vado Dam are slated to start next spring, leaving it unusable for at least a year to deliver water to the Middle Rio Grande Valley, said Page Pegram of the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission. Abiquiu Lake most likely will be the backup, Pegram told the Albuquerque Journal. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation plans to address cracks in El Vado’s steel faceplate and the foundation, as well as the deteriorating spillway. The dam was built in the 1930s, and its current condition isn’t safe for the public, the agency said. El Vado Dam can hold back about 60 billion gallons of water, but the capacity will be reduced significantly while the repairs are being done. Persistent drought also has meant less water in New Mexico reservoirs, and the region could be in store for a dry winter with a La Niña weather pattern. “Water supply conditions for the Middle Rio Grande in 2022 are expected to be significantly diminished,” Pegram said. “We expect stream flows in the basin to remain below average.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is facing calls from faculty to boost its public university system by launching a university endowment – a step dozens of other states have taken. Lawmakers on the state Senate higher education committee held a hearing Monday as part of the ongoing budget process. New York’s economy is still rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the state is facing demands for increased spending at a time when tax collections are strong. The state’s general fund as of September was $4.5 billion higher than the previous September. It’s time for New York to allocate $150 million in additional aid to state-operated campuses, said Frederick Kowal, president of the United University Professions union, which represents more than 37,000 academic and professional faculty. Kowal told lawmakers that New York flat-funded higher education and increased the state’s reliance on students’ tuition and fees under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. “The abandonment of our public higher education system has directly led to drops in enrollment,” Kowal said. And he said an endowment would provide a long-term funding resource to rebuild “depleted” academic departments and hire and promote a more diverse workforce.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper approved a measure Tuesday for a new governing structure for high school sports. The new law allows the State Board of Education to create a formal agreement with the North Carolina High School Athletic Association, the nonprofit body currently governing high school athletics. Under the compromise legislation, the State Board of Education can now reach a memorandum of understanding with the group to administer and enforce the education board’s requirements for high school sports. The deal needs to be reached by March 15 and last an initial four years. “For months, we worked tirelessly to determine the best governing structure that supports our student-athletes and is transparent and accountable,” said a statement from state Sen. Vickie Sawyer, an Iredell County Republican who helped craft the bipartisan bill. “After productive conversations with the NCHSAA, State Board of Education, Governor’s Office, and our Democratic colleagues, we’ve established a clear path forward. I want to thank Gov. Cooper for signing this bill into law.” While state education officials must adopt student participation rules, they can delegate rules on items like school penalties and participation fees to the association, which currently represents more than 400 schools.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Game and Fish Department on Monday unveiled a plan to bring landowners, conservation groups, scientists and others together to restore native grasslands. The agency said North Dakota has lost more than 70% of its native prairie, which is essential for wildlife, pollinators, ranching operations and communities. About 60% of the nearly 5 million wetland acres in the state have been converted or lost. “When we talk about native prairie in the state, we need to acknowledge who the owners and managers of our native prairie are,” said Greg Link, the department’s conservation and communications division chief. “In most cases, we’re talking about ranchers and producers who run livestock on that prairie.” The so-called Meadowlark Initiative is named after the official state bird, known for its unique song. The western meadowlark populations in North Dakota are continuing to decline, wildlife officials said. The program allows producers to plant marginal cropland back to diverse native perennial grasslands for grazing. Funding is available to establish the grass and install grazing infrastructure, such as fencing and water. Producers also are eligible to receive rental payments for the first three years as the land transitions from cropland to grazing land.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: CVS, Walgreens and Walmart pharmacies recklessly distributed massive amounts of pain pills in two Ohio counties, a federal jury said Tuesday in a verdict that could set the tone for city and county governments across the country that want to hold pharmacies accountable for their roles in the opioid crisis. Lake and Trumbull counties blamed the three chain pharmacies for not stopping the flood of pills that caused hundreds of overdose deaths and cost each of the two counties about $1 billion, their attorney said. How much the pharmacies must pay in damages will be decided in the spring by a federal judge. It was the first time pharmacy companies had completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half-million Americans over the past two decades. The counties were able to convince the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication into their communities. “The law requires pharmacies to be diligent in dealing drugs. This case should be a wake-up call that failure will not be accepted,” said Mark Lanier, an attorney for the counties. Spokespeople for CVSHealth and Walgreen Co. said the companies disagree with the verdict and will appeal. Two other chains, Rite Aid and Giant Eagle, already had settled lawsuits with the counties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Monday signed into law newly drawn maps for the state’s five congressional and 149 state House and Senate districts. The bills, approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature during a special session last week, contain the new district boundaries that will be in place for the next 10 years. The new maps had to reapportion the state’s population, which has continued shifting from rural communities to urban and suburban areas. Democrats strongly opposed the newly drawn 5th Congressional District, which has been competitive in recent years, with Democrats winning the seat as recently as 2018 before Republicans won it back last year. The new map moves Democratic portions of Oklahoma City’s core and south side into the heavily Republican 3rd Congressional District that stretches across western and northwestern Oklahoma. Andy Moore, executive director of the group People Not Politicians, which tried unsuccessfully to shift the responsibility of drawing the new maps from the Legislature to a bipartisan commission, said the new maps were a clear example of gerrymandering. “We are disappointed that the Legislature adopted a congressional map that was drawn in secret, divides communities and prioritizes politics over what’s best for Oklahoma voters,” he said in a statement.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: As COVID-19 cases in the state continue to decrease, health officials announced Tuesday that they are immediately lifting statewide mask requirements in crowded outdoor settings. Oregon was the first state in the U.S. to reimplement an outdoor mask mandate for both vaccinated and unvaccinated residents in August as the delta variant of the coronavirus spread. At the time, Oregon was in the midst of its worst surge during the pandemic. Record daily COVID-19 cases were set day after day, and hospitalizations overwhelmed the health system. A majority of people hospitalized were unvaccinated. However, over the past six weeks, health officials say Oregon’s daily COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have steadily declined. Last week, cases decreased by 12% from the previous week. “We took decisive measures. And, as has been the case over the course of this pandemic, Oregonians resoundingly responded,” Patrick Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority, said Tuesday. “Together we have managed to turn back the tsunami of new infections that very nearly swamped our health care system.” Oregon has had some of the strictest statewide coronavirus-related restrictions and safety measures during the pandemic.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Eight civilian Philadelphia Police Department employees were indicted on charges of collecting Pandemic Unemployment Assistance to which they were not entitled because they remained employed. Seven of the employees are dispatchers, and one is a clerk. A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging them with theft of government funds, wire fraud and mail fraud. The accused took advantage of a system that was designed to aid people left unemployed because of the pandemic, prosecutors said. Each allegedly submitted weekly certifications stating that they were not employed and were ready, willing and able to work each day, prosecutors said. According to the indictment, those statements were false because each was employed by the police department. Prosecutors said the employees received assistance funds for multiple weeks while also collecting a salary from the city. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw on Tuesday said she will suspend them for 30 days with the intent to dismiss them at the end of the 30 days upon completion of arrest procedures.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has been awarded an $81.7 million federal grant for the state health department to build a new public health laboratory. Rhode Island’s congressional delegation announced the new federal Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity grant, saying the current facility, commissioned in 1978, has insufficient laboratory space, inadequate building systems and broken equipment, and the state spends more than $500,000 annually to keep it working efficiently. The state health laboratories work to investigate and mitigate life-threatening diseases, including COVID-19, eastern equine encephalitis, Ebola, H1N1 and Zika. Last year, when commercial testing services weren’t yet widely available, the number of coronavirus samples that could be tested was limited due to insufficient laboratory space, the delegation said. “COVID-19 revealed a serious gap in our health care infrastructure. This new federal funding will help Rhode Island bridge that gap and create a new state-of-the-art lab facility for the 21st century,” U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Reps. Jim Langevin and David Cicilline said in a joint statement. The state health laboratories also work with state and municipal agencies to ensure the safety of drinking water and food, monitor water and air pollution, and help public safety and criminal investigations through police officer training, DNA testing and drug identification.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State health and education officials want students to come up with a short song to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. The winning jingle will get the winner’s school $10,000 toward music programs and be recorded and featured in statewide radio advertisements in 2022. Individual students, classes or groups can all compete in the Sing It to Win It campaign. The deadline is Jan. 31, officials said. Five finalists will be chosen and put up for a vote on both the state Department of Education and state Department of Health and Environmental Control’s social media accounts. A $5,000 second place and $3,000 third place prize will also be awarded to a school.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Marcella Rose LeBeau, an Army nurse who was honored for her service during World War II and leadership in the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, has died. She was 102. Family members said she “passed on to journey to the next world” late Sunday in Eagle Butte after experiencing problems with her digestive system and losing her appetite. LeBeau had remained active all of her life and earlier this month traveled to Oklahoma for a ceremony honoring her induction into the National Native American Hall of Fame. Her daughter, Gerri Lebeau, said the matriarch of her family demonstrated fortitude, as well as an ability to seek healing, as she overcame the abuses she faced at an Indian boarding school during her youth. She went on to treat front-line soldiers as an Army nurse in Europe during the Allied invasion of Normandy. After returning home, she became an outspoken advocate for health in the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. “She was the foundation of our family,” said her grandson Ryman LeBeau. “She had a lifetime of good things that she had accomplished.” Lebeau was born in 1919 and grew up in Promise, South Dakota, as a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Her mother died when she was 10 years old, and her grandmother gave her the name Wigmunke’ Waste Win’, or Pretty Rainbow Woman. But LeBeau grew up at a time when the government was attempting to eradicate her culture – while her grandmother only spoke the Lakota language, she could be punished for speaking it at the boarding school.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A historically Black medical college is giving students an early Thanksgiving gift – $10,000 in cash. Meharry Medical College President James E.K. Hildreth announced the gift Monday, telling students they would receive it Wednesday. The money comes from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, part of a federal coronavirus aid package. Schools across the country have used their money to wipe out student debts, offer free tuition and give cash grants such as the one at Meharry. In a video message to the Nashville school’s 956 students, Hildreth said they can manage their money however they choose, but he strongly urged them to use it for their education and training. Rising senior Benson Joseph said he is still deciding how to use his gift, but he will definitely set a portion aside to help cover travel expenses when he interviews for residency programs next year and other expenses financial aid does not cover. “It feels like Christmas came a little bit early,” said Joseph, who plans to pursue neurosurgery. “The last two years have been quite a trial for a lot of us.” Hildreth said in the video announcement that he is thankful for those who work at Meharry and those who support the college with their resources. “But mostly, I’m thankful for you students and the future of health care that is entrusted to you,” he said.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Students at a suburban high school are planning more demonstrations after four students were arrested last week at a protest against the school’s response to allegations of sexual harassment. Hundreds of students decided to walk out of their classes at Little Elm High School on Friday morning after a sophomore publicly accused a freshman of sexually harassing and abusing her. The sophomore’s friend posted on social media that she had reported the abuse to the school’s administration. The friend alleged the administration then suspended the sophomore for three days for falsely accusing the freshman, according to the post. In a joint statement with Little Elm Mayor Curtis Cornelious, Little Elm Superintendent Daniel Gallagher said the school’s investigation of the alleged abuse did not find sufficient evidence of a crime. He denied allegations the student received disciplinary action for reporting the harassment. Another junior, Kailey Heaton, said things turned violent when police officers attempted to corral the protesting students by linking arms. Heaton said the officers began attempting to push the teens back, but students eventually broke through the line. Videos widely shared on social media show officers forcibly holding a student on the ground while arresting him. Others show two officers pepper-spraying one student and firing their Tasers at him. Cornelious said in a video statement on Facebook that officers were justified in their use of force against the students.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah is investigating complaints related to the removal of several books from high school library shelves after a parent complaint. The Canyons School District appears to have disregarded its own policy for responding to such complaints by pulling nine books off the shelves, including “The Bluest Eye” by Toni Morrison, before completing a full review, the organization said in a statement. The removals came after a parent of younger students in the district emailed about what she called sexually explicit material in several titles that she learned about from social media, KSL.com reports. She told the outlet she had asked for them to be reviewed for content, not necessarily pulled. The Canyons policy states that books should remain in use until a full review of any challenged material is complete. In this case, nine books were removed from shelves in four high schools while a review was still in process. District spokesman Jeff Haney has said the district decided to pull the books off the shelves of the school libraries while district officials review the policy itself, which also says that challenges to library materials cannot come from outside a school community. In a statement to KSL.com, he framed the district’s action as a “review for content.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott signed into law Tuesday a bill that will allow the state’s municipalities to adopt temporary indoor mask mandates. Scott’s signature came a day after the Legislature held a special session in which the new law that allows a municipality to impose its own mask was introduced and approved. Scott said he called the special session at the request of the Vermont League of Cities and Towns as a compromise after some lawmakers urged him to reimpose a statewide mask mandate. “As you’ve heard me say repeatedly, masking when inside in public spaces is a good idea right now because masks work, but at this point in the pandemic, mandates won’t,” Scott said. “And I think they’ll be divisive and counterproductive.” Within hours of the new law taking effect, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said he would propose requiring facial coverings in indoor public settings except for situations in which all employees and customers in city businesses are verified to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The ordinance will go before the Burlington City Council on Dec. 1.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A hospital has seen a surge in cases of a coronavirus-related complication in children, officials said. The Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU said 15 kids were hospitalized at the same time last month with a rare inflammatory condition in children linked with the virus, WRIC-TV reports. It was the hospital’s highest peak since the pandemic started, officials said. Previously, it had two or three children hospitalized with the condition at a time. Dr. Tiffany Kimbrough, director of the hospital’s Mother-Infant Unit, said the hospital has seen 50 cases since the pandemic began. The condition can occur two to six weeks after a child recovers from a mild or asymptomatic battle with COVID-19. Kids get symptoms like fever, trouble breathing, abdominal pain and vomiting “and can progress to full shock very quickly,” Kimbrough said. No children with the condition have died on the hospital’s watch, she said. Among the cases the facility has seen, a majority of the children affected are kids of color, she said. Despite the “concerning” numbers last month, Kimbrough said health workers are hopeful that as more children get vaccinated against COVID-19, they will see fewer infections in that age group.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has approved a 2022 budget that cuts police department spending from previous years, drawing criticism from people who say city voters earlier this month endorsed more spending on public safety. In an 8-1 vote Monday, the council approved a $355.5 million budget for the department, saying there are no cuts functionally for the Seattle Police Department. KOMO reports the budget includes funds to hire 125 officers in 2022. But the police department’s budget is smaller compared to years past. In 2021 the budget was $363 million, and in 2020 it was $401.8 million. Outgoing Mayor Jenny Durkan criticized the new spending plan. “Every time council acts, they’re telling officers that are here today if they’re valued or not,” Durkan said. “Mayor-elect Harrell ran on adding more officers, and I’m trying to set him up for success as much as I can.” Bruce Harrell easily won the race for Seattle mayor, running on a platform of increased spending on police services and criticizing opponents who advocated “defunding” the police. The new budget includes funds for 1,357 officers, and SPD reports currently having 1,120 officers on the force, which leaves 237 open jobs.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSnowshoe: A ski resort is opening some of its trails to the public on Thanksgiving. Snowshoe Mountain said it will start the ski season for the general public Thursday with a limited number of trails. The resort also will be open Wednesday to passholders and anyone who already purchased lift tickets for that day. The Pocahontas County facility will have 30 acres of available terrain to skiers and snowboarders with three lifts operating, the West Virginia Ski Areas Association said in a news release. Ski operations at Timberline resort could start as early as the weekend, while Canaan Valley and Winterplace resorts are scheduled to begin in the middle of next month, the statement said. Visitors are asked to check with individual resorts for COVID-19 safety requirements. The association again this year is offering a program that will let children in fourth and fifth grades ski or snowboard for free. Under the program, up to three junior lift tickets and one rental will be allowed at participating resorts during the 2021-22 season, the statement said. West Virginia resorts draw more than 800,000 skier visits a year, typically luring visitors from Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio and Florida. The ski and snowboard season traditionally runs through late March, weather permitting.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Cities are looking for ways to care for an increased number of people experiencing homelessness this winter. Joe Volk, executive director of the Wisconsin Coalition Against Homelessness, said communities across the state have been allocating money to increase services for unsheltered people. He said much of the funding has come from federal pandemic recovery aid, often being used to provide hotel rooms and other temporary housing.

JetBlue may argue that it charges less than the larger network carriers, but its airfares are higher than Spirit and Frontier's. And JetBlue plans to reconfigure the Spirit planes if it acquires the airline to add first class seating.\n\n\"Spirit and Frontier play a big role in the fare you pay, even if you never fly either one,\" said Scott Keyes, founder of Scott's Cheap Flights, a web site that helps passengers find cheaper fares. \"When Delta announced the basic economy fare in 2012, they described it to investors as a 'Spirit-matching fare,' because their lunch was getting eaten by the budget carriers of the world. I'm not a fan of either merger, but I like the JetBlue option even less.\"\n\nFor that reason, it's possible that the JetBlue deal for Spirit will face strong antitrust scrutiny from the US Department of Justice, particularly if the Justice Department views the acquisition as harmful to consumers.\n\nThe proposed JetBlue Spirit deal is smaller than many airline mergers of recent decades, which turned the 10 largest US airlines into four mega-carriers that control 80% of US air traffic. But the Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive stance on questions of antitrust law and vowed to promote greater competition within the airline industry.\n\nBiden's Justice Department sued to block an alliance between American and JetBlue that allows each airline to book passengers onto the other's flights.

Spirit had by far the highest number of passenger complaints in 2021, with 11.45 complaints per 100,000 passengers, according to the US Department of Transportation. JetBlue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6.38, while Frontier came in third with 5.78.

If the last big merger is any indication, maybe.\n\n\"If the merger means improved service and the end of Spirit's poor treatment of passengers, then I'm all for it,\" says Vince Marano, an electrician from Feasterville, Pennsylvania \"But I would hate to see JetBlue get dragged down to Spirit's level.\"\n\nMATCH MADE IN AIRLINE (FEE) HEAVEN: Budget airlines Frontier and Spirit announce merger\n\nBIZARRE LOVE TRIANGLE: Spirit agrees to talk with JetBlue amid merger with Frontier\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that this unlikely airline combination could disappoint JetBlue's customers and damage its brand. But a closer look at the customer service records of JetBlue and Spirit reveals it may already be too late.\n\nAnd a review of the last big airline merger suggests that even if it isn't, a combined JetBlue-Spirit would probably receive more complaints and deliver worse customer service for years to come.\n\nJetBlue and Spirit have a lot more in common than you think\n\nWhen JetBlue announced its unsolicited bid for Spirit earlier this week, CEO Robin Hayes declared the two carriers have \"much in common.\" He pointed to both airlines'' focus on keeping costs low so they can \"profitably\" expand.\n\nBesides that, JetBlue and Spirit seem completely different. Spirit Airlines charges customers for anything that isn't bolted down, including carry-on luggage, snacks and beverages. JetBlue's onboard experience has featured roomier seats in coach, complimentary broadband internet access, snacks and live TV programming.\n\nConsumers consistently reward JetBlue with above-average service ratings. The latest American Customer Satisfaction Index puts JetBlue at a respectable fourth place, behind Alaska Airlines, Southwest and Delta. JetBlue scores 77 out of 100, while Spirit ranks dead last among airlines with a 66.\n\nBut a closer examination reveals that JetBlue has a lot more in common with Spirit than it appears – and, for that matter, with rival Frontier. To find the similarities, you have to dig deep into the U.S. Department of Transportation consumer complaints database. Spirit Airlines was the most complained-about airline in 2021, with an eye-popping 9.76 grievances per 100,000 passenger boardings (the industry average is 3.06). And where is JetBlue on that list? Just two spots ahead with 6.77complaints per 100,000.\n\nTRY OUR TRAVEL NEWSLETTER: Get the latest headlines in your inbox daily\n\nInterestingly, Frontier is sandwiched in between them with 7.59 complaints per 100, so these three airlines are in good company: customers love to complain about them.\n\nWhat happens when two airlines with lousy customer service records merge?\n\nIn February 2013, US Airways announced that it would merge with American Airlines to create the world's largest airline. Both airlines had dreadful customer service records.\n\nIn 2013, the year American and U.S. Airways announced their merger, American ranked third for complaints, behind Frontier Airlines and United Airlines, and U.S. Airways was fifth, according to the DOT. After the merger, the new American Airlines remained one of the most complained-about carriers. The combined airline's American Customer Satisfaction Index scores lingered in the low 70s for years after the combination.\n\nAlmost a decade after announcing its merger, American Airlines is neither the best airline nor the worst when it comes to service. Its American Customer Satisfaction Index scores hover in the mid-70s, and its rate of complaints is about average. So if history is any indication, it could take years before a combined JetBlue-Spirit ever flies as high as a pre-merger JetBlue.\n\nThen again, no two airline mergers are the same, and it's possible that the dynamics of this merger – if it goes through – will be different. Maybe Spirit will drag JetBlue down, as customers like Marano fear. Maybe the opposite will happen, and Spirit's retrofitted planes and retrained cabin crew will bring the \"JetBlue effect\" to passengers in new cities.\n\nPassengers are skeptical of a merger between JetBlue and Spirit Airlines\n\nSome air travelers are skeptical of a JetBlue-Spirit merger. Jeanne Peloso, a retired medical administrator from Pleasantville, New York, says she's been a fan of JetBlue since it launched in the late ’90s.\n\n\"I'm very loyal to JetBlue,\" she says. But the last four months have been difficult, almost Spirit-like, she says. JetBlue has bumped her from flights and rescheduled her. She's waited in \"never-ending\" lines on the phone and in person. It doesn't feel like the same JetBlue she knew and loved.\n\n\"I think that JetBlue might want to get their own house back in order before they try to merge with another airline,\" she says. \"JetBlue prided itself on service. Sadly, that area of their business is gone – hopefully temporarily.\"\n\nOther travelers have told me similar stories of their recent JetBlue flights. The carrier, once the gold standard for airline customer service in the United States, has added new fees for carry-on luggage or offered service that's on the same low level as discount carriers such as Allegiant, Frontier and Spirit.\n\n\"JetBlue ain't what it used to be,\" says Ronna Brown, a retired teacher from Tamarac, Florida.\n\nMatt Murray, another loyal JetBlue passenger, says he watched the last big airline merger between American and US Airways with dismay. He listened to the promises made by airline executives about how the combined airline would deliver better service and more choices and then failed to keep those promises.\n\n\"I knew it wouldn't be of any benefit to us flyers,\" he says. \"And it wasn't.\"\n\nMurray, a real estate agent from Westport, Connecticut, fears the same thing is happening now. Whether Spirit ultimately merges with Frontier or JetBlue, it doesn't matter. The net effect on customer service at the combined carrier will probably be negative.\n\n\"It's gonna make driving or taking the train look good,\" he adds.\n\nScott Lara, an administrator for a home care company in Jacksonville, Florida, agrees that no matter which airlines combine, they will probably fall well short of the assurances they gave passengers pre-merger. So when JetBlue promises to \"deepen its longstanding commitment to Florida\" with \"supercharged\" growth or when Frontier pledges to \"change the industry for the benefit of consumers\" by bringing \"more ultra-low fares to more travelers in more destinations,\" he doesn't believe it.\n\n\"I'm concerned that mergers limit consumer choice and never bring down prices,\" he says.\n\nSo what will the JetBlue-Spirit merger do for customer service?\n\nThe stunning announcement by JetBlue that it wants to buy no-frills Spirit Airlines has left air travelers bewildered and suspicious. And with good reason: The last major merger resulted in a mega-carrier that generated more complaints and delivered worse service, records suggest.\n\nIf a JetBlue-Spirit merger flies, it's likely to have a similar result: instantly creating the most complained-about airline in America and delivering substandard service for years to come.\n\nIf there's a silver lining to the dark clouds on the horizon, it is this: Whether Spirit merges with JetBlue or Frontier, there will be one fewer airline travelers have to avoid.\n\nSpirit-JetBlue merger: Don't forget about these factors\n\nThe JetBlue-Spirit merger might not get past regulators. That's the assessment of Kerry Tan, an associate professor of economics at Loyola University Maryland's Sellinger School of Business. Regulators are likely to frown upon JetBlue's intentions because of the airline's size and routes, according to Tan. \"Spirit-Frontier would have a better chance of getting Department of Justice approval,\" he says.\n\nFrontier is unlikely to give up. Although the other suitor hasn't officially responded to JetBlue's unsolicited offer yet, it will undoubtedly come back with a response in an effort to rescue the deal. That could determine which suitor Spirit chooses and, ultimately, which airline combination flies.\n\nYou'll get to vote on this merger – eventually. Rank-and-file passengers don't get to tell Spirit which airline to take to the altar. But ultimately, they can vote with their wallet. If a combined JetBlue-Spirit is as bad as some fear, avoiding it and giving your business to another airline will let you cast the most important vote in this merger – the one that really determines if the joined airline is successful or not.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/investing/spirit-jetblue?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google", "title": "JetBlue announces a deal to buy Spirit Airlines | CNN Business", "text": "The announcement comes a day after Spirit pulled the plug on a deal to merge with Frontier\n\nJetBlue had been pursuing a hostile bid for Spirit even while Spirit sought shareholder approval for a lower-priced deal with Frontier.

He said there are only three small international routes out of Florida where only Frontier and Spirit offer service, meaning the merger would leave just one carrier.\n\n\"This merger is completely different than everything else you've seen in the industry for the last 20 years,\" Biffle said. \"We are not interested in constraining (seat) capacity and raising prices.\"\n\nHarteveldt said one advantage for bargain-hunting travelers is that two like-minded airlines are combining to create a national budget airline, versus a larger airline scooping one of them up and folding the business into their full-service airline model.\n\nKerry Tan, associate professor of economics at Loyola University Maryland, has researched airline competition and calls the merger of two discount airlines \"uncharted territory.\"\n\nStill, Tan and Harteveldt expect the merged airline to continue to dangle ultra-low fares in a continuing effort to compete against giants American, Delta, United and Southwest.\n\n\"If it's the case that Spirit and Frontier try to exploit their market power after merging, it makes Southwest (and others) a bit more of an attractive alternative for these families,\" Tan said.\n\nSpirit and Frontier airline fees: What happens after the merger?\n\nOne thing travelers can count on with the merger: the combined airlines' fees will remain a staple.\n\nSpirit and Frontier, along with fellow discounter Allegiant Air, pioneered the airline a la carte model, with the ticket price covering no more than transportation between two cities and room for small bag underneath the seat in front of you. Travelers pay extra for anything else and do so in droves.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, the combined airline brought in $465 million in baggage fees alone, according to the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics. That ranks second only to American Airlines at $520 million. Spirit alone collected more in bag fee revenue than much larger JetBlue Airways. Full-year statistics have not been released.\n\nSpirit collected $58.64 in nonticket revenue per passenger per flight in 2021, more than the $46.16 it collected in airfare.\n\nThe airlines have similar, but not identical, fee structures so changes are ahead there. Frontier this month quietly changed its overweight bag limit from 50 pounds to 40 pounds, a move that aligns it with Spirit (and Allegiant.)\n\nBUYER BEWARE: Ticket change fees still around at Spirit, Frontier, Allegiant\n\nAirline meltdowns: Will Spirit, Frontier merger help or hurt stranded passengers?\n\nAirline meltdowns have been a persistent problem for travelers, especially as travel surged back from pandemic lows.\n\nSpirit had a bad spell in late July and early August, with thousands of flight cancellations that stranded travelers for days and cost the airline $50 million.\n\n7 HOURS AT SPIRIT'S BIGGEST HUB ON 7TH DAY OF SPIRIT MELTDOWN: The good, the bad and the ugly\n\nFrontier escaped the omicron staffing woes and wintry weather that afflicted major airlines during and after the holidays but had its own major issue on Monday, the day the merger deal was announced.\n\nThe airline temporarily grounded all flights because of a technology outage that left the airline unable to dispatch flights. The airline canceled 25% of its flights before the problem was fixed, and delayed an additional 24%. More than 260 flights were affected as of Monday evening.\n\nAs part of their pitch to Wall Street on the benefits of the merger, the airlines' executives said the combined airline will have more planes and flights to rebook passengers on when things go wrong.\n\nBiffle used the example of Baltimore to Orlando. The combined airline will have five daily flights on the route at current flight levels, compared with three today for Spirit and two for Frontier.\n\n\"So now, in the event of inclement weather or other challenges, our customers will have at least two additional ultra-low fare options to reach their destination,\" Biffle said.\n\nDuring Spirit's meltdown in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, CEO Ted Christie attributed the hourslong lines for help in part to the time it takes to find seats and rebook passengers, especially on other airlines.\n\n\"They've got to physically go in and buy tickets. That's literally what we're doing, is going on their (other airlines') website and buying their tickets,\" he said at the time.\n\nSpirit has Wi-Fi, Frontier doesn't. Will Wi-Fi be offered on all flights after the merger?\n\nIn-flight services and amenities will also have to be eventually aligned.\n\nOne big topic that will need to be addressed: inflight Wi-Fi. It is standard on major airlines, usually for a fee, but rare on budget airlines.\n\nSpirit has installed Wi-Fi on more than 100 of its 173 planes and is testing the service before rolling it out.\n\nFrontier does not offer Wi-Fi, with its website saying it's a money-saving move.\n\n\"We would rather pass the cost savings on to our customers and offer the lowest fares possible,\" it says.\n\nSpirit has popular first-class-like seats; Frontier doesn't. Which prevails?\n\nSpirit doesn't have first class but the airline sells cushy seats at the front of the plane and gets a premium for them. They are called Big Front Seats.\n\nFor a nonstop flight from Dallas to Cancun, Mexico, in early May, the going price is $130 each way for the seats, which the airline says have up to 11 extra inches of legroom. That's in addition to the roundtrip ticket price of $240.\n\nFrontier does not offer a similar option.\n\nSpirit and Frontier airlines discount fare clubs: Which one survives\n\nUnlike most airlines, Spirit and Frontier offer fare discounts and other perks if you pay an annual membership fee. That's why travelers see an asterisk in most fare sale promotions because you have to be a member to snag that price.\n\nSpirit calls its program Spirit Savers Club and charges $69.95 a year. Frontier calls its program Discount Den and charges $59.99.\n\nBUYER BEWARE: Change fees are gone on some airline tickets. Except these. And these. And these\n\nFLYING SPIRIT: Seven flights in five days.

That is $150 million more than JetBlue previously offered to pay.\n\nIn a Wednesday press release, Spirit said it remains \"bound by the terms of the merger agreement with Frontier.\" It added that its \"board has not determined that either JetBlue's unsolicited tender offer or its updated proposal received on June 6 constitutes a Superior Proposal.\"\n\nSpirit has postponed the Friday meeting until June 30.\n\nWhat about the passengers? How will consumers fare if Spirit merges with JetBlue or Frontier?\n\nSpirit did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nUnder its new proposal, JetBlue said it would prepay $1.50 per share in cash, about $164 million, of the reverse break-up fee, in the form of a cash dividend to Spirit stockholders promptly following the Spirit stockholder vote approving the combination between Spirit and JetBlue. Spirit stockholders would ultimately receive $30 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction and the prepayment of $1.50 per share of the reverse break-up fee.\n\nJetBlue's announcement comes less than a week after Frontier Airlines added a $250 million termination fee to its proposal.

The airline said it would also be able to offer more flights across the United States, Caribbean and Latin America.\n\nSpirit currently serves cities JetBlue does not, including St. Louis; Memphis, Tennessee; and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nSpirit, Frontier airlines respond to surprise JetBlue merger proposal\n\nSpirit said in a statement that it is evaluating the offer.\n\n\"Consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Spirit board of directors will work with its financial and legal advisors to evaluate JetBlue's proposal and pursue the course of action it determines to be in the best interests of Spirit and its stockholders,'' the company said in a statement.\n\nFrontier is already on the offense, saying a JetBlue-Spirit merger would not be good for travelers.\n\n\"Unlike the compelling Spirit-Frontier combination, an acquisition of Spirit by JetBlue, a high-fare carrier, would lead to more expensive travel for consumers,\" the Denver-based airline said in a statement. \"In particular, the significant East Coast overlap between JetBlue and Spirit would reduce competition and limit options for consumers. It is surprising that JetBlue would consider such a merger at this time given that the Department of Justice is currently suing to block their pending (northeast) alliance with American Airlines.\"\n\nJetBlue and Spirit overlapped on 11% of scheduled routes in 2021, compared with about 18% overlap between Frontier and Spirit, it, according to aviation data company Cirium.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nSpirit-Frontier merger announced in February\n\nSpirit and Frontier announced a deal in February to create the nation's fifth-largest airline based on seat capacity and seventh-largest based on annual revenue.

The airlines have not said which airline's name or plane paint style would survive the merger or who would run the combined airline.\n\nBUDGET AIRLINE BONANZA: What Spirit-Frontier merger would mean for fares, fees\n\nSpirit and JetBlue are seen as more of an odd couple given JetBlue's generous inflight perks including extra legroom, free Wi-Fi, free live TV and trendy snacks. If the deal went through, JetBlue said Spirit would be absorbed into JetBlue, with seats taken out of its planes to conform with JetBlue's roomier configuration.\n\nAnalysts say that pricey plane conversion can't be done without raising fares. Already, JetBlue's fares are higher than Spirit's on some competing routes. For a June trip from Fort Lauderdale to New York, Spirit's cheapest fare is $156, compared with $289 on JetBlue. The latter is for a JetBlue basic economy ticket.\n\n\"At the end of the day, our intention is to offer fares that are equally competitive to what Spirit offers,'' JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nJetBlue and Frontier say a deal with Spirit would create a powerhouse national low-fare airline that would be able to better compete with the country's big four airlines: American, Delta, United and Southwest.\n\nFrontier criticized that notion Tuesday and called JetBlue a high-fare airline.\n\n\"Unlike the compelling Spirit-Frontier combination, an acquisition of Spirit by JetBlue, a high-fare carrier, would lead to more expensive travel for consumers,\" the Denver-based airline said in a statement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}]}

The singer didn’t offer a definitive release date, but he expects to release the follow-up album after he begins his Las Vegas residency, which kicks off in July.\n\n“I’m ready to drop my album,” Usher, who said he spent much of the lockdown recording new music, told The Associated Press.\n\n“If this is an exclusive, I’m letting you know that the album is officially coming this year,” he continued. “But before it does, I’ll see you guys at my Vegas residency.”\n\nUsher spoke during an in-person press junket before he hosts and performs at Thursday’s iHeartRadio Music Awards, airing at 8 p.m. Eastern on Fox. The event will be held with roughly 800 COVID-compliant audience members — including first responders and health care workers — at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nUsher spring boarded into superstardom with “Confessions,” which sold more than 10 million units in the U.S. and earned him eight nominations at the 2005 Grammys, winning him three.

Here's what you need to know about refunds\n\nKeith Urban rolls in March 25-April 2 and again May 27-29. Rod Stewart returns May 13-21 and Sept. 23-Oct. 1. Sting offers another round of shows June 3-18, while Van Morrison performs Oct. 7-9.\n\nThat leaves a gap of about a dozen weekends between mid-June to late September and another 12 weekends from Morrison's fall dates through the end of 2022.\n\nBut don’t use those breathless tabloid reports about Adele’s sets being carted out of The Colosseum as a meaningful barometer. The implication is that their removal signals a permanent departure from Caesars. What it actually means is that the venue is not Adele’s personal storage facility and preparations need to begin for Urban, who gamely stepped in to fill some of her abandoned dates starting next month.\n\nShows can be retooled and sets can be returned.\n\nAdele’s original slate at Caesars was called “Weekends with Adele,” and, save for one weekend between Jan. 21 and April 16, she was set to play each Friday and Saturday night. Given the proximity to her Los Angeles home, Adele clearly wanted to knock out the spate of shows in succession, rather than pepper the calendar throughout the year – but she may be forced to break up her dates over a more extended period.\n\nIt's presumed that Caesars Palace and Live Nation are working feverishly to figure out how to still launch Adele’s residency this year, though it’s unknown if other residencies that also require a space commitment have yet to be announced.\n\nNo one – fans, promoters, ticketing agencies – would want to deal with the complexities of moving the show to another venue and reticketing, so a kiss-and-make-up scenario at Caesars is expected.

McLean – recognized the benefits of playing a residency during their “Larger Than Life” run which drew a global audience.\n\n“If 10 years ago you had asked about playing Vegas, I would have been like, no, that’s where people go to retire into the sunset and put an end to their careers. But Celine (Dion), Britney (Spears), JLo (Jennifer Lopez) – they all recreated the thought of what people perceive of Vegas,” Dorough says.\n\nThe Backstreet Boys decided to stage a holiday outing after delaying their “DNA World Tour” until 2022 because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“We really wanted to perform for our fans before the end of this year and felt it was a great opportunity,” Richardson says. “We have two Christmas songs in our history and thought we’d do 12 shows – a small sampling that could maybe happen annually.”\n\nIn addition to those previous songs (“Christmas Time” in 1996 and “It’s Christmas Time Again” in 2012), BSB will craft a set list incorporating songs from their upcoming Christmas album. Fans have been updated on the album through the guys’ social media outlets and in March Dorough told FloridaToday.com, part of the USA TODAY Network,two original tracks will join 10 remakes of Christmas classics.\n\nWhile production for the holiday residency is just starting – Richardson says group rehearsals will commence in October – the plan is to pepper the set list with, what Dorough calls, “Backstreet hits, but Christmas-ized.”\n\nMany familiar dance moves will also be on display, even though Richardson laughs that they aren’t as “gymnastic-oriented” as in the past.\n\n“During lockdown, I kind of got lazy and sat around awhile – but you need that every now and then,” he says. “But gearing back up for a show, we all hit the gym. We box, we do cardio, we hit the Peloton, we do yoga and stretch. It’s like being an athlete on tour – it can be a grind. And we do deal with injuries and sore backs and pulled muscles like any athlete would. Health and wellness is definitely part of the regime.”\n\nSo is an appreciation for ’90s nostalgia, with the group welcomes and shares with many of their peers. McLean and Carter, along with NSYNC's Joey Fatone and Boyz II Men’s Wanya Morris are staging their own Vegas fun with “The After Party” at The Venetian Resort Aug. 19-22, which is the type of camaraderie Dorough says the artists of the era have always shared.\n\n“We’re embracing this ’90s vibe that is coming back and loving it,” he says. “And with all of the other groups around us, we’re all helping each other. I feel like nowadays we’re all still keeping the music alive.”\n\nRichardson’s longevity goals are even loftier, as he stresses the importance of a timeless catalog.\n\n“We want to be The Rolling Stones of pop music,” he says. “The career that they’ve had and the crowd that they still draw. Like Bon Jovi and U2 and the Eagles.

And while that album never materialized, she returned in early 2018 with the single “Dinero” featuring DJ Khaled and Cardi B, raising questions about whether more new music would follow soon.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/01/21/adele-fans-frustrated-sudden-las-vegas-show-postponement-so-sad/6601713001/", "title": "Adele fans frustrated by sudden Las Vegas show postponement: 'So ...", "text": "Adele fans are reeling after the singer's sudden announcement Thursday that her Las Vegas residency, set to begin Friday, would be postponed because of COVID-19-related production delays.\n\n\"I’m so sorry, but my show ain’t ready,\" Adele said in a tearful video posted to Twitter Thursday. “We’ve tried absolutely everything that we can to put it together in time and for it to be good enough for you, but we’ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and COVID – half my crew are down with COVID, they still are – and it’s been impossible to finish the show.”\n\nHer Las Vegas residency, titled \"Weekends with Adele\" and announced in November, was set to kick off Friday at the Colosseum in Caesars Palace and run through April.\n\nCaesars Palace said on its website Thursday night that all events originally scheduled for \"Weekends with Adele\" Jan. 21 through April 16 \"have been postponed.\"\n\nThough the singer received an outpouring of support on social media after her announcement, many fans expressed frustration, anger and disappointment after booking hotel and travel arrangements, plus taking time off work, only for the show to be canceled the day before.\n\n\"That's awesome but I flew across the entire country for tomorrow's show,\" wrote @brittrimmey on Twitter. \"Thanks for the notice\"\n\nAndrea Perez, who arrived from Mexico City Thursday afternoon, learned of the cancellation after arriving at Caesars Palace.\n\n\"We were first going to see Celine Dion and then she canceled, and now Adele,\" she told USA TODAY while standing in front of the Colosseum box office. \"I love Adele.

Her voice is indescribable. And she's just adorable and a great role model for her generation,\" Colbert told USA TODAY.\n\nShe and three girlfriends from around the country purchased tickets for opening night through Ticketmaster's Verified Fan program; they hope rescheduled dates will allow them to attend the new opening night show.\n\n\"As much as we hated to see her message, it speaks to who she is as a person,\" Colbert said. \"We have the flexibility to pay for another trip, so we will be there.\"\n\nAdele isn't a pop star because she's hip.

I was playing heavy drama,” Sting deadpans and then chuckles. “I’ve worked with both Steve Martin and Martin Short many times over the years and they knew I could say lines at least. I’d never worked with Selena (Gomez), and she was fabulous. It was fun – and it wasn’t me, as Shaggy used to say.”\n\nAs he talks from his New York apartment – the Empire State Building is in view, he reports – Sting is both contemplative and engaging.\n\nHe observed his milestone October birthday with a pair of performances under the Acropolis in Greece, and later joined his old friend Eric Burdon of The Animals fame for a celebratory dinner.\n\n“It’s getting more and more difficult to find venues older than me, so the Acropolis fits that bill since it’s about 3,000 years old,” Sting jokes.\n\nThe fall fete marked the start of a new chapter of activity, starting with his twice-postponed debut in Las Vegas.\n\nOf the myriad superstar residencies that have populated the Strip, Sting says the only one he attended was Elton John’s The Red Piano, which played the Colosseum for five years.\n\n“It’s better than that,” he laughs. “No, no, I love Elton.”\n\nSting is, though, audibly excited about having his own room to create a multimedia experience.\n\n“Each of the songs lives in its own visual world. The show begins with me in Paris, where I wrote ‘Roxanne’ with an acoustic guitar and then we instantly head to another world,” he says. “It’s a fascinating visual experiment. There isn’t any furniture being moved around – it’s projections and screens, but it’s quite a stunning variety of images and film and geometry.”\n\nThe show, which plays through Saturday and returns in June for another run, spotlights gems from a career that has yielded more than 100 million albums sold between solo work and with The Police: “King of Pain,” “Next to You,” “Brand New Day,” “Englishman in New York” and the most-played radio song (according to BMI), “Every Breath You Take,” all make appearances, as well as two new songs from “The Bridge,” including the giddy whistler “If It’s Love.”\n\nThe theme of the album came to Sting after he finished recording, which he says was a “mysterious” occurrence.\n\n“I recognized something that connected all of (the songs). They’re all about characters in transition, characters between worlds, between life and death – that’s what connects them. I think the theme of water runs throughout the whole record. Water is a medium that is not comfortable, it’s dangerous and we have to be very careful. But immersing yourself in it does create opportunity,” Sting says.\n\nOn the opening track, “Rushing Water,” he sings “what we have here is so easy to solve/just takes a firm purpose and some resolve,” leading one to wonder about Sting’s level of optimism.\n\nHe laughs and says, “I think optimism is a good strategy in life. It’s getting more difficult to be optimistic. Let’s be frank, the window of opportunity is closing. But it’s the best strategy we have moving forward.”\n\nOn the bonus edition of “The Bridge,” Sting includes a cover of Otis Redding’s “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay,” a classic he says is “always first on my list of favorite songs.”\n\nAlbum review: Ed Sheeran pours on the emotion for \"=\"\n\nHe initially recorded it for the Alzheimer’s Association – “Research tells them people remember songs more readily than anything else when they suffer from dementia,” Sting says – and included it on his new album so fans “can see what I get up to for fun.”\n\nBut he also discovered something musical about the '60s soul masterwork.\n\n“It’s an intensely sad song, but there are no minor chords in it. It’s all major chords and the only complex chords are in the chorus. You’d think it would be a minor (key) song and it’s not and that’s fascinating,” Sting says.\n\nAlong with continuing to be a student of music, Sting is also maintaining a rigorous concert calendar, with a rescheduled European tour launching in March.\n\nSo while peers such as Elton John and Genesis have stated farewell intentions, Sting isn’t ready for any proclamations or to slow down.\n\n“You’re asking a fish what it’s going to be like without water,” he says. “I can’t imagine life without working onstage. I love it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/05"}]}

That's up slightly since earlier this year, when 65% said the same. More broadly, 54% say they see American democracy as under attack, about the same as the 52% who felt that way earlier this year.\n\nAlthough there was little movement on each of these questions, partisans appear to be moving in opposite directions. While Democrats are becoming more likely to say democracy is under attack (55% now, up from 46% earlier this year) and that the January 6 attack is a major problem or a crisis (96% now, up from 91%), Republicans are now less likely to feel that way than earlier this year, before the select committee's hearings. Just 36% of Republicans now say that January 6 was a crisis or major problem, down 7 points since February, and 54% feel American democracy is under attack, down from 66% earlier this year.\n\nRoughly 4 in 10 overall have been closely following news about the select committee's hearings (41%), with attention concentrated among Democrats (55% of Democrats are following at least somewhat closely, compared with 40% of independents and 28% of Republicans).\n\nAbout half of all adults say they think the investigation the committee has carried out has been a fair attempt to determine what happened (47%), while 34% say it's been a one-sided effort to blame Trump, the rest feel they haven't heard enough to say. Those figures are largely unmoved compared with polling earlier this year.\n\nMost (60%) doubt that the committee's work will result in changes that help protect American democracy. Democrats are the most optimistic here, 65% think it will lead to meaningful change, compared with just 37% of independents and 17% of Republicans.\n\nAlthough there are divisions by party in how Americans view Trump's behavior around January 6, majorities across party lines agree that his conduct in trying to remain in office was at least unethical and that he could have done more to stop the attack. Nearly all Democrats (97%) and a broad majority of independents (83%) say Trump acted unethically or illegally in trying to remain in office, but so too do a majority of Republicans (55%). And likewise, 55% of Republicans say Trump could have done more to stop the attack once it began. Eight in 10 independents (81%) and 93% of Democrats say the same.\n\nAsked whether then-Vice President Mike Pence or Trump did more to act in the best interests of the country on January 6, most Americans (67%), including broad majorities of Democrats (91%) and independents (64%), say Pence had the nation's interests more at heart. Republicans split on the question, however, with 52% saying Trump did more to protect the country's interests and 46% saying Pence did.\n\nAnd Republicans do not agree that Trump's statements leading up to January 6 encouraged political violence. About 8 in 10 Republicans (79%) say Trump's statements did not encourage violence, while 66% of independents and 94% of Democrats say they did.\n\nThat said, a broad majority continue to reject the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen: 69%, a new high in CNN's polling, say that Biden legitimately won enough votes to win the presidency in 2020. Still, most Republicans continue to say that Biden's win was not legitimate (66%).\n\nRepublicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to say that the GOP should be accepting of candidates who believe the 2020 election was stolen (72% say it should be at least somewhat accepting of those candidates) than they are to say that the party should be accepting of those who say the election was legitimate (63% say so). Combined, 30% say the party should only be accepting of candidates who say the election was stolen, 22% only those who think it was legitimate, and 42% say the party should accept a mix of both.\n\nThere are broad divides on these questions between those Republicans who want Trump to be the party's nominee in 2024 and those who do not. Among those who say Republicans ought to nominate someone else, there's wide acceptance of those of all perspectives on 2020: 79% say the party should be accepting of candidates who believe the election was legitimate and 62% say it should be accepting of those who believe it was stolen. Trump's backers within the party, though, mostly say to accept those candidates who think the election was stolen (86%) and not accept those who think it was legitimate (57%).\n\nStill, a majority of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters now say they do not want Trump to be their party's presidential nominee in 2024 (55% say they want a different candidate), a slight shift away from Trump compared with earlier this year (49% preferred someone other than Trump in a poll conducted in January and February). An increasing number say they feel that way primarily because they just don't want him to be president (27% now, up from 19% earlier this year).\n\nTrump's standing among Republican-aligned voters in advance of the 2024 campaign, though, is not as perilous as President Joe Biden's position among his partisans. The new poll finds three-quarters of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters (75%) want the party to nominate someone else in 2024, a sharp increase from 51% earlier this year.\n\nThinking more generally about 2024, the poll finds that most Americans (57%) express at least some confidence that the nation's democracy would be able to withstand a losing presidential candidate's attempt to overturn the election results in 2024, but that confidence is tepid. Just 19% say they are very confident that US democracy could survive such an effort, with confidence stronger among Republicans (26% very confident vs. 17% among Democrats). In overall confidence, younger Americans are notably skeptical about US democracy's ability to withstand an attempt to overturn the results of the 2024 presidential contest: While 63% of those age 45 or older express at least some confidence, only 49% of those under age 45 agree.\n\nThis CNN poll was conducted July 22 to July 24 by SSRS online, using sample drawn from a probability-based panel.

Extreme heat\n\nMore than 85% of Americans are bracing for temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit through the weekend, with millions in the south-central US expected to experience readings in the triple digits . \"Widespread high temperatures in the mid-to-upper 90s and low 100s will encompass a majority of the country on Thursday and Friday,\" according to the National Weather Service. The areas at the highest risk for the dangerously high heat span the Southwest, central and south-central US, along with the coastal mid-Atlantic region and the Northeast, the weather service noted . This has driven state and local leaders to issue heat emergencies and offer resources to residents to mitigate the scorching temperatures. The extreme weather in the US has been matched by deadly conditions in Europe , where records have been smashed and 19 European countries remain on \"extreme danger\" alerts for wildfires.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe House select committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, is returning to primetime today for its final planned hearing this month that will seek to show in minute-by-minute detail how former President Donald Trump failed to act while the attack was underway. Committee aides say that the panel will show how Trump \"refused to act to defend the Capitol\" for 187 minutes as the violent mob stormed the building. The committee has spoken with several former Trump aides who were with him that day -- including former White House counsel Pat Cipollone -- and their video depositions are expected to be used to help tell the story of what was going on inside the White House on January 6. The committee is also expected to show clips of video outtakes of Trump recording a message to his supporters on January 7, 2021, the day after the attack. The hearing will air live on CNN at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'You had a president who went AWOL': Conway previews January 6 hearing Replay More Videos ...

Marriage Equality\n\nRepublican and Democratic senators said Wednesday they expect a bill protecting same-sex marriage will eventually win the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster . While it's not yet clear how many Republicans will support the bill, this acknowledgment is a sign of growing public acceptance and a sea change over an issue that had once badly divided the two parties. While most GOP senators are likely to vote against the bill, lawmakers in both parties believe there will be at least 10 Republicans who would join all 50 Democrats and advance the bill to a final up-or-down vote. But with the Senate leaving for its August recess in two weeks, the measure may not hit the Senate floor for some time.\n\n4. Home Prices\n\nHome prices in the US hit a new all-time high in June , despite the lack of affordability that's pushing buyers out of the market. The median home price was $416,000 last month, up 13.4% from one year ago, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors. Miami had the largest median price growth, up 40.1% from a year ago. It was followed by Orlando, Florida, up 30.6%, and Nashville, Tennessee, up 30.6%, the report shows. Inventory, which had been tight, is also ticking up, but there are still longstanding shortages of housing. Some experts say builders are cutting back on single-family home construction and boosting construction of multifamily buildings -- which could be a sign they may be betting on more people getting priced out of buying and renting instead.\n\nJUST WATCHED Realtor.com chief economist shares her advice for homebuyers and sellers Replay More Videos ...

Hunter Biden\n\nThe federal investigation of President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden , has reached a critical juncture, according to people briefed on the matter. Investigators are weighing possible charges while prosecutors are confronting Justice Department guidelines to generally avoid bringing politically sensitive cases close to an election. While no final decision has been made on whether to bring charges against the President's son, sources say the probe has intensified in recent months. The Justice Department investigation initially focused on Hunter Biden's financial and business activities in foreign countries dating to when Joe Biden was vice president.

Uvalde\n\nA Texas House investigative committee released a preliminary report Sunday outlining a series of failures by multiple law enforcement agencies during their response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. The report, which was first made available to the victims' families, described \"an overall lackadaisical approach\" by nearly 400 officers. According to the report, law enforcement officials share a \"systemic responsibility\" for waiting more than an hour before breaching the classroom and killing the shooter. First responders also \"lost critical momentum\" by treating the situation as a \"barricaded subject\" scenario, which calls for a more measured response compared to an active shooter. The report said officials were also lacking an effective incident commander, resulting in a breakdown in communication. The gunman who stormed the school killed 19 students and two teachers, making it the second-deadliest shooting ever at a K-12 school in the US.\n\n2. Mall shooting\n\nAs communities across the US continue to grapple with the aftermath of mass shootings, another three people were killed and several others injured after a shooter opened fire in a food court at an Indiana shopping mall on Sunday. Around 6:00 p.m. local time, multiple people called 911 to report an active shooter at a mall in Greenwood, Indiana, police said. Investigators believe the unidentified gunman, an adult man, was shot and killed by a lawfully armed 22-year-old man who \"observed the shooting in progress,\" Greenwood Police Department Chief Jim Ison said. Among the injured victims is a 12-year-old girl whose parents brought her to the hospital with minor injuries after the shooting, the chief said, noting she is expected to be \"just fine.\" There have been 350 mass shootings this year, according to Gun Violence Archive.\n\n3.

Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has fired two of his top officials , accusing members of their staff of treason and collaborating with Russia. One of the dismissed officials was a long-time associate of Zelensky. On the ground, the Ukrainian military said today that the shelling of its defenses across the Donetsk region is continuing, but renewed attempts by Russian forces to win territory have been thwarted.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mykolaiv resident: Russia's terrorism won't scare us Replay More Videos ...

At least 1,000 deaths have been attributed to the heat wave in Portugal and Spain so far. Temperatures in Spain have reached as high as 114 degrees Fahrenheit during the nearly weeklong heat wave. In France, wildfires have forced the evacuations of more than 14,000 people as officials continue to issue red alerts, the highest possible to warn residents. Extremely high temperatures are forecast in Britain today and tomorrow in what would top a previous official record of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. And in the US, several states from the north-central Plains to Texas face possible record high temperatures this week, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJUST WATCHED Spain's heat wave death toll climbs to 84 Replay More Videos ...

Netflix\n\nNetflix will report its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, and it's shaping up to be one of the most consequential moments in the 25-year history of the company. In April, the streaming giant reported that it lost subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 -- the first time that had happened in any quarter for more than a decade. Netflix's stock subsequently plummeted (it's currently down about 70% so far this year), wiping out billions of dollars in market value. Soon after, the company laid off hundreds of employees . And a weak outlook for the second quarter shocked investors: Netflix predicted it would lose another 2 million subscribers in the spring. According to a market researcher, if that number is higher than 2 million in the report on Tuesday, investors may fully turn their backs on Netflix -- a move that could reshape the future of the company as well as the entire streaming sector.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why second quarter earnings are a serious test for Netflix Replay More Videos ...

Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has scrapped plans to storm the Azovstal steel plant in the southeastern port city of Mariupol, saying those who choose to surrender should be treated in accordance with international conventions. The plant is among the last significant holdouts of Ukrainian forces in the city and is sheltering hundreds of soldiers and civilians. Putin also congratulated the Russian military on taking control of Mariupol, a claim Ukrainian officials have denied. Ukrainian commanders on the ground also said Russian forces have not honored agreements to open humanitarian corridors or enforce ceasefires and have continued to bombard the city. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Air Force has added about 20 more operational aircraft to its fleet because of an influx of spare parts, according to a senior US defense official, which will help strengthen the country's aerial defense network.\n\n2.

Republicans in Florida and Disney have been at odds over the legislation that opponents called the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill .

This comes as Russia is celebrating Victory Day , an annual commemoration of the country's defeat of Nazi Germany at the end of World War II. Typically, the day is celebrated with thousands of troops assembling outside the Kremlin, but this year appears to be a \" very low key \" affair, according to a defense industry analyst. Russia's celebration comes after 60 civilians were likely killed on Saturday when a Russian aircraft dropped a bomb on a school in Luhansk, a Ukrainian official said. Western countries reacted to the bombing with outrage, including UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who said she was \"horrified\" and that the attack \"amounts to war crimes.\" Yesterday, first lady Jill Biden spent part of Mother's Day making an unannounced trip to Uzhhorod, Ukraine, a small city in the far southwestern corner of the country. The first lady is the latest high-profile American to visit the war-torn region in recent weeks.\n\n2. Inflation\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks on inflation tomorrow as Americans continue to struggle with rising costs everywhere from grocery stores to gas pumps. \"He'll detail his plan to fight inflation and lower costs for working families, and contrast his approach with Congressional Republicans' ultra-MAGA plan to raise taxes on 75 million American families and threaten to sunset programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,\" a White House official said. A recent CNN poll found 8 in 10 US adults said the federal government wasn't doing enough to curb inflation, and a majority said the President's policies have hurt the economy. Inflation rates have been increasing sharply since August 2021 and have been out of the normal 2%-to-4% range for a full year. The Consumer Price Index rose 8.5% for the year ending in March -- a level not seen since 1981.\n\nJUST WATCHED Former NY Fed chief: Fed was 'very late' in addressing inflation Replay More Videos ...

Since Friday, Beijing has reported a total of 80 cases. Although the caseload is still relatively low, authorities are not taking any chances, especially after seeing how fast the Omicron outbreak in Shanghai spiraled into tens of thousands of new cases. Dozens of residential compounds across eight districts in Beijing are already under strict lockdowns, in which residents are banned from leaving their homes or community grounds.\n\nJUST WATCHED This is the video Chinese censors don't want you to see or share Replay More Videos ...

Capitol riot\n\nCNN has obtained 2,319 text messages that former President Donald Trump's White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent and received between Election Day 2020 and President Joe Biden's January 20, 2021 inauguration. The text messages, which Meadows selectively provided to the House committee investigating the Capitol riot , show how Trump's inner circle, supporters and Republican lawmakers worked behind the scenes to try to overturn the election results. The messages also reveal how Trump's family members reacted to the violence at the US Capitol during the insurrection. Separately, a New York judge is holding Trump in civil contempt for failing to comply with document subpoenas as part of an investigation into the former President's company. The judge yesterday said Trump will be fined $10,000 a day until he complies.\n\nJUST WATCHED See text messages Mark Meadows gave to Jan. 6 committee Replay More Videos ...

McCarthy told Breitbart he would strip Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of their assignments on the House Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Ilhan Omar of her assignment on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. McCarthy said he would do so because of a \"new standard\" set by Democrats, who elected to remove GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from their committees last year. Gosar was censured for posting a photoshopped anime video to social media showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden.

The 7.2-magnitude temblor was on the same fault line as the 2010 quake, reported NPR, and about 60 miles west. That's about two times stronger than the quake 11 years ago, USGS said.\n\nDevastation by the numbers\n\nHaiti is still recovering from the earthquake of Jan. 12, 2010. It killed an estimated 200,000 and injured 300,000.\n\n\"Entire hillsides were flattened and many buildings collapsed in the capital, including hospitals and schools,\" reported World Vision Australia. \"About 1.5 million people were left homeless and forced to live in temporary shelter sites in Port-au-Prince.

The agency said more than 7,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged.\n\n\"The damage should not be as bad as 2010, because that quake gave Intensity VII shaking to Port au Prince,\" seismologist Lucy Jones said on Twitter.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecast 5 to 10 inches of rain in Haiti and the Dominican Republic and up to 15 inches in some southern parts of the island they share.\n\nHaiti is no stranger to the exacerbation of disaster: About 10 months after the 2010 earthquake, the first-ever cholera outbreak occurred in the country, caused by contamination through a United Nations peacekeeping camp. That outbreak led to more than 820,000 cases and nearly 10,000 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe 2010 cholera outbreak echoes that of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country now. Hospitals are overwhelmed with victims as Haiti struggles with a pandemic that has infected more than 20,000 and killed 576, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nJust last month, the country received its first batch of U.S.-donated coronavirus vaccines via a United Nations program for low-income countries.\n\nPaul Caruso, a geophysicist with the USGS, said aftershocks probably would continue for weeks or months. The largest so far has registered 5.2 magnitude.\n\nIn 2010, the USGS reported at least 52 aftershocks just days after the main quake. The largest, a 6.1 magnitude, struck eight days later.\n\nWhy are earthquakes so devastating in Haiti?\n\nHaiti sits near the intersection of two tectonic plates: the North American plate and the Caribbean plate. Multiple fault lines between those plates cut through or near the island of Hispaniola, which Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe nation has a high population density of 11 million people and buildings that are often designed to withstand hurricanes – not earthquakes.\n\nTypical concrete and cinder block buildings can survive strong winds but are vulnerable to damage or collapse when the ground shakes. Poor construction practices also can play a role.\n\nThe 2010 quake hit closer to densely populated Port-au-Prince and caused widespread destruction.\n\nMore on Haiti:US military trained 'small number' of the Colombian suspects in Haiti assassination, Pentagon says\n\nContributing: Gabriela Miranda, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/08/06/indonesia-earthquake/912515002/", "title": "Indonesia earthquake: Death toll rises as Lombok, Bali shaken", "text": "The death toll rose to 98 after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Lombok and nearby Bali on Sunday, damaging buildings, sending terrified residents and tourists running into the streets and triggering a brief tsunami warning.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo urged the speedy evacuation of casualties, calling for more flights to be sent to the affected areas.\n\nVideo and still images showed hundreds of tourists flocking to the beach to be evacuated.

Earthquakes of 3 or higher are strong enough to be felt.\n\nThere have been hundreds of smaller disturbances: 1,406 aftershocks of at least magnitude 1.0.\n\nThe aftershocks will occur less frequently as time goes on, Aagaard said. Over the next week, the USGS has predicted 84 to 610 aftershocks of magnitude 3 or higher. Aftershocks of at least 3 are more than 99 percent likely. There's an 88 percent chance of a magnitude 5 or higher, too.\n\nAn aftershock stronger or as strong as the initial one is unlikely, however. The probability for an earthquake of magnitude 7 or higher before Dec. 8 is only 3 percent, said the USGS.\n\nThe location of the earthquake – near the subduction interface at a depth of 25 miles beneath the surface – raised the threshold for what magnitudes are felt at the surface, Aagaard said. The subduction zone is the place where two lithospheric plates come together, one riding over the other, according to the USGS.\n\n\"If this had been a much shallower one, people really would be feeling a lot more aftershocks,\" Aagaard said. \"So that is probably helping to some extent, in terms of people not feeling as many aftershocks, because they are occurring deeper.\"\n\nUSGS starts with generic models to predict aftershocks, Aagaard said, then makes adjustments as they monitor aftershocks on the first day. Its scientists are updating forecasts on a daily basis and making weekly projections, the time range in which they have the most confidence.\n\n\"As we get farther into the sequence, then we can have a better fit to our models to be able to see when we expect to get to the background rate,\" Aagaard said. \"That's what we compare against, which is how many earthquakes we have in an area when we haven't had a large earthquake and aftershock.\"\n\nMeanwhile, delivery of food supplies, fuel and other cargo has not been interrupted, Anchorage officials said at a Sunday news conference.\n\nAt the Port of Anchorage, through which 90 percent of all goods sold in Alaska come, at least one major cargo company is unloading as normal.

It was strongly felt in Atka, an Aleut community of 64 people, and the larger Aleutian town of Adak, where 320 people live. The quake was followed by multiple aftershocks, including one measuring magnitude 5.4.\n\nThe earthquake didn't trigger a tsunami warning, but Michael Burgy with the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, said the center is monitoring for potential tsunamis caused by landslides, either on land or under water.\n\nThe Alaska Earthquake Information Center said the primary earthquake was centered 67 miles southwest of Adak, about 1,200 miles southwest of Anchorage. Shaking lasted up to one minute.\n\nThe quake occurred offshore in the subduction zone where plates of the Earth's crust grind and dive. By contrast, California's most famous fault line, the San Andreas, is a strike-slip fault. Quakes along strike-slip faults tend to move horizontally.\n\nIn Adak, city clerk Debra Sharrah was upstairs in her two-story townhome getting ready for work when she heard a noise.\n\n\"I thought it was my dog running up the stairs,\" she said. \"It kept making noise and then it got louder. So then all of a sudden the rumbling started.\"\n\nThe four-plex of townhomes was shaking and swaying as Sharrah and her dog, Pico, dashed out the door. It seemed like the building moved for a long time, but the only thing disturbed in her home was a stepstool that fell over.\n\n\"Nothing fell off my walls, and the wine glasses didn't go out of the hutch or anything,\" said Sharrah, who moved to the island community from Montana's Glacier National Park area almost two years ago.\n\nIn Atka, Nevzoroff manages the village store and expected to find goods had flown off the shelves. But nothing was amiss.\n\n\"Everything seems to be okay,\" she said.\n\nThe communities are located in a sparsely populated region and both played roles in World War II.\n\nAtka residents were displaced during the war, relocating to Southeast Alaska so the U.S. government could demolish the village to prevent the Japanese from seizing it as they had other Aleutian communities. After the war, the U.S. Navy rebuilt the community and residents returned. Today, the community is a cluster of solidly built utilitarian buildings scattered over rolling hills that turned emerald green in warmer months.\n\nAdak, 110 miles to the west, had been home to U.S. military installations that allowed forces to wage a successful offense against the Japanese after they seized the Aleutian Islands of Kiska and Attu.

It’s fairly clear that it’s just a coincidence.”\n\nMagnitude-5.4 quake hits Japan Saturday morning\n\nEcuador is one of the most highly seismic regions in the world, located on what is known as the Pacific Ocean’s active “Ring of Fire.”\n\nDavid Rothery, a professor of planetary geosciences at The Open University, northeast of London, told the Associated Press that the total energy released by Saturday's magnitude-7.8 quake in Ecuador was “probably about 20 times greater” than the magnitude-7.0 quake in Japan early Saturday.\n\nThe Ecuador earthquake began deeper underground than the recent Japan quake, which would have lessened the shaking on the ground. But Ecuador is experiencing a greater loss of life and greater damage to property than Japan because of its less-stringent construction codes.\n\nRothery added that “there is no causal relationship between the earthquakes in Ecuador and Japan.”\n\nSince 1900, there have been seven magnitude-7.0 quakes within 155 miles of the epicenter of Saturday's massive earthquake in Ecuador, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nIn January 1906, a magnitude-8.3 earthquake and tsunami killed as many as 1,500, according to the geological survey.

Earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 or larger — the size of the 1994 Northridge quake — are projected to strike once every 6.3 years, they said, down from once every 4.8 years.\n\nNed Field, a USGS geophysicist and lead author of the study, said the new forecast was created using a model that incorporates the latest research and seismological data.\n\n\"What the model really does provide is a significant refinement in our estimates of where and how often earthquakes will occur throughout the state,\" Field said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\n\"As we filled in the fault inventory over the years, we've just realized that we're dealing not with separate, isolated faults but a vast, interconnected system of faults,\" Field said. \"The fact that we're now dealing with an interconnected fault system effectively has allowed larger earthquakes to occur in the model, and that has increased the rate of magnitude-8 and above events by about 20 percent.\"\n\nThe estimates are laid out in the third version of the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, which enables people to view the projected chances of quakes along different faults using Google Earth.\n\nThe findings, Field said, will help update building codes and earthquake insurance policies, and will affect how engineers design skyscrapers, hospitals, bridges, schools, and water infrastructure.\n\n\"This will help all those people working to make society resilient,\" Field said. \"It will help them do a better job of that.\"\n\nDavid Oglesby, a seismologist at UC Riverside who wasn't involved in preparing the forecast, said the study will also contribute to emergency preparedness.\n\n\"It allows us to focus our efforts in places that can do the most good,\" Oglesby said. \"It's a snapshot of our current understanding of seismic hazard in California based on the best available science that we can incorporate into such a model.\"\n\nTom Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center and a co-author of the study, said in a statement that while seismic activity in California has been relatively low over the past century, \"we know that tectonic forces are continually tightening the springs of the San Andreas fault system, making big quakes inevitable.\"\n\nScientists have long warned that the southern portion of the San Andreas Fault, which runs through the Coachella Valley, is overdue for a strong earthquake — in part because the last time a big quake hit in this area was around 1690.\n\n\"The southern San Andreas, going through the Coachella Valley and up through the Mojave, is the most likely place in the state to host a large earthquake,\" Field said.\n\nIn the area of Coachella, for instance, the model predicts the likelihood of magnitude-7.0 or larger quake on the southern San Andreas Fault to be 21 percent during the next 30 years. The chances of a magnitude-7.5 or larger quake are estimated at 11 percent.\n\n\"Plate tectonic stresses have really built up beyond where they do on average,\" Field said. \"And so we think that those areas are particularly high in terms of the likelihood of having a large earthquake.\"\n\nIan James can be reached by email at ian.james@desertsun.com and on Twitter @TDSIanJames.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/03/10"}]}

The company's \"57 varieties\" slogan was a key part of its early strategy to attract consumers. It's still featured on Heinz ketchup bottles today and is central to the brand's identity.\n\nBut that famous number is completely made up.\n\nThere weren't 57 Heinz varieties when Pittsburgh business magnate H.J. Heinz first invented the slogan in 1896. Nor when Heinz 57 sauce was introduced soon after. There aren't 57 now. There are, in fact, hundreds of Heinz varieties.\n\nThe 57 on a Heinz bottle is more than just the right spot to smack to make the ketchup ooze out at .028 miles per hour . That number has stuck around for 126 years because it reinforces Heinz as a nostalgic and distinctly American food brand — the condiment you put on your hot dog at a baseball game or on a burger at a summer barbeque, marketing experts say.\n\nIn the early 1890s, H.J. Heinz, once described by a biographer as a \"marketing genius,\" sold bottled horseradish, pickles, pepper sauce, ketchup — introduced by the company in 1876 spelled \"catsup\" and soon changed to \"ketchup\" to distinguish the product — among some 60 food items. Pickles were Heinz's biggest success at the time, and he became known as the \"pickle king.\"\n\nVisiting New York City in 1896, Heinz spotted an advertisement for \"21 styles\" of shoes. He found it memorable and thought attaching a number to his own brand would help it stick with consumers.\n\nA 1902 advertisement for Heinz with the \"57 varieties\" slogan.\n\nThere are varying theories on why he landed on 57.\n\nAshleigh Gibson, Heinz's brand director, said in an email that the company's founder felt there was something \"mystical, magical, and memorable\" about the number 57, which was a combination of five, his lucky number, and seven, his wife's lucky number.\n\nBut Heinz's personal secretary, who wrote an early biography of his boss, said that when Heinz was counting up the number of varieties the company sold in 1896, the number seven jumped out at him.\n\n\"Seven, seven —there are so many illustrations of the psychological influences of that figure and of its alluring significance to people of all ages and races,\" Heinz said, according to the biography . \"58 Varieties or 59 Varieties did not appeal at all to me as being equally strong.\"\n\nWithin a week of seeing the shoe ad, the \"57 varieties'\" slogan was appearing in newspapers and on billboards, Heinz wrote in his diary . The company carved 57 on hillsides for train passengers to see and \"57 Good Things For The Table\" was featured on the first electric billboard in New York City in 1900. The sign stood six stories high, had 1,200 fluorescent light bulbs and included a 43-foot-long flashing Heinz pickle, according to the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation.\n\n\"I myself did not realize how highly successful a slogan it was going to be,\" Heinz said.\n\n'Good luck charm'\n\nToday, \"57 varieties\" is slapped high on the neck of Heinz's octagon-shaped glass tomato ketchup bottles. In the center, \"57 varieties\" is printed in small gold lettering above a hanging tomato vine on the keystone-shaped label modeled after Heinz's home state. 57 is also featured on Heinz's baked beans, mustard, mayonnaise and cream of tomato soup.\n\nThe slogan is used as a branding device to convey a \"sense of timelessness and authenticity\" to consumers, Kelly Haws, a marketing professor who studies consumer choices about food at Vanderbilt University, said in an email.\n\nGibson said the slogan has become \"a brand asset,\" similar to the company's logo, keystone and glass bottle design, reminding consumers of Heinz' history.\n\nHeinz and its association with 57 have also served as minor footnotes in US history.\n\nA magazine advertisement for Heinz ketchup from 1927.\n\nWhen Joe DiMaggio's record hit streak ended at 56 games in 1941, the Yankees star reportedly told a teammate that he missed out on $10,000 promised to him by Heinz if he matched its label.\n\nAccording to \" Demagogue ,\" a 2020 biography of Sen. Joe McCarthy, McCarthy once told a reporter \"probably in jest\" that when he alleged he had a list of 57 names of communists working in the State Department, he came up with the number from a bottle of Heinz ketchup. It's even is a plot point in the 1962 film \"The Manchurian Candidate.\"\n\nThen there's the Heinz 57 sauce for steak, chicken and pork, which was memorialized by Jimmy Buffet's \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\": \"I like mine with lettuce and tomato, Heinz 57 and French fried potatoes.\"\n\nNoel Geoffrey, who led the Heinz ketchup division from 2008 to 2011, said 57 was \"like a good luck charm\" at the company. The telephone number for the main switchboard at its previous headquarters — the Heinz 57 Center— was, of course, 57. In 2001, the company paid the Pittsburgh Steelers $57 million over 20 years for naming rights to the stadium.\n\n\"It was everywhere,\" Geoffrey said, \"and part of the DNA of the company.\"\n\nInnovation in food marketing\n\nIt may seem commonplace today, but the idea of \"57 varieties\" was a significant innovation in food marketing at the time. In the late 19th century, packaged and processed foods were a new concept to the public.\n\n\"The big shift was to try to create a consumer population for pre-packaged food,\" said Rita McGrath, a professor at Columbia Business School who has studied the rise of major food brands. \"Before then, food wasn't marketed.\"\n\nH.J. Heinz also had to convince consumers that his products were safe during an era before food was regulated. One way he tried to convey quality was to sell his goods in glass jars, so customers could see what was inside.\n\nThe orginal purpose of the label on the neck of the Heinz ketchup bottle was to draw more attention to the \"57 varieties\" slogan, according to the Heinz History Center.\n\nHis choice of the word \"variety\" was another attempt to signal that Heinz was experienced in a range of products, suggesting to customers they could trust the brand.\n\n\"Variety has always been a thing Americans love,\" said Ken Albala, a food historian at the University of the Pacific. \"They want choice. Even if it's flavors of the same thing.\"\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, Heinz was America's largest ketchup manufacturer. The brand accounted for roughly 70% of the ketchup market last year, according to Euromonitor data. Hunt's, its closet competitor, had 8%.\n\n'Comfort in the familiar'\n\nThe famous number has stuck around through more than a century of different advertising campaigns and changes to Heinz packaging.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway BRKA Kraft Heinz KHC It also survived different corporate owners. In 2013, Warren Buffett'sand Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital bought H.J. Heinz . Two years later, Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz merged, and the company was renamed\n\n\"There's a comfort in the familiar,\" McGrath said. \"Once you got something like that that sticks, people are reluctant to change because of the brand association.\"\n\nHeinz replaced the pickle with a tomato during a 2009 brand redesign. But \"57 varieties\" stayed.\n\nIn 2009, Heinz changed the design of its ketchup label for the first time in more than 60 years, replacing the Gherkin pickle that was under the words \"tomato ketchup\" with a tomato on the vine. Noel Geoffrey, who oversaw the redesign, said there was never any consideration of removing 57 from the label.\n\nBut Emily Ruby, a curator at the Sen. John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh and author of \"57 Servings from the Heinz Table,\" said she was surprised by the change because Heinz \"stuck so long to these symbols of the past.\"\n\nWhen Kraft and Heinz merged in 2015, there was fear in Pittsburgh about losing the link between Heinz and the city. Kraft Heinz has co-headquarters in Pittsburgh and Chicago.\n\n\"There's a sense the company is no longer tied to the history and the region,\" she said. If Kraft Heinz were to drop the 57, \"I think people would be really upset because they like the connection.\"\n\nWhenever Ruby gives local talks on H.J. Heinz or the history of the company, she is always asked about the origins of the number. People even offer up their own theories about its meaning.\n\n\"There's still a lot of curiosity out there about it,\" Ruby said.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/10/12/baby-aspirin-no-longer-recommended-prevent-first-heart-attack/6103264001/", "title": "Baby aspirin no longer recommended to prevent first heart attack", "text": "People over the age of 60 should no longer consider taking a daily low-dose or baby aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke, according to a draft recommendation issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Tuesday.\n\nThe announcement marks a change in the 2016 Task Force guidance that recommended aspirin therapy in certain men and women to lower cardiovascular risk. But more recent evidence suggests it also could cause harm, including bleeding in the stomach, intestines, and brain – a risk that increases with age and can be life-threatening.\n\nThe task force said people ages 40 to 59 who are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease should decide with their clinician whether to start taking aspirin. Once they turn 60, they should not start taking it because the risk of bleeding cancels the benefits of preventing heart disease.\n\nThe new recommendation only applies to people who are not already taking a daily aspirin. Doctors have long recommended daily low-dose aspirin for many patients who have had a heart attack or stroke. The task force guidance does not change that advice.\n\n“Daily aspirin use may help prevent heart attacks and strokes in some people, but it can also cause potentially serious harms, such as internal bleeding,” said task force member Dr. John Wong, a primary-care expert at Tufts Medical Center. “It’s important that people who are 40 to 59 years old and don’t have a history of heart disease have a conversation with their clinician to decide together if starting to take aspirin is right for them.”\n\nThe task force previously said a daily aspirin also might protect against colorectal cancer for some adults in their 50s and 60s, but the updated guidance says more evidence of such a benefit is needed.\n\nThe guidance was posted online to allow for public comment until Nov. 8. The group will evaluate that input and then make a final recommendation.\n\nThe new recommendations not only stemmed from emerging research suggesting aspirin’s potential harm, but also from advances in cardiovascular treatment, said Dr. Guy L. Mintz, Northwell Health’s director of cardiovascular health and lipidology at Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital.\n\nMore:New treatments offer hope with vaccines for 'interlocking benefits' against COVID-19\n\nMore:She's fought health insurers for years. Now a New Jersey girl's struggles could prompt reform\n\nThere are now better medications for cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes that lower cardiovascular risk, heart failure and improve kidney function, he said. There are also more tools to identify and treat insulin resistance and sleep apnea, as well as smoking cessation, which also affect heart health.\n\n“With all these advances, the need for aspirin in all patients has been negated,” Mintz said. “There is benefit for aspirin use in some patients, and that is why patients on aspirin should not stop their aspirin and consult their doctor.”\n\nHowever, some doctors are confused by the new guidance. What should they tell their patients who have been taking aspirin for a decade and are turning 60, asked Dr. Elizabeth Klodas, a cardiologist and founder of Step One Foods, a meal and snack program.\n\n\"I understand where they're coming from but they're inadvertently creating confusion for practicing physicians,\" she said. \"They really need to address the transition of someone who has been on aspirin because they meet criteria and then they get older. What are we supposed to do?\"\n\nAspirin is best known as a pain reliever but is also a blood thinner that can reduce the chance of blood clots. It also has risks, even at low doses – mainly bleeding in the digestive tract or ulcers, both of which can be life-threatening.\n\nContributing: Associated Press.

A man eating the healthier diet from age 20 could add 13 years to his life.\n\nFocusing on a healthier diet could also lengthen the lives of older adults, the study said. By starting at age 60, a woman could still increase her lifespan by eight years. Men starting a healthier diet at age 60 might add nearly nine years to their lives.\n\nA plant-based eating style could even benefit 80-year-olds, the study said: Men and women could gain about 3.5 years of extra life from dietary changes.\n\n\"The notion that improving diet quality would reduce the risk of chronic disease and premature death is long established, and it only stands to reason that less chronic disease and premature death means more life expectancy,\" said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\nKatz, the president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative , a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine, has published research on how to use food as preventive medicine.\n\nJUST WATCHED 3 easy recipes with ingredients you already have at home Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 3 easy recipes with ingredients you already have at home 02:49\n\n\"What they define as an 'optimal' diet is not quite optimal; it's just a whole lot better than 'typical,'\" Katz said, adding that he felt diet could be \"further improved, conferring even greater benefits.\"\n\n\"My impression is that their 'much improved' diet still allowed for considerable doses of meat and dairy,\" Katz said, adding that when his team scores diet quality objectively, \"these elements are at quite low levels in the top tier.\"\n\nA model of longer life\n\nTo model the future impact of a person's change of diet, researchers from Norway used existing meta-analyses and data from the Global Burden of Disease study , a database that tracks 286 causes of death, 369 diseases and injuries, and 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories around the world.\n\nThe largest gains in longevity were found from eating more legumes, which include beans, peas and lentils; whole grains, which are the entire seed of a plant; and nuts such as walnuts, almonds, pecans and pistachios, the study found.\n\nIt may sound simple to add more plants and grains to your diet, but statistics show that Americans struggle to do so. A new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found few Americans eat close to their daily recommendations of fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe CDC study found that only 12% of adults consume 1½ to 2 cups of fruit each day, which is the amount recommended by the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Only 10% of Americans eat the recommended 2 to 3 cups of vegetables each day, including legumes.\n\nAbout 50% of grain consumption should be whole grains, yet over 95% of Americans fail to meet that goal, according to the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans , instead eating processed grains, which have been milled to remove the grain, bran and many nutrients, including fiber.\n\nOver 50% of Americans fail to eat the 5 grams (about a teaspoon) of recommended nuts and seeds each day, the guidelines said.\n\nNuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains contain more than just protein. They include healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and antioxidant \"phytochemicals\" that have been associated with lower risk of chronic diseases.\n\nRed and processed meats\n\nEating less red and processed meat such as bacon, sausage and preserved deli meats was also linked to longer life.\n\nThat makes good sense: Red and processed meats have been linked to significant health risks, including coronary heart disease and bowel cancer.\n\n\"There's substantial evidence that processed meat can cause bowel cancer -- so much so that the World Health Organization has classified it as carcinogenic since 2015,\" Oxford University epidemiologist Tim Key, a member of the UK Department of Health's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, told CNN in a prior interview\n\nReplacing red and processed meats with lean poultry, fish and plant proteins is one way to improve a diet quickly, experts say.\n\nPlant proteins include soybeans (edamame), chickpeas, lentils and other legumes, tofu, tempeh, nuts, seeds, and whole grains like quinoa. Some vegetables, like broccoli, also contain higher levels of protein.\n\nA 2020 study which tracked more than 37,000 middle-aged Americans found those who ate the most plant protein were 27% less likely to die of any cause and 29% less likely to die of coronary heart disease than people who ate the least amount of plant protein.\n\n\"The benefit is more pronounced when red and processed meats are replaced by plant protein sources,\" study coauthor Dr. Frank Hu, chair of the department of nutrition at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told CNN in a prior interview\n\nHow to improve your diet\n\nTied for silver was the DASH diet, which stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension, and the Flexitarian diet, which encourages being a vegetarian most of the time. All of these diets focus on meals full of fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts and seeds.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/roadwarriorvoices/2016/02/14/was-air-travel-in-the-1970s-really-as-groovy-and-boozy-as-we-remember/83199262/", "title": "Was air travel in the 1970s really as groovy (and boozy) as we ...", "text": "queviv\n\nspecial for USA TODAY\n\nOur multi-stop trip through each decade of the aviation industry is touching down once more in the surprisingly alcohol-fueled 1970s. With the groundbreaking 1930s, the explosive 1940s, the golden 1950s, and the swinging 1960s of the commercial airline industry in our rearview mirrors, let's revisit the decade that brought us \"hostesses in hot pants\" and more liquor than we could ever know what to do with. Grab a Southern Airways shot glass and pour yourself a drink. This was what it was like to fly in the 1970s.\n\n747s in the 70s: On January 21, 1970, Pan Am flew passengers from New York City to London aboard the very first commercial 747 flight. Spiral staircases connected two decks. Widescreen movies were played in the cabins for more than 500 passengers in some configurations. Airlines suddenly had room to breathe, dream and design their wildest ideas. The 747 brought us many things, but the most important of all was possibility.\n\nThe great expense account scheme: Plucky upstart Southwest Airlines was only three years into operations at the turn of the decade, and lacked the infrastructure and scale to compete on price with airlines like Braniff Airways and Texas International, which offered intra-Texas flights from Dallas to Houston for just $13 (About $81 in 2016 when adjusted for inflation). So in one of the industry's savviest ploys ever, Southwest began pairing its $26 tickets for comparable routes with a full-size bottle of premium alcohol to be taken home by the passenger after the flight. Businessmen traveling on company expense accounts flocked to the pricier fares in order to score a bottle of the good stuff, and Southwest cemented its standing as a serious contender.\n\nPopping bottles...in coach: Southern Airways leaned into its southern heritage hard in the 70s, famously billing itself as the \"Route of the Aristocrats\". And while it's hard to imagine an aristocrat booking a travel itinerary with four layovers just to get from one part of Georgia to another, the airline certainly played up one part of Southern society aboard its flights: the free-flowing alcohol. Champagne was served in coach, and passengers were sent home with complimentary shot glasses, of which a new collectible design was released each year. A series of accidents eventually led to the booziest airline's demise in 1979.\n\n\"You can find me in the club...\" Don't think that Southern was the only airline having a blast at 30,000 feet. In the 1970s, the party never stopped. American Airlines removed 60 seats from its Luxury Fleet of 747 jets in order to build a lounge large enough to fit both a piano and a bar that served complimentary cocktails. Continental, on the other hand, equipped its fleet with a flying pub, complete with arcade games and yes, complimentary booze. These celebratory airplane redesigns were largely the result of the industry's longstanding two-drink limit being struck down, freeing passengers to imbibe to their heart's — and liver's — content.\n\nThe Age of Airline Deregulation: In the decades following the Airmail Scandal, government regulation — originally put in place to keep airfares fairly priced and individual routes and destinations from being bombarded with competing, empty flights — had begun to go against its original intention. Numerous case studies showed that unregulated airline startups were able to offer fares lower than the protected legacy carriers. So in 1978, President Jimmy Carter dissolved the Civil Aeronautics Board, and subsequently granted airlines both new and old the powers to set their own fares, decide their own route maps, and learn for themselves what the market might bear.\n\nTwo-tiered pricing takes off: Southwest was positively full of marketing tricks in its early years of operation, but this move might take the cake. The airline's first president, Marion Lamar Muse, offered a reduced rate for relocation flights. Without a lick of advertising, Southwest quietly launched a second-tier ticket price of just $10 on the last flight from Houston to Dallas at the end of the week. The plane, Muse reasoned, had to be in Dallas anyway to kick the following week's flight schedule off, so they might as well try to make a buck while repositioning the plane. It took just two weeks for the route to go from zero passengers to fully booked, at which point Southwest expanded the second-tier scheme to the final flight of every route each day.\n\nMuse's two-tier pricing is heralded as one of the single-most important marketing plays in aviation history, and paved the way for the spread in pricing we see across flights occupying the same route at different times today, as well as the cruise industry's fan-favorite repositioning cruises.\n\nFresh cut flowers (and roast beef!): If it could be cut with a sharp blade, chances are it was cut aboard an airplane in the seventies. Pan Am boasted that hot meals were prepared simultaneously in four different galley kitchens aboard each flight — that is, the parts of the meal that weren't carved to order by the flight attendant in the aisle. Likewise, \"vibration-free\" innovation meant airlines were able to deck out their cabins and powder rooms — the size of your own at home! — with vases full of fresh-cut flowers.\n\nA seat with a view: Few things are more of a let down in life than scoring a \"window seat\" aboard a plane that doesn't actually line up quite right with a window. The average seat pitch — the distance between seats that we commonly refer to as legroom — in the 1970s was 34 inches. This number, as opposed to the 32 or even 28 inches offered by some airlines today, aligned perfectly with the windows of a plane, so that each row was sandwiched exactly between two windows. Airline deregulation may have brought us more competitive prices, but at the cost of seat pitch.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/01/the-20-best-gifts-under-50-of-2018/38333567/", "title": "50 best gifts under $50 2021 - Awesome gift ideas they'll love", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in? Study looks at quality of life across the U.S.\n\n45. Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

A post on social media claims the first president also knew how to party.\n\n“The bar tab of a 1787 farewell party for George Washington was left intact and legible,\" a Jan. 19 Facebook post reads. \"According to the bill, the Founding Fathers drank 54 bottles of Madeira, 60 bottles of Claret, 8 bottles of Whiskey, 22 bottles of Porter, 8 bottles of Hard Cider, 12 of Beer and seven bowls of Alcoholic Punch. There were only 55 attendees.”\n\nThe Facebook post received more than 2,400 likes and 1,900 shares in a day. Another post with the claim on Facebook received more than 16,000 shares.\n\nA binge-drinking Founding Father may sound far-fetched, but the claim is true. Records and historians indicate the tab – from a party that took place days before the signing of the Constitution – was real.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the post for comment.\n\nWashington’s rowdy farewell party\n\nThe bender described in the Facebook post took place in September 1787, near the end of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nOn Sept. 15, after a long day of constitutional framing, Washington headed a few blocks down from Philadelphia’s Independence Hall to the Founding Fathers' go-to gathering spot, City Tavern. He met up with the Light Horse of Philadelphia, a volunteer cavalry corps that crossed the Delaware River with Washington, inspiring an iconic Revolutionary War painting\n\n\"The City Tavern was the place to go, practically every day,\" Gordon Lloyd, a professor emeritus at Pepperdine University, told USA TODAY.\n\nLloyd discovered a summary of Washington's tavern bill that night while digging through Independence Hall documents. According to the bill, the soon-to-be first president and 54 other guests did indeed order 54 bottles of Madeira, 60 bottles of Claret, 8 bottles of whiskey, 8 bottles of cider, 12 bottles of beer and seven “large bowls” of punch.\n\nThat would be about two bottles of wine, several shots and a few cups of punch and beer for every guest.\n\nGeorge Washington's night out:\n\nThe Washington Post reported the night’s tab to be estimated at about 89 pounds, four shillings and two pence – the rough equivalent of $15,400 today.\n\nIn addition to the drinks, the tab included dinner for all 55 guests, fees for broken glasses and meals and drinks for musicians and “servants.”\n\nBut the party might not have been all that much fun for Washington, according to Alexis Coe, historian and author of the Washington biography \"You Never Forget Your First.\"\n\n\"Washington really did not want to be there,\" Coe said of the Constitutional Convention. \"He was happy to provide the stable unifying presence that the founders and framers needed in order to sign the Constitution ... but he was exhausted, he was without his wife – who he really liked to be with – and he knew there was no way she would join him.\"\n\nFact check: Shouting profanity about the president is protected by the First Amendment, legal experts say\n\nThe future president likely didn't let the party get out of control, either.\n\n\"He was famously self-controlled,\" Coe said. \"If anyone had gotten out of hand, if anyone had done more than break a few glasses or made excessive toasts, he would have put them in place.\"\n\nOur rating: True\n\nBased on our research, we rate TRUE the claim that a bill shows a hefty bar tab for an extravagant 1787 party attended by George Washington. Records and historians indicate the tab, estimated to be thousands of dollars today, was real. The party took place Sept. 15, 1787, at City Tavern in Philadelphia.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

We're changing that, and it starts with making sure that rural communities are connected to affordable, reliable high-speed internet,\" White House Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Coordinator Mitch Landrieu said on a call with reporters. \"Thanks to the hard work of the President, (Agriculture Secretary Tom) Vilsack and the team at USDA Rural Development, our administration is providing more than $400 million in loans and grants to fund high-speed internet infrastructure for rural communities this week.\"\n\nMany rural areas across the country lack access to high-speed, affordable internet largely because installing the infrastructure isn't worth the investment for internet service providers to take on. The new projects' funding, which will come through the USDA ReConnect loan and grant program, is aimed at the construction, improvement and acquisition of facilities and equipment to support rural broadband access. Additional announcements for program funding are expected over the course of the summer.\n\nVilsack said that the $401 million in funding that is being announced today will support 20 projects in 11 states -- Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, North Dakota and Texas.\n\n\"This is a tremendous opportunity for us over the course of the next several months to roll out over a billion dollars of investment in connecting people to a better and more modern future,\" he added, highlighting how connectivity will give support farmers, expand access to telemedicine in remote areas and expand access to distance learning opportunities.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/03/dropping-mandates-hiking-stress-opening-stadiums-news-around-states/115522630/", "title": "Dropping mandates, hiking for stress: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Hospitals support an extension of a statewide face mask order, at least until more people become vaccinated against COVID-19, the head of the Alabama Hospital Association said Monday. Gov. Kay Ivey is expected to announce this week whether she will extend the face covering mandate and other health orders that are set to expire Friday. A spokeswoman for the governor expressed optimism about state coronavirus numbers. “All along, Gov. Ivey has made clear that she prefers personal responsibility to government mandates. We are optimistic that our state is heading in the right direction, and we still have some work to be done,” Gina Maiola said Monday. Alabama, like much of the nation, has seen a significant drop in daily COVID-19 cases, but medical officials cautioned that the virus has not gone away, and uncertainty remains about the impact of emerging variants and upcoming events like spring break gatherings. “It just seems to me until we get more people vaccinated, the most prudent thing to do is to stay the course and continue to try to drive these numbers down, especially because we are still worried about the U.K. variant and the South African variant,” said Dr. Don Williamson, the former state health officer who now heads the Alabama Hospital Association.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state Department of Health and Social Services has reported fewer than 100 influenza cases during this flu season, down from close to 400 cases at this time last year. While 13 state residents died with the flu last season, so far this season, only two flu deaths have been recorded in Alaska, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The 2018-19 flu season yielded almost 12 times more flu cases in the state compared to the ongoing 2020-21 season, said Carrie Edmonson, a state nurse epidemiologist who compiles the state’s weekly “flu snapshot” report. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that influenza was associated with 38 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths across the country. “This is the lowest flu season we’ve had on record,” according to a surveillance system that is about 25 years old, said Lynnette Brammer of the CDC. Health officials such as Edmonson have said that public health orders aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus have also prevented the flu from spreading. Officials also attribute the flu’s decline to less influenza testing and increased flu vaccinations, the newspaper reports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey and state health officials have announced a new hybrid approach that provides residents 55 and older eligibility along with front-line essential workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The state Department of Health Services opened 50,000 appointments Tuesday at two state-run sites – State Farm Stadium in Glendale and Phoenix Municipal Stadium – for the lowered age eligibility group. “As more vaccine reaches Arizona, we will continue refining our plan to maximize the benefits of this still-limited resource,” state health director Dr. Cara Christ said in a statement. “Moving to a hybrid approach will allow us to rapidly and efficiently administer the vaccine and provide all Arizonans with a clearer estimate of when they will be eligible to be vaccinated.” Since vaccine distribution began in December, authorities said more than 1.8 million doses have been administered, and about 600,000 Arizonans have received both shots. Meanwhile, Arizona’s COVID-19 death toll surpassed 16,000 on Tuesday as the state reported 81 additional deaths and 849 additional confirmed infection cases, the fewest daily new cases in three months.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Republican lawmakers on Monday proposed overhauling the state’s Medicaid expansion to encourage recipients to work after Arkansas’ work requirement was halted by the courts and President Joe Biden’s administration. Proposed legislation would continue using Medicaid funds to place recipients on private health insurance, but those who don’t work or go to school could be moved to the traditional fee-for-service Medicaid program. More than 300,000 people are currently on the state’s Medicaid expansion. “No one loses health care benefits, but there are incentives to encourage that kind of behavior and that kind of progress in life,” the Republican governor said at a news conference. The work requirement had been approved in 2018 by former President Donald Trump’s administration, and thousands had lost coverage before it was halted. “These dollars are essential to keeping our rural hospitals and our health care infrastructure intact and stabilized,” said Republican Sen. Missy Irvin, a sponsor of the legislation. The proposal includes other changes, including a home-visiting program for at-risk moms and a new program to connect young adults in targeted populations such as veterans and former foster children with community organizations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Indoor dining, movie theaters and gyms in the city can reopen within 24 hours, an upbeat Mayor London Breed announced Tuesday as the county officially moved into a less-restrictive tier of the state’s coronavirus strategy. San Francisco and Santa Clara counties in the Bay Area join five other counties in moving to the second-most restrictive operating tier. Much of the state’s population remains in the most restrictive purple tier. “This is the beginning of a new day in San Francisco,” Breed said from Pier 39, an area popular with tourists in picturesque Fisherman’s Wharf. But she warned residents to wear masks and maintain proper social distance even as she encouraged them to explore the city. “When your waiter walks up to your table, put your mask on. When you go to the restroom, put your mask on,” she said. Business activity in San Francisco shut down in early December after several Bay Area counties preemptively went into lockdown. Outdoor dining, outdoor museums, and some indoor and outdoor personal services reopened in late January after the state called off its regional stay-home order, but the economic toll has been grim. Rents plummeted as tech workers who could work from anywhere fled for cheaper homes with more elbow room. Tourism has also been dealt a massive blow.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state has passed its goal of getting 75% of teachers and child care workers a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine by March5. The Colorado State Joint Information Center said Monday afternoon that as of its latest estimates, almost 78% of the 120,000 eligible teachers and child care workers had received a first dose. Pre-K through 12th grade teachers and child care workers were first eligible for the vaccine Feb. 8. At a late January press conference announcing their eligibility, Gov. Jared Polis said all teachers who wanted a vaccine would get one within a three-week period. Polis later said the goal was for 75% of those eligible to have a first dose by March 5. The Colorado State Joint Information Center said the state calculates its percentage based on updates from school districts provided to the Colorado Department of Education. Among educators, just pre-K through 12th grade teachers, support staff and child care workers are currently eligible for the vaccine. Polis announced Friday that student-facing staff in community colleges and universities will be eligible for vaccines when the state moves to Phase 1.B4, likely at the end of March.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A package of tax changes, including a plan to prevent 110,000 commuters with out-of-state jobs from being double-taxed because they’ve been working at home during the pandemic, received final legislative approval Monday. The bill, which also includes provisions to help welfare recipients with liens on their properties and to steer more funding to communities with nontaxable property, cleared the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 28-7. The legislation, which already passed in the House of Representatives, now awaits Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s signature. Supporters of the bill, including senators in the western portion of the state, said it was unfair that many of their constituents who work in New York faced the prospect of having to pay both Connecticut and New York income tax when they were working from home during the pandemic. The issue also affects Connecticut residents who work in neighboring Massachusetts. “These commuters have not benefited from New York services over the last year,” said Sen. Will Haskell, D-Westport, noting that many have “not stepped foot” in New York since many employers told workers to stay home. The underlying issue is ultimately expected to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: With typical getaway options limited due to COVID-19, many have turned to camping for a safe, socially distanced vacation. Delaware state campgrounds reopened in June with new precautions like increased sanitation and masks required for children kindergarten-age and older. Stephanie Sanford didn’t camp much before the pandemic, but she’s recently planned several trips and found them to be a great antidote to pandemic-related anxieties. She has since been encouraging friends and family to turn to the outdoors as a way to process and relieve the stress of COVID-19. “I remember just feeling so alleviated from this pressure that was mounting from being a mom, being a wife, being a teacher in the house,” she said. The quiet of the outdoors, Sanford said, “really puts your mind at ease.” She has even gotten her friends to join her on her outdoor trips by starting a group called Black Girls Hike Too, which now has more than 1,000 followers. Amid the disproportionate impact of pandemic-related stress and anxiety on Black women, Sanford strongly urged friends and family to challenge the idea that the outdoors wasn’t for them.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The process to book a vaccine appointment has become so strenuous that some are concerned it could create even more hesitancy among residents who are already skeptical or don’t have the technical experience or means, WUSA-TV reports. Katie Wall-Mansen, fearing technical hurdles to sign up online might be pushing more people away, started the group DC Vaccine Coalition in January after reading many comments on neighborhood-based social network Nextdoor about how confusing it was, especially for older citizens, to reserve a slot. “I fear we’re actually creating a new form of vaccine hesitancy, and that’s been so difficult for people to register for a vaccine that I understand people’s plight and that they may sit back and not want to do this again,” Wall-Mansen said. Her group has grown to include about 50 volunteers working to make the process easier by finding appointments online. They start by looking at avenues outside the DC Health portal system to find availability at hospitals or community clinics. Wall-Mansen said volunteers keep a resident’s information populated to quickly enter it into the system, use different browsers simultaneously and ensure they’re on the call line when appointments become available. “We organized chaos, but we are in and willing,” she said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis reflected as much on the past year as on his priorities for 2021 during a State of the State address Tuesday that touted his response to the coronavirus pandemic. DeSantis, a staunch opponent to lockdowns and business restrictions, said Florida is in much better shape than other states because it is open for business. “While so many other states kept locking people down over these many months, Florida lifted people up,” DeSantis said. “Florida’s schools are open, and we are one of only a handful of states in which every parent has a right to send their child to school in person. All Floridians have a right to earn a living, and our citizens are employed at higher rates than those in the nation as a whole. Every job is essential.” DeSantis’ speech marked the first day of the 2021 legislative session. Ironically, while he was talking about keeping the state open, the Capitol was closed to the public because of the pandemic. DeSantis credited his refusal to return to shutdowns and business restrictions for Florida being in a better financial situation than forecasters predicted last year. “Economic lockdowns are a luxury of the largely affluent Zoom class. Many Floridians can’t do their jobs over a computer. They need to show up,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: More than 2 million Georgians have received at least the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but the numbers of positive cases and community transmission remain high. The state’s confirmed coronavirus case count rose by 1,214 since Sunday to reach 819,730 on Monday, while the statewide death toll rose by 80 to reach 15,148, according to figures posted Monday afternoon by the Georgia Department of Public Health. As of Monday, the state had administered 2,060,352 doses of COVID-19 vaccine for a rate of 19,388 vaccines administered per 100,000 Georgians, as reported by the state’s new vaccine dashboard. Of Georgia’s 56,089 confirmed COVID-19 cases in patients who were hospitalized when the case was reported to DPH or when interviewed, 50 patients included in that total were added Monday.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Maui Health plans to increase the number of first-dose COVID-19 vaccination appointments it offers, while Kauai has widened the availability of vaccine doses. The nonprofit health care organization for Maui and Lanai said it will raise the number of weekly vaccines to 3,000 beginning this week and 4,000 next week, The Maui News reports. Maui Health was nearing completion of appointments that were rescheduled after clinics closed in January because of vaccine shortages, spokeswoman Tracy Dallarda said late last week. Maui Health opened a satellite vaccine clinic Wednesday at a Kaiser Permanente facility in Kihei that will operate Wednesdays and Fridays by appointment. “What we’re trying to do is really ramp up the number of appointments that we can take,” Dallarda said. The County of Kauai has opened its vaccine distribution to residents 75 and over, The Garden Island reports. The island’s clinics previously focused on vaccinating front-line essential workers. The Hawaii State Department of Health said 59% of Kauai residents in the older age bracket had received at least one dose of a vaccine.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s suicide rate dropped steeply before the pandemic, but the trend may have reversed in 2020, according to federal data. Idaho had the biggest drop of any state from 2018 to 2019, according to the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nearly 15% decline in Idaho meant 52 fewer suicides in 2019 compared to the previous year. “Some of the efforts that we had made were starting to show,” said George Austin of the Idaho Suicide Prevention Hotline, referring to statewide efforts to raise awareness and reduce stigma around asking for help. The drop in suicides came after Idaho’s worst reported year for suicide deaths in 2018. Idaho’s 2019 figures still put the state in the top 10 in the U.S. for age-adjusted suicide rates. Based on preliminary data, 2020 may be worse than Idaho’s 2018 peak, Boise State Public Radio reports. Austin said that could be due in large part to the pandemic, which has caused isolation, job loss, death of loved ones and relationship difficulties.\n\nIllinois\n\nChampaign: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it has authorized the emergency use of a coronavirus saliva test developed by the University of Illinois. Despite the lack of FDA approval until Monday, officials said the test, known as covidSHIELD, has been used more than 1.5 million times at the university’s campuses in Urbana, Springfield and Chicago. University officials also said that because the test had been properly lab-certified, dozens of organizations around the world were sold the test. In a statement, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the emergency-use authorization unlocks federal COVID-19 funding to provide 1 million tests to public universities in Illinois. “Even as we lead large-population states in vaccinations, widespread testing remains a critical tool in combating this pandemic, and I’m dedicating $20 million in CARES Act funding to provide 1 million tests to Illinois’ other public universities under the FDA’s emergency use authorization,” Pritzker said in a statement. There has been interest from school systems, universities and corporations in using the test because the process is less invasive that the nose-swab method, and results can be obtained within 24 hours.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Residents ages 55 to 60 are now eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, health officials announced Tuesday in the latest expansion of the state’s vaccine rollout. The Indiana Department of Health said the expansion is the first step in making the free shots available to the nearly 858,000 Hoosiers in their 50s. Indiana’s vaccine eligibility pool had previously included people age 60 and older, health care workers, long-term care residents and first responders. Additional groups will be added as more vaccine becomes available, officials said. The state’s current vaccine distribution plan indicates Hoosiers ages 50 to 55 are next in line to receive shots, although there are no specific timelines in place for when new eligibility expansions will take effect. The state health department also announced the opening of three mass vaccination sites through partnerships with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the University of Notre Dame and Ivy Tech Community College in Sellersburg. A fourth mass vaccination site is being planned in Gary, officials said. The clinics will offer the Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine, which was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Saturday. To schedule a vaccine, Hoosiers can visit ourshot.in.gov and select a location from one of nearly 400 clinics around the state.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Meatpackers will be vaccinated this week as newly approved shots from Johnson & Johnson arrive. The Iowa Department of Public Health announced Monday that the state will receive 33,400 doses of the single-shot vaccine among the 100,000 shots it’s getting this week and will send the new version to communities with a large numbers of workers in the food, agricultural, distribution and manufacturing sectors “who have been disproportionally affected by the virus.” Meatpacking workers, at the center of the state’s largest initial COVID-19 outbreaks last spring, will get vaccines beginning Wednesday at Tyson Foods’ Waterloo and Perry plants. The company said employees in Columbus Junction, Council Bluffs, Independence and Storm Lake will receive shots later in the week. JBS announced that its Marshalltown employees will get the shots Friday, and its Ottumwa workers will get vaccinated March 12. Both Tyson and JBS are offering incentives to workers to get the shot, with Tyson giving four hours’ pau to workers who have to come in on a day off and JBS offering a $100 bonus. Five Republicans have introduced a bill in the Legislature that includes a ban on extra payments for workers receiving the vaccine, contending companies should not treat workers differently based on willingness to be vaccinated.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local hospital has raised its minimum hourly wage to $15. The University of Kansas Health System said in a news release that the change will be reflected in paychecks beginning Friday. The announcement came nearly a year into a global pandemic that has hit hospital staffs around the country particularly hard and as President Joe Biden’s administration has been pushing for an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The hospital has not laid off or furloughed staff during the pandemic, it said in the release, adding that hourly employees who were already making $15 per hour or more also saw increases to account for experience and responsibility-based pay differences. “This pay increase is another step to support frontline workers and the critical role they play in providing care in our communities,” the release said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Legislation that would provide broad protections to shield businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits won approval from the state Senate after a long debate Monday evening. Republican Senate President Robert Stivers described the measure as a necessary step to help businesses recover from pandemic-related setbacks without the fear of potential virus-related lawsuits. “We cannot afford to put another straw on that camel’s back that may break it,” said Stivers, the bill’s lead sponsor. “Because many are already broken, we don’t need to see any more become broken because they are in fear of litigation.” The proposal passed the chamber on a 24-11 vote and now goes to the House, which passed its version of virus-related liability protections for businesses in January. Republicans dominate both chambers and will try to reach agreement on a final version before this year’s session ends in late March. The Senate measure ran into resistance from some lawmakers who said it’s too broadly written and favors some Kentuckians over others. Republican Sen. Phillip Wheeler said the bill “devalues certain lives” by “creating a class of people who are protected and sacrificing other people who don’t receive protections but yet may be injured by the actions of the protected class.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Bars can reopen indoors, restaurants can hold more customers, and churches won’t have capacity limits for worship services, under loosened coronavirus rules announced Tuesday by Gov. John Bel Edwards. The eased Phase 3 restrictions – which come as Louisiana’s new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have continued to drop – will take effect Wednesday across the state, unless a local mayor or parish president enacts tougher limits. A statewide mask mandate in place since July will remain. The new requirements will stay in place until March 31. “We’re currently moving in the right direction and have been for several weeks now, and certainly we’re all gratified by that,” the Democratic governor said. “We know, however, we still have a lot of work to do before we get out of this pandemic.” Restaurants, cafes, spas, salons, movie theaters and other nonessential businesses that had been limited to 50% of their occupancy limit can move to 75% capacity. The exception is for gyms, which Edwards is requiring to stay at 50% capacity. Music will be allowed at indoor locations again, though with a long list of requirements for venues from the fire marshal’s office and no dance floors allowed. Conferences and other gatherings can restart at convention centers, if the events get fire marshal approval.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A new emergency rental assistance program designed to help tenants has started accepting applications. MaineHousing said the program launched Monday and is funded by the federal coronavirus stimulus package that passed in December and provided $200 million in rental assistance funding to the state. The agency said the program allows applicants to apply for funds to cover rent and utilities owed back to March 13, 2020. Saying it expects high demand at the beginning of the program, MaineHousing is asking tenants and landlords to communicate in advance of applying. Daniel Brennan, director of MaineHousing, said tenants are in need of the assistance. “We are all living under the direction to stay ‘safe at home.’ We need to make sure that every Mainer has a stable home for themselves and their families,” he said. Meanwhile, city officials said an updated outdoor dining and retail permitting program will be in effect from April 2021 to April 2022. Portland officials said in a statement that the program will allow retailers and restaurants to “apply to expand into public spaces, including closed streets, parklets, the public right-of-way, and parks.” City Manager Jon Jennings said the changes will allow businesses to operate safely for the coming year.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Officials announced a plan Monday to improve equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in Baltimore amid continuing criticism about the state’s rollout, particularly in its largest city. The Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital – a public-private partnership of the state health department, the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Medicine – will put an emphasis on vaccinating the most vulnerable communities in Baltimore, Gov. Larry Hogan’s office announced. Leadership at the field hospital has been working closely with hospital-based community health teams to encourage eligible individuals who live in high-vulnerability ZIP codes to register for vaccinations, the governor’s office said. Meanwhile, lawmakers on a panel holding weekly hearings on Maryland’s vaccine rollout continued to criticize aspects of it. Sen. Mary Washington, D-Baltimore, asked the acting health secretary, Dennis Schrader, about a comment the governor made last week that Baltimore had received more vaccine than the city was “entitled to,” and she asked Schrader how he planned to address “the negative damage” caused by Hogan’s comment that outraged city officials. Schrader said Washington was asking him a political question, and he was staying focused “on process and facts.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Residents have increasingly been going online during the COVID-19 crisis to purchase nearly everything under the sun – including alcohol. State alcohol regulators have seen a 300% uptick in direct-to-consumer alcohol deliveries throughout the pandemic, state Treasurer Deborah Goldberg said during a virtual hearing on the state budget Tuesday. Under state law, a direct wine shipper may send up to 12 cases of wine per year to a Massachusetts resident. As treasurer, Goldberg oversees the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, which helps enforce liquor laws and has also been enforcing the state’s COVID-19 protocols. Since last August, inspectors visited more than 21,000 licensed alcohol businesses in the state and found 98% in compliance with Gov. Charlie Baker’s pandemic-related executive orders, Goldberg said. The Democrat also oversees the state lottery, which she said took a hit in the early months of the pandemic. Overall sales last March, April and May fell by a combined $244 million compared to the same period in 2019. “Since then, our revenues have stabilized and improved,” said Goldberg, who also said the use of contactless payment options has soared during the pandemic, and the lottery also needs to have the flexibility to expand cashless transactions.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday announced the further loosening of Michigan’s coronavirus restrictions, easing capacity limits in restaurants and a host of other businesses while also allowing for larger indoor and outdoor gatherings. The revised state health department order takes effect Friday. The Democratic governor also said families will be able to visit nursing homes after being tested for the coronavirus. Restaurants and bars, now limited to 25% capacity inside, will have a 50% restriction. A 10 p.m curfew will shift to 11 p.m. Venues such as movie theaters, bowling alleys, banquet halls and casinos will have higher capacity limits, too.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: More than 45,000 doses of the newly approved Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine should arrive this week, state health officials said Monday. Minnesota Department of Health spokesman John Schadl said the order for the first shipment of the single-dose vaccine was placed Sunday night. It usually takes a couple of days for processing and shipping, he said. “More doses of safe and effective vaccine in the state means more people can get protected more quickly,” the Health Department said in a release Monday. “The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a game-changer that will help us quickly provide immunity to even more Minnesotans.” Last week, Gov. Tim Walz said the state plans on vaccinating 70% of seniors in the state with at least one dose by the end of March before expanding vaccine eligibility. He said it could be done in less time with the new vaccine. “That was not factored in, and again the good thing on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is it’s one dose,” Walz said. Health officials on Monday confirmed 636 new COVID-19 cases and three new deaths, increasing the state’s totals to 485,230 positive tests and 6,486 fatalities since the start of the pandemic.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said as of Wednesday, he is getting rid of most mask mandates that he had imposed to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. He is also lifting most other restrictions, including limits on seating in restaurants. “The governor’s office is getting out of the business of telling people what they can and cannot do,” the Republican governor said during a news conference Tuesday. Until now, most of Mississippi’s 82 counties had been under a mask mandate for months. Reeves said the number of people hospitalized because of the virus has decreased in recent weeks, and vaccination numbers are increasing. Reeves said rules for K-12 schools are not changing. Schools will still require masks where social distancing is not possible. There are also still limits on seating at K-12 school events: 25% capacity indoors and 50% outdoors. The new capacity for seating at indoor arenas for colleges is 50%. Club areas in arenas are limited to 75% of their seating capacity. Reeves said he is encouraging mask-wearing but not requiring it and is asking people to follow recommendations from the state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs. Dobbs said it’s still a good idea for people to avoid large, unmasked gatherings. “There’s no way in heck I would go sit in a crowded bar right now,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Residents wouldn’t have to repay millions of dollars in federal unemployment benefit overpayments under legislation advanced in the GOP-led state House on Monday. At issue are mistakes by the state’s Labor Department as it was struggling to quickly handle a huge influx of unemployment claims during the coronavirus pandemic. The agency ended up doling out $146 million to 46,000 Missourians who didn’t qualify. Now Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is trying to get those overpayments back. Republican bill sponsor Rep. J. Eggleston said many of the workers who got the federal aid spent already spent it on rent, mortgage payments, utilities and other needs and don’t have the money to repay the government. “What the financial recipients thought was a lifeline of survival has now become an anchor of debt,” he said. The House bill, given initial approval in a voice vote, would stop the state from collecting federal unemployment overpayments. The measure would only give amnesty to people who applied for unemployment help in good faith and received it because of a mistake by the state Labor Department. People who committed fraud would still have to pay the federal funding back. Missourians also would still be on the hook to repay unemployment aid received from the state.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: The Blackfeet Nation on Tuesday began offering COVID-19 vaccines to people 18 and older. The tribe is holding two clinics this week. The Blackfeet Community Hospital is offering vaccines Tuesday through Friday, and the Southern Piegan Clinic was offering immunizations Tuesday. Both said they were accepting walk-ins, but vaccinations at the hospital can also be scheduled by appointment. The tribe expects to receive a shipment of the new Johnson and Johnson vaccines next week. The tribe on Monday reported eight active coronavirus cases on the reservation and has recorded 1,383 total cases since March. Forty-seven tribal members have died from the respiratory illness caused by the virus. More than half of Blackfeet Reservation’s 10,000 residents have received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the tribe’s Public Information Officer Jim McNeely. “We’re moving along quite fast – faster than we expected,” said McNeely, who credits the successful vaccine rollout to the state and the Indian Health Service. “At the rate we’re going, it may be possible for our community to be fully vaccinated by mid-May.” He said the Blackfeet Nation is still encouraging people to get tested for the coronavirus by offering incentives at test sites, including food, cleaning supplies and gift cards.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: More than 84,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered across the state last week. As of Sunday, more than 428,031 doses have been given to those in Phase 1 priority groups, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Additionally, as of Sunday more than 145,000 Nebraskans have completed vaccinations, which represents 9.8% of Nebraskans 16 and older. For more information and to register for a vaccine, residents can visit Finish Strong Nebraska, the state’s official vaccination campaign, at FinishStrong.Ne.Gov. Once registered on the portal, Nebraska residents will be notified when COVID-19 vaccination begins in their area. A Spanish translation of the website is also available. As of Monday, more than 220,409 Nebraskans have registered to receive the vaccine at vaccinate.ne.gov.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Officials are preparing to cede decision-making power over the state’s coronavirus measures to county officials. In the five rural counties that have passed resolutions condemning the restrictions, it’s unclear how much will change. “We just plan to continue as we’ve been. We want to be smart, but we want to protect freedom. In the resolution we passed, we give businesses restrictions as they see fit,” White Pine County Commissioner Ian Bullis said of the state’s plan to let counties control some guidelines starting May 1. To prevent deaths and keep hospitals from reaching capacity, Nevada has limited the number of people who can gather at places like churches, casinos and restaurants. Officials have mandated face coverings and, for most of the past year, not allowed conventions, trade shows and live entertainment. The restrictions, though not as stringent as those in some neighboring states, have stirred up anger in rural counties suspicious of government overreach, prompted debate about the extent of the governor’s powers and raised questions about consistent enforcement of coronavirus containment measures. In November, White Pine County became the first of five counties to declare an economic state of emergency rebuffing Gov. Steve Sisolak’s containment measures.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New businesses that opened just in time to be slammed by the coronavirus pandemic would be eligible for more help under a bill before a state Senate committee Tuesday. The state distributed more than $400 million in federal funding through its Main Street Relief Fund for small businesses, but only those that were established before May 26, 2019, were eligible. “This cut out a large segment of new small businesses which fill new needs in our communities and create the most new jobs at a time when they were really struggling,” said Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, D-Portsmouth. Her bill would remove the cutoff date for future funding. “The newer the business, the more critical supporting it is,” she told the Senate Commerce Committee. Lizabeth Tompkins had worked at the Puttin’ on the Glitz boutique in Portsmouth for several years before becoming the owner in September 2019. While she was able to get a loan to help recover from being shut down for three months during the pandemic, she wasn’t eligible for the grant funding. “I don’t like asking for help. That’s not how I got here, but this is my only source of income,” she said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: NJ Transit will receive 300 vaccines this week to distribute to its front-line workers at the agency’s vaccination sites in Maplewood and Camden thanks to an agreement struck with the state Department of Health. The vaccine will be available to NJ Transit workers who are currently eligible – including those 65 and older, those with chronic medical conditions and smokers – but have not gotten it yet. The workers must also be customer-facing employees, such as bus operators, ticket collectors, train conductors and police officers. Eligible agency employees can begin signing up for appointments Wednesday, and the first doses will be given Thursday in Maplewood and Friday in Camden. “We are grateful to the DOH for providing 300 doses,” NJ Transit spokesman Jim Smith wrote in an email. “We feel this is a great opportunity to initiate the vaccination process for eligible transit workers.” NJ Transit, which employs nearly 12,000 people, became an approved state vaccine distributor in January after securing freezers, getting its two vaccination sites set up and developing its own appointment system.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state Senate has advanced a bill that would require public schools to extend the academic calendar next year in an effort to help students catch up from the loss of learning during the pandemic. If passed, the bill would stretch the school calendar next year by 25 days for K-5 students and 10 days for most 6-12 schools by requiring them to participate in extended learning programs already paid for by the Legislature. Schools had been slow to embrace the programs, citing staffing issues, despite the fact that more work would increase teacher take-home pay by 6% to 14% depending on the grade level. Then the programs were canceled because of the pandemic. “Extending the school year is shown to be one of the best things you can do for student achievement,” said Democratic bill sponsor President Pro Tem Sen. Mimi Stewart, citing legislative research that drove the passage of the programs in 2019. The mandate for next year would only take effect if Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s current health order curbing in-person schooling is lifted, and it would only last for the 2021-2022 school year. On the other side of the Capitol Complex, the House is considering a measure that would allow for longer school days to use the funds without extending the school calendar.\n\nNew York\n\nOlean: St. Bonaventure University President Dennis DePerro died Monday from complications of COVID-19, according to the university. He was 62. DePerro was hospitalized since late December after testing positive for the coronavirus on Christmas Eve. The university said it’s unknown how he contracted it. He had been on a ventilator since mid-January. “Words simply can’t convey the level of devastation our campus community feels right now,” said Joseph Zimmer, provost and vice president for Academic Affairs. Zimmer was named acting president of the private Franciscan university late last month in DePerro’s absence. The university flag will fly at half-staff through the end of March on the western New York campus, where the spring semester began Jan. 25 with about 85% of classes taking place in person. DePerro became president June 1, 2017, and implemented new strategies that increased freshmen enrollment. He launched the “A Bolder Bonaventure” capital campaign to fund the university’s School of Health Professions and last year reconstituted a presidential commission to improve diversity, equity and inclusion on campus. “What I’ll miss more than anything was his uncanny ability to make you feel better even on your worst days. He had a unique gift,” university spokesman Tom Missel said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper announced Tuesday that the state will more quickly open up COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to those who are front-line essential workers or have serious underlying health issues. The state had been set to allow a broad group of workers ranging from mail carriers to elected officials to begin receiving vaccines March 10. But with approval of a single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine and more than 80,000 doses arriving soon, public health officials will now allow front-line workers to get shots starting Wednesday – a week earlier than anticipated. Meanwhile, North Carolinians under 65 with high-risk medical conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness if they become infected with the virus will become eligible March 24. “We’ll open group 4 first to people with medical conditions that put them at a higher risk for severe risk to COVID-19 illness,” Cooper said in a news conference. “The third vaccine and improving vaccine supply of the two we already are getting will help us get more people vaccinated more quickly.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is rolling out another round of grants to help communities prevent suicides, and state officials say there’s more urgency with this funding, given the pandemic and its added stresses for many residents. The Department of Human Services’ Behavioral Health Division will award $750,000, to be shared by up to 19 community groups, local and tribal governments and nonprofits to develop or increase suicide-prevention strategies. While more people already may have reached out for help, division director Pamela Sagness said history shows that for others, it can take longer for the effects of a crisis to surface. “This is the time for us to be gearing up to really not only support individuals that are already feeling the mental health impact but those that will potentially be feeling those impacts for several years,” she said. The deadline for groups to apply for grant funding is Friday. Sagness said the most recent state data, from last spring, found nearly 70% of respondents reported an increase in mental health struggles. Nationally, the group Mental Health America reported nearly 180,000 Americans had frequent thoughts of suicide and self-harm last year – the largest number in its reporting history.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An outdated reporting system that led to the undercount of more than 4,200 COVID-19 deaths will now be retired, the state’s health department director said Tuesday. The Ohio Department of Health will retire the manual system it used to provide a real-time death toll from the pandemic over the past year after a breakdown in the system led to a massive adjustment last month to the documented death toll. “We have been building the plane as we fly it,” Health Director Stephanie McCloud said Tuesday. “And unfortunately, we weren’t given all new parts to build it well. We did not have time to stop the plane to land it, get the new parts that we need and then take off again.” The department was switching Tuesday to relying exclusively on a slower but more reliable and accurate system to count virus-related deaths, McCloud said. The agency had used this slower process as a quality check to reconcile the data from the manual system that failed. The slower system is based on death certificates sent to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s infectious diseases database, which are confirmed as COVID-19 deaths before being added to the state’s database. The shift will result in only confirmed deaths being listed every few days instead of probable deaths listed daily.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association said Tuesday that he is encouraged and happy that the State Department of Health will begin using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 death reports, which show about 2,500 more deaths due to the coronavirus than the department has reported. “As physicians we want to make sure that these numbers are accurate and timely, and certainly one of the best ways to look at COVID deaths is to look at death certificate information,” which is prepared by doctors and used by the CDC to report deaths, said Dr. George Monks. “I was encouraged by … our state epidemiologist, that he addressed that issue, that there was a big discrepancy.” State epidemiologist Dr. Jared Taylor said Monday that the state health department would begin work to present the death toll reported by the CDC National Center for Health Statistics. “The difference in death counts is that the CDC values they are citing are derived from death certificates,” Taylor said. “OSDH counts are derived from people who are first diagnosed as COVID positive, then die, and we do a full investigation” into the cause of the death.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State health officials said Monday that they expect to receive 34,000 doses of the newly approved Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine this week. The two vaccines that Oregon has had on hand – Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna – both have reported efficacy rates around 95%, require two doses and need ultra-cold storage. Johnson & Johnson’s is a single-dose vaccine and can be stored in a refrigerator for months but has a lower efficacy rate. “Having access to a third highly effective COVID-19 vaccine is a game changing development for Oregonians,” said Paul Cieslak, the medical director for communicable diseases and immunization for the Oregon Health Authority. “We believe this vaccine is effective against the virus, and a one-dose regimen will allow us to vaccinate more Oregonians more quickly.” For the past month, health officials have reiterated that although the vaccine supply is increasing, it’ll take time for everyone who wants to be vaccinated to move through the process. As of Monday, people who are 65 years and older became eligible to receive doses of the vaccine, joining other elderly residents, people in long-term care facilities, adults in custody, educators and health care workers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Fans will soon return to pro sports venues whose stands have been empty for a year or more after the state on Monday eased restrictions on large gatherings to reflect a sustained slide in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Under the relaxed gathering limits announced by Gov. Tom Wolf, outdoor venues are now allowed to host events up to 20% of their maximum capacity, while indoor occupancy will be 15% of maximum capacity, regardless of venue size. The Pittsburgh Penguins said the ice hockey team would allow 2,800 fans into PPG Paints Arena for Tuesday’s game against the Philadelphia Flyers. It will be the Pens’ first home game with fans since a victory over Montreal on March 8, 2020. Pittsburgh Pirates President Travis Williams said opening day at PNC Park “will be much more than a game. It will mark a significant step in overcoming this pandemic.” In Philadelphia, the Wells Fargo Center said it would quickly allow fans into Flyers and 76ers games if city officials give the go-ahead.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city has received permission from state health officials to start vaccine registrations for residents 50 and older who live in the hardest-hit neighborhoods, the mayor announced Tuesday. Those eligible will get their vaccinations at neighborhood clinics, Mayor Jorge Elorza and City Council President Sabina Matos said in a statement. “The city is working closely with the Rhode Island Department of Health and community partners to reach residents in communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19,” Elorza said. State-run mass vaccination sites and retail pharmacies will continue vaccinating eligible residents 65 or older. The city’s Clinica Esperanza has been granted authority to vaccinate residents 18 and older provided they also help register and bring an older adult 65 or older to be vaccinated, they said, but only if they live in certain hard-hit ZIP codes within the city. Clinica Esperanza primarily serves the city’s immigrant communities and saw a coronavirus positivity rate of 23% at the clinic in February. Appointments are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Vaccines are available to all eligible residents of any immigration status. Eligible residents can sign up on the city’s registration portal.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The majority of the state’s residents will be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine starting next week, officials announced Tuesday. The state will move to Phase 1B of its vaccine plan beginning Monday, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news conference. Teachers, grocery store employees and people with certain medical conditions can sign up for appointments then. Officials estimate 2.7 million people will be newly eligible for the vaccine in the state with a population of about 5 million. People 55 and older and those with increased risk for severe COVID-19, including people with certain developmental disabilities and individuals with medical conditions such as heart disease or sickle cell disease, will become eligible. Front-line employees who work in-person jobs that put them at increased risk of exposure also will be eligible. Those workers include day care and grocery store employees, manufacturing workers, and law enforcement officers. People who meet the age requirement can show vaccine providers an identification card, South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control Director Dr. Edward Simmer said. Otherwise, providers will have to rely on the honesty of South Carolinians who attest that they meet one of the other qualifications. “Please don’t jump ahead,” Simmer said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: After nearly a year of being barred from visiting the incarcerated, families and friends will soon have the chance to visit their loved ones in the state’s prison facilities. Phased scheduling with COVID-19 screening procedures will start Monday and roll through March 15, according to a memo by the South Dakota Department of Corrections. Visits will be limited to allow for social distancing, and “several new restrictions” will be used to “protect the health and safety of offenders and staff during the public health crisis,” the memo said. Visits could be halted again should the facilities see an increase in cases. Approved visitors must pass a temperature check and wear a face mask when entering the building, after which they will be given a new mask. Two visitors will be allowed per inmate, and no children under 12 will be permitted. Visitations and many group activities at all of the state’s prisons and work centers were suspended March 12, 2020, including powwows and sweat lodges, which the men at the South Dakota State Penitentiary and Jameson Annex hold a few times each year. In January, the Lakota/Dakota/Nakota Spiritual Group at the South Dakota State Penitentiary donated what money would have been spent on a powwow to the Children’s Inn.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: More than 1 million Tennesseans will become eligible Monday for the COVID-19 vaccine after the Department of Health announced Tuesday that it was expecting a large supply of the immunizations. According to Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey, the new eligibility will apply to people 16 and older who have high-risk health conditions – including cancer, hypertension, obesity and pregnancy – as well as caregivers and household residents of medically fragile children. “This is a massive population,” Piercey said. “There are a lot of people who will qualify.” Tennesseans should check with their counties to learn more about eligibility and registration. Residents in metropolitan areas may have different instructions. The age limit to receive the vaccine will remain 65 or older for people who don’t fall into other high-risk groups. Separately, state Health Department investigators are looking into whether anyone received expired vaccine doses in Shelby County, which encompasses Memphis. There was no indication Tuesday that anyone had received an expired dose, said David Sweat, the county’s chief of epidemiology.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state is lifting its mask mandate, Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday, making it the largest state to end an order intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that has killed more than 42,000 Texans. The Republican governor has faced sharp criticism from his party over the mandate, which was imposed eight months ago, as well as other COVID-19 restrictions on businesses that Texas will also scuttle starting next week. The mask order was only ever lightly enforced, even during the worst outbreaks of the pandemic. The repealed rules include doing away with limits on the number of diners or customers allowed indoors, said Abbott, who made the announcement at a restaurant in Lubbock. He said the new rules would take effect March 10, although leaders in Houston and other big Texas cities were already reacting with alarm. “Removing statewide mandates does not end personal responsibility,” Abbott said in a crowded dining room where many of those surrounding him were not wearing masks. “It’s just that now state mandates are no longer needed.” The top county leader in Houston, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, called the announcement “wishful thinking” and said spikes in hospitalizations have followed past rollbacks of COVID-19 rules.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced it has donated $20 million to help a program aimed at distributing COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries around the world. The donation from the humanitarian arm of the Utah-based faith is going to UNICEF as part of the organization’s work with the United Nations-backed COVAX initiative, which last week sent its long-awaited first deliveries to Ghana and Ivory Coast. More than half of the 16.5 million church members of the faith known widely as the Mormon church live outside the United States, including 666,500 in Africa. Many serve faith outreach missions around the world aimed at recruiting new members. Church officials hope the program helps children in these countries, where programs run by other organizations that provide children with health, nutritional and educational services have been disrupted by the pandemic, Gerald Causse, presiding bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint Charities, said in a statement. The faith doesn’t disclose information about its finances but commonly announces donations made through the humanitarian arm of the religion that has helped more than 1,000 coronavirus relief projects in 152 countries, according to the church.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is expanding eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines to teachers next week, Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday. The expansion comes as the supply of available vaccine increased by the federal approval over the weekend of the vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, which only requires one shot and can be stored with regular refrigeration. “Our first allocations in the month of March for the Johnson & Johnson will be … dedicated to the teachers, school employees and child care providers,” Administration Secretary Mike Smith said. While the first allocation of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine this month will be reserved for educators, teachers will be able to choose if they’d prefer the two-dose vaccinations. Gov. Phil Scott said he felt some people will prefer the easier-to-use and distribute Johnson & Johnson vaccine and worried the demand for it could exceed the supply. The state is also expanding eligibility to include people 16 to 64 who have preexisting medical conditions that put them at higher risk of complications or death from COVID-19. Starting Monday, people with those conditions in the 55-to-64 age group will be able to make appointments. The younger group will be able to register the week after that.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers have approved a loosening of the state’s ABC laws to help businesses and local governments recover from the impacts of the pandemic. One measure would allow distillers and restaurants to continue offering cocktails to go. That’s been allowed for a while under an executive directive Gov. Ralph Northam issued in April. But the new legislation would allow sales to continue even if the governor’s executive order declaring a state of emergency due to the pandemic expires. The bill would allow a limit of two cocktails per meal and a total of four maximum, said Eric Terry, president of the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging & Travel Association. He said the to-go provisions have been a “lifeline” for restaurants during the pandemic, when some customers have been reluctant to dine indoors. The bill as passed would sunset July 1, 2022. Terry said he hopes lawmakers might extend it in the future. Another measure would effectively allow local governments to seek state approval to create open-container zones. The bill expands a code section that previously dealt with special events. It will allow localities to seek approval from the state ABC board for an “outdoor refreshment area license.”\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: Public school teachers continue to resist returning to classrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the urging of Gov. Jay Inslee. Educators in Renton voted not to return to in-person teaching. KIRO reports the Renton School District had planned for preschool, kindergarten and self-contained elementary special education teachers to return to school classrooms Wednesday. The teacher’s union said the district failed to address safety concerns from school nurses, special education teachers and staff considered to be high-risk. But the district said the union had already approved an agreement that said teachers would return Wednesday. There are about 15,000 total students in the Renton district. Earlier, teachers in Seattle – the state’s largest district with more than 50,000 students – had balked at plans to return some students to classes early in March. The Seattle public teachers’ union filed unfair labor practice complaints against the city school district over actions it took to try to return some students to classrooms. After getting authorization from the Seattle School Board last week, the district designated some 700 educators as “essential” to speed up the process of in-person instruction for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state expects to receive a surge in vaccine doses this week after the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine gained emergency use authorization. On top of the 15,500 doses from Johnson & Johnson, the state’s allocation of vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will mean the state receives nearly 93,000 total doses this week, Gov. Jim Justice said Monday. The state administered more than 60,000 total first and second doses last week. With the vaccine supply now increasing, it will test West Virginia officials’ claims that the state has the capacity to administer 125,000 shots a week. They have said vaccinations have already driven down deaths linked to COVID-19. There were 39 deaths reported last week, the first time with fewer than 40 deaths reported statewide since late October. On Monday the state reported no additional deaths. “I am so delighted by this it’s unbelievable,” Justice said. “We have lost nobody in the last 24 hours.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Teachers will be prioritized to receive the first shipment of about 48,000 doses of the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine coming to the state next week, a bolster in supply that won’t be matched again for several weeks, the state’s deputy health secretary said Tuesday. About 30% of Wisconsin public school districts – 131 out of 421 – will be done vaccinating teachers by March 15, said Julie Willems Van Dyke, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The state originally planned to prioritize schools for vaccine distribution but didn’t need to do that because initial supply met the plans for distribution submitted by schools, she said. “We feel really great about the way this all timed out,” Willems Van Dyke said. “The good news is we’ll get our teachers vaccinated quickly, and by doing that, it opens the vaccine pipeline for others in this eligibility group.” Republicans who control the Legislature continue to put pressure on Gov. Tony Evers to force all schools to resume in-person classes. Evers has left opening decisions up to the schools and said Tuesday that he can’t force the change. “I cannot order schools to open,” Evers said. “It’s not part of my ability as governor.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The governor announced a goal Tuesday to capture more carbon dioxide than the nation’s top coal-mining state emits, as he criticized plans taking shape under President Joe Biden intended to limit climate change. “They claim to follow the science, but they adopt policies that resemble science fiction,” Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, said in his State of the State address. Prioritizing renewable energy over technology to keep carbon dioxide from power plants out of the atmosphere is a “crazed pursuit,” Gordon said about Biden’s plans. A tumultuous year of the pandemic and low oil prices has forced Wyoming to make steep spending cuts, but better days lie ahead, Gordon said. He praised Wyoming’s response to the pandemic that has kept schools open and businesses viable and said vaccine distribution was going smoothly. Wyoming could see a tourism “bonanza” if pent-up demand for travel brings visitors to the state this summer, he said. Still, Wyoming isn’t out of the woods yet with the virus and economic turmoil, Gordon said. He urged lawmakers meeting in Cheyenne over the next month to find a way to fund public education amid declining revenue from the state’s coal, oil and gas extraction industries.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/20/fire-ants-elvis-presley-lake-flash-flood-rescue-news-around-states/117579112/", "title": "Fire ants, Elvis Presley Lake, flash flood rescue: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabama is turning to social media to encourage more people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Department of Public Health announced a TikTok contest to encourage young people to get vaccinated before the start of the school year. The contest is for people ages 13 to 29. To participate, contestants should submit a TikTok video showing themselves getting vaccinated or include a creative message explaining, “This is why I got vaccinated.” All videos must tag @alcovidvaccine, #getvaccinatedAL and #ADPH. Winners will be determined based on creativity, originality and popularity measured by the numbers of likes and shares. The videos should be submitted by Aug. 6. Advertising professionals and department staff will select four winners who will each receive a $250 Visa gift card. Winners will be announced Aug. 13 on the @alcovidvaccine TikTok account and promoted on Department of Public Health social media. Complete contest rules, information and guidance about COVID-19 can be found www.alabamapublichealth.gov/covid19vaccine/tiktok.html.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Alaska had about 17,000 more jobs last month than it did in June 2020, with most industries seeing gains over that period but still falling below prepandemic levels, a report released by the state labor department showed. The state had about 30,600 fewer jobs last month than in June 2019, according to the report. Industries hit hard during 2020 saw big gains in the new report, the department said. For example, there were 4,500 more jobs in leisure and hospitality last month than a year earlier and 4,200 more in the trade, transportation and utilities sector. However, there were 11,300 fewer jobs in leisure and hospitality last month than in June 2019 and 6,300 fewer in trade, transportation and utilities, according to the report. Health care employment and construction were up from June 2020 and equaled their June 2019 numbers. Manufacturing, which the department said is mainly seafood processing, had 1,200 more jobs last month than a year earlier and 100 fewer than in June 2019.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey announced he’s using $101.1 million of federal relief funding to launch a new program to encourage more tourism spending in the state and help the hospitality industry recover from the pandemic. The Visit Arizona Initiative will use the American Rescue Plan money to help the tourism sector of the state’s economy to prosper and “continue to recover from the effects of the pandemic,” Ducey said in a statement. Examples of planned funding uses include destination and travel marketing, local programs and events, state park improvements, Arizona State Fair marketing and a workplace initiative for the hospitality industry. Ducey’s move to bolster the tourism industry followed his announcement that he was tapping federal cash from the American Rescue Plan to refill the state unemployment insurance trust fund.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:The Arkansas Department of Agriculture has added Sebastian, Logan, Prairie and White counties to a state quarantine to try and prevent the spread of fire ants. The designation means people cannot remove any of the following items from the quarantine zone without treating them: nursery stock with soil or potting media, grass sod, baled hay stored in contact with the soil, baled straw stored in contact with the soil, as well as soil and used soil-moving equipment. There are 43 counties in the quarantine, according to the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. Paul Shell, a plant inspection and quarantine program manager with the Arkansas Department of Agriculture, estimated that fire ants have been present in the state since the 1980s. Fire ants spread naturally through flight but can also spread when people move soil. Fire ants can inflict painful stings multiple times and can cause allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPetrolia: A 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the northern California coast late Saturday. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake just before midnight was about 7.5 miles west of Petrolia in Humboldt County and 35 miles southwest of Eureka. The depth was just over 18.5 miles. The shaking could be felt as far south as San Francisco and as far east as beyond Yuba City, according to reports submitted to the USGS. Further details weren’t immediately available.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The north end of Denver International Airport’s terminal is about to become unrecognizable when the Hensel Phelps construction firm begins building new security checkpoints as the Great Hall improvements reach Phase 2. Plans call for three escalators to move people from the new sixth-floor security station directly to the train platform. Improvement should be functioning by the beginning of 2024, said outgoing airport CEO Kim Day, who retired Friday after 13 years at the helm. Phase 1 included expanding the number of gates by 39, adding four additional restrooms and improving the check-in stations for Southwest, United Airlines and Frontier Airlines. The new check-in points are now on Level 6, above the existing TSA security checkpoints. Hensel Phelps took over for the previous general contractor, which was fired two years ago after delays and cost overruns. The new security area is to include “state of the art” screening technology, new line processes and streamlined procedures, Day said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStamford: Former Major League Baseball player and manager Bobby Valentine has raised about $300,000 for his independent campaign for mayor of Stamford since announcing his bid in May, including donations from former President George W. Bush and other high-profile Republicans. Bush gave $500 to Valentine’s campaign, Hearst Connecticut Media reported Saturday, citing financial disclosures. Bush was managing partner of the Texas Rangers in 1992 when the team fired Valentine as manager. Valentine, a Stamford native, also received $1,000 maximum contributions from Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director for former President Donald Trump, and Linda McMahon, former administrator of the Small Business Administration under Trump and former chief executive of Stamford-based World Wrestling Entertainment. The $300,000 in individual contributions is more than the two Democrats running for mayor raised during the first half of this year, the records showed. Democratic Mayor David Martin has collected more than $78,000 in individual donations as he seeks a third term, and state Rep. Caroline Simmons has raised nearly $140,000.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach:The city has opted to triple its police department’s liability insurance, noting a rise in civil rights lawsuits. The Dewey Beach Town Council voted recently to increase the coverage from $1 million to $3 million, the News Journal reported. “I think it’s prudent for the town to consider upping the amount to protect us, so, God forbid, something happened we wouldn’t have to liquidate any town assets,” said Police Chief Sam Mackert during a July 9 council meeting. Mackert said he has been watching other towns across the country pay settlements far beyond Dewey Beach’s policy limit. The town has a total budget under $4 million. The increase in coverage will lead to a hike in its premium. The town already had some money budgeted for it and will use funds from its real estate transfer tax to help make up the difference, the newspaper reported. “You hope and pray that you never have to use it,” Commissioner Paul Bauer said. “But better safe than sorry.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The Golden Triangle Business Improvement District told WUSA9-TV last week that small businesses could receive multiple months of free rent as part of a new program to help the area recover from a high number of vacant office and retail spaces. The Golden Triangle area stretches 44 square blocks from Dupont Circle to Pennsylvania Avenue. A spokesperson for the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District said the area encompasses 34 million square feet of office space and can attract almost 90,000 workers a day. However, the pandemic brought closures and forced many of the workers to work remotely. Buildings that usually bustled with activity had only about 8% occupancy for months, according to BID data, and pedestrian counts were down 90%. Over a year after the pandemic spread to the district, the group said the Golden Triangle has 122 vacant office and retail spaces. By fall, the spokesperson said the group hoped to get the area back on track to where it once was before businesses and workers left.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Smyrna Beach: A man is facing animal cruelty and other charges after investigators said he attacked and seriously wounded a dog with a machete. An affidavit by a Volusia County sheriff’s deputy said Richard Nelson, 46, injured the dog during a confrontation earlier this month outside a New Smyrna Beach home. Nelson is also charged with falsely telling deputies he acted in self-defense when the dog attacked him first. Nelson was arrested Friday and released on his own recognizance the next day, court records showed. No attorney is listed to speak for Nelson, who authorities said has no fixed address. According to the affidavit, Nelson and the dog had issues in the past. Initially, Nelson told investigators the dog ran at him unprovoked and bit him, leading to his decision to use the machete. Video evidence, however, showed that Nelson stood up aggressively when the dog approached, striking the dog several times with the machete as he chased the animal around the yard, the affidavit said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWarner Robins: A thriving Black community established in the 1940s for African American workers at Robins Air Force Base has been commemorated with a historic marker. The new plaque in Warner Robins – unveiled last month – celebrates the Jody Town Community, a segregated neighborhood that became a hub for Black life in the area before an urban renewal plan in the 1970s led to its destruction, The Telegraph newspaper reported. Johnson-Granville recalled going to an ice cream shop in the neighborhood and learning how to sew and bake cookies with her Girl Scout troop there. The Dodgers scouted players at a park where the Warner Robins Jets baseball team played, she said. But an urban renewal project in the 1970s supported by a federal grant displaced residents and brought down buildings. The neighborhood disappeared. Johnson-Granville called the marker “a symbol of what our ancestors did in the past.” The marker is the latest addition to the Georgia Civil Rights Trail, an initiative led by the Georgia Historical Society that aims to commemorate key events during the Civil Rights movement.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A federal judge ruled Maui County must get permits to operate injection wells that environmental groups said are polluting the ocean. Several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in 2012 over the injection wells, saying effluent from the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility was entering the ocean and damaging coral reefs and sea life. The groups pointed to studies that traced the discharge from two wells to the ocean. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Susan Oki Mollway sided with the environmental groups and ordered Maui County to “obtain a permit under the Clean Water Act consistent with the analysis established by the Supreme Court,” The Maui News reported. Maui county officials had refused to settle the case and brought it to the Supreme Court in 2019. The Supreme Court in April 2020 ruled that injection wells fall under the Clean Water Act. The county argued that treated wastewater from injection wells did not require permits under the Clean Water Act because the discharge did not go directly into the ocean.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Anti-government activist Ammon Bundy has asked a judge to throw out his conviction for trespassing at the Idaho Capitol and acquit him instead because he said the state’s trespassing law should not be applied to public property. Idaho’s courts, like many states, allow defendants to ask the judge for an acquittal within several days of a jury verdict. The move is seldom made, however, and rarely successful. It stems from Bundy’s arrest on Aug. 25, 2020, after he refused to leave an auditorium in the Statehouse after officials ordered it to be cleared. Officers also said he went limp and refused to stand up and put his hands behind his back. Officers ultimately wheeled him out of the Capitol building on a swivel chair. The arrest came during a special session of the Idaho Legislature that was called so lawmakers could address issues related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIllinois\n\nMarion: Authorities in southern Illinois are investigating after skeletal remains were found at a wildlife refuge. The Williamson County Sheriff’s Office was working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Illinois State Police and the county coroner. The remains were found Thursday at the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge, according to a news release. No further details were released. The roughly 44,000-acre refuge includes hardwood and pine forests, croplands, grasslands rolling hills and several lakes.\n\nIndiana\n\nCharlestown:Hundreds of people turned out for an auction at a former Indiana wildlife center where the ex-proprietor and his ex-wife were found to have violated the Endangered Species Act by taking and wounding animals, including tigers and lions. A federal judge in June ordered Timothy Stark and his ex-wife, Melissa Lane, to pay more than $700,000 to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals for attorney fees from the group’s successful lawsuit against the pair. Stark gained attention last year as one of the people in the Netflix true-crime series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.” Along with volunteers, he operated the Wildlife in Need center in southern Indiana for more than 20 years. They showed off hundreds of exotic animals at the roadside center, charging admission of $25 or more. On Saturday, more than 7 acres of land, several buildings and a four-bedroom frame home were up for sale, the Indianapolis Star reported. Personal property including a Polar King walk-in freezer and refrigerator, trucks, trailers and ATVs also were auctioned.\n\nIowa\n\nShenandoah: The Pella Windows & Doors company plans to shift more window production to its southwest Iowa factory and hire 120 additional workers in Shenandoah. Company officials said they plan to move production of their wooden double-hung windows to Shenandoah from a factory in Macomb, Illinois, according to The Des Moines Register. The Iowa Economic Development Authority agreed to give the company a forgivable $200,000 loan to help pay for the move. In return, the company said it plans to spend $5.6 million on equipment for the new lines, and the new jobs will pay at least $20.58 an hour, state officials said. The city of Shenandoah is also providing a $40,000 forgivable loan. Pella already employs about 300 people at the plant in Shenandoah. That will grow to more than 400 once the change is made.\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: Kansas State University will require that first-year students to live on campus starting in the fall of 2022. The university said in a news release the requirement aims to enhance student success. Thomas Lane, vice president for student life and dean of students, said data showed the university’s first-year students who live on campus have higher grade-point averages, stay in school in higher numbers and graduate faster. The retention rate for freshmen who lived on campus in the fall of 2018 was 87.6%, compared to 79.9% for those who did not. For the fall of 2019, the university found that 5% more first-year students who lived on campus stayed in school than those who lived off campus. Kansas State will join all other institutions in the Kansas Regents system, with the exception of the University of Kansas, in requiring freshmen to live on campus. Students can apply for an exemption to the policy.\n\nKentucky\n\nCadiz: A riverboat stuck in Lake Barkley for more than a week was freed Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The American Jazz, with 120 passengers and 54 crew members, became stuck on a sandbar last week while on a seven-night cruise between Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, according to its operator, American Cruise Lines. The passengers were moved off the ship and transported to a Nashville hotel on July 9. The boat was not damaged. The boat was left in full reverse for about three hours Friday while a towing vessel pushed on it, and after taking a break, the boat worked itself free around 3:20 p.m., said Lt. Phillip Baxter of the Coast Guard in Paducah. The American Jazz’s hull was being inspected to make sure there was no damage or water going in before sending it on its way, Baxter said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Bagpipes played as an honor guard carried the flag-draped casket bearing the body of former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards down the steps of Louisiana’s towering state Capitol on Sunday and loaded it onto a horse-drawn carriage for transport to his funeral site. The four-term former governor died at his home in Gonzales on July 12 at age 93 after placing himself in hospice care following bouts with respiratory illness. His body lay in honor Saturday at the Capitol, where members of the public were allowed to file by. The Southern University marching band was part of a procession that carried the body from the 34-story Capitol built in the 1930s, on a nearly mile-long route to the Old State Capitol, a 19th Century structure, where a private funeral ceremony for Edwards was held. Among the speakers was current Gov. John Bel Edwards – no relation – who praised Edwards as a consensus builder and deal-maker who modernized state government and worked hard to fund education and the state’s charity hospital system.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The percentage of Maine teenagers and 12-year-olds who have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine has exceeded 50%. Maine has been ahead of most of the country in vaccinating residents against COVID-19. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that about 51% of the state’s 12- to 19-year-old residents have had at least one dose, and about 47% have had a final dose. The rollout of vaccines to teens and adolescents has been much slower nationwide. Only about 14% of the U.S. population that is under 18 has had a first dose of the vaccine, according to data from the Mayo Clinic. In Maine, the percentage of the total population that is under 20 and has had at least one dose is about 22%, the Maine CDC reported. That includes people too young to receive a vaccine. More than two-thirds of Maine’s population old enough to receive a COVID-19 vaccine has received a final dose. That is one of the highest percentages in the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:Point Broadband, an internet provider based in Georgia, is expanding its a fiber optic network to the Hagerstown area. The company, which acquired Hagerstown Fiber a little more than a year ago, will offer internet and telephone service for homes and businesses. Clint Wiley, general manager of Point Broadband in Maryland, said part of the work has already started. Wiley, who owned Hagerstown Fiber, said the company had started building a fiber optic network in the city before being acquired by Point Broadband. “That initial build was successful. ... We’re obviously building from where we are in Hagerstown outwards,” he said, referring to a map of the planned coverage area, which stretches from the Pennsylvania state line south to Williamsport, and from just west of Hagerstown east to Smithsburg. It includes communities such as Maugansville, Halfway and Funkstown.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is working with Boston and several other area communities to build nearly 5 miles of bus lanes and make other upgrades along crucial transit corridors, transportation officials said. The projects are designed to boost bus speed and reliability and in turn support economic growth as the region eases public health restrictions put in place during the coronavirus pandemic, the MBTA said in a statement. The work is also being done in Lynn, Brookline, Malden, Revere, and Somerville. “These quick-build projects aim to address transit delay on some of the region’s most congested roadways in order to improve bus travel time and reliability, and move more people more efficiently to support economic recovery and public health,” the T’s statement said.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinaw City: A bomb scare closed the bridge connecting Michigan’s two peninsulas for about three hours on Sunday afternoon, authorities said. Law enforcement notified the Mackinac Bridge Authority of the threat and the bridge was closed in both directions at about 2:15 p.m., the authority said in a tweet. The Michigan State and Mackinaw City police investigated. Nothing was found after an “extensive search,” the authority said, and the bridge was reopened shortly after 5 p.m. The more than 26,300-foot structure is the longest suspension bridge in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nMinnesota\n\nEly: Superior National Forest officials said they are expanding their closure order for the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness north of Ely because of the threat of wildfires burning across the Canadian border. The newly expanded order, which took effect Sunday, includes 12 more BWCA entry points and the area around Lac la Croix, in addition to the areas around Crooked and Iron lakes that had been included. It now stretches east nearly to Basswood Lake, west nearly to Crane Lake, and south to the Echo Trail, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Authorities said wildfires burning unchecked just across the border in Ontario’s Quetico Provincial Park could cross into the BWCA. Forest Service officials said the new order is meant to give campers time to leave the area. The closure order will last at least seven days, or until the fire danger has subsided.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A lake named for the king of rock ‘n’ roll is closed for repairs and could reopen in the spring of 2024. Elvis Presley Lake has been drained and the entrance to it is locked, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported. Dennis Riecke, fisheries and environmental coordinator with the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries & Parks, said plans include an inspection of the drain structure and installation of a rack to prevent logs from getting caught in the drain pipe. They also include the addition of fish attractors or brush piles in the shoreline areas and the addition of gravel beds to provide spawning sites for bass and bluegill. The state in recent years also temporarily closed Trace State Park Lake and Lake Lamar Bruce for improvements. Both are open again.\n\nMissouri\n\nFredericktown: A flash flood in rural eastern Missouri led to a water rescue of two people after their vehicle became stranded in fast-rising water. Heavy rain on Friday prompted a quick rise of the St. Francis River in Madison County. KFVS-TV reported that the water came up so quickly that both people were forced to stand on top of the vehicle to escape drowning. A Missouri State Highway Patrol marine operation trooper, R.A. Walker, and Madison County Emergency Management Director Dean Stevens were able to navigate the flooding waters and rescue the victims.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Extreme heat descended on parts of the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains on Monday, as authorities struggled to contain dozens of wildfires burning in a region parched by prolonged drought and blanketed with dangerous smoke. Record-setting temperatures were forecast for much of eastern Montana and portions of northern Wyoming. Billings, Montana’s largest city, was expected to hit 106 degrees Fahrenheit, topping a record set 61 years ago. Glasgow was forecast to reach 108. The heat will linger through Thursday, the National Weather Service said. Red flag warnings for high-fire risk were issued across almost all of Montana and Idaho and portions of northeastern and western Wyoming. More than two dozen new fires broke out across the three states Sunday, further straining firefighting resources stretched thin by a high number of early summer fires. Thunderstorms rolling through Monday night will bring winds that could fan wildfires and lightning that could spark new ones, according to the weather service.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: City officials are defending their actions to remove a homeless encampment that had been set up in a wooded area. Officials said concerns from residents nearby prompted an investigation by Lincoln Fire and Rescue and the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department. Jon Carlson, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff, told the Lincoln Journal Star that conditions were found to be dangerous for those who were living there. Carlson said dead trees, dry brush, wood, grills, propane tanks and gas cans created a fire threat. Health officials also determined conditions were unsanitary. But some homeless advocates said it was unjust to demolish a community people made for themselves. About 20 people attended a protest and sought to raise donations to help those affected by the demolition.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Some Las Vegas resorts and casinos are again requiring employees to wear masks, a response to a recommendation issued by regional health officials amid rising COVID-19 case rates. The Southern Nevada Health District on Friday recommended that all people, regardless of whether they’ve been vaccinated, wear face coverings in public settings such as stores, malls, casinos and events. The district’s recommendation isn’t a mandate but local media outlets reported that it prompted properties such as Westgate Las Vegas, The Venetian and Las Vegas Sands to impose masking requirements for employees. Some properties also posted the district’s recommendation at entrances and offered complimentary masks to visitors. Nevada Resort Association President Virginia Valentine said the district’s guidance was “ an important reminder that masks are effective in reducing spread.” Restrictions affecting casinos and other venues were lifted in May when the state fully returned pandemic control measures to counties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMilford: Hitchiner Manufacturing has installed a 510-kilowatt solar array at one of its facilities in Milford. The array will produce more than 625,000 kilowatt-hours of renewable energy every year at a cost of less than $0.04 per kilowatt-hour, the company said in news release Friday. This will save Hitchiner more than $3.5 million over the array’s lifespan, and reduce Hitchiner’s carbon footprint by more than 665,000 pounds annually, the company said. One of the major hurdles in deciding to make the investment was the state’s high electrical costs, the company said. Hitchiner needs to “develop competitive and reliable sources of commercial energy so that businesses, and manufacturers in particular, can grow the state’s economy,” John Morison III, Hitchiner’s chairman and CEO, said. Hitchiner worked with ReVision Energy on the installation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSpringfield Township: A small tornado touched down in New Jersey over the weekend leaving behind a trail of damaged trees, the National Weather Service said. According to forecasters, a line of thunderstorms produced the EF-1 twister about a mile from the Burlington County Fairgrounds on Saturday night. It is estimated the tornado was packing winds of 80 to 90 mph. The tornado followed a narrow path of nearly 8 miles, damaging trees north of Columbus-Jobstown Road, snapping tree limbs on Island Road, uprooting a tree on Juliustown-Georgetown Road and causing additional scattered tree damage before the twister dissipated near the Ocean County border. No injuries were reported. The weather service determined a tornado was responsible after surveying the damage on Sunday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico plans to convert two privately run state prisons in rural areas into facilities operated by the Department of Corrections, the agency said. The department said Friday that it will take over operations of the Northwest New Mexico Correctional Center in Grants and the Guadalupe County Correctional Facility in Santa Rosa by November, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. The facility in Grants is operated by CoreCivic, which is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, and the facility in Santa Rosa is operated by Geo Group, which is based in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he does not plan to reinstate a city-wide mask mandate even as COVID-19 cases increase, opting instead to focus on vaccinating more residents. There have been calls for New York City to follow the lead of Los Angeles County, which announced last week that it will require masks be worn indoors amid a sharp increase in virus cases. But De Blasio insisted vaccinations are a better strategy for the nation’s most populous city. There are 4.8 million city residents with at least one vaccine dose, the mayor said. The daily number of COVID-19 cases in the city has increased since mid-June, though the caseloads are nowhere near the pandemic’s peak this past winter. The 628 confirmed and probable cases recorded citywide Thursday, the most recent day available, compares to 241 on July 1. The number of virus cases has been rising around the country, many of them the highly transmissible delta variant. City health officials said the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheboro: At the same time the North Carolina Zoo is seeing a huge increase in visitors compared with last year, it’s struggling to find staff to keep all of its exhibits open. “Like just about every other business out there, we’re having difficulty finding applicants,” Diane Villa, director of communications and marketing for the Asheboro zoo, told The Courier-Tribune. Most attractions are open, but certain features like an obstacle course and feeding activities have remained closed, the newspaper reported. Villa said 20 people recently turned out for a job fair with dozens of open positions. She said the zoo is partnering with other organizations that hold job fairs and is advertising locally to try to find applicants. Many of the jobs at the zoo are part time, temporary and pay about $10 to $12 per hour.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nTowner: A California man rode his bicycle to North Dakota to celebrate his mother-in-law’s 90th birthday. Brian Gonsalves, who lives in the San Diego area, isn’t new to long-distance bicycle rides. The X-ray technician rode to Georgia in 2018, a trip totalling 2,709 miles. As a survivor of a 2016 bicycle accident, he used that journey to celebrate his 50th birthday and raise money for Scripps trauma services. “I had a laparotomy, resection of my pancreas, and splenectomy that night,” Gonsalves said of the crash. “Two years later, my employer gave me time off to ride across America. I hope to encourage people to do what they love.” With his wife, Dorreen Drader-Gonsalves, providing his mobile support, he started the 2,143-mile trip from California on June 18 and made it to the International Peace Garden on July 11. From there, they drove the 65 miles to Towner for Beverly Lynch’s birthday party, the Minot Daily News reported. “It’s a beautiful country to ride across,” Gonsalves said. He said the minute he entered North Dakota the roads became “smooth as glass,” unlike some other areas.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A dog that had been missing for five days is back home after it was found trapped between two concrete walls in a nearby home’s garage and freed by firefighters using a saw and sledgehammer. The homeowner called the Cincinnati Fire Department on Sunday after hearing the dog’s cries. Firefighters discovered Gertie had fallen down a crevice and was trapped between the walls. The dog had escaped from its home on July 13 and its owners had put up missing posters across the neighborhood. A video posted on Facebook showed firefighters using the tools to create an opening in the wall to pull Gertie to safety after about 10 minutes. The dog wagged its tail after being rescued. “It was just so sweet, just wagging that little nub tail, and she was just so, she was so excited,” Gertie’s owner, Connie Frick, told WXIX-TV.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma reported more than 550 new coronavirus cases Monday as daily cases of the illness continued the upward trend they have charted over the past two weeks. The State Department of Health said the state recorded 557 cases of COVID-19 on Monday, bringing the total number of cases since the pandemic began to 466,733. The rolling average number of daily cases over the past two weeks has increased by 336, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Oklahoma has seen about 155 cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks, which ranks 11th in the country for per capita cases. According to Johns Hopkins, about 46.2% of Oklahomans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 39.5% of the population is fully vaccinated.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Oregon’s salmon license plate, first introduced in 1998, is getting an updated, more colorful look, available Sept. 1. Fans of classic salmon license plate who want it on their vehicle have until Aug. 31 to get to the Oregon DMV to register for one. The original plate, designed by Newport artist Herb Goblirsch, was first introduced by the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board and Oregon Parks and Recreation department in 1998, becoming one of the state’s earliest custom plate designs. Revenue from the specialty plate has contributed more than $8 million into salmon recovery, helping protect and restore native salmon habitats, according to the release announcing the new design, The new design comes from Gretchen Kirchner, an amateur artist and former graphic designer for the watershed board. Kirchner drew inspiration from her 16 years in Oregon and the state’s beaches, forests, mountains and valleys and she worked with OWEB biologists to accurately represent the salmon’s details. More information about the new salmon license plate, auction rules and eligibility, is available at orsalmonplates.com. Registration fees and ordering information are available on the DMV website.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvania smashed its record for gambling revenue, state regulators said Monday, reporting nearly $3.9 billion in the last fiscal year as every category of wagering showed growth in one of the nation’s largest casino and gambling states. The rebound comes after pandemic-related shutdowns helped knock casino revenue down significantly. The nearly $3.9 billion from 14 operating casinos, fantasy sports operators and truck stops for the fiscal year ending June 30 beat the previous high, two years ago, by about 17% and last year’s take by more than 40%, according to figures from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Revenue in casinos from slot machines, at just below $1.9 billion, and from table games, at $721 million, remains lower than record highs in previous years. Online casino gambling grew to nearly $900 million in just its second year, and sports betting grew to $309 million in just its third year. Pennsylvania legalized both as part of an aggressive gambling expansion in 2017.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJamestown:A Rhode Island man is planning a 19-mile swim from Block Island to Jamestown on July 31 to raise money for a nonprofit that works to keep oceans clean. Ben Tuff’s grueling swim will raise money for Clean Ocean Access. Just two years ago, he swam 23 miles around Conanicut Island to raise more than $54,000 for the organization, The Newport Daily News reported. Tuff is director of admission at Rumsey Hall School in Connecticut and a former triathlete who grew up in Jamestown. To keep safe, he will wear a shark-repellent device. About 6 feet long, the device will trail behind him. It can be a burden, but Tuff said it will provide peace of mind during a stretch of the swim when he won’t be able to see land. Two boats and a paddle boarder will trail him during the swim. He estimated the swim will take one to two hours more than his Jamestown around-the-island swim in 2019 that lasted 9 hours, 11 minutes, but much depends on currents.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Starting on Oct. 1, 2024, nurseries in South Carolina will be prohibited from selling Bradford Pear and Callery pear trees, according to the Post and Courier. The trees are known for their early spring white flowers. But they also are known as one of the weakest structural trees in existence, with branches that commonly break after 10 to 15 years and a short life expectancy of 20 to 30 years. The ban affects the Bradford pear and any other tree grown from the Pyrus calleryana rootstock. State lawmakers and the state’s Crop Pest Commission approved the ban after an advisory panel added the tree to the State Plant Pest List. The Bradford pear was introduced to the United States in the 1950s. Although technically sterile, its fruit can cross pollinate with any other variety of pear tree and produce Callery pear trees, said David Coyle, assistant professor of Forest Health and Invasive Species at Clemson. He has started a program to encourage people to cut down and replace Bradford pears.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWatertown: The Department of Game, Fish and Parks is weighing how to proceed on beaver hunting in the Black Hills and the state. The idea for a hunting ban came up recently when the Game, Fish and Parks Commission discussed a proposal to create a year-round beaver hunting season across the state, with hunting only allowed in portions of the Black Hills not owned by the U.S. Forest Service from Nov. 1 to April 30. “By creating one statewide beaver season (with the exception of the Black Hills) that is year-round, it simplifies this regulation and allows landowners in eastern South Dakota the ability to remove beavers that are causing damage,” the proposal stated. Keith Fisk, the agency’s program administrator, said he receives at least 500 beaver complaints on an annual basis, the Black Hills Pioneer reported. “There are a number of landowners out there that would take advantage of this opportunity to remove some of those problem beavers whether it is them practicing that or someone they know willing to come and help them out,” Fisk said. But Commissioner Travis Bies said the Black Hills does not have problems with beavers, and the population has been greatly decreased. Bies called for a study of the beaver population, a suggestion that prompted the commission to table the proposal to its September meeting.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee officials said state tax revenue continued to exceed projections in the latest monthly report. The Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration said revenue for June were $1.9 billion, which is $372.3 million more than the budgeted monthly revenue estimate and $321.1 million more than June 2020. That represents a growth rate year-over-year of 20.9%. The revenue also represents a monthly growth rate of 18.6% compared to June 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. The revenue reflects taxable sales activity from the month of May. On an accrual basis, June is the eleventh month in the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Year-to-date revenues were $2.8 billion more than projections.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A section of east El Paso received more than 3 inches of rain within an hour Sunday night, the National Weather Service said Monday. The largest amount of rain – 3.28 inches – was recorded in the Eastwood area along Montwood drives between McRae Boulevard and Yarbrough Drive, according to a NWS rain totals map. The next-largest rain totals were 2.46 inches near Vista Del Sol and Yarbrough Drive and 2.07 inches near the El Paso Community College Valle Verde campus. Other areas of El Paso received less than a half-inch to more than 1 inch of rain Sunday night as thunderstorms moved through the region. Flash flooding was reported in parts of El Paso, where 1 to 2 inches of rain had fallen earlier in the night. Drivers were cautioned not to enter flooded roads. There were reports of vehicles stuck and partially submerged in high water in several parts of the east side, including off Lee Treviño Drive and McRae Boulevard. There also was high water impacting traffic in the area of Interstate 10 and Piedras Street.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale:Zion National Park has set a record for visitors in a month. National Park Service data showed the park saw nearly 676,000 visitors in June, topping the number during the same period in 2019 by a wide margin, the Spectrum newspaper reported. In June 2019, the park saw 595,000 visitors. The number dipped in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic to about 377,000 visitors. “We far surpassed our record,” Superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh told the Springdale Town Council. Two other Utah parks, Canyonlands National Park and Capitol Reef National Park, saw their busiest June ever, with nearly 110,000 and 190,000 visitors respectively. Arches National Park temporarily delays entry almost daily now because of high visitation volumes but the official data hasn’t been released for June. Utah parks have seen visitation rise steadily over the past decade, with some parks seeing their average annual attendance nearly double.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Celebrations were held at Amtrak stations across Vermont on Monday to mark the return of passenger rail service to the state. The Vermonter train and the Ethan Allen Express resumed passenger service Monday. The service was suspended last year at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Amtrak offered $1 fares at each Vermont station to include Brattleboro, Bellows Falls, Windsor, White River Junction, Randolph, Montpelier, Waterbury, Essex Junction and St. Albans. The Vermonter train runs between New York City and St. Albans. The Ethan Allen Express runs between Rutland and New York. The southbound Vermonter was a few minutes late when it arrived in Montpelier on Monday. There were scores of people there waiting for it getting ice cream from a food truck and listening to a band that was set up under a tent.\n\nVirginia\n\nSpotsylvania: A massive Virginia solar plant that drew a flood of opposition when it was first proposed is now more than half completed and sending electricity into the power grid. The first phases of the Spotsylvania Solar Center are generating 259 megawatts each day, providing power for some of the companies that bought the rights to the energy, the Free Lance-Star reported. Among them are Apple, Microsoft and the University of Richmond, which contracted to receive the electricity credits from the facility in rural western Spotsylvania County. The remaining portion of the solar facility should be online by the fall, Helen Humphries, a spokeswoman for AES Corp., told the newspaper. The plant is on track to become one of the largest in the U.S., with about 1.8 million panels generating 484 megawatts a day.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap:The Central Kitsap School District plans to start building a new facility on the campus of Olympic High School to replace Fairview Middle School in 2022. The district’s board members approved its Long-Range Facilities Plan, which includes the replacement of Fairview Middle School, in a board meeting last Wednesday. The long-term facilities plan provides a 40-year roadmap for the replacement and modernization of facilities in Central Kitsap, according to a document provided by the district. Having been meeting regularly with the district’s general contractor, Skanska, Central Kitsap School District will have some conceptual drawings of the new facility in August or September, Newell said in the board meeting. The new facility on the Olympic High campus will accommodate about 750 students, the same number of students which Fairview Middle School currently has, the district’s spokesperson, David Beil, said. The construction is estimated to cost $65 million, with $48.5 million coming from the federal government and $16.5 million from the state, according to a document provided by the district.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Jean Dean, the first woman to serve as mayor of Huntington, has died. Dean died Saturday morning, her son Justin Gibson told the Herald-Dispatch. Her health had been deteriorating, he said. Dean served from 1993 to 2000. Before that, she was director of administration and finance, a position similar to a city manager. “She considered it a great honor to serve the people,” Gibson said. Current Mayor Steve Williams called Dean a “graceful giant.” Her vision, determination and graceful countenance set a foundation on which we continue to benefit, Williams said in a statement. Gibson said his mother was willing to work with representatives in Congress, local business leaders and residents to support the city. Funeral arrangements were pending Sunday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wisconsin’s two medical schools are collaborating on a study addressing health disparities in the state. The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and the Medical College of Wisconsin will use $3 million in endowment money to measure and recommend solutions for health inequities, which have been underscored by the coronavirus pandemic. The Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality is a consortium of state health systems and hospitals. The collaborative in 2020 found low rates of colon cancer screening and HPV vaccination in some rural areas and low rates of childhood vaccinations and depression screening in some urban neighborhoods. Blacks in Wisconsin have higher rates of cancer and sexually transmitted diseases than other groups, and poorer outcomes for stroke, diabetes and asthma, stemming in part from more poverty and less education, according to the state Department of Health Services, the State Journa l reported.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Dusty Campbell completed a 285-mile rollerblade journey from Jackson to Salt Lake City on July 4 in just 47 hours and raised $15,200 for the Wounded Warrior Project, a nonprofit that helps veterans recover from mental and physical injuries. With those service members in mind, Campbell rollerbladed through two nights, resting only for three 30-minute naps. He was still on his wheels at 4:20 a.m. on July 4, with about 50 miles left to go. When he first set off from Town Square in Jackson, there wasn’t much fanfare. The stagecoach driver gave him a tip of the hat, and some tourists vaguely noted the size of his wheels. The symbolism of the location was noted, though, in Instagram live videos that showed the rollerblader in front of the veteran memorial in the center of the square. “In my mind there’s no greater cause,” Campbell said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/27/bomber-boneyard-flying-farmer-crashes-blueberry-bonanza-news-around-states/118952548/", "title": "B-1 bomber boneyard, Flying Farmer crashes, Blueberry bonanza ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:The state is considering whether to use $400million in pandemic relief funds to build new prisons, a proposal Gov. Kay Ivey and Republican legislative leaders said would save state taxpayers’ money, but that critics argue is not for what the funds are supposed to be used. Lawmakers on Monday begin a special session focused on a $1.3 billion prison construction plan to build at least three new prisons and renovate others. The projects would be done in phases and funded with a $785 million bond issue, $150 million in general fund dollars and $400 million from the state’s $2.2 billion share of American Rescue Plan funds. Ivey and Republican legislative leaders have defended the use of the virus funds, saying it will enable the state to essentially “pay cash” for part of the construction and avoid using state dollars as well as paying interest on a loan.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state reported more than 1,700 resident COVID-19 cases Friday, which state health officials said included reports from earlier this month as they work to clear a backlog that has built up during the latest case surge. Health officials encouraged looking at cases by their symptom onset date versus the date they were submitted to the state health department. Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, also recommended looking at weekly trends. Zink said the high daily report includes a mix of current and older cases, “but it does not diminish the fact we continue to see tremendous COVID spread in our communities.” Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist, told reporters there is no indication yet that Alaska has hit a peak.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: More than a dozen B-1 bombers decommissioned by the Air Force have been flown to a boneyard in Tucson. The last of the 13 bombers destined for storage or disposal at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson arrived Thursday after being flown from a base in California, an Air Force statement said. The Air Force decommissioned a total of 17 B-1s, with the other four going to various locations for testing and other purposes. With the retirements of 17 of the B-1 bombers, 45 others remain in the Air Force’s active inventory. In addition, four of the B-1s sent to Davis-Monthan will be stored in a manner that would allow them to be put back into use if needed. The Air Force said retiring some of its B-1s will allow it to give more attention to remaining B-1s to increase their readiness while the service transitions to a bomber fleet consisting of only two types of aircraft – rebuilt B-52s and a new model, the B-21.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients in Arkansas’ hospitals hit its lowest point in two months on Friday as the state reported more than 1,300 new coronavirus cases. The state Department of Health reported COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by 62 to 894. It’s the lowest number of COVID-19 patients the state has reported since 875 were hospitalized on July 24. The state reported 1,365 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 491,221. Arkansas ranks 23rd in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California will strike the word “alien” from its state laws, getting rid of what Gov. Gavin Newsom called “an offensive term for a human being” that has “fueled a divisive and hurtful narrative.” Newsom on Friday signed a law that removes the word from various sections of the California state code. California passed laws in 2015 and 2016 that removed the word from the state’s labor and education code. But the law Newsom signed on Friday finishes the job by removing the word from all state laws. The word will be replaced with terms such as “noncitizen” or “immigrant.” “By changing this term, we are ensuring California’s laws reflect our state’s values,” Newsom said. The federal government has used the term “alien” to describe people in the U.S. who are not citizens since at least 1798 with the passage of the “Aliens and Sedition Acts.” But Assemblywoman Luz Rivas, a Democrat from Arleta, said the word “has become weaponized and has been used in place of explicitly racial slurs to dehumanize immigrants.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Whistleblower allegations that the state health department’s air pollution division interfered with staff efforts to properly enforce federal air quality standards are unsubstantiated, according to an independent report released Friday by the Colorado attorney general’s office. The Colorado Department of Law, which is led by Attorney General Phil Weiser, hired the independent investigator after a complaint was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of inspector general in March. Three whistleblowers alleged that dozens of air pollution permits were issued unlawfully by the health department’s Air Pollution Control Division to companies, and that at least one whistleblower was asked to falsify data to get pollution estimates under permitted limits. They also alleged that health department division leaders ignored EPA regulations on modeling and permitting short-term pollutants from important Colorado industries – including mines, asphalt plants and oil and gas gathering sites. They said the permits were part of a larger problem of state officials allegedly catering to industry. The Denver Post reported the findings released Friday didn’t substantiate the claims of fraud and suppression.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDurham: A retired Connecticut physician and surgeon’s license was suspended Friday by a state medical board for allegedly providing people she had not treated with blank vaccine, mask-wearing and other exemption forms, so long as they sent her a self-addressed stamped envelope in the mail requesting the paperwork. The state Department of Public Health said it received an anonymous tip in July about Dr. Sue Mcintosh of Durham sending people fraudulent exemption forms. After an investigation, DPH called on the Connecticut Medical Examining Board to hold Friday’s emergency hearing and summarily suspend the doctor, saying she poses a “clear and immediate danger to public health and safety.” The panel voted unanimously in favor of the suspension. A full hearing on the merits of the case is scheduled for Oct. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has refused to order a hospital to administer the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to a man who is seriously ill with COVID-19. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn said in a ruling issued Friday that patients, even if they are gravely ill, do not have a right to a particular medical treatment. She also said a health care provider’s duty to treat is bound by that provider’s standard of care. “While ivermectin has been approved as safe and effective to treat human parasitic infections, and so is distinct from a wholly unapproved new drug, DeMarco still has no right to compel its use to treat COVID-19 outside the standard of care,” Zurn wrote. The ruling came a day after a hearing in a lawsuit filed last week by Mary Ellen DeMarco on behalf of her husband, David, against Christiana Care Health Services. Despite refusing to issue an injunction sought by Mary Ellen DeMarco, Zurn indicated she was prepared to quickly consider an application for an interlocutory appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Two women, a pastor and a college student, who live in the D.C. area, will headline CBS's “Survivor 41” that premieres at 8 p.m. Wednesday, WUSA-TV reported. Shantel Smith, 34, who is from Toronto, is a pastor at Emmanuel Brinklow Church,.and Liana Wallace, 20, who is from Evanston, Illinois, is a junior at Georgetown University. The Emmy Award-winning series returns this fall on CBS as 18 new castaways will compete for $1 million and the title of Sole Survivor.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A ferret has tested positive for the coronavirus in Florida, the first ferret to test positive for the virus in the United States, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture news release. A ferret in the European nation of Slovenia previously tested positive for the virus. USDA officials said samples from the Florida ferret were tested after the animal showed symptoms that included sneezing and coughing. Officials believed the ferret acquired the virus from an infected human. The small mustelids are commonly kept as pets. Officials didn’t say where in Florida the infected ferret was found. COVID-19 has been reported in several animal species around the world, usually animals that come in close contact with infected humans, officials said. The USDA said the the risk of animals spreading the virus to people is low and doesn’t recommend routine testing for animals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The largest city in coastal Georgia is in talks about a new way to recycle glass that it’s burying in a landfill, even though it still accepts glass in recycling bins. WTOC-TV reported Savannah officials are in talks with Glass WRX SC, a South Carolina company that seeks to recycle glass into air and water filtration systems, road surfaces and prefabricated interior walls. The city stopped recycling glass more than five years ago after running out of users willing to accept the bulky material. It’s a common problem nationwide. Savannah still finds new users for paper, plastic and metals that it collects from all-in-one recycling bins. In 2020, about 25% of what the city collected from recycling bins, including about 1,000 tons of glass, were buried in the city landfill. Some of that was because materials were too contaminated for further use. City officials recently toured Glass WRX SC’s facility in Beaufort, South Carolina. One use is turning glass into rock-like water filters.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines said a passenger assaulted one of its flight attendants in an unprovoked attack during a flight. The airline said the incident occurred shortly after flight HA152 left Honolulu for Hilo at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. The flight attendant was walking down the aisle at the time. The pilot returned the plane to Honolulu. Deputy sheriffs assigned to the airport arrested a 32-year-old male passenger for third-degree assault based on information they received from the airline, said Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Safety. The FBI was investigating the matter, said agency spokesperson Joy Van Der Voort. Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson Alex Da Silva said the flight attendant was evaluated for injuries and released from work to rest. The flight took off again for Hilo at 9:09 a.m.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Department of Defense is taking input on its plan to build an advanced mobile nuclear microreactor prototype at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho. The department began a 45-day comment period on Friday with the release of a draft environmental impact study evaluating alternatives for building and operating the microreactor that could produce 1 to 5 megawatts of power. The department’s energy needs are expected to increase, it said. The draft environmental impact statement cited President Joe Biden’s Jan. 27 executive order prioritizing climate change considerations in national security as another reason for pursuing microreactors. The draft document said alternative energy sources such as wind and solar were problematic because they are limited by location, weather and available land area, and would require redundant power supplies.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford:The northern Illinois city that figured prominently in the movie “A League of Their Own” might be getting a museum of its own. The Rockford Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously last week to grant a special-use permit to build a $10 million International Women’s Baseball Museum at Beyer Park on the city’s southeast side, the Rockford Register Star reported. The city and the league gained international fame in 1992 when the movie starring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Madonna was released. At the park, Beyer Stadium was the actual home of the real Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and 1950s. To put the museum on the site, the Rockford Park District, which owns Beyer Park, plans to sell an acre of land at the north end of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. The vote came after a group called Friends of Beyer Stadium urged the zoning board to find a different site for the museum – an effort the group said will continue as the issue moves to a Rockford City Council committee on Monday and the full council on Oct. 4.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie:A beverage can company has started work on a factory in eastern Indiana where it expects to produce about 3.6 billion cans a year. A groundbreaking ceremony was held last week for the new aluminum can factory in Muncie that will be operated by Canpack, a subsidiary of the Polish company Giorgi Global. The factory is expected to ultimately employ about 340 people, according to the company. The new factory will help meet the demand for more beverage cans in the U.S., company executive Tom Johnson told The Star Press. Johnson said the company plans to start recruiting employees early next year and have the factory in operation by late 2022. Delaware County approved 15 years of property tax breaks for the new factory, while the state agreed to provide up to $6 million in tax credits and worker training grants.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: At least 16 people in eastern Iowa were charged with gun crimes after a two-day sweep by federal authorities this week. Grand juries met Wednesday through Friday in the U.S. District Court for Northern Iowa and issued the indictments, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported. Many of those indicted have already been charged in state courts for weapons offenses. Most of the indictments were for felons in possession of a firearm or for having a firearm and using drugs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said the state will adopt the recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning Pfizer booster shots as part of the effort to fight COVID-19. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky ruled Thursday that people 65 and older, nursing home residents and those ages 50 and older who have chronic health problems such as diabetes should be offered a booster once they’re six months past their last Pfizer dose. Kelly, a Democrat, said in a news release that she has authorized all COVID-19 vaccine providers to begin administering Pfizer booster shots to eligible Kansans as of Friday. Kelly said the CDC’s announcement “will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable Kansans and our frontline healthcare workers.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear called on the state’s residents Friday to honor a 15-year-old Fayette County student who died from COVID-19 by lighting porches with green lights. In a statement posted to social media, he also urged Kentuckians to “encourage vaccinations among friends and family and to mask up indoors.” Sophomore Christopher “C.J.” Gordon Jr. died from virus, Fayette County Superintendent Demetrus Liggins confirmed Thursday in a news release. Gordon’s mother, Renita Wright Gordon, told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Gordon always put other people first and you rarely saw him “not smiling.” Earlier this month, a 15-year-old Shelby County student who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 before the school year began also died from the virus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: Next month, people can order firewood from the Rapides Parish Sheriff’s Office and in the process help out the community and inmates. Sheriff Mark Wood has started a firewood project that can help recycle the many trees felled by recent hurricanes and winter storms. Priority for the wood will go to elderly and disabled residents of the parish, but anyone can buy up to two ricks beginning Oct. 1. Each rick costs $60, and sales are handled with money orders only. Wood told The Town Talk the object isn’t to make a lot of money through the venture. Some of the proceeds will go toward the upkeep of chainsaws and log splitters, and some will go into the sheriff’s office Inmate Welfare Fund. Money from the fund is “used to purchase basketballs and other sports equipment and work clothes or work boots for those inmates who have an economic need,” according to a news release. Some inmates don’t have family to help them with things like shoes, he said. He said the fund can help provide that so inmates “can continue paying back their debts to society.” Residents interested in buying wood through the program can call (318) 709-8489 to check availability. The sheriff’s office also asks local tree surgeons or cutters to call them if they have hardwood trees needing disposal.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s wild blueberry growers had a bounce-back year this summer after struggling with low prices and small crops sizes in recent seasons. The only commercial-scale wild blueberry growers in the U.S. harvest the fruit in Maine, mostly in the rural Down East region. The 2020 crop was less than 48 million pounds, and that was the lowest number since 2004. But the 2021 season, which ended recently, appeared to be much better, said David Yarborough, emeritus professor of horticulture with the University of Maine. He said the crop was likely about 90 million pounds, which would be the most blueberries since 2016. Growers had a better year in part because of a cool, wet July, Yarborough said. Hot summers and droughts have hurt the crop in recent years. It was also a good season for pollinators, Yarborough said. Prices were also up to about 70 cents per pound to farmers, which would be an improvement of 10 cents from last year and more than twice the number from 2017, when prices cratered, he said. Wild blueberries are smaller than cultivated blueberries, and they serve a slightly different niche in the market. Although many cultivated blueberries are sold fresh, the vast majority of the wild blueberry crop is frozen. The berries are also used extensively in processed food products.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials said two sewer discharges have released an unknown amount of sewage in residential neighborhoods. The City Department of Public Works issued a notice of the overflows Saturday. One occurred in the Reiserstown area northwest of downtown and affected the stream known as Gwynns Falls. The other happened in the Poplar Hill neighborhood north of downtown and impacted the stream known as Jones Falls. Officials urged people to avoid swimming or other contact with the impacted streams.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu has won the endorsement of her former political rival and current office holder, Acting Mayor Kim Janey. Janey made the endorsement Saturday, the Boston Globe reported. In a statement, Janey said Wu has the record and values to protect and build upon the city’s progress in becoming more “equitable, just and resilient.” “Important policies like our housing agenda, equitable vaccine distribution, and how we handle mental health crises are on the line in this election,” said Janey. “Moreover, Black and brown residents who are most impacted by systemic inequities need a leader in City Hall who will center equity and inclusion in all her policies, and ensure they have a seat at the table when real decisions are made.” Wu was the top vote-getter in Sept. 14′s preliminary election. City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George came in second and also advanced to the Nov. 2 general election, and three major contenders – City Councilor Andrea Campbell, Janey, and John Barros – were eliminated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said she will declare unenforceable a Republican-written budget provision that seeks to ban indoor mask requirements for children. The Democrat had been expected to block the language as unconstitutional since $55 billion in spending was unveiled and quickly passed by Michigan’s Legislature earlier this week. Spokesman Bobby Leddy confirmed this week’s move in a statement, calling the proposed restriction “dangerous.” The provision, which is not tied to spending, would prevent the state health director and local health officers from issuing or enforcing orders that require children under age 18 to wear a face covering. More than a dozen counties, including most of the state’s most populated ones, mandate masking in schools to curb COVID-19. Various K-12 districts in other counties also require face coverings. The governor and GOP legislators did negotiate other language related to coronavirus vaccine exemptions and reporting requirements for epidemic orders.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State regulators launched a court-ordered process for assessing the risks to clean water from waste from the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. The Department of Natural Resources announced plans for a trial-like proceeding known as a contested case hearing, which was ordered by the Minnesota Supreme Court in April. The hearing will be confined to the narrow question of whether the bentonite clay lining planned for the mine’s waste basin would be sufficient to keep pollution contained. A prehearing conference has been set for Nov. 1. An administrative law judge will later schedule the hearing itself, which will be a potentially lengthy proceeding in which all sides can present evidence and call witnesses before the neutral judge, who will report his findings back to the agency. The open pit mine and processing plant near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes would be Minnesota’s first copper-nickel mine. Environmentalists have fought it because of the potential for acid mine drainage.PolyMet said the mine will be safe and that the project has undergone more than a decade of thorough, public environmental reviews.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will soon start rebuilding a section of highway that collapsed during torrential rainfall brought by Hurricane Ida, the head of the state Department of Transportation said. Two people were killed and nine injured Aug. 30 as seven vehicles plunged into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital on Sept. 11. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislative budget writers Friday that the department has completed a geotechnical review and will choose a company early next month to repair the damage for about $1.2 million. He said the highway could reopen in about 45 days. White said the area had received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches of rain in less than a day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers who want to halt all public funds to Planned Parenthood are recommending the Legislature give Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration authority to cancel abortion providers’ Medicaid contracts based on behavior in other states deemed illegal or unethical. The Senate Interim Committee on Medicaid Accountability and Taxpayer Protection approved a report with that recommendation on Thursday. Planned Parenthood is Missouri’s only abortion provider. Abortion providers are prohibited from using Medicaid funds for abortion except when the mother’s life is in danger or in the cases of rape or incest. Some lawmakers want to pull all public funds, including those for birth control, sexually transmitted disease treatments, cancer screenings and other health care for low-income women. Democrats warned that the move would trigger a confrontation with the federal government that could threaten the overall Medicaid program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A therapeutic boarding school in northwestern Montana, which state inspectors learned had once made boys sleep outside in winter conditions without proper clothing as punishment, closed Friday. Staffers confirmed to the Montana State News Bureau on Tuesday that the 16-bed Wood Creek Academy near Thompson Falls was shutting down. A message had also been posted on the program’s website, which had been pulled down by Friday. Wood Creek Academy, a residential boarding school for boys ages 13 to 18, had been the subject of two complaints filed with the state within the past year and inspections uncovered other infractions. The state health department sent inspectors to the boarding school in January in response to a complaint. The inspection found two boys ran away from the school one morning in January and Wood Creek Academy staff waited for more than an hour before calling law enforcement. As punishment for running away, staff prohibited the boys from having any interaction with their peers for three days. Such punishment is prohibited under state regulations. The inspector reported the boys also were sent to sleep in shorts and T-shirts in tents as nighttime temperatures dipped as low as 28 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Authorities in south-central Nebraska said a teenage girl survived after a car she was driving collided with a train. The collision was so violent that her car’s engine was ejected. The crash happened Wednesday at a rural railroad crossing west of Kearney, the Kearney Hub reported. Buffalo County Sheriff’s officials said Sydney Conner, 17, was traveling north on a county road about 7:45 a.m. when her car collided with a westbound Union Pacific train. Sheriff’s Sgt. Ramey Ristine said investigators believe Connor was blinded by the rising sun as she approached the crossing and didn’t see the train. There are no crossing arms at that railroad intersection, but it is marked with stop signs.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A hospital in rural northeastern Nevada is pleading with residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to take other precautions to help slow the spread of the coronavirus to “keep our health care system from being overrun.” The Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital in Elko said Friday the virus was “running rampant”” in the region and that the hospital’s intensive care and medical-surgical units were near capacity and that it had postponed elective surgeries and added beds. “As a hospital staff, we are pleading with you to practice the precautions we know are effective in stopping COVID-19,” the hospital said in a statement posted on social media. “Avoid large gatherings, wear a mask when around people from outside your household, observe physical distancing, and practice good hand hygiene. Most importantly, please get vaccinated against COVID-19.” The hospital said wait times were longer than normal but that it was still able to safely provide medical care. “Please help us slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our healthcare system from being overrun,” the hospital said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former high school teacher accused of soliciting sexually explicit videos from a student for money and making and possessing child pornography has pleaded guilty to human trafficking and manufacturing child sex abuse images. Joshua Harwood, 38, of Manchester entered his pleas to the two felony counts on Wednesday, the Concord Monitor reported. Harwood had taught business at the high school, where he was hired in July 2020. Police were notified of the allegations involving a minor in December and Harwood was placed on administrative leave. He was later arrested and has been in jail since February. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 19. On the trafficking charge, attorneys are recommending a sentence of 31/ 2 to seven years in jail, which may be suspended if Harwood completes a sex offender program. They’re recommending a consecutive sentence of 71/2 to 15 years, a portion of which may be suspended, for the manufacturing charge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCherry Hill:The New Jersey craft beer scene took home a few big honors at this year's Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Among the 265 breweries awarded 290 medals from the Brewers Association were Mechanical Brewery of Cherry Hill, which took home the gold in the English mild or bitter category for its Momentum. Departed Soles Brewing Co. of Jersey City and Spellbound Brewing of Mount Holly each took home silver medals. The Jersey City brewery was honored in a gluten-free beer category for None Shall PATH, and the Mount Holly brewery won for its wood- and barrel-aged beer for Porter Aged on Palo Santo. The Great American Beer Festival honored beers in 97 categories spanning 175 styles in the 35th edition of its competition, with judging held across 17 days and 34 sessions, according to a news release.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham visited southern New Mexico on Friday to talk with fellow elected Democratic leaders and business groups about economic development and to tour a military base near the U.S.-Mexico border where Afghan refugees are being housed. The Democrat’s visit was not made public until late in the afternoon. Her office said she walked through the processing area at Fort Bliss Army base, spoke with volunteers about the need for winter coats and other items for those at the facility and saw how the refugees were screened for COVID-19. “Whenever the federal government tells us they need our help, New Mexico is ready to help these families on their way,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement after the tour. There was no indication that Lujan Grisham visited the U.S.-Mexico border while in the area. She has faced criticism in recent months for not doing more to address the concerns of residents along the border amid the latest influx of immigrants.\n\nNew York\n\nHolbrook: Mourners began arriving at a Long Island funeral home viewing Sunday for Gabby Petito, whose death on a cross-country trip has sparked a manhunt for her boyfriend. A line had formed outside the funeral home in Holbrook, about 35 miles east of New York City, by noon, and groups of firefighters were seen filing past. A fire truck sat on each side of the building, each with its ladder raised. Across the street from the funeral home, a chain link fence was adorned with posters featuring Petito’s image and messages such as, “She touched the world.” Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Brian Laundrie visited parks in the West. Her body was discovered Sept. 19 in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Laundrie and Petito grew up on Long Island but in recent years moved to Florida. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results. The couple posted online about their trip in a white Ford Transit van converted into a camper. They got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab, Utah, that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night. But no charges were filed, and no serious injuries were reported. Investigators have been searching for Laundrie in Florida, and searched his parents’ home in North Port, about 35 miles south of Sarasota.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Authorities said a bank robber was caught after they determined he had taken his getaway vehicle for a test drive from a car dealer. The Raleigh-based U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release that 68-year-old Glenn Alin Martinoff was sentenced to more than four years in prison on Thursday after previously pleading guilty to bank robbery. The news release said Martinoff entered a Wilmington bank in January wearing a mask and gloves and brandishing a large screwdriver. He robbed the location of more than $6,000, authorities said. Investigators using surveillance video determined his getaway car was for sale at a nearby dealership. The news release said that authorities found out he had taken the car for a test drive to use as his getaway car. The news release said investigators found the cash and clothing worn during the robbery during a search of his apartment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMakoti: The first car jumping attempt in five years by North Dakota’s version of Evil Knievel ended in disaster when the car driven by the man known as the Flying Farmer corkscrewed off the ramp and rolled. Authorities said John Smith, 57, was alert after the crash Saturday at a rural gravel pit and that he even tried to pull himself out of the car while talking to rescuers. He was eventually cut out and taken by a medical helicopter to a hospital, according to firefighters. The extent of his injuries wasn’t known. The crowd of about 300 spectators went silent when Smith crashed. Family members, including his daughters and wife of 34 years, Melinda, reacted emotionally, running to the mangled car, The Bismarck Tribune reported. Smith’s previous jump was in 2016, when he rose over towering flames to clear a burning trailer. Smith, who farms near Makoti, in western North Dakota, said he was inspired by the motorcycle daredevil Knievel while growing up. He has gained notoriety for his jumps at fairs and other attractions across the state. He has performed more than 100 jumps, even jumping on a frozen lake.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine’s top lobbyist, a man linked to an ongoing federal bribery investigation but never charged, resigned Friday after three years on the job. Legislative Director Dan McCarthy cited “the pace and grind” of the job and referred to predecessors who warned him against serving more than two years. “I know I’ve run quite a bit over my two year commitment but I think now is the right time to resign as your Legislative Director,” McCarthy wrote in his letter to DeWine. Federal prosecutors charged five individuals last year, including the then-House speaker, with orchestrating a $60 million bribery scheme to assure the 2019 passage of a bill bailing out two nuclear power plants. Prosecutors said the scheme also involved killing efforts to put a petition on the ballot to overturn the bailout. The power plants were operated at the time by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. McCarthy is a former FirstEnergy lobbyist who was president of one of the dark money groups, Partners for Progress, which has been implicated in the alleged bribery scheme. McCarthy has said his actions were legal and DeWine’s office has said it has no indication McCarthy is a target of the investigation, which continues.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOkmulgee: Muscogee Nation voters have approved press protections for their tribe’s news enterprise. Citizens voted 1,914-596 last week to amend the tribe’s constitution to include press protections and mandate funding for Mvskoke Media, Indian Country Today reported. Although freedom of the press is guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, many tribal nations lack such language in their constitutions. The Muscogee amendment allows the tribe’s news enterprise – which includes print, broadcast and digital operations – to operate “free from political interest or undue influence, harassment, censorship, control or restrictions from any department” of the tribe’s government. The effort traces to 2015, when the tribe passed the Free Press Act establishing independent media. Its governing body later repealed the law during an emergency meeting. Last year, tribal leaders unanimously restored the press freedoms by passing the Independent Muscogee (Creek) Press Act, which was viewed as a positive step.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: A school board has banned educators from displaying Black Lives Matter and gay pride symbols, prompting a torrent of recriminations and threats to boycott the town and its businesses. Newberg, a town of 25,000 residents situated 25 miles southwest of Portland in gorgeous wine country, has become an unlikely focal point of a fight between the left and right across the nation over schooling. The City Council has condemned the action by the Newberg School Board. So did members of color of the Oregon Legislature and House and Senate Democrats. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon is threatening to sue. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. But the four conservative members of the seven-member board are digging in their heels. Member Brian Shannon, who proposed the ban, said lawmakers from Portland should keep out of the school district’s business and instead focus on Portland, where homelessness is an issue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has joined a federal investigation of Pennsylvania’s largest pension fund and is seeking among other things records to determine whether improper “compensation and gifts” might have been offered staff, a newspaper reported. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the commission is also seeking records earlier sought by the U.S. attorney’s office about what officials of the $64 billion Public School Employees’ Retirement System have called a mistake in calculating the fund’s long-term investment performance. The newspaper reported that the subpoena given to the school pension plan Friday was the first indication that investigators are looking into possible presents or money from investment advisers and consultants. State employees are forbidden from accepting such gifts under a ban imposed by Gov. Tom Wolf. The Securities and Exchange Commission pursues civil rather than criminal complaints and has broad power to impose fines, discipline financial players and order changes. Pension fund system spokesperson Steve Esack said Saturday that the fund had no comment on the SEC action, the newspaper said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The man authorities sid leads the Rhode Island chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club has turned down a plea deal that would have sent him to prison for five years, and will now take his chances at trial. Joseph Lancia, 30, of Smithfield told a judge Thursday that he would rather go to trial, WPRI-TV reported. He faces multiple criminal counts stemming from two incidents. In one case, he is charged with shooting at a truck in June 2019 being driven by a former Hells Angels prospect with whom he had a dispute. He is charged with felony assault and battery in that case. He is also charged with knocking someone unconscious with a punch outside a Providence strip club in March 2020. Prosecutors initially offered a deal that came with eight years in prison, but after speaking with the judge, the sentence was lowered to five. Assistant Attorney General Joseph McBurney said if Lancia is found guilty at trial on all counts, he faces 61 years behind bars. Lancia, who is out on bail, refused to comment outside of court.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSt. George: State transportation officials want to hear from the public about a project to widen part of Interstate 26 and improve one of the state’s key interchanges. The state is spending $19 million on preliminary engineering work to widen 22 miles of I-26 in Orangeburg, Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The project also will modernize I-26’s interchange with Interstate 95. The tight, curving off ramps often cause backups. The Department of Transportation is accepting comments about the project until Oct. 10 on its website. The project from Exit 165 to Exit 187 on I-26 will also improve interchanges and take other steps to make the highway safer. It is also part of a larger plan to have three lanes in each direction on I-26 from Charleston to Columbia by the end of the decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A Missouri-based battery manufacturer has selected Rapid City for a factory complex that it said could employ up to 1,500 people. AEsir Technologies plans to construct four buildings. The first building will be a 150,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution center capable of producing 1.2 million batteries annually. The company initially plans to hire 400 employees and expand to 1,200 to 1,500 employees. The first phase will cost about $90 million, with a total price tag of $300 million when all four phases of the development are finished, according to CEO Randy Moore. The company looked for an available labor force, an economic development incentive package and community support when searching for the ideal location for the new facility, Moore said. Twenty other communities were considered for the facility. Moore said easy access to rail, a state highway and Rapid City Regional Airport were also factors in the company’s decision to choose Rapid City. AEsir Technologies manufactures nickel zinc batteries that Moore said are two to three times more powerful than lithium ion batteries and last just as long. He said they use potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte, an active ingredient in soaps and shampoos, which makes the batteries environmentally friendly.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Tennessee Supreme Court Justice Cornelia Clark has died at the age of 71, the court announced Friday. She had been diagnosed with cancer. According to a news release, Clark died overnight after 16 years in her role, serving the longest tenure of her counterparts on the court while she was on the bench for more than 1,100 Supreme Court cases. Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who will select Clark’s replacement, called her a “trailblazer for women in the legal profession.” Clark was appointed to her seat in 2005 by former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen and served as chief justice from 2010 to 2012. Chief Justice Roger Page said Clark, better known as Connie, “loved the Tennessee judicial system and has made it better in immeasurable ways.” All but one of the remaining justices – Sharon Lee, whom Bredesen also appointed – were appointees of former Gov. Bill Haslam, signaling a likely shift further rightward for the court with an appointment by Lee. The Governor’s Council for Judicial Appointments will recommend three candidates to the governor, who will make his pick. The Legislature must confirm the selection.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A group of 14 Mexican soldiers was detained Saturday after inadvertently crossing the border at the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said. The soldiers were returned to Mexico after being detained by CBP for about 5 hours. One of the soldiers was issued a civil fine for being in possession of a personal-use amount of marijuana, CBP said. The incident occurred shortly after midnight Saturday when CBP officers saw two Mexican military vehicles cross the international border line on the middle of the bridge, CBP said. The bridge is also known as Puente Internacional Córdova de las Américas and as the Puente Libre, or free bridge, because there is no bridge toll charge. CBP officers approached the military trucks and temporarily detained the soldiers and secured their weapons and equipment. Photos shared on social media showed soldiers sitting on the asphalt and a military pickup stopped near the CBP checkpoints at the foot of the bridge on the El Paso side. The soldiers told CBP that they did not realize they had entered U.S. territory. CBP contacted Mexican military leadership who soon arrived at the international bridge. Shortly before 5 a.m., all the soldiers, equipment and vehicles were returned to Mexico, CBP said. Similar border incidents have occurred over the years, often involving Mexican soldiers or federal police from other parts of Mexico who cross the borderline into the U.S. at the middle of the international bridges in El Paso.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The home arena of the NBA’s Utah Jazz announced Friday that it will require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test for all fans over the age of 12. Vivint Smart Home Arena, located in Salt Lake City, will require fans to present proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of the event to enter the venue. Employees who work at the arena are required to be fully vaccinated. “As a community gathering place, we have a responsibility to protect our guests by putting health and safety standards in place,” Jim Olson, president of Vivint Arena and the Utah Jazz, said in a statement. “We believe this is the path forward to shut down this pandemic.” Guests under the age of 12 will be allowed inside the arena if they wear a mask at all times. Other guests are strongly encouraged to wear a face mask, but it is not mandatory.\n\nVermont\n\nWilliston: Three people were sent to a hospital with nonlife-threatening complaints Friday after being exposed to bear spray at a local hotel, the Williston Fire Department said. Emergency crews were sent to a local inn about 10:30 a.m. Friday after receiving a report that four employees were having difficulty breathing. The investigation determined a can of bear attack deterrent was left in one of the second floor rooms where it was accidentally discharged by housekeeping staff. Bear spray is stronger than police pepper spray. Officials said 30 people in the hotel were evacuated. Three people were taken to a hospital and a fourth was treated at the hotel and released. The firefighters ventilated the building. Occupants and staff of the hotel were able to reoccupy the building shortly after noon.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia has announced plans for a new performing arts center funded by a $50 million donation. University President Jim Ryan said the gift is being made by Tessa Ader. The news release said the new center for dance, concerts, theater and other performances will be in the area known as the Emmet-Ivy corridor. “My late husband, Richard, and I long felt that a state-of-the-art performing arts center was needed by the University of Virginia,” Ader said in a statement to The Daily Progress. “I believe this new facility will be a wonderful asset to our community and am hopeful my gift will encourage others to come forward as well to make it a reality.” Although designs haven’t been completed, the university said the center will include a concert hall with more than 1,000 seats, a 150-seat recital hall and rehearsal studios. The center will also hold national touring artists. “The performing arts center will be a place that celebrates the arts as fundamental to the human condition, a university education and a democratic society,” Ryan said in the news release.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An administrative law judge has recommended that a Native American tribe in Washington state once again be allowed to hunt gray whales – a major step in its decadeslong effort to resume the ancient practice. “This is a testament to what we’ve been saying all these years: that we’re doing everything we can to show we’re moving forward responsibly,” Patrick DePoe, vice chairman of the Makah Tribe on the remote northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, said Friday. “We’re not doing this for commercial reasons. We’re doing it for spiritual and cultural reasons.” DePoe was in high school in the late 1990s when the Makah were last allowed to hunt whales – occasions that drew angry protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Since then, the tribe’s attempts have been tied up in legal challenges and scientific review. A federal appeals court ruled in 2002 that the Makah needed a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act; the tribe applied for one in 2005 but still hasn’t received one. On Thursday, nearly two years after he presided over a hearing on NOAA Fisheries’ proposal to approve the waiver, administrative law Judge George Jordan issued his 156-page recommendation to the U.S. Department of Commerce, finding that the tribal hunts would have no effect on the healthy overall population of the whales. The recommendation, along with a public comment period and further environmental analysis, will inform the department’s final decision, though no timeline for that has been set. As proposed, the waiver would allow the tribe to land up to 20 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with hunts timed to minimize the low chances of the hunters accidentally harpooning an endangered Western North Pacific gray whale.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice is urging residents who got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to get their booster shot, citing the rising number of hospitalizations involving vaccinated people. There were 16,223 active COVID-19 cases reported statewide on Friday, with 1,008 people being treated in a hospital, according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. The number of fully vaccinated people who have been hospitalized has increased 20%, Justice said. “That tells us there’s a growing need, more and more and more, for people that are fully vaccinated to get their booster shot,” he said. He said booster shots are available, for the most part, for people age 18 and over who had their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Booster shots are not yet available for other vaccines. Justice also pleaded again for the unvaccinated to get the vaccine. He said 3,700 doses have been given since the last update, but that’s not enough. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia ranks last among the states in doses administered per 100,000 population.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:North America’s oldest polar bear living in human care at the Milwaukee County Zoo has died, zoo officials said Saturday. The Journal Sentinel reported 36-year-old Snow Lilly was euthanized Friday because of her declining health and subsequent quality of life concerns. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the median life expectancy for polar bears in human care is about 23 years. A recent wellness exam found Snow Lilly had heart disease and was undergoing other age-related changes, the release said. Snow Lilly came to the Milwaukee County Zoo in 2005 from the Bronx Zoo. “Snow Lilly was a visitor favorite at the Zoo and considered one of the iconic animals in the population,” said Zoo Director Amos Morris in a statement. “She will be sorely missed by both staff and visitors.” In recent years, the zoo called on Snow Lilly to stand in for a groundhog and usher in spring at a Groundhog’s Day celebration in 2018. She also shared a birthday with Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich. A necropsy will be performed, as important information can continue to be collected from it and help other polar bears living in human care. Final necropsy results will be forthcoming in the upcoming months.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Kristi Gabriel, 42, who survived a brush with death with COVID-19 but also lost her father and aunt to the disease, is pleading for the public to get vaccinated. “Even though I’ve gone through what I’ve gone through, some of my family still doesn’t agree with the vaccine,” she said. “And it’s shocking.

Savers could lose ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country's rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nPeter had put his life savings of about $6 million into accounts at three small banks in China's central Henan province. He says he hasn't been able to access them since April.\n\nThe 45-year-old entrepreneur asked us to call him Peter for security reasons. He's from the eastern city of Wenzhou and is just one of thousands of depositors who have been fighting to recover their savings from at least six banks in rural provinces in central China.\n\n\"I'm close to having a nervous breakdown. I can't sleep,\" Peter told CNN Business.\n\nWhen he tried to access his accounts online, a statement would pop up on the homepage informing him that the website was under maintenance and services would be unavailable for a while, Peter told CNN Business. Two months later, those services have not been restored.\n\nThe trouble began in April, when four banks in Henan suspended cash withdrawals.\n\nIn China, local banks are only permitted to obtain deposits from their home customer base, but authorities say that \"third-party platforms\" were used to acquire funds from depositors outside the region. In Peter's case, for example, his hometown is over 700 miles away from the banks in Henan.\n\nThe national banking regulator has accused a major shareholder of the four banks of illegally attracting money from savers. \"Henan New Fortune Group, a shareholder of the four village banks, has illegally absorbed the public's funds through internal and external collusion, the use of third-party platforms, and fund brokers,\" the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission told state-run Xinhua News Agency in May.\n\nDepositors protest in front of the Henan branch of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, demanding their money back after their funds were frozen.\n\n\"The police have opened a case for investigation into the matter,\" it added.\n\nRuns on small Chinese banks have become more frequent in recent years and some have been accused of financial improprieties or corruption. But experts worry that a much bigger financial problem could be looming, caused by fallout from a real estate crash and soaring bad debts related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThere are no official estimates yet on the total amount of funds that bank depositors are unable to withdraw. CNN Business did not receive a comment from the local police or the national banking regulator.\n\nunable to access their savings, according to an estimate in April by As many as 400,000 banking customers across China wereunable to access their savings, according to an estimate in April by Sanlian Lifeweek , a state-owned magazine.\n\nThat's a drop in the ocean of China's vast banking system, but about a quarter of the industry's total assets are held by around 4,000 small lenders, which often have opaque ownership and governance structures and are more vulnerable to corruption, say experts, and the sharp economic slowdown.\n\n\"The scope of the bank scandals where bank officials embezzle and steal funds from depositors is alarming, and what is exposed could only be the tip of the iceberg,\" said Frank Xie, a professor at University of South Carolina Aiken who studies Chinese business and the economy.\n\n\"As the Chinese economy slows down further, the fiscal shortage worsens, and the debt repayments become more widespread among Chinese companies, especially in the real estate sector, bank runs could become more often and on a larger scale,\" he said.\n\nMany savers have had enough. Late last month, hundreds of depositors traveled to Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan, to protest outside the office of the banking regulator and to demand their money back, to no avail.\n\nAnother protest was planned in June. But as the depositors arrived in Zhengzhou, they were stunned to find that their health codes — which were green upon departure — had turned red, according to six people who spoke with CNN and social media posts. Anyone with a red code — usually assigned to people infected with Covid or deemed by authorities to be at high risk of infection — immediately becomes persona non grata.\n\nThey are banned from all public venues and transport and are often subject to weeks of government quarantine.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Zhengzhou government for comment. The Henan Provincial Health Commission told state-run news website thepaper.cn it was \"investigating and verifying\" the complaints from depositors who received red codes.\n\nWhat's behind the problem in Henan\n\nIn Henan, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has put the blame on the private investment firm that holds large stakes in all four lenders.\n\nLast week, the Henan police said that a criminal gang headed by the investment firm's controller \"has been suspected of using village banks to commit serious crimes.\" Police say several suspects have been arrested.\n\nThe Henan New Fortune Group no longer has a website. CNN tried to reach the company for comment on the phone and by email without success. The company has made no public statements and it's believed to have been annulled.\n\nLater on Monday, the four Henan banks said they would start collecting information from customers who have been affected by the shutdown of their online transaction systems. The move was required by financial regulators, the banks added in separate statements on their website, without elaborating further.\n\nThat's of little comfort to the banks' customers. Deposits up to 500,000 yuan (almost $75,000) are guaranteed in the event of bank failures, but that's not enough for some — like Peter — and if the government's investigation finds that their savings are \"non-compliant\" transactions, they could lose everything.\n\n\"I'm quite worried about how they [authorities] are going to deal with our money,\" said Ye, who asked CNN Business to only use his surname. Ye is a 30-year old tech worker from the city of Dongguan in Guangdong province — about 1500 km (900 miles) from the banks he used in Henan. He said he has a total of 160,000 yuan (about $24,000) worth of deposits with them.\n\n\"We were told by the banks that the deposit products were legal, and that they were protected by the deposit insurance scheme,\" he said. \"We just want to get our money back.\"\n\nThe four banks — Yuzhou Xinminsheng Village Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank, New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng — have not replied to requests for comment.\n\nRisky liabilities\n\nIn early 2021, Beijing banned banks from selling deposit products via third party online platforms, fearing that the rapid expansion of the fintech sector could increase risks in the wider financial system. The People's Bank of China called such practices \"illegal financial activities.\"\n\nSo why were small local banks in Henan apparently ignoring the ban and raising deposits from savers — like Ye, who live on the other side of the country?\n\nChina's national banking and insurance regulator says third party online platforms allowed them to bypass these geographical restrictions and grow their business nationwide.\n\nBaidu BIDU JD.com. JD In the Henan case, various state-run media are reporting that the deposit products were sold via platforms affiliated with, or owned by, giants of China's tech scene such asand\n\nThose platforms — Du Xiaoman Financial, which is the financial affiliate of Baidu, as well as JD Finance — have not responded to requests for comment.\n\n\"The central government regulators seem to be incapable of enforcing those regulations aimed at preventing this kind of bank run from occurring,\" said Frank Xie, the Chinese economy expert. He added that corruption was \"rampant\" at local levels of financial institutions.\n\n\"Perpetrators such as the person stealing millions from the depositors often get shielded by accomplices in governments and in the upper-level management of the banks,\" Xie said.\n\n\"The core problem is that China's financial system simply expanded far too fast relative to the size of the economy over the previous decade,\" said Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group.\n\nChina's banking sector has increased sixfold in size since 2008, with total assets reaching over $50 trillion, according to government statistics.\n\nThe funding structure of small lenders also makes them more risky, say experts.\n\nCompared with big banks, they are more reliant on deposits for funding. Many of them offer high interest rates to attract commercial and interbank deposits. But as the slowing economy means borrowers struggle to repay the banks, it becomes difficult for them to deliver the returns they offered savers.\n\n\"The funding structure of liabilities in many of China's mostly smaller and regional banks is most likely still vulnerable to deposit runs, lender caution, and deteriorating economic performance and rising unemployment,\" said George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University and former chief economist at UBS.\n\nDeteriorating financial health\n\nThe Henan crisis arrived at a time when public confidence in China's banking system was already waning.\n\nIn the past decade, Beijing has been clamping down on \"shadow banking\" activities — which means unregulated, off-the-book lending by financial institutions — on worries that most of the funds had been diverted to property developers and local government infrastructure projects, leading to a rapid run-up in debt and growing financial risks.\n\nIn 2019, China seized control of Baoshang Bank, based in Inner Mongolia, citing serious credit risks posed by the lender.\n\nIt was the first bank seizure in China in more than 20 years and the lender was declared bankrupt.\n\nThe following year, there were at least five bank runs at small lenders, mostly triggered by public fears following reports of financial distress at the banks or anti-graft investigations into bank executives.\n\n\"Financial institutions are still grappling with some of the losses that have resulted, particularly in China's northeast, central provinces, and western regions, where shadow banking activities had expanded the fastest over the past decade,\" Wright said.\n\nMaking matters worse, \"the ongoing slowdowns in the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic have further exposed financial institutions to new credit risks as well,\" Wright added.\n\nSpillover effects\n\nInvestors are closely watching the government's investigation into the Henan bank run. Analysts are gauging possible spillover effects to other banks.\n\n\"The economy is a key reason why affected banks might be experiencing difficulties, and it is quite possible that other banks will be affected, perhaps even larger banks, given that the fate of the property market and real estate prices hang in the balance,\" said Magnus from Oxford University.\n\nThe Chinese economy has been struggling with the country's zero-Covid policy . Many cities have been placed under full or partial lockdowns since March, wreaking havoc on activity. Analysts are worried that the economy could contract in the second quarter.\n\n\"This could have multiplier effects given that real estate as an asset class could be compromised now for a few years,\" Magnus said.\n\nChina's gigantic real estate sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of its GDP, is in a worsening downturn. Sales by the country's top 100 developers collapsed 59% in May from a year ago , according to a recent survey by property research firm Cric China.\n\nEvergrande — one of the country's biggest developers — is undergoing a huge restructuring after it defaulted on its debts late last year. Analysts have long feared Evergrande's collapse could have ripple effects across the property industry and spill over to the financial system.\n\nProperty loans accounts for nearly 30% of outstanding loans with China's financial institutions.\n\nAnalysts aren't yet worrying about a financial crisis — because the PBOC is likely to ensure that larger and systemically more important banks are protected.\n\nBut the discontent triggered by the bank runs could be a major concern for the government.\n\nWhen Covid health codes of depositors turned red early last week, derailing a planned protest in Zhengzhou, it sparked a massive outcry on social media.\n\n\"Now (the authorities) can stop you from petitioning by directly putting digital shackles on you, aka giving you red codes,\" said one comment on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform.\n\nDozens of depositors were taken into a quarantine hotel guarded by police and local officials, before being sent away on trains bound for their hometowns the next day; others were \"quarantined\" at several other locations in the city, including a college campus, according to the witnesses and online posts.\n\n\"Many people lost their lifetime savings because of this and [if] more incidences like this takes place, and [if] a bank run is met with a government crackdown, social unrest will be the only end result,\" Xie said.\n\n— Nectar Gan, CNN's Beijing bureau, and Wayne Chang contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Laura He", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/26/cathedral-change-whip-crackdown-conjuring-house-news-around-states/118950862/", "title": "Cathedral change, whip crackdown: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state has averaged more than 100 deaths a day from COVID-19 over the past week, statistics showed Thursday, giving it the nation’s highest death rate over the period even as hospitalizations linked to the coronavirus pandemic continue to decline. Statistics from Johns Hopkins University show 106 deaths were reported statewide daily over the past seven days, although some of those could have occurred earlier because of a lag in reporting. Alabama’s rate of 18 deaths for every 100,000 people over the past week is far above second-place West Virginia, which had 10 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The increase in deaths come as hospitalizations in the state fell below 1,800 patients for the first time in a month, a change health officials said likely was due both to people getting well and to others dying. While more people are getting vaccinated than before the highly contagious delta strain of the virus took hold, the state still has one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates, and its chief health officer said still more people need to get shots because the risk of getting infected remains high. Nearly 13,800 people have died of COVID-19 in Alabama, according to state health statistics.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials outlined plans Wednesday to help hospitals with crisis standards of care if needed amid a surge in COVID-19 cases and announced short-term contracts for more than 400 health care personnel to relieve medical facilities with overtaxed staffs. State health commissioner Adam Crum signed an addendum to a public health emergency order that he said provides guidance to hospitals, care providers and local health authorities if the crisis standards of care are needed. Crisis standards of care provide guidelines for administering care in extraordinary circumstances in which there are insufficient resources to provide levels of care that patients would normally get. Earlier this month, Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage implemented crisis standards, with Dr. Kristen Solana Walkinshaw, the hospital’s chief of staff, writing that the number of patients and level of care that they needed were exceeding the hospital’s resources. Alaska has recently had the highest per-capita rate of COVID-19 cases, according to a tracker by Johns Hopkins.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A lawyer for several abortion providers urged a federal judge Wednesday to block a new state law that would allow prosecutors to charge doctors who knowingly terminate a pregnancy solely because the fetus has a genetic abnormality such as Down syndrome. The law, set to take effect Wednesday, is so vague that it would dissuade doctors from performing an abortion anytime there’s an indication the fetus might have a genetic problem for fear of criminal prosecution, argued Emily Nestler, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “There are women in Arizona whose access to abortion will be eliminated altogether,” Nestler said. “So the burden is more than substantial. It’s absolute for those patients.” A lawyer for the state argued the law won’t block any woman from getting an abortion, though she might have to refuse to tell her doctor why she wants to terminate her pregnancy. “It sends a message to the medical community that the state believes strongly that physicians should not be performing intentionally discriminatory abortions,” said Michael Catlett, a deputy solicitor general in Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office. Catlett argues the law upholds the state’s interest in protecting the disability community from discrimination and upholding the integrity of the medical profession.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An Arkansas man has pleaded guilty to assaulting a flight attendant on a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Little Rock last year. Leon Anderson, 40, of Maumelle, pleaded guilty Wednesday to interfering with a flight attendant, federal prosecutors said. They said he grabbed a flight attendant several times during the February 2020 flight and made inappropriate sexual comments to him. The flight attendant notified the captain, who notified law enforcement. Anderson faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state on Wednesday became the first to bar mega-retailers from firing warehouse workers for missing quotas that interfere with bathroom and rest breaks under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that grew from Amazon’s drive to speed goods to consumers more quickly. The measure also bars Amazon, the online retail giant, and similar companies from disciplining workers for following health and safety laws and allows employees to sue to suspend unsafe quotas or reverse retaliation. The bill applies to all warehouse distribution centers, though proponents were driven by Amazon’s dominance. “We cannot allow corporations to put profit over people,” Newsom, a Democrat, said in a news release announcing he had signed the law. The law, AB 701, was authored by Democratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, a lawyer and former labor leader. She accused Amazon of disciplining warehouse workers at the direction of “an algorithm” that tracks employees’ activities and can determine that anything not directly related to moving packages is “off-task.” “Amazon is pushing workers to risk their bodies for next-day delivery, while they can’t so much as use the restroom without fearing retaliation,” Gonzalez said when the Legislature passed her bill. Amazon did not respond for requests for comment.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A police sergeant who was placed on administrative leave following the rough arrest of a 73-year-old woman with dementia has resigned. The Loveland Police Department announced Wednesday evening that Phil Metzler submitted his resignation amid a disciplinary review. Police Chief Robert Ticer said in a statement that Metzler’s resignation “closes one more chapter of an incident that has tarnished the hard work of the men and women of the Loveland Police Department.” Then-officer Austin Hopp arrested Karen Garner after she left a store without paying for $13.88 worth of items in June 2020. Police body camera video shows that after she turned away from him, he grabbed her arm and pushed her to the ground. A federal lawsuit that Garner filed, which has since been settled for $3 million, claimed he dislocated her shoulder by shoving her handcuffed left arm forward onto the hood of a patrol car. Metzler was captured on body camera footage dismissing a passerby’s excessive force concerns. A working phone number for him could not be found Wednesday evening. Hopp and another officer who responded to help him are being criminally prosecuted for their actions.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A high school that recently resumed full in-person learning for the first time since the onset of the pandemic sent students home temporarily for remote learning – not because of the virus but because of issues with misbehavior. New Britain High School, in suburban Hartford, is “hitting the refresh button” and will restart the school year, Principal Damon Pearce wrote in a letter late Tuesday to students and families. Pearce initially said instruction would be done remotely through the end of this week, but the district later notified parents that students would be welcome back Thursday for a half-day. Mayor Erin Stewart said she was told the school made its decision because of difficulties controlling student behavior, particularly vandalism and fighting. “I’m disappointed in this decision, it’s not fair to the majority of students who behave respectfully and want to be in school to learn,” Stewart, a Republican, said in a Facebook post. Many districts across the country have reported issues with behavior, including vandalism apparently promoted by a viral TikTok challenge. The problems at New Britain involve 50 to 60 students, school officials said. A spokesperson for the state Department of Education, Eric Scoville, said the district’s actions conflicted with state guidance that doesn’t recommend a move to full remote learning.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State officials are offering drivers a chance to settle their toll debts. Anyone with outstanding violations from Route 1 or Interstate 96 from January 2014 to April 2020 is eligible. The one-time amnesty program will allow drivers to settle their debts for a fraction of what they owe, the Department of Transportation said. The department is waiving civil penalties and administrative fees if drivers pay the original toll and an amnesty fee. Starting Oct. 1, drivers with toll violations will be sent a letter offering amnesty, and they’ll have 60 days to settle their debt. Drivers can arrange to make payments on their balance, but they must be paid off by Dec. 31. With various fees and a civil penalty surcharge, an unpaid $1 toll can grow to $88.50 in less than two months. The program aims to collect debts that otherwise might go unpaid. Delaware collects more than $190 million annually from the tolls on I-95 and Route 1, but officials said the state is owed more than $143 million in toll debt.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Washington National Cathedral has chosen contemporary artist Kerry James Marshall, renowned for his wide-ranging works depicting African American life, to design new stained-glass windows with themes of racial justice that will replace a set with Confederate imagery that the landmark sanctuary removed in 2017. The cathedral on Thursday said Marshall will design four windows that will tell “a new and more complete” story of the nation’s racial history. Poet Elizabeth Alexander will write a poem to be inscribed in stone tablets alongside the windows, overlaying older tablets that venerated the lives of Confederate soldiers, the cathedral said in a statement. The project is expected to be completed by 2023. The windows will replace a set that had honored two Confederate generals, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, with saint-like reverence and had included a Confederate flag. The cathedral removed them in 2017, prompted by a larger national reckoning over Confederate imagery and white supremacy in the wake of a series of deadly attacks. The window openings have been covered with plywood since 2017. In replacing the windows, the cathedral is acknowledging the need to correct what it called a “false narrative of what America once was.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A federal judge has struck down portions of an immigration enforcement law that was a priority of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, saying in her ruling that the measure was racially motivated. U.S. Judge Beth Bloom on Tuesday rejected sections of the law that ban local government sanctuary policies and require local law enforcement to make their best effort to work with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The office of DeSantis, who signed the bill into law with much fanfare in 2019 as a priority of his administration, said Wednesday that it would appeal. Bloom repeatedly said that the law was racially motivated and that its supporters showed no evidence why it was needed to lower crime. She said the bill’s sponsor was guided by anti-immigrant hate groups such as Floridians for Immigration Enforcement. “Allowing anti-immigrant hate groups that overtly promote xenophobic, nationalist, racist ideologies to be intimately involved in a bill’s legislative process is a significant departure from procedural norms,” Bloom wrote. “This involvement strongly suggests that the Legislature enacted SB 168 to promote and ratify the racist views of these advocacy groups.” Bloom cited numerous communication between Floridians for Immigration Enforcement and staff for state Sen. Joe Gruters, who sponsored the bill and serves as chairman of the Florida Republican Party.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A man who was punched and kicked in the head by police officers during a traffic stop four years ago has filed a lawsuit alleging that the stop was unjustified and that the officers used excessive force against him. Gwinnett County police Sgt. Michael Bongiovanni pulled Demetrius Hollins over in Lawrenceville, just outside Atlanta, on April 12, 2017. Video filmed by a witness shows Bongiovanni punching Hollins as he stood with his hands raised after exiting his car. A second video shows Bongiovanni appearing to yell at a handcuffed Hollins, who then lies face-down in a left-turn lane of a busy intersection. Officer Robert McDonald runs up and immediately appears to stomp on Hollins’ head. Hollins, who was 22 at the time of the traffic stop, said during a news conference Wednesday that he still has “some kind of PTSD from this situation.” The federal lawsuit says Bongiovanni pulled Hollins over without justification and then retaliated with excessive force after Hollins began using his cellphone to record video of the encounter. It says McDonald knew Hollins was not a threat when he arrived on scene but still kicked him in the head and held him down with a gun pressed to his head. Both officers were fired the next day after video of the traffic stop surfaced and were subsequently charged with multiple crimes related to the stop.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has yet to submit a court-ordered management plan for air tours over its public land. The action is required 21 years after the Air Tour Management Act of 2000 was enacted and a year after a federal judge ruled in favor of environmental groups, including one from the Big Island, that petitioned the court to enforce the law, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The court gave the parks until August 2022 to complete the plans. The law requires commercial air tours over national parks and some tribal lands to obtain federal permits. Federal agencies are also required to include conditions or prohibitions for flying over some wilderness areas. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokeswoman Jessica Ferracane said in an email to the Tribune-Herald that the National Park Service and Federal Aviation Administration are working on rules for all parks and will release plans in the coming months. Bob Ernst, a founding board member of environmental group Hawaii Island Coalition Malama Pono, fears Hawaii Volcanoes National Park will continue a business-as-usual approach. “National parks aren’t playgrounds,” Ernst said. “They’re not moneymaking venues for private enterprise – especially the designated wilderness areas.” He said companies “can develop air tours that operate offshore with the view of the island.”\n\nIdaho\n\nFiler: A south-central Idaho school district with about 1,600 students is temporarily closing its schools due to not having enough teachers or substitute teachers. The Filer School District announced on its website Wednesday that schools will close Friday and reopen Oct. 4. The announcement included a note saying that anyone interested in becoming a substitute teacher should contact the district. Aaron Phinney, the school district’s business manager, told The Times-News that COVID-19-related absences are only partially behind the low staffing levels. The Gooding School District with 1,300 students has also been struggling to find teachers. That district’s school board on Tuesday voted to end a mask mandate at schools.\n\nIllinois\n\nEvanston: Northwestern University announced its largest donation ever Wednesday, a $480 million gift that will be used for many priorities, from biomedicine to the campus football stadium. The money is coming from alumni Patrick and Shirley Ryan and family, who were already the school’s largest supporters, Northwestern said Wednesday. The money will support research in digital medicine, neurosciences, global health and other medical sciences, as well as support programs in microeconomics and the Kellogg School of Management. “Advancing scientific discovery, especially in human health, has been a long-standing priority for our family,” Shirley Ryan said. Northwestern also will redevelop Ryan Field, which is named for the family, whose billionaire status is tied to the insurance industry. “The Ryan family’s new gift will have a profound and lasting impact on faculty and student opportunities, including research and discovery,” President Morton Schapiro said. “Additionally, our student athletes, coaches, fans and the community will benefit from their support of Northwestern Athletics and Recreation for many years to come.” Northwestern said it raised $6.1 billion through its “We Will” fundraising campaign.\n\nIndiana\n\nPendleton: A school district was sued Wednesday by the American Civil Liberties Union after a group that supports LGBT students said it has been barred from promoting its meetings. The free speech rights of the Gay-Straight Alliance at Pendleton Heights High School are being violated along with other laws, the lawsuit alleges. “The differential treatment aimed at Pendleton Heights Gay-Straight Alliance by administrators is unwarranted, and these students must be treated in the same manner that all other student groups are treated,” said Kit Malone, advocacy strategist at ACLU of Indiana. A message seeking comment was left with the superintendent of the South Madison Community School Corp. The principal at Pendleton Heights High has barred the group from advertising on school bulletin boards or anywhere else on school property, according to the lawsuit. The group is “severely hindered in its beneficial function to be a place of shelter, support and education, not just for gay, lesbian, transgender and non-binary students, but for all Pendleton Heights High School students,” the lawsuit states.\n\nIowa\n\nCenterville: Volunteers are prepared to serve 26,000 pancakes Saturday in a Guinness World Record attempt for most pancakes served in a single setting during the annual Pancake Day celebration. The town will try to break a world record of 13,000 pancakes set just this June by a Hy-Vee store in Blue Springs, Missouri. Hy-Vee will donate 2,400 pounds of pancake mix to help the town break the company’s own record. Free pancakes will be served from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday on the Centerville town square. Centerville Tourism Director Delaney Evers said realistically 20,000 to 21,000 pancakes will likely be served. “We’re prepared to double the record, if everything works out in our favor,” Evers said. “That being said, this is the Midwest. It’s a bunch of people coming home. We get chatty in line.” Pancake Day started in 1948 as a way for manufacturers around Centerville, including a Pillsbury facility, to show appreciation for their employees by giving them free pancakes on the town square. As manufacturers left Centerville, community members took on the event and turned it into a regional celebration. A parade, petting zoo, magic show and other free family activities will follow the world record attempt. During a regular year, Centerville serves between 17,000 and 18,000 pancakes anyway, Evers said.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Former state Rep. Michael Capps has pleaded not guilty to 19 counts that allege he tried to defraud federal, state and county government organizations out of more than $450,000 in coronavirus relief funding. Capps entered the plea Wednesday via video conference from his lawyer’s office during his arraignment hearing, the Wichita Eagle reports. Capps also agreed to surrender his passport while he awaits trial. Federal prosecutors have said the Wichita Republican filed forms inflating the number of employees he had at two businesses and a sports foundation and then applied for loans to pay the nonexistent employees. Capps is charged with multiple counts of making a false statement, bank fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. The alleged fraud involved the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program and Emergency Injury Disaster Loan programs, which are designed to provide assistance to businesses that struggled during the pandemic. Capps has not been arrested or detained in connection with the case. On Wednesday, a judge allowed him to remain free on a $25,000 unsecured bond.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The coronavirus claimed 52 more lives in the state as the governor warned Wednesday that it’s hitting younger people harder than at any other time of the public health crisis. The latest virus-related deaths in the Bluegrass State included people as young as 34, 38 and 39, Gov. Andy Beshear said. The statewide death toll has reached at least 8,422 since the pandemic began. In eastern Kentucky, a 29-year-old teacher who was fully vaccinated died Monday after battling COVID-19, the district’s superintendent said. Joannie Bartley, a middle school math teacher in the Jenkins Independent district, died at Pikeville Medical Center. “This virus will come for any of us,” the governor said. “Please get vaccinated. It gives you the best protection out of anything out there to make sure that we don’t lose you or your loved ones.” Beshear continued urging people to mask up when indoors in public, away from home. At least 44 Kentucky K-12 schools personnel have died as a result of the coronavirus, according to the educators group Kentucky 120 United. With a few exceptions, school boards across the state voted to keep masks on students and staff while at school as the delta variant drives up coronavirus infections and deaths. The Republican-led Legislature recently shifted masking decisions to local school leaders.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state reported its 16th child death from COVID-19 on Wednesday. The state health department in Baton Rouge said the victim was between the ages of 12 and 17. No other details were released. It was the seventh pediatric death from the disease since Louisiana’s fourth coronavirus surge began in July. Another child’s death was reported last Friday. “Just five days ago, our hearts were heavy as we mourned the sixth child to lose their life to COVID-19 in this surge. Here we are once more, grieving as another promising young life ends too soon,” Dr. Joseph Kanter, state health officer for Louisiana, said in a news release. The state reported a total of 99 new COVID-19-related deaths Wednesday and 1,906 confirmed or probable cases. Daily hospitalization numbers continue to drop. The latest hospitalization figure was 1,221 – still much higher than the spring and early summer but down from a peak of more than 3,000 in August. Kanter again urged Louisiana residents to take steps to prevent the spread of the disease. “It’s incumbent upon all of us to get the vaccine and wear a mask to protect ourselves and one another, including our children,” Kanter said. Statewide, only about half of all residents have had an initial shot of a COVID-19 vaccine; about 44% have received complete dosages.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The highest rates of COVID-19 infections in recent months have been in places with lower vaccination rates, demonstrating a divide between rural and urban centers in the state, the Bangor Daily News reports. Communities with the lowest vaccination rates have seen the highest rates of new coronavirus cases over the past 41/ 2 months amid the onset of the delta variant, according to the newspaper. Communities where more than 90% of eligible residents are vaccinated experienced nearly 40% lower infections than in communities with inoculation rates below 70%, the newspaper reports. The highest infection rates were previously centered in ZIP codes containing cities like Portland, Lewiston, Biddeford and Kittery but are now in communities like Guilford, Levant, Houlton and Madison. Dr. Noah Nesin, chief medical officer at Penobscot Community Health Care in Bangor, said the good news is that more people are getting vaccinated as they see the damage inflicted by the delta variant. “It is now a choice between getting vaccinated or getting delta,” Nesin said. “They see this as a very serious disease that isn’t just going to go away.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced steps to bolster the state’s nursing workforce Thursday as hospitals are once again handling hundreds of COVID-19 patients. The measures aimed at “providing hospitals with maximum flexibility to mitigate staffing shortages” include allowing nurses with out-of-state licenses to provide care in Maryland and early graduation for nursing students. Thursday’s announcement comes as some Maryland hospitals have had to postpone elective procedures. TidalHealth Peninsula Regional in Salisbury and TidalHealth Nanticoke in Seaford paused elective surgeries requiring an overnight stay beginning Sept. 13. Maryland’s state health secretary, Dennis Schrader, outlined options for medical providers dealing with shortages in a letter to state hospital and nursing home leaders. The options include working with local nursing programs to use student nurses as much as possible, recruiting nurses from states that allow their nurses to practice in multiple states, and allowing students to work as certified nursing assistants or physician assistants. Thursday’s announcement also advised medical providers that nurses with active licenses in any state can practice in Maryland “during an emergency situation.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Native American tribe is calling on Boston University to change the name of a dorm that honors Myles Standish, the military leader of the Pilgrims. The Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag said Myles Standish Hall should be renamed Wituwamat Memorial Hall after a leading Native American figure massacred with other tribal members by Plymouth Colony settlers in 1623. “Long celebrated by many as a New England folk hero, Myles Standish is remembered by this lands’ first peoples for the extreme acts of violence he committed against their ancestors,” says a recently launched online petition seeking the name change. According to the tribe’s history, Standish and his men killed Wituwamat and other members of the Neponset Band of the Massachusett Tribe because Standish suspected Wituwamat of plotting against the fledgling English colony. Wituwamat was beheaded and his head displayed atop Plymouth Colony’s meeting house as a warning. The online petition also argues Standish has no connection to the university or the stately Back Bay neighborhood. Instead, the dorm takes its name from the building’s origin as the Myles Standish Hotel. Built in 1925, the elegant brick hotel was located steps from the Charles River and Fenway Park. The university bought it in 1949 and converted it into dorms.\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: The state will provide bottled water and water filters in Benton Harbor, where tests have revealed elevated levels of lead, a spokesman said Wednesday. The action comes less than two weeks after about 20 groups urged the Biden administration to immediately step in. They said local and state officials have not adequately responded since the contamination was discovered three years ago in the Black, mostly low-income community. The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy will provide bottled water and go door-to-door to ensure proper installation of faucet filters, spokesman Scott Dean said. Testing children is also part of the plan. Free water will be available until the filter distribution is completed. The target is Oct. 8. “The state of Michigan remains committed to ensuring every Michigander has access to safe drinking water,” Dean said. A local activist, the Rev. Edward Pinkney, praised the moves but noted that three years have passed since elevated lead levels were revealed. The National Resources Defense Council said the free water should continue beyond early October. “There’s this ongoing issue – as we all saw in Flint – of filter maintenance and of ensuring that the filters are being used properly,” said Cyndi Roper of the NRDC.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRed Lake: The Red Lake Nation is requiring all people who come to the tribe’s northern Minnesota reservation for work or other business purposes to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or show weekly coronavirus test results. The Red Lake Tribal Council said the mandate does not apply to pregnant women, people with documented medical conditions, children under 12, and those with certain religious beliefs and practices, according to a resolution that passed on a 9-0 vote. Exceptions will not be approved for philosophical, political or scientific views, the tribe said. Those not following the vaccination mandate are required to be tested on a weekly basis and provide documentation showing the results. The tribe has recorded 693 cases of the coronavirus and 12 deaths since the start of the pandemic and currently has 56 active cases, the Red Lake Nation News reports. The Red Lake Hospital is providing on-demand vaccinations with a $130 incentive for each shot, the newspaper reports. Other tribes around the country have also instituted mandates, according to Indian Country Today.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A sheriff’s department said it has identified the skeletal remains of a woman found nearly 44 years ago, and investigators believe she was a victim of the now-deceased Samuel Little, the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history. Hunters found the woman’s remains in December 1977 in the small community of Escatawpa in coastal Jackson County, and investigators had referred to her since then as “Escatawpa Jane Doe.” An autopsy determined the woman, who had a distinctive gold tooth, had been dead about three or four months before her remains were found. Sheriff Mike Ezell said in a news release Tuesday that investigators used DNA to identify the remains as those of Clara Birdlong, who was born in 1933 in Leflore County, nearly 300 miles northwest of Jackson County. A relative told investigators early this year that Birdlong went missing from Leflore County in the 1970s. Ezell said Little confessed in 2018 to several killings in the Southeast, including that of “Escatawpa Jane Doe,” although Little said he did not know her name. Ezell on Tuesday released a jail photo of Little that was taken in August 1977 after his arrest on a petty theft charge in Pascagoula, which is in Jackson County. Little died in December in California, where he was serving a life sentence for multiple counts of murder. He confessed to killing 93 people between 1970 and 2005.\n\nMissouri\n\nLiberty: Officials in a suburban Kansas City school district are investigating after a small group of students posted a petition online calling for the return of slavery. The petition came to light last week after the students at Park Hill South High School posted it during a school-related activity, officials said. Further details about the number of students involved, the specific language of the petition or what might have prompted it were not being released because it is a discipline issue, district spokeswoman Nicole Kirby said Wednesday. Jeanette Cowherd, superintendent of the Park Hill School District, said in a letter to the community Wednesday that the district does not tolerate discrimination or harassment and has specific policies addressing any violations, which could result in a suspension or expulsion. The district also has a policy on civility that prohibits attacks against people based on factors such as race, gender, religion, disability or other personal characteristics. Kerrie Herren, principal of Park Hill South, said a student notified him of the petition last Thursday, and school officials have been working to help students and staff upset by the incident. “I think that a large portion of our population is hurt, mad, outraged and confused and want to use it as way to make Park Hill South better,” Herren said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Medical providers and residents with compromised immune systems are challenging the only law in the U.S. that prevents employers from mandating that workers get vaccinated. They argue the new law violates federal requirements for safe workplaces and reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities and want a federal judge to rule that it doesn’t apply to hospitals and other medical providers. The Montana Medical Association, private physician groups, a Missoula hospital and seven individuals filed the complaint in U.S. District Court in Missoula on Wednesday, arguing the law inhibits providers’ ability to “practice ethical and effective medicine” by requiring them to employ unvaccinated workers who are more likely to spread infections and diseases than vaccinated workers. The law – which applies to all vaccinations, not just those for COVID-19 – prevents medical providers from complying “with national standards for the care and treatment of patients, including observing and enforcing infectious disease prevention protocols,” the complaint says. Montana’s Republican-controlled Legislature passed the law this year that says requiring vaccines as a condition of employment is discriminatory and violates the state’s human rights laws.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Health care officials are lodging complaints about a reopened transfer center intended to help hospitals across the state find places to send patients who need additional care as COVID-19 cases have surged in recent weeks. Officials at Lincoln’s Bryan Health and smaller hospitals around Nebraska have complained that the transfer center has not proven helpful in recent cases in which very sick patients need to get to a larger hospital, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. In some cases, hospital staff reported they got no help from the system and, instead, had to make numerous calls themselves to find an intensive care bed. Gov. Pete Ricketts announced at the beginning of the month the reboot of the transfer center, an around-the-clock call center intended to serve as coordinator for in-state hospitals to try to keep them from getting overwhelmed. The transfer center had first been used last year and was considered a success. But that center focused mostly on finding beds for COVID-19 patients and was run by CHI Health. The new version is being run by Nomi Health, the Utah-based company that ran coronavirus testing operations for the state until earlier this summer. The rebooted system attempts to find beds for any patient needing more intense care.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The City Council introduced an ordinance Wednesday that would make the use of whips in downtown Reno illegal. The new ordinance, which will amend an existing municipal code on weapons, states that it is illegal for anyone to possess, carry or use a whip in the downtown corridor without a permit. That area also would include Midtown, the Riverwalk District and Idlewild Park neighborhoods. It also states that it is illegal for anyone to crack a whip to “injure, annoy, interfere with, or endanger the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of others” within city limits. Lily Baran spoke against the ordinance on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union during public comment at the meeting. She said the homeless community is known for using the whips, and the ordinance will “perpetuate the criminalization of the unhoused.” She said she wished City Council members would spend more time discussing and evaluating community care rather than enforcing laws that displace homeless people. City Council received 19 letters in favor of the whip ordinance. There was no discussion among council members on the issue. They will continue discussing it at a later date.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Administrators in the Weare school district are covering for school staff members who contracted COVID-19. Superintendent Jacqueline Coe on Monday cited two clusters at Center Woods Elementary School, where at least 10 people tested positive for the coronavirus while in the building last week, WMUR-TV reports. “At this point, very few people in the Weare School District are wearing masks in the building, even though many individuals have been notified that they are confirmed close contacts,” Coe said in a letter to the school community. “Based on our plan and mandates from the Department of Education, we have no intention to shift to remote learning.” In Bedford, Memorial Elementary School is just emerging from a COVID-19 outbreak. Officials said they have been using targeted masking and plan asymptomatic testing soon, starting with staff members. “Once we do that, we will open it up to other groups,” Superintendent Mike Fournier said. “So, sports teams, grade levels, classrooms.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWoodland Township: The state plans to restore vast tracts of a coastal tree species threatened by climate change and will pay for it with money from polluters of groundwater. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said Thursday that its plan to restore 10,000 acres of Atlantic white cedar would be the largest restoration effort involving the species in U.S. history. The $20 million project will span 10 years and be paid for from court settlements with manufacturers and distributors of MTBE, a now-banned gasoline additive. “Through this project, we will reestablish once-dominant stands of Atlantic white cedar, but at higher elevations less vulnerable to rising seas and saltwater intrusion, and provide habitat for globally rare plants and wildlife, while capturing and storing carbon and absorbing floodwaters,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner. The trees were heavily logged for their desirability as a disease- and pest-resistant wood source. But they also have been falling prey to saltwater intrusion as sea levels rise and more frequent storms push saltwater into the freshwater areas in which the cedars grow. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 also downed many of the trees. Stands of dead cedars haunt New Jersey and other spots along the Atlantic coast, where the bleached-white trees have become known as “ghost forests.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A bipartisan group of lawmakers is renewing a push to expand a U.S. compensation program for people who were exposed to radiation following uranium mining and nuclear testing carried out during the Cold War. Advocates have been trying for years to bring awareness to the lingering effects of nuclear fallout surrounding the Trinity Site in southern New Mexico, where the U.S. military detonated the first atomic bomb, and on the Navajo Nation, where more than 30 million tons of uranium ore were extracted over decades to support U.S. nuclear activities. Under legislation introduced Wednesday by U.S. Sens. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, other sites across the American West would be added to the list of places affected by fallout and radiation exposure. Eligibility also would be expanded to include certain workers in the industry after 1971, such as miners. The legislation also would increase the amount of compensation someone can receive to $150,000 and provide coverage for additional forms of cancer. A multibillion-dollar defense spending package approved last year included an apology to New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and other states affected by radiation from nuclear testing, but no action was taken on legislation to change and broaden the compensation program.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An inmate on a jail barge died Wednesday after a medical emergency, the city’s Department of Correction said. It is at least the 12th death of a city inmate this year and the second this week amid what some elected officials and advocates have deemed a “humanitarian crisis” in the city’s lockups. The Department of Correction said in a statement that the inmate at the Vernon C. Bain Center, a floating Bronx jail across the East River from the Rikers Island jail complex, appeared to be in medical distress and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Correction Commissioner Vincent Schiraldi said he was “devastated to see that we have yet another death in custody and determined to stop this heartbreaking trend.” The Department of Correction identified the inmate as Stephen Khadu, who had been held on a second-degree murder charge since December 2019. The cause of death is under investigation by the city medical examiner’s office. City officials had conflicting information on Khadu’s age but placed him at being in his 20s or 30s. The Bain Center, a five-story jail stacked on a 625-foot barge, opened in 1992 as temporary relief for crowded city’s jails. Since then, it’s been criticized for overcrowding. The city’s jail system, troubled by years of neglect, has spiraled into turmoil during the coronavirus pandemic with a spike in inmate deaths, violence, self-harm and staff absences. More inmates have died this year than in any of the past three years.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAhoskie: A funeral home said it has reached out to apologize after two sisters who went to view their mother’s body instead found another woman wearing her clothes inside the casket. Jennifer Taylor and Jennetta Archer had gone to see their mother’s body at an Ahoskie funeral home Sept. 7 when they discovered the mistake, WAVY reports. Archer said there was no resemblance between their mother and the woman who was in the casket. She said the unidentified woman “was swimming in the clothes because she was so small compared to my mother.” The sisters approached workers at Hunter’s Funeral Home, who at first denied the woman was someone else until they went back into the embalming room and saw the body of Mary Archer. The funeral home switched the bodies, and the service continued. The funeral home said it has reached out to the family to apologize, but Taylor and Archer said they had not received a call from the funeral home and were awaiting answers to their questions. An official was not immediately available for additional comment Thursday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Lawmakers on Tuesday moved to significantly change the threshold on new legislation that limits spending of federal money by a governor-led panel. The law, passed shortly before the Republican-led Legislature adjourned in April, came after the Emergency Commission, headed by GOP Gov. Doug Burgum, largely determined how to spend $1.2 billion in federal coronavirus relief the state received last year. Many lawmakers believed the full body should have that responsibility. The Legislature easily overrode Burgum’s veto of the bill that he said “clearly violates the separation of powers doctrine” and would be unconstitutional. The law, which got wide bipartisan support, caps the Emergency Commission’s spending authority of federal funds to $50 million and to just $5 million in so-called special funds in a two-year budget cycle – a cap that was quickly reached before the last budget cycle ended June 30. Expenditures exceeding the cap need approval of the full Legislature later this year in a reconvened or special session. The commission is composed of the governor, the secretary of state, the chairmen of the state House and Senate appropriations committees, and the majority leaders of the House and Senate.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Residents ages 12-25 who receive COVID-19 vaccines can enter a new lottery making them eligible for one of five $100,000 college scholarships and 50 $10,000 scholarships, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Thursday in his latest effort to boost number of people inoculated against the surging disease. Details will be announced soon for the new Ohio Vax-to-College program, aimed at the group of Ohioans with the most room to grow in terms of receiving vaccines, the Republican governor said, with just 46% of Ohioans ages 12-25 having received an initial dose. Getting a COVID-19 shot is the best way for students to continue participating in sports and extracurriculars, he said, reiterating that students who are vaccinated don’t have to quarantine if exposed to someone with the coronavirus. “Keeping our children in school in person is a top priority for the state,” he said. The state has seen more than 42,000 cases of COVID-19 among kids ages 5-17 since mid-August, he said. The Ohio Hospital Association warned of a dire situation caused by increased cases. In mid-July, 1 of every 100 hospital patients was being treated for COVID-19, the group said. Today, that ratio is 1 patient out of 6. Virtually all Ohio patients hospitalized with COVID-19 today are unvaccinated, said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, the state health director.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Fans of the NBA’s Oklahoma City Thunder will be required to provide proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to attend games in person, the team announced Tuesday. “As we continue to face serious health challenges from COVID-19, we must remain committed to protecting the health and safety of our community,” Thunder Chairman Clay Bennett said. The policy will be in effect for the first 12 games of the preseason and continuing into the start of the regular season. The team also strongly recommends fans wear masks while attending games. While the state’s coronavirus case numbers and new hospitalizations have declined slightly this week, numbers remain concerning, and the Oklahoma State Department of Health announced a virtual career day Sept. 29 in an effort to hire 70 nurses statewide. “Oklahoma needs more nurses, right now, to assist with COVID-19 vaccinations,” said Amy Gaither, director of nursing service for the department.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: After a private blessing and a prayer, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde invited gathered media to watch as an excavator tore into a wall of the old, abandoned paper mill that the tribe says has stood on its ancestral grounds for too long. The tribe held a symbolic demolition event at the old Blue Heron Paper Mill at Willamette Falls on Tuesday, representing a small step toward removing the industrial site and returning it to Indigenous hands, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Chris Mercier, vice chair of the Grand Ronde Tribal Council, said the tribe has been trying to reclaim as much of its traditional homelands as possible. “This site here is of deep historical and cultural significance,” Mercier said. “The fact that we’ve actually purchased it and own it now is kind of a dream come true for many of us and many of our tribal members because our roots run deep here.” The land around Willamette Falls was once home to the Clowewalla and Kosh-huk-shix villages of the Clackamas people, who ceded the land to the U.S. government under the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 before being forcibly removed and relocated, according to the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. Willamette Falls has long been one of Oregon’s best, least-accessible natural wonders, with public access blocked off by the paper mill that shut down in 2011.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State senators grilled turnpike executives over their efforts to collect unpaid tolls that amounted to $104 million last year during a hearing Wednesday prompted by an Associated Press report last week regarding some 11 million rides that generated no revenue for the debt-hobbled agency. Transportation Committee Chairman Wayne Langerholc, R-Cambria, scolded the turnpike brass for not alerting him to the growing problem that he said “should have been a red flag within your department.” Sen. Marty Flynn, D-Lackawanna, called the $104 million figure “just unacceptable.” Turnpike Chief Executive Mark Compton assured the committee the agency takes the issue “very seriously” and is working to lower the amount of “leakage.” Compton said his agency’s 93% overall rate of collection is typical for turnpike operations across the U.S. The turnpike laid off hundreds of toll collectors last year and speeded up its long-planned conversion to a cashless, all-electronic tolling system. Ideas floated by lawmakers during the hourlong hearing included requiring front license plates to make identifying vehicle owners easier, adding tolls on about 30 miles of turnpike at the Ohio border, and lowering the amount of unpaid tolls that trigger vehicle registration suspensions in Pennsylvania, a level currently at $500 over a three-year period.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBurrillville: Not afraid of ghosts and things that go bump in the night? The purportedly haunted farmhouse where the spooky happenings that inspired the 2013 horror movie “The Conjuring” occurred hit the market Thursday for the scary price of $1.2 million. Realtor Mott & Chace Sotheby’s International Realty in its listing called the 14-room, 3,100-square-foot home on 8.5 acres in Burrillville “one of the most well-known haunted houses in the United States.” “Legend has it, the home is haunted by the presence of Bathsheba Sherman, who lived in the house in the 1800s,” the agency said. “To this day, countless happenings have been reported.” The movie wasn’t filmed at the home but was based on the experiences of the Perron family, who lived there in the 1970s. The home last sold in 2019 for $439,000 to a family who described themselves as paranormal investigators, hosted events at the site and rented rooms overnight for people eager for a scare. Before that, the previous owners didn’t complain about ghosts but about fans of the movie who showed up at all hours and trespassed on the property.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a law preventing anyone from moving a Confederate monument or changing the historical name of a street or building without the Legislature’s permission is legal. But in the same ruling, the justices struck down a requirement that two-thirds of the General Assembly must approve a move or name change. The unanimous decision keeps intact South Carolina’s Heritage Act, which has stopped colleges and local governments from removing statues honoring Civil War soldiers or segregationists even as other areas of the South took them down. The law was passed in 2000 as part of a compromise to remove the Confederate flag from atop the South Carolina Statehouse dome. The rebel banner was moved to a pole on the capitol lawn, where it flew until 2015 when lawmakers removed it after nine Black church members were killed in a racist massacre in Charleston. One of the people who sued lawmakers over the Heritage Act is the widow of state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the pastor at Emanuel AME church who died in the attack. Jennifer Pinkney has pointed out that the law’s wording, which also protects monuments from other wars or honoring African Americans and Native Americans, means she couldn’t make changes to a monument to her late husband unveiled this year without asking lawmakers for permission.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPine Ridge: Oglala Sioux Tribe officials said Wednesday that they’re asking all tribal members on the Pine Ridge Reservation to shelter in place following a spike in COVID-19 cases. The initial stay-at-home order issued earlier this week by Oglala Vice President Alicia Mousseau was approved by the tribal council on a 14-4 vote. The order will remain in place until the tribal council rescinds it. The order only allows essential business to operate and only at 25% capacity. It includes a mask mandate and limits gatherings to no more than 10 people, the Rapid City Journal reports. Tribal health officials said there have been 58 new cases of COVID-19 over a two-week period. There are 64 active cases on the reservation. Mousseau said in a letter that all schools on the reservation will adopt and submit a plan for reopening school buildings and resuming all extracurricular activities, including sports.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: East Tennessee State University is seeking volunteers to help sift for fossils in sediment from what was a prehistoric pond that has produced remains of mastodons. The university says the volunteers needed this fall at the the Gray Fossil Site and Museum will be working outside and screening material from the Mastodon Pit area. The school says the pit has been one of the most productive areas in recent years, and excavation there has uncovered fossils of rhinos, alligators, snapping turtles and mastodons. The university says volunteer screeners are essential to keep digging and lab work going. Volunteers should expect to perform minor physical labor and spend at least three consecutive hours working. Those interested must be 18 or older and should visit etmnh.org/support/volunteer.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Federal officials made more than two dozen recommendations Thursday aimed at further safeguarding power plants and natural gas supplies to prevent a repeat of the February blackouts that caused more than 200 deaths in the state. Staff at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Reliability Corp. made their recommendations to FERC’s four commissioners while presenting a preliminary report on the February disaster, which left millions of people without power during subfreezing temperatures. “The situation didn’t need to be as bad as it was,” said FERC Chairman Richard Glick. He said changes should have been made after a winter storm caused blackouts in Texas in 2011, when a report called for the mandatory weatherization of power plants. “But somehow that recommendation eventually was watered down to guidelines that few generators actually followed,” said Glick, a former Democratic congressional staff lawyer. In the preliminary report, officials recommended power providers be required to meet tougher standards for protecting their plants from freezing temperatures and be able to seek compensation for the cost of winterizing them. Such a change would make Texas’ deregulated electricity market more like those in other states.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Zion National Park is transitioning into its new operational schedule this fall, with shorter hours for some activities, some facilities closed or limited, and continued rules in place for the COVID-19 pandemic. Park officials always recommend visitors plan ahead and check the park website before visiting, but coming prepared is especially important this year given the various requirements in place for the pandemic and as a result of recent flooding and other damage from weather. As in the summer, the park’s iconic main canyon remains accessible only by shuttle bus. The Zion Canyon Scenic Drive shuttles require all riders to wear masks, and visitors should prepare for occasional waits on busy weekends or other popular days when the lines can get quite long. The park also operates a free shuttle in Springdale. Visitors can leave their vehicles at a hotel or in one of the approved parking areas in town and catch the shuttle to take it into the park. Visitors can also enter the park at the pedestrian bridge at Zion Canyon Village. The South Campground will close for the season Oct. 18, two weeks earlier than usual this year, in order to complete intermediate steps in the design process for the South Campground rehabilitation project, which is scheduled to start construction in 2023.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The City Council has unanimously approved allowing emergency camping on city public property for the homeless because of a lack of affordable housing and shelter beds. The council voted Wednesday to decriminalize such camping. It’s not a long-term solution to homelessness but a short-term step as the city navigates an immediate affordable housing crisis, the policy says, according to mychamplainvalley.com. City employees who find an encampment on public land must tell police and the city manager’s office through email to determine how to respond, the news station reports. People camping in high-sensitivity areas will be asked to move within 24 hours and be connected with overnight shelters at no charge. After 24 hours, those camps could be removed by the city.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A monument that honors Virginians who fought against slavery and for freedom has been dedicated in the former capital of the Confederacy. The Virginia Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Commission unveiled its Emancipation and Freedom Monument to a rain-soaked audience at Brown’s Island on Wednesday, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. Oregon-based artist Thomas Jay Warren created the monument. It features two 12-foot bronze figures, one of a newly freed man with chains broken from his wrists, the other a woman holding an infant in one arm and in her other hand a page that reads “January 1” and the Roman numerals for 1863, the date that Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation took effect, freeing slaves in the South. The base displays the names of five Black Virginians who fought against slavery, including Nat Turner and Dred Scott, and five who fought for equality, including the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, John Mitchell Jr. and Rosa Dixon Bowser. Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney spoke during the ceremony, saying that Richmond and Virginia have come a long way, and while there’s work left to do, “we are moving in the right direction … moving forward to a more inclusive and more equitable future.”\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: Lawsuits have been filed in several western Washington counties claiming auditors used uncertified voting equipment and manipulated thousands of ballots in an unspecified statewide race last year. The Daily Herald reports the lawsuits in Snohomish, Whatcom and Clark counties seek a “full forensic audit” conducted in the same manner as one carried out in Arizona – which has so far yielded no evidence of widespread fraud. The legal pursuits in Washington, expected to expand to more counties, are steered by lead plaintiff Washington Election Integrity Coalition United, whose leader, Tamborine Borrelli of Gig Harbor, has traveled the state in search of residents willing to join the effort. “I’m not personally alleging that there has been any specific impropriety,” said Art Coday of Woodinville, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for state Senate last year. “A forensic audit would go a long ways to reassure people things are as they should be.” The notion of needing to reassure people of the integrity of elections is a mantra of former President Donald Trump – despite a broad coalition of government and industry officials calling the presidential election “the most secure in American history.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: Parachutists won’t jump off the nation’s third-highest bridge next month due to worries about sufficient emergency health care amid the coronavirus pandemic, an organizer said Wednesday. Marcus Ellison, an organizer for BASE jumpers, told the Bridge Day Commission on Wednesday that the group will not participate in Bridge Day, the state’s largest outdoor festival on the New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville. In past years the jumpers have been one of the festival’s main attractions. BASE stands for building, antenna, span and Earth, the fixed objects from which jumpers leap. Ellison cited concerns about available health care in case of an emergency because of the pandemic, news outlets report. “The well-being of my jumpers is the No. 1 priority as an event organizer,” Ellison said. Some hospitals in southern West Virginia have been inundated in recent weeks with COVID-19 patients, with a few saying their intensive care units were at capacity. Ellison said he also is concerned there could be an insufficient number of bus drivers to transport BASE jumpers from the bottom to the top of the bridge. The Bridge Day Committee later scheduled a vote for Sept. 29 to decide whether the Oct. 16 event will continue. Last year’s Bridge Day was canceled due to the pandemic.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Six Native American tribes have sued the state to try to stop its planned gray wolf hunt in November, asserting that the hunt violates their treaty rights and endangers an animal they consider sacred. The Chippewa tribes say treaties give them rights to half of the wolf quota in territory they ceded to the United States in the mid-1800s. But rather than hunt wolves, the tribes want to protect them. The tribal lawsuit comes three weeks after a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups sued to stop Wisconsin’s wolf hunt this fall and void a state law mandating annual hunts, arguing that the statutes don’t give wildlife managers any leeway to consider population estimates. Hunters blew past their limit during a court-ordered hunt in February. The state Department of Natural Resources set the quota at 119, but hunters killed 218 wolves in just four days, forcing an early end to the season. Conservationists then deluged the department with requests to cancel this fall’s hunt out of concerns it could devastate the wolf population. Agency biologists recommended setting the fall quota at 130. But the agency’s board last month set the kill limit at 300. The tribes have claimed their half, but since they won’t hunt wolves, the working quota for state-licensed hunters would be 150.\n\nWyoming\n\nPine Bluffs: A school nurse has resigned over a Laramie County district’s decision to make quarantining optional for students exposed to people with COVID-19, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. “I just can’t look the other way anymore,” Kay Dersham told the paper, saying she was being asked to follow a policy that was unethical and could jeopardize her nursing license.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/03/virus-sniffing-dog-vegas-boom-vaccine-hecklers-news-around-states/115956336/", "title": "Virus-sniffing dog, Vegas boom: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Vaccines for COVID-19 are now widely available, but some people remain hesitant to take the shots, State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday. After months of struggling with getting an adequate supply into the state, Harris said health officials are now trying to battle some people’s reluctance to sign up for doses. While people can be reluctant to take the vaccine for a variety of reasons, one is the false belief that the vaccine is more dangerous than the coronavirus, he said. “If you can identify one single issue that is a problem, it’s that there are people who are just convinced that the vaccine is somehow more dangerous than the disease,” Harris told reporters. “That’s a false belief we have to try to combat as often as we can. It’s simply not true.” Nearly one-third of Alabama’s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, that figure ranks the state third from last in the nation, ahead of Mississippi and Louisiana, and Alabama is last nationally in its overall rate of vaccination. Harris said health officials are conducting media campaigns and asking doctors to contact their patients about the benefits of getting vaccinated. He emphasized that vaccination “is the fastest way to get back to normal.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Friday ended the state’s COVID-19 disaster declaration, saying the state is in such a good position he doesn’t need emergency powers bestowed by the Legislature. “Alaska is in the recovery phase where an emergency declaration is no longer necessary,” Dunleavy said in a statement. “Our systems are fully functioning with vaccine distribution, adequate testing, and health care capacity. It is important our focus remains on getting Alaska’s economy back on track and welcoming summer tourism throughout our great state.” Dunleavy acted on the recommendation of health commissioner Adam Crum, who concluded the emergency disaster declaration is no longer necessary. “While COVID-19 is still present in Alaska, the urgent nature of the pandemic has passed and we are no longer anticipating the widespread emergency that Alaska faced earlier in this pandemic,” Crum wrote in a memo to Dunleavy. The Republican governor also signed a bill that his office says ensures the continuation of COVID-19 federal relief to affected Alaskans and liability protections for businesses in the state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Numerous doctors’ offices and clinics will be able to directly obtain COVID-19 vaccines starting this week, state health officials said Friday. Dr. Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, announced eligible physicians and local health care providers will no longer have to rely on allocations from their county public health department. That means nearly 1,200 providers registered with the state can order up to 200 doses within a two-week period from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They will receive the Moderna vaccine because it has less complex storage requirements. The hope is that being able to go to a primary care doctor for a shot will “be a major driver,” Christ said. “Based on our community listening sessions, people indicated that a recommendation from their health care provider, that would be one of the things that would drive them to get vaccinated,” Christ said. State officials are expecting 100,000 doses to be available for these smaller providers to order directly during the first week. As vaccine demand declines, state health officials have been working with community groups on pop-up vaccination events in underserved areas like Yuma and south Phoenix. Strategies include telephonic town halls, door-to-door canvassing and targeted social media posts.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson has signed into law legislation banning state and local mask mandates for preventing the spread of the coronavirus, even though the prohibition will not take effect until later this summer. Hutchinson dropped the state’s mandate in March, but cities including Fayetteville and Little Rock were allowed to keep their requirements in place. The bill is the latest measure the Republican governor has signed to curb Arkansas’ pandemic-related restrictions. On Wednesday he signed bills prohibiting the state and local governments from requiring vaccinations against COVID-19 or “vaccine passports” to access services. The mask mandate ban does not prevent businesses from imposing their own requirements, unlike an earlier version of the bill Hutchinson had said he would veto. The new law doesn’t take effect until late July at the earliest. Hutchinson cited the delay in the prohibition taking effect and its exemption of private businesses. “It is important to respect the individual decisions made by private businesses,” Hutchinson said in a statement. “It also does not have an emergency clause, so the law will not go into effect until the current school year ends.” The measure doesn’t apply to state-owned or state-controlled health care facilities, state prisons or facilities operated by the Division of Youth Services.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Friday that the COVID-19 mass vaccination site at Dodger Stadium will close by the end of May, part of a trend in California to bring doses closer to where people live as appointments in some places go unfilled. Winding down operations at the stadium marks the transition of the city’s vaccination efforts to appointment-free options and putting more doses into walk-up centers and mobile clinics, the mayor said in a statement. Dodger Stadium became one of the nation’s most prominent sites for coronavirus response, first for testing and then for delivery of vaccines to people waiting in long lines of cars. “Dodger Stadium set the standard for sports franchises and community institutions playing a starring role in our COVID-19 response for the country,” Garcetti said. More than 1 million people were tested at the stadium, and the number of vaccine doses administered there has topped 420,000, according to the city. Orange County’s big vaccination site at Disneyland closed Friday as the theme park reopened to visitors for the first time in more than a year. Similarly, a major site at Six Flags Magic Mountain in northern Los Angeles County recently closed as that park welcomed visitors back. North of San Francisco, Marin County will close two mass vaccination sites in San Rafael by the end of May.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A little more than a year since schools and all their events shut down, some traditions, like prom, are returning – or, as some schools called them, “prom-like events.” Poudre School District’s four comprehensive high schools – Fort Collins High School, Fossil Ridge High School, Poudre High School and Rocky Mountain High School – hosted proms Saturday night, with a few stark differences from those of years past. At this year’s events, students could choose to wear formal or informal attire, food was not served for safety reasons, and the dances were all hosted outside to allow for social distancing and airflow. Tickets had to be bought ahead of time through an application that allows a school’s COVID-19 response team to perform contact tracing if a student who attended tests positive for the coronavirus. Students also had to register for the dance in a “pod” of no more than 10 and be limited to hanging out with that group for the evening. The district said by having students register in groups, kids within a pod were able to be less than 6 feet away from each other. Students were unable to attend if they had “any illness symptoms or are probable/positive for COVID-19.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Several of the state’s best-known museums have signed on to a proposal by Gov. Ned Lamont designed to combat some of the learning lost during the pandemic by allowing children to visit for free this summer. Mystic Aquarium, Mystic Seaport Museum, Beardsley Zoo, the Connecticut Science Center and the Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk have all expressed interest in participating, Lamont said Friday. Under the initiative, all Connecticut children 18 and under and one accompanying adult can visit the museums free of charge from July 1 to Sept. 6. “By participating in this program, we hope to provide more children access to a fun and educational destination and instill a love of the ocean that motivates young audiences to make a difference in our world,” said Dr. Stephen M. Coan, president and CEO of Sea Research Foundation Inc., the nonprofit that operates Mystic Aquarium. The governor’s plan would fund the program with $15 million from the state’s federal recovery funds. “Connecticut has some of the best museums in the region, and they were significantly impacted by the pandemic,” Lamont said. “Investing these recovery dollars into our museums just makes sense.” The Legislature must sign off on the proposal.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state had the highest foreclosure rate in the country so far this year, according to a nationwide realty data analysis. One in every 1,705 housing units in Delaware had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2021, according to the report from ATTOM Data Solutions. Of the state’s three counties, Kent County saw the highest foreclosure rate at the start of this year, with 1 in every 1,281 housing units seeing a foreclosure filing. New Castle County saw 1 in every 1,691, and Sussex County saw 1 in every 2,094. While the First State ranked first in terms of its foreclosure rate this past quarter, it was 31st in the total number of foreclosure filings, according to the data. The state had 254 filings, showing that even a small change in the small state can have a big impact on its ranking. And some state officials questioned the data. The Delaware State Housing Authority launched a mortgage assistance program in August to help people struggling to make their payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. That program was paused at the end of last year because the state was unsure if the federal government would continue to help fund the program, according to Jessica Eisenbrey Welch, a spokeswoman for the Delaware State Housing Authority.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Fully vaccinated people may do more without wearing a mask under a new order from Mayor Muriel Bowser, WUSA-TV reports. People who are fully vaccinated – meaning at least two weeks have passed since their final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine – may now gather outdoors with a small group of vaccinated and unvaccinated people without wearing a mask, but social distance must be maintained, and people in the group who are not fully vaccinated must continue to wear masks. Fully vaccinated people can visit with a small group of fully vaccinated people only at a private indoor setting without wearing a mask. They may travel within the United States without getting tested for the coronavirus before or after their trip. Those flying into the U.S. from another country still need to show a negative test before boarding and get tested three to five days after their return. Fully vaccinated people may also continue activities after being exposed to someone with COVID-19 without needing to get tested or quarantine, unless they have symptoms or live in a group setting. Businesses and other institutions may ask to see a person’s vaccine card or other proof of inoculation. Employers are also required to provide masks for their employees and can implement mask mandates at the office, according to the order.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: Three days a week, Buffy greets visitors at the entrance to Doctors Hospital of Sarasota. If they grant permission, she sniffs their feet, seeking a whiff of active COVID-19 infection. Few decline the offer when they see the yellow Labrador retriever with a wagging tail. People generally don’t love going to a hospital, said CEO Robert Meade, but “who doesn’t love labs?” Buffy was trained by Palmetto-based Southeastern Guide Dogs as part of a four-dog pilot program for scent detection. The original plan was to train dogs to detect heightened levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. The coronavirus pandemic derailed that plan but opened the door to another. Small, early studies on dogs trained to detect the virus in Europe – though still unproven – showed promise. Southeastern decided to give it a shot. The four dogs selected had flunked out of Southeastern’s guide dog training, seen as easily distracted or “a little high-energy,” trainer Laska Parrow said. But “they were dogs that never gave up when a treat was hidden somewhere.” Saliva samples were collected from Doctors Hospital patients with active COVID-19 infections and “inactivated,” rendering them noninfectious. The dogs trained for three months. At the end, Buffy was 95% accurate at detecting the virus samples. Meade said he believes Doctors Hospital of Sarasota is the first hospital in the U.S. with such a pooch.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is removing many remaining requirements for social distancing and masked employees from businesses, saying the state’s efforts to control COVID-19 have been successful – even as its vaccination rate lags and as federal officials continue to warn that infection rates remain relatively high. While Kemp was touring the Mexican border in Texas on Friday, the Republican’s office released a new executive order that took effect Saturday and runs through May 30. “Businesses across the Peach State have followed COVID-19 restrictions for over a year to keep their employees and customers safe and will now be able to make informed decisions about how their business operations move forward,” said Mallory Blount, a spokesperson for Kemp. “Georgians know best how to protect themselves and their families, and they deserve to be able to return to normal.” But public health experts fear another surge, possibly driven by more infectious variants of the coronavirus. “Too soon,” Emory University infectious disease expert Carlos del Rio wrote on Twitter, pointing to federal statistics. “We still have ‘substantial transmission’ and our percent of population fully vaccinated is low.” More than 6 million doses of vaccines have been given in Georgia, but the state ranks 44th in doses per capita to people 18 and up.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige says the state’s mask mandate will remain in place for now. Ige urged people to continue wearing masks despite the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccinated people not having to wear masks in certain outdoor situations, Hawaii News Now reports. “We believe that the basic mask mandate is still appropriate, and we won’t be making changes, or making significant changes, at this time,” Ige said. He said said it would be difficult to determine who has been vaccinated against COVID-19 when it comes to enforcement. Some people at a beach park agreed. “It’s great that he’s not going to change it because how can you tell if somebody’s vaccinated or not?” said Terry Kakazu. “For my own protection, I’m gonna wear it anyway.” And beachgoer Claire Nakamua-Rochon asked: “What are we gonna do, put a ‘V’ on everybody’s arm to let everybody know you’re the vaccinated one?” Ige said he believes masks have helped keep the coronavirus in check in the state. “Hawaii continues to have amongst the lowest per capita infection rates and fatality rates in the country,” he said. “I do believe that our mask mandate is part of that success.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers hesitant to leave the governor in charge of pandemic decisions after the legislative session are delaying their adjournment, a move that analysts say could cause a government shutdown by threatening the start date of some 200 pieces of legislation. A measure intended to change the effective date of the legislation should be amended to avoid a potential government shutdown starting in June, a legal analysis has determined. The Idaho attorney general’s office sent the analysis Thursday to the Idaho Legislative Services Office, a nonpartisan government entity that supports state lawmakers. The document obtained by the Associated Press said the legislation as written could pass a court challenge, but the consequences for failing could be severe. The 200 bills include 65 critical appropriations bills. They would typically not take effect until at least 60 days after the Legislature adjourns. But the Legislature still being in session pushes their effective date past the start of the new fiscal year, starting July 1. If the bill is found unconstitutional, “some 200 bills, including appropriations bills to fund parts of state government, would not take effect on July 1, 2021,” wrote Chief Deputy Brian Kane, and “there could be funding issues for parts of state government as early as June 12.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Consistent statewide procedures and ongoing drills that target infection response and other emergencies will be routine at Illinois veterans’ homes after COVID-19 caught the LaSalle Veterans’ Home unprepared and claimed 36 lives last fall, said the newly appointed director of the state Department of Veterans Affairs. Terry Prince, a 31-year Navy veteran and former senior adviser to the U.S. surgeon general, has issued a six-point plan for improving readiness at the state’s veterans’ homes in Anna, Manteno, Quincy and LaSalle. The plan follows a blistering investigative report that laid out a string of miscommunications, lax policy and missed opportunities when the pandemic hit the home in LaSalle, 94 miles west of Chicago. The report by the inspector general of the Illinois Department of Human Services, released Friday, noted that despite escaping all traces of the deadly respiratory illness for eight months after it entered Illinois, little was done to devise protocols for preventing or managing infections. After the first four cases were reported Nov. 1, the virus spread to 60 residents and 43 employees as confused staff operated in an environment that was “inefficient, reactive and chaotic,” the report said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gamblers will have to keep wearing face masks inside the state’s casinos at least through the end of May. Updated health guidelines issued by the Indiana Gaming Commission said operators of the 13 state-licensed casinos decided to keep the mask rule in place to stem COVID-19 spread even though Gov. Eric Holcomb lifted the statewide mask mandate as of April 6. The casino rules require customers to wear masks except when eating, drinking or smoking while seated at a slot machine, bar or restaurant table. Gamblers must wear masks at table games, and employees are required to have masks on at all times. The gaming commission said casinos will review whether to continue the mask requirement past June 1. The state guidelines direct casinos to obtain permission from local health officials before holding any events involving large crowds and continue extra spacing between slot machine players.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said she rejected $95 million in federal money for coronavirus testing in schools because she didn’t think there was a need for the funding. Reynolds, a Republican, announced her decision on a Thursday night Fox News show and criticized President Joe Biden’s administration for offering the money aimed at expanding testing. “I think he thinks that COVID just started,” Reynolds said on the show, which was televised from a forum with other Republican governors in Florida. ”I just returned $95 million because they sent an additional $95 million to the state of Iowa to get our kids back in the classroom by doing surveillance testing. And I said we’ve been in the classroom since August. Here’s your $95 million back.” Kelly Garcia, director of the Iowa Department of Human Services, confirmed later that Iowa had turned down the funding. The Republican Party of Iowa praised Reynolds’ decision, saying the Biden administration had failed in its efforts to return students to in-person classrooms, but “Gov. Reynolds fought back against the teachers unions and succeeded.” Democratic state Auditor Rob Sand questioned the rejection of federal money that would have assisted testing at schools and funded Iowa jobs.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A Kansas City-area high school athletic director is pleading with families to take pandemic safety protocols seriously after instructing about 200 students to quarantine last week. John Johnson, who oversees athletics at Shawnee Mission South High School, said in a message to parents and athletes that “there are more students with positive tests, and that is causing an extreme domino effect of COVID transmission concerns.” He also warned that post-season play could be affected, The Kansas City Star reports. Elected officials in Johnson County voted Thursday to switch the mask mandate to a recommendation, although the decision doesn’t affect schools. Health officials in the county, which is the state’s largest, have warned that while the number of new coronavirus cases is down, the drop in testing makes it more difficult to know how widespread transmission of the virus has become. And they are urging eligible residents to get vaccinated, saying demand has slowed. District spokesman David Smith said it is typical for student-athletes to be quarantined from playing sports after a potential exposure but still be allowed to attend class. “At school, we have protocols, including mask-wearing and social distancing. But when you’re participating in sports, it’s not always possible to do those things,” Smith said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Thousands of spectators gathered in the infield at Churchill Downs on Saturday for the Kentucky Derby, many not wearing face masks required amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds stood in lines that were not spaced out to use ATMs or buy food. Unlike some Derby tickets this year that are all-inclusive, infield tickets don’t include drinks or food, so fans have to use cash to make purchases. Sydney Lowe of Columbus, Ohio, said she and her friends were fine with not wearing masks because they were outside and had been vaccinated. “We’re outside; I feel like it’s not that big a deal,” Lowe said. “I wish there were more ATMs and that it wasn’t only cash, that’s one thing,” added her friend Halle Vozar. A recording played over a loudspeaker at the entrance said guests were required to wear masks over their mouths and noses. Ticket-takers reminded people coming in the front gate: “Please have your mask on! Masks on! Masks on!” A sign posted indoors by the wagering windows reminding spectators to wear masks largely went ignored. Others had masks pulled down covering their chins. The crowd at the Downs reportedly topped 50,000 people, which would make the Derby the biggest gathering for a U.S. sports event since the pandemic began.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has proposed spending $1.6billion of the state’s $3.2billion in federal funding from the latest pandemic relief package on Louisiana’s bankrupt unemployment trust fund, tourism and infrastructure to help stand up the economy. “It’s my belief that these are the three most important things we can do right now ... to have a transformative, positive impact on Louisiana,” Edwards said at a Thursday press conference. Edwards, who will need approval from the Legislature, wants to direct $230 million to repay federal loans that have propped up the state’s unemployment trust fund and another $400 million to replenish the trust fund to avoid triggering tax hikes on businesses. “I don’t believe it’s a good thing to increase taxes on businesses when we’re trying to grow the economy coming out of a pandemic,” he said. Edwards is proposing $750 million go toward infrastructure – $400 million to roads and bridges, $300 million to upgrade dilapidated water systems and $50 million for ports. He’s also recommending $125 million for Convention and Visitors Bureaus and other tourism venues and $20 million for the Office of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. “That’s incredibly important to jump-start our economy,” he said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Cities and towns would be able to get access to federal coronavirus aid under a pandemic law change. The Legislature on Wednesday passed a proposal to set up an account for the state to receive and distribute federal funds for the municipalities via the American Rescue Plan. The proposal, which was a governor’s bill, is now before Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. Democratic Senate President Troy Jackson said the money is important for Maine cities and towns to “work to rebuild local communities and economies.” The American Rescue Plan allocated funds to Maine municipalities based on their populations, the Maine Legislature Office of the Presiding Officers said. Every town in the state will receive money, Democratic Rep. Teresa Pierce said. That will result in more than $600 million going into the communities, she said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Preliminary data from 2020 reveals a dramatic increase in deaths linked with opioids in the state, particularly fentanyl, and health officials blame the pandemic. The number of unintentional intoxication overdoses – those involving all drugs and alcohol – rose 18.7% to 2,773 in 2020 from 2,379 in 2019, according to data collected by the Maryland Department of Health. In more than 90% of cases, opioids were detected in bodies postmortem. That’s the highest rate recorded in the state’s history of collecting this data. While too early to formally determine the extent to which COVID-19 has influenced this increase, experts agree the pandemic is likely to blame for the widespread increase in drug use. Dr. Aaron Greenblatt, medical director of the University of Maryland Medical Center Addiction Treatment Programs, said pandemic-induced stress is likely a major factor in drug users’ relapses, but COVID-19 restricted treatment options, too. “I think that access to treatment – particularly access to psychosocial treatments – was really significantly impacted by COVID … we haven’t had groups,” Greenblatt told Capital News Service. Outpatient addiction treatment programs are intense and may require patients to visit an office or a clinic to get supervised therapeutic medication dosing up to six days a week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is pouring $70 million into summer educational programs to benefit students who have fallen behind academically and socially while learning remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. “Studies continue to show that amid the school closures, many students did miss out on some fundamental issues around math and reading,” the Republican governor said after touring a Canton middle school. The programs designed for every grade level – including high school seniors graduating this spring – will feature a mix of academic and recreational opportunities at schools, after-school providers, community colleges and recreation sites, he said. Many students were out of school for longer than a year during the pandemic, and some high school students continue to learn remotely. The programs include so-called Acceleration Academies, which will offer intensive instruction in one subject with smaller classes, longer instructional blocks and individualized attention. Under the Summer Acceleration to College program, class of 2021 high school graduates will be able to take math and English courses for credit at no cost at 14 community colleges. Another program is aimed at incoming kindergartners.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republican legislative leaders on Friday welcomed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s metric-based approach to further relaxing coronavirus restrictions, but they questioned what will happen if Michigan’s COVID-19 vaccination rate falls below targets. Their comments came a day after the Democratic governor announced four benchmarks that will trigger additional economic reopening – when 55%, 60%, 65% and 70% of people ages 16 and up get at least one shot. About half have done so to date. The state, where the seven-day infection rate remains highest in the U.S. but is dropping, now needs at least 2 of every 5 unvaccinated residents to receive a dose. “I think that we need a little more of a discussion on this metric of vaccines alone. I believe there’s a little more breadth that needs to be taken into consideration there, especially if we run into resistance and reluctance that causes us to plateau below the numbers that have been indicated,” Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said during a virtual event sponsored by the Detroit Regional Chamber. It included all four legislative leaders. House Speaker Jason Wentworth, R-Clare, applauded Whitmer for providing people “some sense of hope” and said both the vaccination rate and vaccine accessibility are important.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: About 100 people gathered at Lake George on Saturday morning to memorialize the nearly 400 area residents who have died from COVID-19 in the past year and to share messages of resilience and hope for the future. The event was organized by St. Cloud Times journalists Nora Hertel and Sarah Kocher. “I had the idea to do something like this in January,” Hertel said after the memorial. “I just thought, how are we honoring these people?” Each death has added to a “huge community loss,” Hertel said, and “I just felt like we needed to reckon with it.” The memorial took place on the deck on the east side of Lake George. Guests were invited to tie strips of cloth, donated by Gruber’s Quilt Shop in Waite Park, to the railing, where they will remain until Friday. Those ribbons fluttered in the breeze behind each speaker during the event. The Rev. James Alberts, of the Higher Ground Church of God in Christ, was the first guest to speak, opting to use his “pastor voice” instead of a microphone. “It’s good to see your faces, in a shared space and to be able to do this together,” Alberts said, before leading the group in prayer. “It’s so important that we recognize the loss of nearly 400 people in our area,” Mayor Dave Kleis said. “I hope there’s a day not too distant in the future where we will celebrate the last case of COVID.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves on Friday erased most restrictions he had set to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Republican governor left one rule in place: a mandate for students 6 or older to wear masks in schools for the rest of the current academic year. The school year ends within the next few weeks in most parts of the state. Reeves’ new executive order removes capacity restrictions for sports events. Previously, indoor arenas could only fill two-thirds of their seats to allow for social distancing. School sporting events and other activities were limited to 50% capacity for both indoor and outdoor events. Now, both indoor and outdoor school activities are no longer under capacity restrictions. “Getting our kids back in school last August was one of the most important decisions of the pandemic and keeping them in the classroom is one of my top priorities,” Reeves said in a statement Friday. “Even so – our class of 2021 has not been afforded a normal senior year. I want every one of them to attend their graduation and I want everyone in their family to be able to join them!” Reeves had already removed mask requirements in public spaces and all capacity restrictions for restaurants, bars and other businesses.\n\nMissouri\n\nReeds Spring: A southwest Missouri school district that dropped its mask mandate last month has decided to reinstate it after several students became infected with the coronavirus, leading to dozens of quarantines. The 1,700-student Reeds Spring district had gone weeks without a case when it decided to make masks optional beginning April 22. Several other districts in the Springfield area also have ditched mask orders in recent weeks. “It’s getting harder and harder to even get kids to keep those masks on as they are seeing people, adults and everyone in the community, not wearing masks,” Superintendent Cody Hirschi said in a video at the time. The change didn’t last long, though, before the district decided to reinstate the mandate starting Friday. “The cases of quarantine are really our biggest concern,” said district spokesman Ben Fisher, noting that six positive tests led to 95 quarantines in several buildings. “We really think it is essential for kids to be able to participate in end-of-year activities, so we decided this was the best option to keep kids in school.” Statewide, the percentage of Missouri residents receiving at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine barely budged Friday, remaining a little above 37% of the state population, KMIZ-TV reports.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state posted 169 new COVID-19 cases Saturday, bringing Montana’s total to 108,985 confirmed reports. Of the 108,985 cases, 106,324 are recovered, and 1,087 remain active. There are 53 people who are now hospitalized out of 5,021 total COVID-19 hospitalizations since the pandemic began, according to the state website covid19.mt.gov. Montana added two deaths overnight, bringing the total to 1,574 fatalities related to the respiratory illness. The state has thus far administered 1,302,221 tests for the coronavirus. The first case of COVID-19 in Montana was reported March 11, 2020. The state’s highest daily total of newly detected cases came Nov. 12, when 1,429 new cases were reported.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A community college is using federal COVID-19 relief funds to pay for tuition and books for high schoolers from the state to take courses this summer. The Omaha World-Herald reports officials at the Metropolitan Community College hope their newly approved offer will pull in thousands of students. The college saw about a 15% drop in summer enrollment from 2019 to 2020, said Bill Owen, the college’s vice president for strategic initiatives. “If we’re truly in recovery mode, and we hope we are, we think we’ll see a return to those numbers,” he said. Typically, high school students pay $33 per credit hour – half the full rate – if they enroll in a program called CollegeNow that is designed for high school students to jump-start their college education. While those students will be allowed to attend courses for free this summer, they will be responsible for tools and other required supplies.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The city has been almost elbow-to-elbow lately with pandemic-weary tourists looking for excitement and entertainment, after casinos rose from 35% to 50% occupancy March 15 under state health guidelines. Capacity limits in Las Vegas casinos dropped again Saturday – allowing 80% occupancy – while person-to-person distancing went from 6 feet to 3 feet. Masks are still required. “People were just yearning to go someplace and let loose,” said Alan Feldman, a former casino executive who is now a fellow at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Among the first arrivals were people ages 60 and older who were recently vaccinated with time and disposable income, he said. Analysts said pent-up demand, available hotel rooms and $1,400 federal pandemic recovery checks have contributed to the rush. “People are feeling more comfortable traveling as science appears to be getting ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Jeremy Aguero, principal analyst at Applied Analysis in Las Vegas. And every Sunday, a nearly 20-mile line of vehicles jams southbound Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line. “You have visitors coming throughout the week, all leaving at the same time,” Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Travis Smaka said. “It’s very busy every Sunday.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu says state health officials and private agencies have begun a number of initiatives to encourage residents to get vaccinated. Officials warn that New Hampshire, which has been leading the nation in the percentage of the population that’s received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, is starting to see growth in the number of fully vaccinated residents slow down. WMUR-TV reports many people who are eligible to receive a shot have not signed up for an appointment. Data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows more than 790,000 New Hampshire residents have received their first dose, about 60% of the population, while more than 351,000 of those people are fully vaccinated, or about 26% of the population. The state says a series of public service announcements and electronic billboards will encourage people who may be hesitant to get vaccinated. Experts say it is important for everyone to get inoculated. “They may not become ill. They may be a transmitter and simply part of an asymptomatic transmission,” said Martha Wassell, director of Infection Prevention at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital. “That could in turn spread this to someone who either was vaccinated, and it didn’t work well, or for whatever medical reason could not be vaccinated.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Business, casino and political officials called on Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday to ease coronavirus regulations enough to allow conventions and trade shows to resume in the city. Saying the convention industry generates nearly $2 billion in annual revenue for Atlantic City, the groups asked the Democratic governor to allow meetings to utilize available space at 50% of capacity, as is permitted on the gambling floors of the city’s nine casinos. Michael Chait, president of the Greater Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce, praised Murphy’s handling of the pandemic but said state-imposed rules are inconsistent and are hurting the convention industry. “I can only have 25 people in a meeting room, but I can have 225 people in a banquet hall,” he said at a press conference on the Boardwalk as workmen attended to the facade of Boardwalk Hall in anticipation of the summer tourism season. “I can have 50% capacity on the casino floor, but I can only take 25 of them and put them into an adjacent meeting room.” Chait said the city would like to be able to host conventions and trade shows at 50% of capacity, using the same safety and distancing protocols the casinos have been using since they were allowed to reopen last July. He said the casino industry has proven it is possible to operate at higher levels without compromising safety.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A judge has ordered education officials to provide computers and high-speed internet to students who still don’t have them in a landmark ruling that for the first time in the state has set a standard for internet speeds for public school children. The ruling requires state officials to immediately determine which students covered by the sweeping lawsuit are still lacking quality internet or devices and to provide them with what they need, including transportation if they can’t get fast internet from home. “Children who are lacking access to internet and technology for remote learning are not getting much of an education, if at all, let alone one that is sufficient to make them college and career ready,” state District Judge Matthew Wilson said in the ruling Friday morning. It’s unclear how the court might compel state officials to act on the ruling or when it might hold them in contempt. The vast majority of New Mexico schools are open to in-person learning. But school districts serving tribal areas, which were particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 cases and deaths, are still under lockdown orders, and some are still in remote or partially remote learning. About 10% of New Mexico children are Native American and often confront major barriers to online and in-person learning.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants in New York City can increase their indoor dining to 75% of capacity starting Friday, May 7, in line with the rest of the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday. That will let city eateries fill more of their tables on Mother’s Day, May 9. Cuomo on Friday also said personal services including hair salons and barbershops could expand to 75% capacity starting May 7 as well. Gyms in New York City can go to 50% capacity starting May 15. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio both spoke Thursday about wanting to see coronavirus-related restrictions lifted in the next couple of months. Infection rates throughout the state have continued to fall at a steady pace in recent weeks as more people have become vaccinated against COVID-19. The number of new infections reported daily in New York has dropped 56% since the start of April, even as more and more social activity has resumed. Still, the crisis isn’t over yet. A majority of New Yorkers have yet to receive even a single dose of the vaccine. The state recorded 25,000 positive coronavirus tests in the prior seven days, more than it did in the entire month of September.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Some low-income families missed out on getting coronavirus relief grants last year because of administrative and qualifying hurdles required by the General Assembly, a state audit concluded last week. The legislature in September approved using federal COVID-19 relief funds to give families one-time $335 payments. The “Extra Credit Grant” money was designed to assist with virtual schooling and child care costs during the pandemic but could be used for any purpose. Lawmakers tasked the Department of Revenue with managing the program. More than 1.1 million payments had been sent by the department through December totaling about $375 million, according to State Auditor Beth Wood’s office. They were sent automatically to families who were 2019 tax filers and reported having at least one child age 16 or under. But parents or guardians who didn’t make enough money in 2019 to file a return were required to fill out an application to obtain payments. By the end of 2020, about 25,000 payments had been made to those who had applied, the performance audit said. Wood’s report found that other low-income families didn’t receive payments because of the additional steps the Revenue Department had to complete within a matter of weeks to accept applications and award payments.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The 2021 Legislature reached its finale early Friday in a session marked by a record-high state budget, the first expulsion of a lawmaker and pandemic protocols that greatly dampened public participation at the state Capitol. Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford, the state Senate’s presiding officer, hit the final gavel at 12:26 a.m. Friday. House members officially completed their work at 12:18 a.m. after finishing a brief chorus of “Auld Lang Syne.” Lawmakers from both sides exchanged handshakes and hugs after a marathon day that came to an end after approval of the spending bill for the Office of Management and Budget, which also serves as Legislature’s last-minute catchall measure. Thursday was Day 76 for the Legislature, just short of the 80-day maximum set by the North Dakota Constitution. The Legislature will use the remaining days later in the year to approve new legislative districts. The Republican-led Legislature has passed record-setting budgets in most of the past several sessions, but the spending plan for the next two-year budget cycle is particularly eye-popping, due in part to federal coronavirus aid. As the session wound down Thursday, lawmakers completed work on a nearly $17 billion, two-year budget, about $2.1 billion more than the current budget cycle ending June 30.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Teens have been trickling into COVID-19 vaccination clinics ever since Gov. Mike DeWine opened up eligibility to everyone 16 and older March 29. Soon, experts say it’s possible a vaccine will be allowed for children as young as 5. Dr. Robert Frenck, director of the Gamble Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, said that could happen by August or September. Until then, public health officials are working to get more and more eligible teens vaccinated. In some cases, that means bringing clinics to school buildings. Milford High School in Clermont County hosted a vaccination clinic in partnership with Clermont Public Health last month. District spokesperson Wendy Planicka said about 200 people came to the clinic, 150 of whom were students. Milford senior Jack McKenney, 18, said he caught the coronavirus in the fall. He said he didn’t feel very sick, and a sinus infection he had last March was much worse. Still, he went to Milford’s clinic because he’s worried about spreading COVID-19.“I mean, I know if I were to get COVID again, I would most likely be OK, but it’s just I’m relieved that I wouldn’t give it to someone else as easily,” he said. Other school districts are considering hosting vaccine clinics or at least encouraging students to get shots if able.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Mask mandates intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus are ending in the state’s two largest cities, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The requirement ended Friday in Oklahoma City and Saturday in Tulsa, although the mandate continues at places such as city offices. Mayors David Holt in Oklahoma City and G.T. Bynum in Tulsa both credited COVID-19 vaccinations for lowering the number of virus cases and hospitalizations. “It is possible we are taking the miracle vaccinations for granted,” Holt said during a Friday news conference. “These proven, safe vaccines are remarkable.” Bynum said residents should also continue wearing masks when in groups of people outside their family. “While we’re in a position to end the city’s mandate that people wear masks in public, that doesn’t mean everyone should have a mask-burning party over the weekend,” Bynum said Thursday. In both cities, private businesses can continue requiring masks if desired. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Friday reported 448,305 total virus cases since the pandemic began. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in the state has declined from 314.4 daily to 240.7, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: A vaccine clinic set up inside a high school attracted anti-vaccine protesters who heckled teenagers as they entered the site Thursday, prompting the church that provided a parking lot for the event to call police. The Bend-La Pine School District plans to offer COVID-19 vaccines at six different clinics at Central Oregon high schools through June 3 in hopes of stemming an outbreak that’s sickened at least 95 students and staff, The Bulletin reports. Before the school clinics began, Bend-La Pine School Board members received hundreds of angry emails from anti-vaccine activists, said board member Julie Craig. Most had the exact same copy-and-paste wording, but a few were especially nasty, she said. Board member Carrie McPherson Douglass shared emails with The Bulletin that called the school board Nazis for allowing vaccine clinics. In one, a parent promised to “exact cruel and inhuman revenge” if their child was harmed by the shot. “I’m frankly so done with it,” Craig told the newspaper. “I’m so disappointed in community members who feel that is the best way to try and have a conversation, when they don’t agree with something that we’re doing.” In Oregon, teens 15 and up can agree to medical services – including immunization – without parental consent, according to the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Light of Life Rescue Mission’s plans to hold a vaccine clinic for homeless people last month were upended about three hours before the event was supposed to start, when news broke that use of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine had been paused, the Tribune-Review reports. The shelter quickly shifted gears and administered the Moderna option instead, said Jerrel Gilliam, executive director. But the development altered Light of Life’s vaccine strategy, as clinicians had to inform patients without consistent housing that they needed to return for a second dose. “It is very frustrating,” Gilliam said. “This was part of our strategy to use in the camps because of the one shot.” U.S. health officials later lifted the 11-day J&J vaccine pause, but many of the challenges facing shelters and the homeless during the pandemic will remain. More than 70% of residents in Light of Life’s long-term program have been fully vaccinated, which provides some peace of mind, Gilliam said. But in a population with so much transience and turnover, he said the shelter can’t let its guard down. Barriers to health care, mental health care, food and other basic needs will remain, even after COVID-19 is resolved. “There is some concern that this population will once again go to the back burner,” Gilliam said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Health is partnering with nine colleges and universities to make getting a COVID-19 shot as easy as possible for all students, faculty and staff before the end of the spring semester. Under the program announced Thursday, schools will either hold on-campus vaccination clinics or provide free shuttle service from campus to vaccination sites. “Now that vaccine eligibility is open to all people 16 and older who live, work, or go to school in Rhode Island, it’s important that we get our young people who live in congregate settings vaccinated,” Gov. Daniel McKee said in a statement. For example, Brown University is participating at a designated day at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center in Providence by providing shuttle service to the clinic. Roger Williams University is partnering with the town of Bristol to host an on-campus clinic. Bryant University, the University of Rhode Island, Providence College, Community College of Rhode Island, New England Institute of Technology, Rhode Island College and the Rhode Island School of Design are also participating in the program. Many colleges are requiring students to be vaccinated before returning to campus for the fall. There is no cost to get a shot, and participants do not need health insurance.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Masks continue to be important in schools and many other crowded public settings, state health officials said Friday, after Gov. Henry McMaster last week called masks in schools the “height of ridiculosity.” McMaster criticized the requirements Wednesday, and in a Twitter post he also urged cities and towns to remove mask requirements. Other state officials, from education and health departments, have voiced concern about the Republican governor’s mask recommendations. The South Carolina Department of Education and state Department of Health and Environmental Control have both issued statements saying mask usage is critical to preventing the spread of the coronavirus. South Carolina’s assistant state epidemiologist said Friday in a media briefing that mask mandates in cities and towns continue to be important. Even in cities that have taken away those orders, Dr. Jane Kelly said, “I would urge you to protect yourself, your family and your community by wearing a mask.” She said masks work and likened wearing a mask to wearing a seat belt because once traffic fatalities began to drop, and seat belts were widely adopted, the belts remained, and the fatalities stayed low.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The 2020 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally caused “widespread transmission” of the coronavirus across the United States, finds a new study released Thursday. More than 463 COVID-19 cases across 30 states were directly connected to the Sturgis Rally in August and September 2020. Seventeen patients were hospitalized, and one person died, according to the report by the Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The information was reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including members of the CDC COVID-19 Response Team, though a disclaimer in the study says the findings “do not necessarily represent the official position.” A total of 649 primary and secondary cases were attributed to the South Dakota event in the study. About 56% of the Sturgis-associated cases were reported in South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska and Wyoming. “While the number of cases identified is sizable – 140 cases per 100,000 attendees – it is likely that the true national impact of the Sturgis event is underestimated,” the report says. Some attendees could have been asymptomatic or hadn’t been tested when they returned home from the rally, leading to untraceable infections.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: For the second year in a row, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville has recommended no increase in tuition or fees for students. It’s a purposeful decision to help students in a challenging time as families continue to recover from the economic effects of COVID-19, UT Knoxville Chancellor Donde Plowman said Friday. “The proposed budget with no increase in tuition and fees represents our commitment to provide affordable access to a world-class education, especially as students and families continue to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic,” Plowman said. “We are also grateful for the state support we receive, which helps us keep tuition flat and continue to offer the academic opportunities and college experiences that make our university special.” The chancellor’s advisory board approved the flat tuition and fees for the 2021-22 school year Friday morning, as part of the budget recommendation for the next fiscal year. The budget and tuition recommendations still needs to be approved by the board of trustees later this year. Last year, tuition and fees were kept flat at all UT campuses because of financial hardship caused by the coronavirus. The year before that, tuition increased by 2%. There was no tuition increase in 2018.\n\nTexas\n\nArlington: A runoff for a U.S. House seat is set between Republican Susan Wright, whose husband was the first member of Congress to die after being diagnosed with COVID-19, and Republican Jake Ellzey. Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez was narrowly locked out of the runoff in Texas’ 6th Congressional District, which has long been GOP territory. With nearly all votes counted, Sanchez had trailed Ellzey by 354 votes. She said in a statement Sunday that her campaign “came up short.” “Democrats have come a long way toward competing in Texas but we still have a long way to go,” Sanchez said in a statement. Ellzey is a state lawmaker who narrowly lost the GOP nomination for the seat in 2018 and carried the backing of former Gov. Rick Perry. Susan Wright had already been seen as a favorite in a crowded race to fill the seat of her late husband, who died in February after being diagnosed with COVID-19. He was 67. The date of the runoff has not yet been set. Wright will enter the runoff with the backing of former President Donald Trump, who waited until just days before the election to endorse Wright.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: In the past year, lifestyle changes sparked by society’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to more time at home, more time in front of a screen and a propensity for more frequent snacking. “We call it the COVID diet,” said Dr. Daniel Cannon, a pediatrician with Red Rock Pediatrics in St. George. “We’ve seen a real uptick in weight gain in a lot of kids.” Although the problem may have increased due to factors related to pandemic-era lifestyles, it’s definitely not the first time medical professionals have seen this problem. “Childhood obesity is basically an epidemic,” Cannon said. The problem stems from an increasingly unhealthy lifestyle in children and adolescents and from behaviors sometimes learned from generations of family obesity, he said. Other causes may include a lack of education on the topic of health, poverty, home environment, and accessibility of health care and healthy nutrition. “We call these ‘social determinants of health,’ ” Cannon said, adding that these determinants and others are screened for and discussed at each well visit in order to identify concerning trends before they become a problem. When it comes to increasing activity in children and young adults, Cannon said it’s best to find something the child is interested in and build activity around that.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state relaxed its guidance on mask-wearing outside Saturday while also moving to the second phase of reopening that allows larger gatherings, lifts industry-specific guidance for most businesses, and requires them to all follow the same rules about wearing masks, distancing and staying home when sick, Gov. Phil Scott said Friday. Vaccinated and unvaccinated Vermonters will no longer be required to wear masks outdoors if they are able to physically distance themselves. The new rules follow updated guidance last week from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Scott said during his twice-weekly virus briefing. Masks will only be required in crowds or with multiple households when distancing isn’t possible, said Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine. “The science and data show that outdoor transmission is rare; it poses little risk if you follow our guidance,” the Republican governor said. Municipalities and businesses can have stricter policies if they want, Scott said. More than 60% of adult residents are vaccinated, meeting the state’s goal to move to the second phase of reopening, Scott said. If the state reaches 70% of adults vaccinated by June 1, it will be able to take its final step to turn mandates into recommendations in July, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: Republican candidates for governor touted plans to reopen schools and lift pandemic restrictions as they made videotaped pitches to the tens of thousands of party delegates who will choose a nominee at a convention next Saturday. Pandemic restrictions on mass gatherings have prevented the GOP from holding a traditional convention, so the party has instead opted to hold an “unassembled convention” in which delegates who preregistered to participate will cast ballots at more than 30 locations to choose a nominee. The convention will use ranked-choice voting to more closely mimic the balloting at a traditional convention, where the field is winnowed in successive votes until one candidate gets a minority. And because the candidates won’t be able to make traditional convention speeches to assembled delegates, the GOP arranged for candidates to submit videos touting themselves on the party’s website, which were posted Saturday night.\n\nWashington\n\nRepublic: About 10% of the population of this small city in north-central Washington has tested positive for the coronavirus in an outbreak traced to large indoor events last month at the local Fraternal Order of Eagles hall. Ferry County Memorial Hospital officials have confirmed more than 100 cases, with one reported death, since the April 9-11 events, including a membership drive that featured dinner, live music and a 1980s-themed karaoke night. Some patients have had to be transferred to Wenatchee and Yakima because of a lack of capacity at the 25-bed hospital – the only hospital in a 50-mile radius – and other closer facilities. “In Ferry County especially, we’re seeing really sick young people showing up in the emergency room to get care,” Northeast Tri County Health Officer Dr. Sam Artzis said, according to The Spokesman-Review. The county previously had relatively few COVID-19 cases, and many in the conservative, rural community saw mask mandates as infringing on their liberty. Less than one-quarter of the county’s residents have received a vaccine to date, according to the health district, but officials said the outbreak has increased interest in it. The situation should serve as a warning to other communities about the danger of large indoor events with unvaccinated people, they said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: Signs featuring the words “Now Hiring” and “Help Wanted” are an increasingly common sight outside restaurants locally, but surprisingly few people are stepping forward and taking those jobs, business owners and hiring managers say. The COVID-19 pandemic put many people out of work as restrictions kept diners out of restaurants. Adjustments such as more drive-thru traffic, deliveries and limited seating helped, but restaurants cut back on wait staff and other employees. Restrictions are starting to relax, but now they are having trouble bringing new employees in. Jamie Null, executive director of the Mercer County Convention & Visitors Bureau, said local restaurants and service industries have been looking for new employees, but they are not receiving many applicants. Some area restaurants are seeing people ask about jobs, but few are taking the next step from applicant to employee. The Corner Shop in downtown Bramwell has been hiring for months, manager Mandy Fink said. She said she believed some of the people who apply but never follow through are listing applications so they can keep receiving unemployment benefits. “Right now, there’s a lot of people who are able to work,” she said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Capitol, closed to the public since late March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, will reopen Monday, Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced Friday. It will be opened for limited hours, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and only on weekdays. Before the pandemic, the building stayed open until 6 p.m. during the week and was also open on weekends. There will be no public tours of the Capitol, but the tour desk will be staffed for visitors to get information. Only one entrance to the building will be open to the public. Capitol staff, including those who work for Evers, lawmakers and the state Supreme Court, have been working out of the building for months. The Legislature has also been holding hearings and floor sessions, which are open to the public. State office buildings that surround the Capitol remain closed, but Evers has said he’s targeting a return to work for many this summer. Republicans have been pushing Evers to move faster to open the offices. As of Friday, more than 43% of people in Wisconsin had received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, while nearly 34% were fully vaccinated, according to the state Department of Health Services.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Telephone scammers are trying to take advantage of an accidental Wyoming Department of Health data release affecting over a quarter of the state’s population, agency officials said Friday. Scammers request insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or other financial information and in some cases look like they’re calling from state government numbers, department administrator Jeri Hendricks said in a statement. “No one representing the department will ask you for insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or personal financial information. No one representing the department will call you about the breach unless they are returning a call you made to us first,” Hendricks said. The scammers appear to be targeting residents at random and not through access to phone numbers inadvertently released, department spokeswoman Kim Deti said. A department employee working with computer code accidentally posted coronavirus test results as well as associated names, addresses, birth dates and other information on GitHub.com, an internet-based software development platform. The employee released coronavirus plus flu test results for 145,698 Wyoming residents. Also posted were blood alcohol test results for 18,312 people, mainly from Wyoming but also other states, dating to 2012.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/22/sequoia-toll-daffodil-project-ferret-release-news-around-states/49419721/", "title": "Sequoia toll, Daffodil Project: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A television station has donated thousands of items including historic footage from the civil rights era to the Alabama Department of Archives and History, which will make the material available to the public. WSFA-TV in Montgomery announced it had given the agency materials dating to the 1950s, including footage from news conferences by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., coverage of the Freedom Riders in 1961 and original film from the “Stand in the School House Door” by then-Gov. George C. Wallace in 1963. The video also includes scenes from a visit to the NASA center in Huntsville by the President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson in 1962 and special reports on the death of former University of Alabama football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant in 1983. As the TV station was planning to switch locations, managers determined it wasn’t practical to move the large numbers of delicate film reels and boxes full of video and other items. Steve Murray, the state archives director, said archivists had long suspected the WSFA studios held valuable content for historical preservation, and his department jumped at the opportunity to add to its collection when a phone call came in late 2019.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Members of the Biden administration have launched a series of events aimed at exploring the Arctic’s potential to act as a “living laboratory of clean energy innovation.” Officials participating in the online event, billed as “ArcticX,” spoke of the challenges faced by remote communities in Alaska’s Arctic region, such as high energy costs and impacts from climate change. During the event’s broad discussions, they said they see opportunities for sustainable or renewable energy systems. Wednesday’s meeting was the first of four planned online events, with an in-person gathering set for May in Alaska. Among the speakers was U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Offices that fall under the department co-hosted the event. “We hope to combine the world-class expertise of our national labs, of our 17 national labs, with the know-how that Arctic communities have developed over centuries of innovation in the far north so together we can get new technologies out of the lab and into the field and onto the market and support communities in taking control of their own clean energy future,” Granholm said. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable sources accounted for about 30% of Alaska’s electricity generation in 2019. Many rural communities rely largely on diesel electric generators for power.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Motor Vehicle Division failed to notify more than 34,000 drivers that their licenses had been suspended, revoked or canceled and also lagged for months in alerting prosecutors. The MVD notified county attorney’s offices around the state of the problem Wednesday, saying in an email that notices weren’t mailed “beginning in late 2020 and ending in March.” A glitch with the agency’s mailing process was the cause. “When MVD discovered this issue in February 2021, the first step was to understand what caused the problem, the extent of customers affected and how to resolve the problem,” MVD spokesman Doug Parcey said in an email. “Once those were known, the affected customers were immediately notified.” Some prosecutors learned about the issue from defense attorneys. Potentially thousands of drivers might have been arrested and prosecuted or paid hefty fines because they unknowingly drove with a suspended license. Prosecutors in Maricopa and Pinal counties have already flagged more than 1,000 cases. Municipal and justice courts will also have to review cases involving suspended licenses. “Our first priority is to look at convictions,” said Rachel Mitchell, acting division chief of the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office. “We are focusing on prison. … It is certainly scary for me as a prosecutor.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State lawmakers on Friday delayed a vote on whether to allow state-run health care facilities to require employees to get COVID-19 vaccines – a move officials say is needed to protect millions of dollars in federal funding. The Arkansas Legislative Council voted to delay considering the requests by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs for an exemption from a state law banning vaccine requirements by government entities. The law conflicts with a federal COVID-19 vaccine requirement for health care workers issued by President Joe Biden’s administration that’s set to take effect in January. A group of Republican-led states, including Arkansas, have asked a federal judge to block its enforcement. UAMS could lose $600 million in Medicare and Medicaid funding and another $100 million in federal contracts if it doesn’t comply with the federal rule, Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson told the panel. Patterson said the exemption was needed to ensure that the university’s workers are in compliance with the federal requirement and that funding isn’t threatened. The panel did not set a date for considering the exemptions. But legislative leaders said they hoped to meet before Dec. 5.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of giant sequoias this year, leading to a staggering two-year death toll that accounts for up to nearly a fifth of Earth’s largest trees, officials said Friday. Fires in Sequoia National Park and surrounding Sequoia National Forest tore through more than a third of groves in California and torched an estimated 2,261 to 3,637 sequoias, which are the largest trees by volume. Nearby wildfires last year killed an unprecedented 7,500 to 10,400 giant sequoias that are only native in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range. Losses now account for 13% to 19% of the 75,000 sequoias greater than 4 feet in diameter. Blazes so intense to burn hot enough and high enough to kill so many giant sequoias – trees once considered nearly fireproof – put an exclamation point on climate change’s impact. A warming planet that has created hotter droughts combined with a century of fire suppression that choked forests with thick undergrowth have fueled flames that have sounded the death knell for trees dating to ancient civilizations. “The sobering reality is that we have seen another huge loss within a finite population of these iconic trees that are irreplaceable in many lifetimes,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the parents of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after police stopped him on the street and put him in a neck hold two years ago, the city and family attorneys announced Friday. A federal magistrate judge accepted terms of the settlement after a mediation session, said Qusair Mohamedbhai, an attorney for McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain. Outside court, Sheneen McClain said she was glad to have the agreement finalized but noted the work of fighting for justice for her son just makes her miss him more. “The money is just the world’s way of saying, ‘We’re sorry,’ but it’s not going to help me heal the hole in my heart,” she said. The settlement amount was agreed to in July but not officially disclosed until now because of a dispute between McClain’s parents about how the wording of the agreement could affect their dispute over how the money should be divided. Sheneen McClain said Elijah’s father, LaWayne Mosley, was not involved in raising him. How the money will be divided will be addressed separately. In a statement, Mosley did not address the dispute but said he hoped the settlement would send a message to police. “I hope Elijah’s legacy is that police will think twice before killing another innocent person,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPlymouth: Officials believe nearly 40 drug overdoses across the state since July may be linked to marijuana laced with the powerful opioid fentanyl and are warning the public about the potential danger. State health officials said marijuana seized in Plymouth after an overdose in early October tested positive for fentanyl at the state crime lab. “This is the first lab confirmed case of marijuana with fentanyl in Connecticut and possibly the first confirmed case in the United States,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement Thursday. Officials had been investigating reports of people across Connecticut who overdosed and were revived with naloxone but denied using opioids. They told authorities they only smoked marijuana. There were 11 such overdoses in July, nine in August, nine in September and 10 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 26. No deaths were reported. Brian Foley, an aide to state public safety Commissioner James Rovella, said the state crime lab will now be testing all marijuana that police submit for fentanyl. An estimated 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in a recent one-year period – a never-before-seen milestone that health officials say is tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and a more dangerous drug supply.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In October, as the state allocated $78 million in federal money to health care facilities struggling with staffing shortages, hospitals received $25million total – only about one-third of what they requested. Health care workers, who have been fighting the coronavirus for nearly two years, have said they’re burned out and exhausted. Some chose to leave the hospital bedside or the profession entirely. Others declined financial incentives of several hundred dollars offered to fill shifts, citing mental health reasons. Many are jumping ship to other hospitals in Delaware or the Philadelphia area because health systems are providing hefty signing bonuses and significant increases in pay. Hospitals are also relying on travel nurses, who work in three-month shifts, to fill the gaps. Travel nurses can make twice as much or more what permanent hospital nurses take home in pay. ChristianaCare requested $40 million in federal aid, according to documents provided by the governor’s office. Instead, the state’s largest hospital and private employer received $12 million, the biggest sum any health system received. ChristianaCare, like others, continues to offer $10,000 signing bonuses for a number of open nursing positions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser’s decision to ease mask requirements in the nation’s capital has sparked a public debate about timing, with the majority of the D.C. Council pleading with her to reconsider. It’s a localized debate that reflects a broader national dynamic in the country’s coronavirus-mitigation stance, with some leaders and businesses pushing for more normalcy after the successful reopening of schools and others preaching caution against reckless pre-winter moves. Starting Monday, masks will no longer be required in many indoor spaces in D.C. They must still be worn in multiple settings, including schools, libraries, public transportation, ride-share vehicles, and group-living facilities like nursing homes, dorms and jails. Private businesses will still be able to require customers to wear masks. Bowser has cautiously hailed the step as a “shift in where we are with the pandemic,” saying the return of the mask mandate earlier this year helped blunt the late-summer surge of the delta variant. The nation’s capital originally lifted its indoor mask requirement for fully vaccinated individuals in May but reinstated it in late July as cases began to rise again. According to D.C. Health Department statistics, the current seven-day average of new cases is higher than it was in May but still well below the late-summer delta-variant peak.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed work on a $339 million Everglades restoration project aimed at cleansing water runoff before it flows into a troubled river. Corps and local officials held a ceremony Friday for the 12,000-acre project in Martin County known officially as the C-44 Reservoir and Stormwater Treatment Area. It’s a key part of a broader effort to restore the vast Florida Everglades. The reservoir will capture, store and clean fertilizer-laden runoff from farms and development before it is routed into the St. Lucie River and ultimately the Indian River Lagoon. Both have been plagued by harmful algae blooms and other long-term problems associated with water pollution that threatens wildlife and human health. “I think it’s huge” for the east coast, said Chauncey Goss, chair of the South Florida Water Management District. “Not only symbolically, but it’s also going to be taking water, cleaning it up and helping to get rid of some of these discharges, which is really the goal of all of this.” The project can store 19.7 billion gallons of water, according to state water managers. It will use plants such as cattails to suck up about 35 metric tons of phosphorus every year before the water makes its way into the St. Lucie River.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCumming: Leaders with Forsyth County Schools, Congregation Beth Israel and the OneForsyth Council have planted 500 daffodil bulbs outside the school district’s new Forsyth County Arts and Learning Center as part of the Daffodil Project, a worldwide initiative aiming to plant the flowers all over in honor of each of the 1.5 million children who died during the Holocaust. Thanks to the partnership, Forsyth County will now be home to 500 of those daffodils, which will bloom in the spring on Holocaust Remembrance Day. FCS Superintendent Dr. Jeff Bearden, Rabbi Levi Mentz with Congregation Beth Israel and OneForsyth Council Chair Kristin Cook all gave opening remarks at a Nov. 8 ceremony before county and school district leaders began planting each of the bulbs. Cook said she was proud to be there, speaking on behalf of OneForsyth, the Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce’s diversity initiative, and modeling their guiding principles of uniting, celebrating and promoting inclusion in the county. “Our hope is that, by continuing to support events like these, we will all grow to appreciate the unique identities that embody us all,” Cook said. Metz said he was overjoyed to see the project coming to Forsyth County, his involvement feeling personal to him and his family since his grandfather was a survivor of the Holocaust.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is considering additional protections for waters off the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. NOAA announced the proposal to designate oceanic areas of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which is already one of the largest protected natural areas in the world, as a national marine sanctuary on Friday. The agency opened the plan to public comment through January. The designation would build on existing protections meant to maintain marine habitats and wildlife. The new rules would apply only to oceanic areas, not the islands that are already part of the monument. “Papahānaumokuākea’s ecosystems are increasingly under pressure from threats such as marine debris, invasive species, and climate change,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state of Hawaii and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs currently co-manage the monument. Papahānaumokuākea is larger than all other U.S. national parks combined and is home to endangered Hawaiian monk seals, green sea turtles, seabirds and extensive coral reef ecosystems. The area is home to many species found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: If anyone has a good idea on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon, the U.S. government wants to hear about it. NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab on Friday put out a request for proposals for a fission surface power system. NASA is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to establish a sun-independent power source for missions to the moon by the end of the decade. “Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,” Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. If the effort is successful in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next objective would be Mars. NASA says fission surface power could provide sustained, abundant power no matter the environmental conditions on the moon or Mars. “I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,” Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement. The reactor would be built on Earth and then sent to the moon.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new store at the Illinois State Museum will feature products from the state, along with themed souvenirs, specialty foods and toys. The Shop opened to the public Saturday. Families were invited to attend an opening event in their flannel and fleece pajamas. The store is located in the first floor of the Illinois State Museum, which owns and operates the Shop to fund programs and research. Cinnamon Catlin-Legutko, the museum’s director, called the opening an important moment in the museum’s return to operations. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner’s administration shut down the museum in 2015 during an ongoing budget impasse. It reopened the following year but since then has seen closures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The museum was established in 1877 and has branch facilities in Lewistown and Lockport.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A renewed push for the state to join more than two-thirds of states with some form of legalized marijuana use appears to face the same roadblock from Statehouse Republicans who have opposed such a step for many years. Legislative Democrats and the state Democratic Party united last week in urging approval of marijuana legalization during the legislative session that starts in January, arguing that it could benefit those wanting to use it for medical purposes, create new jobs and become an additional state tax revenue source. The Republican-dominated Legislature has not taken any action on bills submitted over the past decade for allowing medical marijuana or removing criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug, even as recreational marijuana sales have won approval in Michigan and Illinois and as medical use is allowed in Ohio. Legalization advocates haven’t yet changed the minds of legislative leaders, who reject arguments that Indiana is losing money to neighboring states and point to pot still being illegal under federal law. “I think when you make the argument about having that substantial a public policy change just because you’re trying to chase dollars makes no sense to me, so I’m in the same place I’ve been,” Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: A city park will now be named Ioway Creek Park to align with the creek’s name change earlier this year. The Ames City Council voted unanimously last week to change the name of Squaw Creek Park to Ioway Creek Park. In February, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names changed the name of Squaw Creek, a 42-mile-long tributary of the South Skunk River, to Ioway Creek, as the original name is considered derogatory to Native Americans. The Ames Tribune reports that an Indigenous teen, Fawn Stubben, pushed for the change in the 1990s, but the proposal wasn’t considered until Ames resident Jasmine Martin applied to the federal board in 2019. The Ames City Council and Story County Board of Supervisors both voted in support of the change. The current name honors the Ioway, an Indigenous tribe that once lived in parts of Iowa. Creek sign names have since been adjusted around Ames, but there were still remnants of the former name, including Squaw Creek Drive. The street was renamed Stonehaven Drive as part of the meeting’s consent agenda. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Friday formally declared “squaw” a derogatory term and said she is taking steps to remove it from federal government use and to replace other derogatory place names.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Next year, the state will start requiring employers, individuals and health insurance companies to pay some costs associated with coronavirus testing. The state Department of Health and Environment announced Friday that it will start phasing out free screening tests for people who aren’t showing COVID-19 symptoms or haven’t potentially been exposed. The agency said it expects the policy to begin in March 2022. The department said it can’t sustain having public health agencies cover the cost of all testing indefinitely. The agency said it initially allocated $141 million in federal funds to make coronavirus tests available and support commercial and university labs to expand processing and sampling capacity. But the department said infections from the delta variant depleted the funds faster than expected. “Testing has become an increasingly important way in which those who choose to be unvaccinated may still be able to work, attend events, and travel,” Ashley Goss, the department’s acting secretary, said in a statement. The changes will mainly affect programs used by employers to test 10% of their workers on a regular basis and programs by community organizations to offer free rapid tests.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city has received a perfect 100 score from the Human Rights Campaign, a national civil rights organization, for its laws, policies, services and programs to protect and support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. The city received a total score of 106 for additional steps it has taken over the past few years to benefit the LGBTQ community. It’s the highest ranking of any city in Kentucky, though Louisville has received a perfect score for several years. A 100 is considered a perfect score, but cities can earn up to 122 additional points for programs and services. “We’ve worked hard to create an atmosphere welcoming all people,” Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said. “That hard work has resulted in the highest score received by a Kentucky city.” It’s the first time since the rankings began eight years ago that Lexington has earned a perfect score. In 2020, it received a 95 out of 100. Lexington received high marks despite Kentucky not having a statewide LGBTQ nondiscrimination law. The Human Rights Campaign evaluated more than 506 cities across the country. Other evaluated Kentucky cities include Berea, Bowling Green, Covington, Frankfort, Morehead and Owensboro. Covington’s score was 96. The lowest-scoring Kentucky city was Owensboro with 18.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State lawmakers on Friday lambasted Louisiana’s temporary housing program enacted after Hurricane Ida, saying it continues to move too slowly to help people living in damaged homes and tents since late August. “We’re moving at a snail’s pace. It’s just unbelievable,” said Sen. Mike Fesi, a Houma Republican who represents Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, which were among the hardest hit by Ida. The state has spent $90 million in federal disaster aid on more than 2,000 trailers to provide temporary shelter to residents in southeastern Louisiana. Half have been placed on residents’ properties and other community housing sites, and 653 families have moved into the trailers so far, the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness told lawmakers. The program has received near-constant criticism about the time it’s taking to place trailers since Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration launched the Hurricane Ida Sheltering Program on Oct. 4. That critique spilled over into Friday’s meeting of the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, as the homeland security agency asked lawmakers to approve $500 million in authority to spend federal disaster recovery aid. Director Casey Tingle defended the housing program, telling lawmakers: “We have a brand new program that’s never been done before.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The developer of a $1 billion electric transmission line is suspending construction at the request of the governor after she certified election results Friday in which residents firmly opposed the project. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills had urged New England Clean Energy Connect Transmission LLC to stop construction on the 145-mile project until legal challenges are resolved. Thorn Dickinson, president and CEO of NECEC, said work will be temporarily halted until a judge rules on a request for a preliminary injunction in its lawsuit contending the referendum was unconstitutional. “This was not an easy decision. Suspending construction will require the layoff of more than 400 Mainers just as the holiday season begins,” Dickinson said in a statement Friday evening. Mills supports the project but said she also supports “the rule of law that governs our society and the will of the people that informs it.” Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the project would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid. That’s enough electricity for 1 million homes. Critics said the project is damaging the woods and changing the character of a part of western Maine with little if any benefit for its residents.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: With sailboats taking over Carroll Creek, a unique holiday tradition has returned to downtown Frederick for its sixth year. About two dozen sailboats were launched in the creek Saturday as part of the annual Sailing Through the Winter Solstice project. Volunteers rushed about Saturday morning, lowering the boats off the banks of the creek into the water. Some volunteers had the unenviable task of wading through the water on the chilly November morning to ensure the boats were anchored in place. Peter Kremers, who co-founded and serves as the chair of the event, said there were about 25 sailboats in and around the creek this year. Now in its sixth year, the project has quickly grown into a beloved part of the holiday season in the city. This year’s event has more sailboats than ever. “We started with one boat in ’16,” Kremers said of the project’s speedy growth. “I think last year we had maybe 19 in the water; this year we have 22 boats in the water and three on land.” The sailboats will stay on Carroll Creek until March, each fitted with lights and decorations to brighten up the dark nights of winter. But the goal isn’t just to make the downtown look nice. The project also helps raise a significant amount of money for a number of local charities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A 48-foot white spruce chosen as the city’s Christmas tree has arrived from Nova Scotia as part of a decades-old tradition. This year’s tree was donated by L’Arche Cape Breton, a nonprofit that provides homes and work for people with disabilities. The 60-year-old tree was on the nonprofit’s property on Canada’s Cape Breton Island. A police escort brought the tree to Boston Common on Thursday, WCVB-TV reports. Nova Scotia donates a tree to Boston every year as a token of gratitude for relief efforts by Bostonians after a munitions ship exploded in Halifax Harbor in 1917, killing or injuring thousands of people. It will be lit Dec. 2. For Massachusetts residents buying a Christmas tree locally, finding the perfect one may prove difficult this year. Tree sellers are expecting one of their busiest and most challenging seasons yet, The Boston Globe reports. Last year, with many people cooped up at home during the pandemic, everyone wanted a tree – sometimes more than one, the National Christmas Tree Association said. Many local Christmas tree farms cut and sold trees they normally would have left in the ground. That means some sellers this year have fewer, shorter trees.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Pure Michigan is marketing the state’s upcoming winter season in an advertising campaign running in key regional and state markets. The Still Pure Michigan campaign is expected to run through the end of February and use broadcast and connected television, online video and digital ads, and social media, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. said. Much of the focus of the tourism and marketing campaign will be on travel and shopping. Advertising spots will run in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Lansing, Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, Traverse City, Cadillac, Marquette and Alpena. They also will be seen in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Kentucky. This year’s total winter advertising budget tops $3 million. The launch of the Pure Michigan campaign comes just ahead of the opening of many of Michigan’s ski resorts for the year, according to the MEDC. “As winter approaches, adventure awaits us in the form of downhill skiing, fat-tire biking or snowshoeing epic backcountry landscapes,” Travel Michigan Vice President Dave Lorenz said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Farmers across the state who grow about 45 million turkeys annually will benefit from higher prices this year, according to agriculture experts. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture said the price of turkeys has steadily increased as demand has risen following a year when there were fewer family gatherings, and restaurant traffic was down due to the coronavirus pandemic. “USDA is actually predicting this year to be a record-high price for turkeys,” said Tim Petry, a livestock marketing economist with the North Dakota State University Extension Service. “From a price standpoint, these are the best prices they’ve seen for a number of years. So, you know, that’s good news for producers.” The good news on prices is tempered somewhat by rising costs to raise the birds on more than 500 farms in the state, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Higher prices for corn and soybeans to feed the turkeys are cutting into profits, growers said. “Those are our two biggest ingredients, and and those prices were substantially higher than last year or past years,” said Jessica Westbrock, the president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. While turkey prices are up 17 cents a pound from last year, Petry said consumers are still likely to find bargains, as many stores sell turkeys below cost.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi School Boards Association is joining a handful of other states in breaking ties with the National School Board Association after the nonprofit sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking for federal support investigating harassment and threats of violence against school board members. Mississippi School Boards’ leadership wrote this week in a letter explaining the decision that the National School Boards Association’s “inflammatory language and the request for federal agencies to intervene in our communities, was just one in a series of lapses in governance.” It said Mississippi will end its relationship with the nonprofit NSBA on June 30, 2022, the end of the term for which the Mississippi School Boards Association has paid its dues to the national organization. Mississippi will then work with school board associations in other states to form a new organization that “will provide services to its member state school boards associations which are requested by and tailored to each member state school boards associations’ unique needs.” Local school boards across the country have become political battlegrounds over issues such as COVID-19-related mask rules, the treatment of transgender students, and how to teach the history of racism and slavery in America.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A couple who gained fame after waving guns at protesters near their home in 2020 are seeking to keep their law licenses by arguing their actions were justified because they were defending their property from a violent and threatening mob. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who are both lawyers, made that claim in response to a complaint asking the Missouri Supreme Court to suspend their licenses. The demonstrators went past the McCloskeys’ home June 28, 2020, at the height of racial injustice protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The couple, who were eating dinner on the patio with their daughter, responded by waving two weapons at the protesters. No shots were fired, and no one was hurt. Their actions gained praise from conservatives, including then-President Donald Trump. Mark McCloskey is now a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. They contend in their legal response that the demonstrations “involved significant unlawful and violent conduct,” KCUR reports. The response cites a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association finding nearly 89% of protests in St. Louis in June 2020 involved unlawful activity, and 11% involved some level of violence. Still, special prosecutor Richard Callahan has said his investigation determined the protesters near the McCloskeys’ home were peaceful.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Biden administration on Friday said it will consider new measures to protect greater sage grouse, a bird species once found across much of the West that has suffered drastic declines in recent decades due to oil and gas drilling, grazing, wildfires and other pressures. The announcement of a range-wide evaluation of habitat plans for greater sage grouse came after the Trump administration tried to scale back conservation efforts adopted when Biden was vice president in 2015. A federal court blocked Trump’s changes. But Biden administration officials said the attempt set back conservation efforts – even as the chicken-sized bird’s habitat was further ravaged by wildfires, invasive plants and continued development. U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said he believed Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning – a former aide to the lawmaker – would pursue a collaborative, balanced approach that will keep sage grouse from becoming an endangered species. But Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines criticized the action, saying states should be given deference to manage wildlife and federal lands kept open for energy exploration and grazing. Daines said state and local conservation efforts needs to be protected from “federal overreach,” while Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for Gianforte, said Montana already has a plan that balances conservation and rural economies.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s unemployment rate fell to a mere 1.9% last month – the lowest any state has reached since data collection began in 1976, according to labor statistics released Friday. The October rate reported by Nebraska’s labor department and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics marked the first time any state’s unemployment rate dropped below 2%. Spokespeople for both agencies confirmed that Nebraska’s rate is the country’s lowest on record. Nebraska has maintained its status as the state with the lowest rate through much of the pandemic. Its 1.9% rate for October was down slightly from the September rate of 2%. Nebraska Labor Commissioner John Albin said total nonfarm employment has risen by more than 30,000 from October of last year. The state reported 1,031,001 filled jobs in October, which was 10,718 more than the previous month. Nebraska has struggled with a chronic worker shortage since even before the pandemic, and it has driven up wages and made it difficult for employers to hire and expand. Earlier this month, the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry released a survey of its members in which 92% said finding skilled workers was a top priority.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A big southern Nevada sewage pumping facility failed last year, spewing an estimated 500,000 gallons of wastewater and leaking into a creek that leads toward the Lake Mead reservoir on the Colorado River, a television station investigation found. Officials want to spend $40 million to rehabilitate the Clark County Water Reclamation District wastewater lift station, where the January 2020 spill was blamed on a corroded underground pipe, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reports. Most of the spilled sewage was vacuumed up from land outside the Whitney Lift Station, KLAS-TV reports, citing documents, photos and emails obtained with a public records request. But an estimated 10,000 gallons – about enough water to fill an average kidney-shaped backyard swimming pool – went into a nearby creek that feeds the Las Vegas Wash. The wash flows to Lake Mead, the drought-stricken reservoir that provides about 90% of the Las Vegas-area drinking water supply. The Whitney Lift Station is one of 24 similar facilities operated by the reclamation district, which was formed in 1956 to reclaim wastewater from unincorporated Clark County, the largest jurisdiction in the Las Vegas area. The district treats nearly 106 million gallons of wastewater per day, according to its website.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers accepted $22.5 million in federal COVID-19 vaccine funding Friday that has sparked intense debate and angry protests for the past two months. The Joint Fiscal Committee had tabled a request from the Department of Health and Human Service in September to spend the money to hire new workers to promote the vaccines and help providers comply with the state’s new vaccine registry system. Meanwhile, the Executive Council, which approves state contracts, initially rejected the money before reversing course earlier this month. On Friday, three Republicans joined the committee’s three Democrats in voting to accept the money. Four Republicans voted no, with some citing concerns that language in the grant would require the state to follow future federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. “The action we take today will be historic,” said Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren. “It will be historic because we will either reject the notion of subservience to government coercion, or it will be historic because we accede to that notion and violate the most fundamental premises of freedom upon which our state and nation were founded and which are imperiled as never before in our nation’s history.” Giuda predicted the vote would become a campaign issue next year. At least one audience member agreed, shouting at Sen. Chuck Morse, R-Salem: “Treason! You will never get elected again, Morse! You’re done!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The decades­long odyssey to find the remains of Jimmy Hoffa, a tenacious leader of the Teamsters union, apparently has turned to land next to a former landfill that sits below an elevated highway in the Garden State. The FBI obtained a search warrant to “conduct a site survey underneath the Pulaski Skyway” last month, said Mara Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Detroit field office. She didn’t indicate whether anything was removed. The FBI’s disclosure is another turn in a mystery that has gripped law enforcement for more than 45 years. Hoffa was last seen July 30, 1975, when he was to meet with reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano at a restaurant in suburban Detroit. The focus now is in Jersey City, below a four-lane bridge where the sound of cars and trucks doesn’t stop. Wild overgrown brush thrives in the gritty industrial area, and green dumpsters abound. No one nearby at Interstate Waste Services offered a comment. “I’ve been assured that the body hasn’t been dug up yet,” journalist Dan Moldea said, referring to the FBI’s work in October.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Internet problems continue to slow down many students in the state, but a pilot project using TV signals to transmit computer files may help. On Thursday, state public education officials distributed devices to eight families in Taos that allow schools to send them digital files via television. The boxes the size of a deck of cards allow digital television receivers to connect with computers using technology called datacasting. Many rural areas of New Mexico are too far from internet infrastructure such as fiber cables and cell towers but do get TV reception. In October, local broadcasting affiliates of New Mexico PBS finished testing the technology to make sure they could set aside bandwidth not taken up by TV show broadcasts and dedicate it to broadcast downloadable digital files. The pilot program in Taos relies on a broadcast from northern New Mexico PBS affiliate KNME, while two others are planning to roll out pilot programs in the cities of Silver City and Portales. Remote learning during the pandemic highlighted the digital divide for New Mexico students, many of whom had to learn using paper packets while their peers could participate in virtual lessons via video chat.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The New York Assembly’s investigation into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s conduct in office concluded the Democrat’s administration misrepresented how many nursing home residents died of COVID-19, according to a lawmaker who reviewed the committee’s still-secret report. Assembly Member Phil Steck was among the Assembly Judiciary Committee members who were able to review a copy of the approximately 45-page report Thursday and Friday in advance of its public release, possibly as soon as this week. The report, compiled by the New York City law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, covers a wide array of allegations of misconduct by Cuomo, including sexual harassment claims and the participation of his staff in writing his book on the coronavirus pandemic. Other topics include the Cuomo administration’s manipulation of data on COVID-19 deaths as presented to the public. Gaps in the state’s statistical accounting of fatalities include the administration’s decision to exclude from its nursing home death totals thousands of patients who died after being transferred to hospitals. The Davis Polk investigators confirmed press reports that the state Department of Health wanted to include those hospital deaths in the state’s nursing home fatality count.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A bear cub wandering around a neighborhood with a jug stuck on its head is running free in the forest again thanks to wildlife biologists and some observant residents. Wildlife biologists with the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission spent two days searching for the bear cub, according to a news release. The commission said the bear likely got stuck while going through some trash and was wandering around an Asheville neighborhood. District Biologist Justin McVey got the initial report about the bear Monday night. Commission officials reached out to the public to help identify its location. McVey said a combination of responses to a message posted to NextDoor by the commission and direct calls to biologists, local residents led personnel directly to the bear cub. The bear was anesthetized before the jug was taken off its head. Biologists performed a health check before relocating it to a remote area in western North Carolina.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library has agreed to take a controversial equestrian statue of the 26th president that has stood on the steps of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City since 1940. The bronze statue, designed by James Earle Fraser, was commissioned by the Board of Trustees of the New York State Roosevelt Memorial in 1929. The library opening next year in Medora will be getting it as a long-term loan. The statue, which depicts the former president on horseback with a Native American man and an African man flanking the horse, has been the subject of years of criticism that it symbolizes colonial subjugation and racial discrimination. Objections grew more forceful after the death of George Floyd sparked a racial reckoning and a wave of protests across the U.S. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to remove the statue in 2020, calling it “problematic,” which drew an angry response from President Donald Trump, who tweeted: “Ridiculous, don’t do it!” With the support of members of the Roosevelt family, the North Dakota library will establish an advisory council composed of representatives of Indigenous and Black communities, historians, scholars and artists to “guide the recontextualization” of the statue.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law a map of new congressional districts Saturday that will be in effect for the next four years, despite objections from Democrats and voting rights groups. DeWine said in a statement that, compared with other proposals from House and Senate lawmakers from both parties, the Senate legislation he signed “makes the most progress to produce a fair, compact, and competitive map.” The redistricting measure cleared the Legislature along party lines with House approval Thursday after a breakneck sprint through both chambers, amid praise from majority Republicans. Democrats blasted the Republican-led mapmaking process as unfair, partisan and cloaked in secrecy. The Senate approved the bill Tuesday, only about 16 hours after the new map was released. The nonpartisan Princeton Gerrymandering Project gave the map an F grade. The new law creates at most three safe Democratic districts out of 15 new U.S. House seats in a state where voters are split roughly 54% Republican, 46% Democratic. Populous Cuyahoga and Hamilton counties – home to Cleveland and Cincinnati, respectively – are divided three ways each. Franklin County, home to Columbus, is divided two ways, and the western Cleveland suburbs in Lorain County are part of a district that stretches to the Indiana border, a nearly 3-hour drive.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s building code commission has undermined the efforts of its own committee tasked with reviewing energy conservation standards by shooting down proposed changes and completing a takeover of the committee itself. Last week’s actions leave green building in Oklahoma a dozen years behind, stuck in 2009, standing pat with current minimum standards, said Kelly Parker, chairman of the committee whose months of work was spurned. The committee started its work in May as part of a state-mandated code review every six years to update the state’s modified versions of various building codes. But committee members had not seen the commission’s recommendations on energy conservation until they were presented Tuesday. Commission Chairman Cary Williamson, Ardmore’s fire chief, wondered why and argued that the energy committee, effectively shut down in October, should have been allowed to do its job. Commissioner Kyle Lombardo, an architect with Rees Associates, complained that he was not given time to review the complex, technical recommendations, which will go to state lawmakers next year. The Oklahoma Uniform Building Code Commission further eroded efforts to make home construction in the state more environmentally friendly, Parker said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A man who was protesting outside the city’s federal courthouse when a federal law enforcement officer shot him in the face with a “less lethal” impact munition is suing in federal court. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the lawsuit filed by Donavan LaBella calls the unnamed officer’s actions “unprovoked, unjustifiable, and unlawful.” LaBella’s injury July 11, 2020, was captured on video and shared widely. The video depicts then-26-year-old LaBella holding a speaker over his head, pointed at the courthouse. Federal officers turn on a bright light, and then an officer fires a less lethal munition striking LaBella. Like other protesters who have tried suing federal law enforcement agencies over injuries at protests for racial justice, LaBella’s attorneys have struggled to identify the officers. The lawsuit names “John Does 1-10″ as unknown federal law enforcement officers, believed to be with the U.S. Marshals Service, present or responsible for shooting LaBella. Desiree LaBella, Donavan’s mother, said the people responsible for injuring her son need to be held accountable. “As much as we wish it didn’t have to come to this, he’s irreparably damaged,” she said. He now suffers from a debilitating, permanent frontal lobe brain injury that has negatively altered the course of (his) life,” the lawsuit says.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Frozen vials labeled “Smallpox” that were discovered in a freezer at a vaccine research facility in the state “contain no trace of virus known to cause smallpox,” federal health officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that testing showed the vials contain “vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine,” and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox. The CDC had said Monday that the vials “were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker” who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer. The CDC said no one was exposed to the contents. Mark O’Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County. It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. The CDC said it was “in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization” about the findings. Smallpox is a deadly, infectious disease that plagued the world for centuries and killed nearly a third of the people it infected. Victims suffered scorching fever and body aches, followed by spots and blisters that would leave survivors with pitted scars.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority is getting a $900,000 federal boost to develop plans for a high-capacity transit corridor to connect Central Falls to Warwick via Providence, according to the state’s congressional delegation. The corridor was one of five goals included in RIPTA’s Transit Master Plan for the next 20 years. The planning grant could enable RIPTA to complete the preliminary work needed to eventually bring a bus rapid transit or light rail project to the region. The $900,000 planning grant is made available through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity grant program, for capital investments in surface transportation that will have a significant impact on or directly benefit areas of persistent poverty. The state’s congressional delegation and RIPTA CEO Scott Avedisian have scheduled a news conference for Monday at the agency’s Chafee Transportation Center in Providence to discuss the study and its potential impacts.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSeneca: One of the most wanted fugitives in the United States apparently died about four months ago in a South Carolina home about 16 years after he was first wanted in San Diego for sexually assaulting children, investigators said. Frederick Cecil McLean, 70, died of natural causes in July, but his body wasn’t found until Nov. 6, when someone asked deputies to check on a neighbor who hadn’t been seen in a while, Oconee County Coroner Karl Addis said. McLean has been on the U.S. Marshal Service’s 15 Most Wanted list since 2006, a year after the San Diego Sheriff’s Department issued arrest warrants for sexual assaults on a child and determined he was a high risk to continue attacking girls. One girl was assaulted more than 100 times before she turned 13, marshals said in a statement. McLean had been living in South Carolina for 15 years, going by the name of James Fitzgerald, marshals said. “The discovery of Frederick McLean’s body marks an end to the manhunt, but the investigation continues,” U.S. Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis said. Investigators are now trying to determine if anyone helped McLean avoid being found by police. They have determined he used several other aliases and also lived in Anderson, South Carolina, and Poughkeepsie, New York.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMcIntosh: The work of two wildlife management agencies has resulted in the release of 28 endangered black-footed ferrets on the South Dakota side of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which straddles the Dakotas. The push behind the effort by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is twofold: to maintain control of black-tailed prairie dogs in an area of the reservation used primarily for grazing and to save from extinction the black-footed ferret, considered the most endangered mammal in the U.S. They are yellowish-buff in color and weigh 11/ 2 to 2 pounds. The forehead, muzzle and throat are white, and the feet are black. They have a black mask around the eyes that is well-defined in young ferrets. The ferrets were released Oct. 20 in prairie dog towns between McIntosh and Bullhead, said Michael Gutzmer, ecologist with New Century Environmental, the Nebraska company that provides biological services to the tribe, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Prairie dogs make up 90% of the black-footed ferrets’ diet. The ferrets live in prairie dog burrows, and each eats a prairie dog about every three days, said Seth Gutzmer, biologist on the Standing Rock project and Michael Gutzmer’s son. The ferrets were considered extinct in the wild in 1987.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Friends and associates of slain rapper Young Dolph handed out Thanksgiving turkeys at a neighborhood church Friday, two days after he was gunned down in broad daylight inside his favorite bakery. Known for acts of charity in his hometown, the hip-hop artist and label owner had helped organize the event at St. James Missionary Baptist Church and was going to participate before he was fatally shot Wednesday. Undaunted, members of his music label, Paper Route Empire, along with church volunteers and community activists, distributed dozens of turkeys, stuffing mix and cranberry sauce to people driving past the church. It was the type of event Young Dolph, who grew up in the Castalia neighborhood where the church is located, has been organizing for years, often without the reporters and cameras present Friday. Before the event, volunteers spoke quietly among themselves or sat in solemn reflection as his music played outside the church on the sunny afternoon. Label employee Bee Bee Jones, 38, helped hand out the food, honoring his friend of 30 years. “When I hear his music, I just break down,” Jones said. “The truth in all of it, and where he came from, that’s what really gets to me sometimes. This is what he would want us to do right here, still keep on giving. He came from nothing, but he wanted to make sure everybody got some.”\n\nTexas\n\nBig Spring: A pickup truck heading the wrong way on a West Texas highway slammed into a bus carrying members of a high school band, killing three people, officials said Friday. Two students from the bus were critically injured in the late Friday afternoon crash on Interstate 20 in Big Spring, about 250 miles west of Fort Worth, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The bus from Andrews High School was headed to a football game with 25 students aboard when it was hit by the wrong-way truck, which burst into flames, killing the truck’s driver, said DPS Sgt. Justin Baker. One of the adults from the bus was also pronounced dead at the scene, he said. A third adult and two students were airlifted to University Medical Center in Lubbock, 95 miles north of the crash site. The adult died at the hospital, and the two students were listed in critical but stable condition, Baker said. Other students were taken to the Scenic Mountain Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries, he said. The football playoff game between Andrews and Springtown in Sweetwater was postponed.\n\nUtah\n\nBeaver County: Climate change has been making droughts more frequent and intense and limiting Utah farmers’ ability to grow crops. In the past two years, a growing number of farmers have signed up for a state program that helps fund projects to increase their water use efficiency, KUER-FM reports. Among them is Trent Brown, a longtime rancher and farmer in Beaver County who’s also the county assessor, since farming doesn’t pay all the bills. It’s a family tradition: His father and grandfather were ranchers and farmers and worked government jobs, too. Brown finished the switch from growing alfalfa to grass five years ago to save water, but it wasn’t enough to overcome this summer’s drought. Earlier this year, he used a grant from the state’s Water Optimization Program to replace the cement in a ditch that brings water from the nearby Manderfield Reservoir to him and other farmers in the valley. “The concrete ditch was put in in the ’60s, and it was just falling apart, failing,” he said. “We were losing a lot of water. We figure probably 20%.” Utah established the Water Optimization Program in 2020. It got $3 million in state funding that year and another $3 million in 2021. During the latest round, the program got 81 applications totaling $10.6 million – more than triple the money available to spend, according to the program’s director, Jay Olsen.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Captain Snowpants; Yo Bro, No Snow; Plow-A-Tron 6,000; and Jennifer Snowpez are among the names that will be on some of the state’s snowplows this winter. Vermont school students participated in the state transportation department’s Name a Plow contest to come up with names for the plows serving their communities. The entries ranged from “creative and clever to cute and silly,” the agency said. Participating schools got a visit from their newly named plows last week. One child was so upset she had missed the visit from the snowplow named Super Snow Storm that the driver and plow will visit again, said Amy Tatko, spokesperson for the Vermont Agency of Transportation. The full list of the Vermont names – including Snowbegone Kenobe, Plowy McPlowFace, Brr-rito and Steve – can be found on the transportation department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order Thursday aimed at improving how the state receives and evaluates input from tribal nations when making decisions about permits related to environmental, historical or cultural resources. The order directs four agencies to draft their own policies within 90 days for working with tribal nations before a permit is approved or denied. The Northam administration said this would help Virginia identify and understand concerns from tribal nations before finalizing permits, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The directive applies to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Historic Resources, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Northam’s executive order also directs the secretary of the commonwealth to appoint an ombudsman who can work with both state agencies and tribal nations. Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin will take office a month before Northam’s deadline and could potentially cancel the executive order. The Youngkin transition team didn’t immediately respond to the Times-Dispatch’s requests for comment.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: As lawmakers prepare for a new legislative session to craft and pass a supplemental budget, they’ll have more money to work with thanks to a steady increase of state revenues over the past year. Updated numbers by the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council released Friday show that projected revenue collections for the 2021-2023 budget cycle are $898 million above what had been originally forecasted in September. And projections for the next two-year budget cycle that ends in mid-2025 increased by more than $965 million. Revenues for the current budget cycle that ends mid-2023 are now projected to be $60.2 billion. And projected revenues for the next two-year budget cycle that starts July 1, 2023, are projected to be about $64 billion. Steve Lerch, the chief economist and executive director of the council, said compared to the first forecast this year in March, overall revenues increased $3.6 billion for the current biennium and $4.1 billion for the next. Republican legislative members of the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council said in response to the strong growth, tax cuts should be part of any final plan. Democratic budget writers said nothing is off the table but expressed caution.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBramwell: A 128-year-old church collapsed suddenly in the middle of the night Thursday, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Bramwell’s historic Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, which has stood since 1893, caved in about midnight, Mayor Louise Stoker told the paper. The church’s original congregation included many of the town’s first residents, Stoker said. The Independent Bible Church later occupied the building before donating it to the town, which had been planning to conserve the historic structure. “I’ve been in dialogue with a preservation contractor,” Stoker said. “This week, in fact, we had sent him photos.” Workers clearing the debris noted things that could be saved such as large wooden beams and the old church bell. Some of the church’s Queen Anne-style stained glass windows were also mostly intact. Stoker said the town council will discuss what to do next, but it’s possible that a portion of the building that didn’t collapse will have to be taken down. Standing outside the church Friday, she pointed out six circular stained glass windows in the remaining structure. “Not one of them has a broken piece,” she remarked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: As the state kicked off its 170th deer gun season Saturday, some hunters were feeling ill-equipped for the second straight year. A nationwide ammunition shortage due to the supply chain issues affecting other products has left hunters searching far and wide for ammo in the first place and then shelling out more money if they do find it. Randy and Tiffani Rogness, who own Paddock Lake Sporting Goods in Salem, had empty ammunition shelves Friday. When a new supply is delivered, it lasts two to three hours, even with a one-box limit per customer, they said. “We search everywhere. We’ve ordered so much, and it’s just not coming in,” Tiffani Rogness said. One of the nation’s biggest ammunition manufacturers, Vista Outdoor in Anoka, Minnesota, said it’s “ramping production ahead of schedule at its Remington facility to meet unprecedented demand.” The price of almost any caliber ammunition is double what it was a year ago. Manufacturers say the pandemic created new gun buyers, along with more hunters looking for something to do outside, WISN-TV reports. More than 570,000 deer hunters from around the world are expected to try their luck in this year’s nine-day season, Department of Natural Resources officials said. Wisconsin has more than 7 million acres of land open for hunting.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: For the past four months, people have been protesting the presence of sexual education and LGBTQ books in the children’s and teen sections of the Campbell County Public Library. The movement, part of a national trend, is being led by the Wyoming chapter of MassResistance, a national group headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, that prides itself on “pro-family activism.” The local chapter was formed in July. Since then, the group has worked to get its message out to the community that the library is actively corrupting the youth with its books, the Gillette News Record reports. “It’s been hard on the library staff,” said library director Terri Lesley. “It’s been a long time, and I’m very proud of them for how well they’re doing, how well they’re holding up. It’s not easy to be in the middle of a big controversy.” MassResistance’s goal is to protect “the traditional family, school children, and the moral foundation of society.” It believes in marriage between a man and a woman and that people are not born homosexual. Library board member Charlie Anderson said he’s been called names, and Lesley said she and some of her staff have received angry emails and letters, some from out of state. Lesley said she’s also received a lot of support, which has helped balance out the calls for her resignation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/17/peacock-problems-avocado-threat-weedy-sea-dragons-news-around-states/111330104/", "title": "Peacock problems, avocado threat: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A lawmaker fed up with her colleagues’ attempts to outlaw abortion has filed legislation to require all men over 50 to get vasectomies. Democratic Rep. Rolanda Hollis said Friday that she introduced the bill to send “the message that men should not be legislating what women do with their bodies.” Alabama lawmakers last year approved a ban on abortion unless the woman’s life was in danger. A federal judge blocked the law from taking effect while a legal challenge plays out in court. Hollis said doctors, not legislators, are the ones to be consulted about surgery, medications and making the “incredibly difficult decisions” related to personal reproductive rights. Her bill suggests the state require a man to get a vasectomy within one month of turning 50 or after the birth of his third child. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that forced sterilization is unconstitutional.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Volunteers slung bales of hay onto a table Thursday, where they were swiftly stuffed inside blue plastic bags, twirled and shut with twist ties before being dragged off to waiting pallets. Their efforts will help ensure the canine participants in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race have someplace warm and dry to bed down when their mushers stop along the 1,000-mile trail between Anchorage and Nome. The so-called straw drop is the first volunteer event of the Iditarod race, says Mark Nordman, the race director and marshal. More events follow this week, including people helping prepare shipments of food for both the dogs and the mushers to the checkpoints. The race over treacherous Alaska terrain – including two mountain ranges, the frozen Yukon River and the ice-covered Bering Sea – starts March 7 in Anchorage with the fan-friendly ceremonial start. The actual race begins the next day in Willow, about 50 miles north. The winner is expected in the old Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast, about 10 or 11 days later.\n\nArizona\n\nLake Havasu City: Officials plan to end scheduled closures of London Bridge for special events, saying they don’t want to block vehicle travel between an island and the rest of the western Arizona city along the Colorado River. City officials cited safety reasons and residents’ concerns about closures that typically have lasted two or three hours, Today’s News-Herald reports. Events that have required bridge closures include the annual Line Dance on the London Bridge; Camaros on the Bridge; and, infrequently, Corvettes on the Bridge. City Manager Jess Knudson says officials were grateful “for all the events that have been on the bridge in the past. But the city has decided to go a different direction now.” Lake Havasu City founder Robert McCulloch purchased the stone bridge in the late 1960s and had it transported by ship and truck from London in pieces.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court panel in Washington upheld a lower court’s decision Friday that blocked the Trump administration’s work requirements for Medicaid recipients. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found Arkansas’ work requirements for Medicaid recipients to be “arbitrary and capricious.” About 18,000 people in the state lost benefits because of the work requirements, but it wasn’t clear how many obtained coverage elsewhere. “In short, we agree with the district court that the alternative objectives of better health outcomes and beneficiary independence are not consistent with Medicaid,” the opinion said. “The text of the statute includes one primary purpose, which is providing health care coverage without any restriction geared to healthy outcomes, financial independence or transition to commercial coverage.” Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he’s hopeful the U.S. Supreme Court will review the case.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A Southern California aquarium has successfully bred the rare weedy sea dragon, the lesser-known cousin of the sea horse that resembles seaweed when floating. San Diego’s Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography said in a news release that two weedy sea dragons hatched last week, making the aquarium one of the few in the world to successfully breed the unusual fish. The babies with leafy appendages are less than an inch long and have eaten their first meal of tiny shrimp. The aquarium is keeping the delicate creatures out of public view for now. The hatchlings come less than a year after the aquarium at the University of California, San Diego built what is believed to be one of the world’s largest habitats for the sea dragons, whose native populations off Australia are threatened by pollution, warming oceans and the illegal pet and alternative medicine trades.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Research shows gun sales in the state have dropped for the third consecutive year, and experts suspect a correlation to which political party is leading the country. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation conducted 335,370 backgrounds checks in 2019, a 1.4% decrease compared to the year before, the Denver Post reports. The state does not track the number of firearms sold, so background checks performed ahead of gun sales are used to calculate totals instead, department officials say. Department data has shown about 98% of background checks were approved, and denials were due to assault or drug records by potential gun buyers. Data suggests sales tend to increase under Democratic presidents and decrease under Republican leadership, experts say. “When Obama was elected, sure enough gun sales went up,” says Eileen McCarron, president of Colorado Ceasefire Legislative Action, a group that advocates against gun violence. “But they didn’t just spike – they went up and stayed up.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials have announced drug overdose deaths increased by nearly 20% last year. Exactly 1,200 people died of some sort of drug overdose in the state in 2019, an increase mostly attributed to the continued rise in fentanyl use, the Hartford Courant reports. “Fentanyl is still increasing,” Chief State Medical Examiner Robert Gill said. “If we had a magic wand and could make all the fentanyl disappear, there is no doubt that we would see a considerable decline in accidental drug intoxication deaths in Connecticut.” The number of overdose deaths had dropped for the first time in 2018 to 1,017, Gill said. Last year marked the first time the state reached the 1,200 death milestone. A spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont said that state agencies must continue to work together and that perhaps federal funding is needed.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a state prison inmate who complained about running out of toilet paper. The judge ruled Thursday that the lawsuit by Isaac Pierce was frivolous. The ruling contains references to several other court decisions regarding toilet paper, or the lack of it, in prisons. Those rulings generally concluded that, while a temporary lack of toilet paper might be unpleasant, it does not violate an inmate’s rights or, in the words of one court, does not present a question of “constitutional magnitude.” The lawsuit was filed last year by Pierce and two cellmates, who were subsequently dismissed from the case. They alleged they were forced to use newspapers after they were denied more toilet paper for two and a half days in August 2019.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A couple’s new cannabis delivery service took some getting creative to keep it legal, WUSA-TV reports. District Derp co-owner Chris says because pot can be gifted but not sold in the district, he and his partner consulted a team of legal experts to make sure the business – which primarily sells their dog’s original artwork, combined with a cannabis gift – always operated above board. “When it came to navigating the law, our legal team just kind of advised us, do what you do best,” Chris said. “Make your art, sell your art, and provide the great cannabis experience that you can on the side.” Now, their business model is equal parts of sausage meat and patience. “Sudo is a very food-driven dog,” Chris says of the artist. Sudo is an Alaskan Klee Kai, a breed known for its smarts. District Derp co-owner Anais says it took about a month to unleash Sudo’s artistic skills.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A pack of peacocks that has wreaked havoc on a neighborhood will be relocated after city commissioners voted Thursday night to side with residents and agreed to have the birds taken away. It was a big win for many residents who have complained that the birds have taken control of a Coconut Grove neighborhood, mating into the night, pooping in large piles, and scratching cars as they travel in packs of 20 to 40 or more, the Miami Herald reports. Andrews Candela told commissioners before Thursday night’s vote that he once felt lucky to live in North Grove, but the massive infestation of peacocks has ruined the quality of life for him and his wife. “I don’t want to remain forgotten in a filthy, dirty peacock land as hostage to a group of birds,” Candela said. “I think that is more than unfair.” Commissioners unanimously agreed to amend the city’s charter to allow for trapping and removal of excess peacocks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Election officials have loaded and shipped the last truckloads of new voting machines making their statewide debut in the March presidential primaries, getting the equipment to local election offices Friday barely two weeks before advance voting begins. Distributing 30,000 machines among 159 Georgia counties ahead of the primaries posed a big challenge for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. A federal judge last August ordered Georgia to retire its outdated, paperless system before any votes were cast in 2020, citing security concerns. Raffensperger’s office had just awarded a $103 million contract for the new machines when the judge ruled, increasing pressure to meet an already tight rollout schedule. Georgia will hold its presidential primaries March 24. But advance, in-person voting begins March 2.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An invasive bug was discovered feeding on avocado leaves across the state and was most recently found on Maui plants in retail outlets, entomologists said. The avocado lace bug was first discovered in Pearl City, Oahu, in December and was subsequently identified on Hawaii Island and Maui, the state Department of Agriculture said. Department officials have not confirmed the presence of the bug on Kauai. The infested Maui plants located in retail outlets were destroyed or treated, department officials said. It is unclear how the bug was introduced in Hawaii. The lace bug feeds on the leaves of avocado plants, extracting nutrients and gradually destroying the plants, experts said. The bug does not feed on the fruit itself. The bug causes green to yellowish blotches on the leaves, and damaged leaves become dry and may curl, drop prematurely and cause reduction in fruit yields.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has been awarded a grant to study how elk herds move through a northern Idaho migration corridor also used by grizzly bears and wolverines. The grant, announced by the U.S. Department of the Interior on Friday, is part of $3.2 million in funding for big game rangeland studies in 11 western states. Idaho’s research will focus on the McArthur Lake area, which serves as a link between the Selkirk and Cabinet mountains used by grizzly bears, wolverine and elk. Scientists will put GPS collars on 40 elk to monitor their movements over two years and then combine that data with information from a grid of 119 trail cameras. The findings will be used to map seasonal ranges, movement routes and stopover areas, according to the Interior Department.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new sculpture honoring the 16th U.S. president is coming to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Museum officials announced plans last week for the “Beacon of Endurance” piece, designed by B.J. Krivanek. He described the sculpture in a statement as standing 24 feet, 10 inches tall. Renderings of the piece show an obelisk, with a base inscribed with quotes from Lincoln and a stainless-steel upper portion inscribed with words describing Lincoln. Members of an advisory panel will weigh in on which words to include, and the museum also plans to take ideas from the public through social media. Officials plan to place the sculpture outside the museum. Renderings show that the piece includes projections of key words onto the southeast corner of the building’s exterior at night.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A 60-day law license suspension is being recommended for the state’s attorney general after allegations that he grabbed the buttocks of a state legislator and inappropriately touched three other women during a party. The recommendation filed Friday with the state Supreme Court puts the Republican Curtis Hill’s ability to remain as state government’s top lawyer in jeopardy, as he must have a law license to hold the position. It wasn’t immediately clear how a temporary suspension would affect his status. Former state Supreme Court Justice Myra Selby proposed the punishment in a report to the court, which will make the final decision in the professional misconduct case. Selby said his law license should not be automatically reinstated following the suspension. In her 36-page report, Selby wrote that Hill committed battery, and she “finds and concludes by clear and convincing evidence” that he violated rules of professional conduct.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state court judge on Friday heard arguments on whether to dismiss a lawsuit challenging an Iowa law passed last year that would block Planned Parenthood of the Heartland from receiving federal grant money for sex education courses. Judge Paul Scott is considering whether to throw out the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa for Planned Parenthood. It challenges the law passed as a violation of free speech, due process and equal protection rights. Last May, Judge Joseph Seidlin temporarily halted enforcement of the law until the court could decide whether it’s constitutional. He concluded that Planned Parenthood is likely to succeed in its equal protection claim and that it has demonstrated significant harm through loss of funding.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A significant drop in methamphetamine prices led to a nearly a 20% decline in burglary in the city last year, according to a police official. Thanks to the low price of meth, the theft of guns and other items from inside vehicles also was down from 2018 to 2019, Wichita Police Department Deputy Chief Jose Salcido told a Criminal Justice Coordinating Council meeting. Meth now sells for $2,400 per pound, which is the lowest price in 20 years, Salcido said. “The market is saturated. There’s no incentive for criminals to go steal to finance their habits like in the past,” Salcido said. The latest available state data shows that the street value of meth is at $3,500 to $5,000 per pound, according to a 2018 Kansas Bureau of Investigation report. An ounce costs between $250 and $500. In 2014, meth prices were about three times as much at $13,000 to $15,000 for a pound and $800 to $1,200 for an ounce. In 2019, the city reported 255 stolen guns from vehicles, a 17.5% drop from the year prior. Theft of items from inside a car fell by 19% from 2018 to 2019.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Medical marijuana is getting a serious look in the Legislature. In another sign of momentum for the push to legalize cannabis for treatment of some medical conditions, House Speaker David Osborne said the bill could come up for a House vote as soon as this week. The measure cleared the House Judiciary Committee on a 17-1 vote Wednesday. One of its lead sponsors, Republican Rep. Jason Nemes, has predicted it would pass the House by a wide margin. House Republicans will discuss the measure internally to gauge support and develop a plan for it when the GOP-led Legislature reconvenes Tuesday, Osborne told reporters. The speaker praised the bill’s supporters for crafting a version that has drawn a lot of support. Supporters point to strong grassroots support for the legal use of medical cannabis for people battling chronic pain and certain debilitating medical conditions.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Fire trucks traditionally bring up the rear of the city’s Mardi Gras parades – but not this year. As Carnival season kicks into high gear, the first of the major parades, with marching bands and floats carrying masked riders, rolled Friday evening. Parades are scheduled almost daily through Mardi Gras – or Fat Tuesday – which falls on Feb. 25 this year. Fire trucks traditionally roll behind each parade in the city, signalling a procession’s end. But Mayor LaToya Cantrell and fire chief Tim McConnell confirmed at a news conference on Mardi Gras safety issues that the practice is being abandoned. Fire crews will still do safety inspections on floats before parades but will then return to their stations. McConnell said the change will mean more trucks are available when needed anywhere in the city. He and Cantrell said the move was not prompted by an ongoing labor dispute involving firefighters.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: Dozens of residents told the state they’re opposed to the building of a large salmon farm in this coastal city. The proposal from Norwegian-owned Nordic Aquafarms would create a $500 million salmon farm that uses land-based facilities to grow the fish for human consumption. Many Maine residents told the Maine Board of Environmental Protection during a Tuesday night hearing that they think the project is a bad fit for the community, the Bangor Daily News reports. The environmental protection board is visiting Belfast to review environmental permit applications that are needed for the project. Residents at the hearing raised concerns including that the environmental impact of the project would be too much for the community. Others said it was simply too large for Belfast. Nordic has characterized the project as a sustainable way to create jobs and meet demand for healthy seafood.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: School construction funding would increase by $2.2 billion over five years under a measure approved by the House of Delegates on Friday. The House approved the measure, called the Built to Learn Act, on a bipartisan 128-6 vote, and it now goes to the Senate, whose leaders support it. Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, also has expressed support. “I think it’s telling how important this bill is on both sides of the aisle,” said House Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Baltimore County Democrat. The measure enables the Maryland Stadium Authority to issue up to $2.2 billion in revenue bonds. The money would be on top of about $400 million the state spends each year to build and repair schools. The debt on the bonds would be paid by $125 million annually over 30 years from casino revenue that goes to the state for education.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A traveling exhibit marking the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage is heading to the city. The exhibit presented by the American Bar Association will be on display at the John Joseph Moakley Law Library from Monday through Feb. 28. It’s titled “100 Years After the 19th Amendment: Their Legacy, and Our Future.” The exhibit was curated by the Library of Congress and includes photos and artifacts about the movement to give women the right to vote. Women’s right to vote was secured by the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.\n\nMichigan\n\nBattle Creek: Officials at Binder Park Zoo are hoping its male snow leopard hooks up with a female snow leopard he was paired with through a breeding program that aims to give the threatened species a boost. The zoo recently introduced Victoria, a 2-year-old snow leopard who arrived in August from Omaha, Nebraska’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, with Raj, who’s been at the Binder Park Zoo since 2012. Until Victoria arrived, the 7-year-old Raj was the lone snow leopard in Battle Creek. Zoo officials are hoping the pair will mate and produce a litter of cubs. The big cats were matched through a Species Survival Program breeding recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquarium to make sure they were genetically compatible. “They do have a ‘dating profile,’ so to speak, but it’s driven by science rather than romance,” says Leslie Walsh, manager of marketing and development for Binder Park Zoo.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz and LGBTQ activists rallied at the Capitol on Friday to demand that the Republican-controlled state Senate pass a ban on “conversion therapy” for minors, a discredited practice that seeks to turn gay people straight. The proposal passed the Democratic-controlled House last year, but an effort to amend it onto a larger bill on the Senate floor by Sen. Scott Dibble failed late in the session. The Minneapolis Democrat, who is openly gay, said he plans to reintroduce it this year, though he acknowledged in an interview that enacting it will be an uphill fight. But he has an ally in the Democratic governor. Walz pointed out to a crowd of about 100 people in the Capitol rotunda that 19 other states have enacted conversion therapy bans. “The idea that this absolutely discredited, Byzantine, torturous way of telling our children they are not who they are has got to end and will end,” Walz said. The American Psychological Association says conversion therapy is not based in science and is harmful to mental health.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A legendary rodeo clown who spent decades performing has died after the final performance of the 55th Annual Dixie National Rodeo and Livestock Show. Lecile Harris, 83, died in his sleep after the show Wednesday night in Jackson, according to a release from the Mississippi Fair Commission. Born in Lake Cormorant, Mississippi, Harris gained popularity after starring in the television show “Hee Haw,” as well as roles in other TV shows and movies. He was inducted into the Mississippi Rodeo Hall of Fame and the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame and won the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association award for Clown of the Year five times. “All of us involved at the Dixie National are truly saddened,” Mississippi Fair Commission executive director Steve Hutton said in the news release. “We all send our love and wishes to Lecile’s family, friends, and adoring fans around the world.”\n\nMissouri\n\nCape Girardeau: A southeast Missouri peach grower was awarded $15 million in actual damages Friday in his lawsuit alleging the weedkiller dicamba severely damaged his orchards. Bill Bader, of Campbell, sued Bayer and BASF, alleging they were responsible for damage at Bader Farms, one of the largest peach farms in the state, which his attorneys argued would likely not survive repeated exposure to dicamba. Bader’s lawsuit is one of several filed against Bayer and BASF that blame the pesticide for damaging millions of acres of crops across the country. Farmers have been using dicamba for more than 50 years, but complaints increased after Monsanto – which was bought by Bader in 2018 – released dicamba-tolerant cotton and soybeans, leading to increased use of dicamba-based herbicides and more complaints about the chemical drifting onto farms that did not have resistant crops.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Hunting regulations on wolf and elk near Yellowstone National Park have increased, wildlife officials say. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission tightened wolf hunting rules and reduced elk-hunting seasons, the Missoulian reports. The commission discussed proposals and allowed public comment on the regulations Thursday during its daylong meeting in Helena. Regulations included reducing wolf hunting quotas to one per person in each district near Yellowstone National Park and shortening elk shouldering seasons by a month in some districts in central Montana, commission officials said. Some public commenters have argued that wolf quotas should be one or none because the animals are crucial to the ecosystem, while opponents suggested increasing the quota to two. The commission also adopted elk shoulder seasons for several hunting districts covering west-central Montana, agency officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Researchers at the Center for Great Plains Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln this week will discuss in a lecture the new research on black homesteaders in the Great Plains. The Paul A. Olson Great Plains Lecture is scheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday at the center in Lincoln. Although few in comparison to the multitudes of white settlers, black people also carved out lives for themselves on homesteads. About 70% of them settled in clusters or “colonies,” the center said in a new release, including one in DeWitty, Nebraska. The free public talk is part of a lecture series from the Center for Great Plains Studies on various Great Plains topics. More information is available online.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Workers have completed the first of two underground tunnels for a system to whisk passengers between exhibit halls at an expanded Las Vegas Convention Center, tourism and project officials said Friday. It took about three months, and officials say the drilling machine now will be disassembled, repositioned, reassembled and restarted for the second tunnel. The $52.5 million people-mover is being built by billionaire Elon Musk’s company The Boring Co. It is expected to be completed by the end of the year and is designed to offer conventioneers an approximately one-minute trip in self-driving electric vehicles between three exhibit hall and parking stations. The system is being called key to an ongoing, $1.5 billion convention center expansion and renovation that includes adding a three-story, 1.4 million-square-foot building across the street from the existing single-story convention center.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Cats are closer to achieving equal footing with dogs in the state, at least when it comes to their untimely demise. House lawmakers on Thursday approved a bill that would require anyone who hits a cat with a vehicle to notify police or the animal’s owner as soon as possible. Such notification already is required when it comes to canine collisions. The bill now goes to the Senate, but three other bills related to killing animals won’t live on. The House voted against a measure that would have repealed a prohibition on hunting with ferrets, another that would have created a safari hunting license for those taking elk and boar at a private game reserve, and a third that would have lowered the bar for killing animals that damage crops or other property. Current law allows someone to kill wild animals that cause “actual and substantial” damage. The failed bill would have removed the “and substantial” language.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMorris County: A bowhunting organization says a 700-pound bear shot in the state last fall has set a world record as the largest black bear killed with a bow and arrow in North America. The Pope and Young Club, a bowhunting and conservation organization, said the bear killed Oct. in Morris County toppled a record set in 1993 by a hunter in California. “It has been an inspiring journey, to say the least,” hunter Jeff Melillo said in a statement quoted by the organization. “New Jersey, my home state, has its first-ever world record animal!” Club records director Eli Randall said the animal’s skull measured over 23 inches and had a bone structure that he called “the heaviest I had ever seen.” Melillo recalled an Outdoor Life article suggesting that that a world record black bear would likely come from New Jersey one day. The state’s black bear hunt has generated controversy in recent years, with Gov. Phil Murphy vowing during his campaign to seek an end to it and in 2018 instituting a ban on hunting bears on state lands. The New Jersey Sierra Club is still seeking a complete ban.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State lawmakers are considering setting aside $20 million that could be used as seed money as water managers, municipalities and farmers scramble to find ways to reduce groundwater pumping that is at the center of a high-stakes legal battle. The fight over the Rio Grande has pitted Texas against New Mexico as demands increase and drought persists. It will be up to a special master appointed by the U.S. Supreme Court to eventually decide how New Mexico goes about ensuring enough of the Rio Grande flows south to users in Texas and Mexico. Right now, the system is out of balance, and Texas is arguing that New Mexico should be forced to reduce its pumping by as much as 60%. That would be equivalent to more than half of the water supplied annually to residents in Albuquerque, the state’s largest city. Such a reduction would be disastrous for users in southern New Mexico, says John D’Antonio, New Mexico’s top water engineer.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is courting winter tourists with a fee-free weekend for out-of-state snowmobilers. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the plan Sunday at Saranac Lake. Fees will be waived March 14 and 15 for Canadian and other out-of-state visitors with registered, insured vehicles. New York State Snowmobile Association President Rosanne Warner says a lack of snow has made it tough to get the state’s more than 10,000 miles of trails ready this season. The state has committed $4.2 million in grants for trail maintenance and grooming, funded by snowmobile registration fees. Registration is $100 a year, or $45 with membership in a snowmobile club. Cuomo’s office says winter tourism generates nearly $14.4 billion in direct visitor spending.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state schools superintendent has been accused of using a database to send hundreds of thousands of text messages and emails for political gain. The Raleigh News & Observer reports multiple ethics complaints have been filed against State Schools Superintendent Mark Johnson. Johnson sent 540,000 text messages and 800,000 email messages that he accessed from a state database to voice his opposition to the “Common Core” educational standards. Johnson’s opposition to the standards is a major part of his campaign for lieutenant governor. The complaints allege that the messages were designed for Johnson’s personal gain and were issued at the start of early voting before next month’s primary. Johnson is in a crowded field of Republicans running for lieutenant governor.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials say passenger boardings at the state’s eight commercial service airports during January were up nearly 12% over the same month in 2019. Nearly 100,300 people boarded planes in Bismarck, Devils Lake, Dickinson, Fargo, Grand Forks, Jamestown, Minot and Williston during the month, according to the state Aeronautics Commission. All airports saw an increase in boardings except Grand Forks. Devils Lake had the largest increase at 28.8%, followed by Fargo at $17.9%. Dickinson had an increase of 13.5%, followed by Bismarck at 11.8%, Minot at 9% Williston at 5.4% and Jamestown at 3.9%.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine is backing legislation that makes distracted driving reason enough to pull someone over. The bipartisan bill in the Ohio Senate addresses writing, sending or looking at texts, watching or recording photos or videos, or livestreaming while handling an electronic device, among other activities. The legislation would make those a primary offense, meaning police don’t need another reason first – such as speeding – to pull drivers over. The bill would also increase fines for people who are caught regularly using electronic devices while driving. Exemptions include using a phone to place an emergency call or using hands-free functions to talk on the phone or dictate texts. DeWine said Thursday that it’s time for a cultural recognition that distracted driving is just as bad as driving while drunk. Traffic deaths on Ohio roads have increased in five of the past six years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More inmates have been released under a law that directs a state board to review sentences of those in prison for crimes that would not be considered felonies if charged today. The law, which took effect in November, gives the state Pardon and Parole Board authority to establish an accelerated, single stage docket to review sentences, The Oklahoman reports. Under Oklahoma’s expedited commutation docket, 124 inmates, 83 men and 41 women, were released Thursday. Elizabeth Bijelic, 28, is one of those inmates. She was reunited with her 2-month-old daughter, to whom she said she gave birth while serving a three-year sentence for drug possession. “It’s amazing,” Bijelic said. “I didn’t expect it to happen so soon. I’m very blessed to be out. I’m not saying I didn’t need to be sat down for a minute, but it was excessive.” More than 450 inmates were released in November.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Concordia University students walked out of their classes Thursday in protest of the Board of Regents’ recent decision to close the 115-year-old institution this year. The private Lutheran university’s board voted last Friday to cease operations and sell Concordia’s 24-acre campus in Northeast Portland. Concordia enrolls about 5,700 students, but sources estimate only about 1,200 of them attend classes on campus. Most of the students study remotely through Concordia’s online classes. Students spoke on campus Thursday morning outside the president’s residence holding signs asking “Where did my money go?” “Almost graduated” and “CU in court,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. In a poster calling for the walkout, students outlined a list of demands targeted at the Board of Regents: clear financial records, questions answered regarding the sudden closure, and a support plan for students, staff, faculty and the surrounding community.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A funeral director has been suspended indefinitely after four decomposing bodies were found at his funeral home. Andrew Scheid agreed to the indefinite license suspension before a scheduled appearance Friday before the State Board of Funeral Directors. The suspension means he won’t be able to direct or supervise funerals at his locations in Lancaster and in Manor Township, outside Millersville. At the request of Lancaster County prosecutors, the coroner’s office went to Scheid’s Manor Township location last month and found the decomposing remains in a preparation area, according to WHTM. None of the bodies had been refrigerated or embalmed. One body had been there 17 days, while another was there for 12, according to a petition for suspension. No criminal charges have been filed.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state appears poised to raise its minimum wage. The House of Representatives passed legislation Thursday night to raise the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour by Oct. 1. The hourly rate is currently set at $10.50. The state Senate approved a bill last week to raise the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour on Oct. 1, and Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo has said she wants to raise the minimum wage. Rhode Island’s minimum wage has been $10.50 since Jan. 1, 2019, which is lower than the hourly rates in neighboring Massachusetts and Connecticut. Some Republicans voted against the bill, saying they were worried that the steadily rising wage threatens to hurt employers and could lead to job losses, The Providence Journal reports. Some Democrats supported the bill even though they had wanted a higher raise.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster is now the oldest person ever to hold that office in the Palmetto State. McMaster turned 72 years and 262 days old Thursday, one day older than James Byrnes when he left office in January 1955. “I’m glad to be living,” the Republican governor told The Post and Courier of Charleston after reaching the milestone. McMaster is only the third governor to serve into his 70s among South Carolina’s 117 chief executives dating back to 1670. And McMaster could serve a lot longer. He has given no indication he won’t run for reelection in 2022, and if he won, his term would end in January 2027, when he would be 79. Longevity runs in McMaster’s family. His father retired from his law firm at 99 after trying his final case at age 93. McMaster is still younger than President Donald Trump, who is 73. And he is only the nation’s fourth-oldest current governor.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Police say complaints against the city’s officers in 2019 were the lowest in nine years. Citizens filed 12 complaints last year compared to a high of 56 in 2015 and an average of 35 between 2011 and 2019, the Rapid City Journal reports. Last year also marked the debut of equipping officers with body cameras, allowing the department to use the footage to help investigate the complaints. The 12 complaints were the result of 142,186 calls for service and 8,243 arrests. “The high volume of work and the low number of complaints is a positive reflection of the quality of employees who serve you as well as the training they receive,” Police Chief Karl Jegeris wrote in the report. Jegeris said the department takes the complaints seriously, and when “we are wrong, we admit it, and we take measures to improve our ability to provide service to citizens.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $9 million on high-speed broadband internet projects in 10 rural Tennessee counties. USDA officials said in a statement Thursday that the broadband projects will create or improve high speed internet connectivity in more than 3,700 households and more than 70 businesses and farms. Projects are planned in Cumberland, Houston, Henry, Maury, Montgomery, Rutherford, Smith, Stewart, Williamson and Wilson counties. Rural areas around the country have been clamoring for more high-speed internet access for use in schools, libraries, homes and businesses such as farms. Funds come from the federal ReConnect Pilot Program, which provides loans and grants to help build broadband infrastructure in rural parts of the country.\n\nTexas\n\nFalfurrias: Authorities are searching for vandals who damaged a south Texas shrine to faith healer Don Pedrito Jaramillo. The damage to the shrine to Don Pedrito Jaramillo in Falfurrias, about 150 miles south of San Antonio, was reported Friday, according to Brooks County Sheriff Urbino “Benny” Martinez. “We’re really working hard on it because I think it’s really unfortunate that that would happen to Don Pedrito,” Martinez told the San Antonio Express-News. “It’s been there for years and years.” Jaramillo was known as “the healer of Los Olmos,” for using natural remedies to heal the sick. He came to the Los Olmos Ranch near Falfurrias in the early 1880s and died in 1907. The shrine began at his burial site and received a Texas Historical Marker in 1971. Falfurrias City Administrator Melissa Landin said damage to crosses and statues of Jaramillo may be irreparable.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Authorities are investigating an attack on a black missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a possible hate crime. Two men were arrested Thursday on suspicion of assault, and charging documents show a hate crime designation is under consideration. The NAACP expressed outrage about what allegedly happened, and church officials said they are concerned about the incident. The victim and his missionary companion were preparing to go to a house of people they were going to teach Jan. 28 in the central Utah city of Payson when they encountered six people wearing dark hoodies, charging documents show. The assailants shouted a racial slur at the victim, who is Panamian, and told him to get out of their “hood,” he told police. They threw his cellphone on the ground, threatened his mother and called him a “church boy” before punching him in the head and face and kicking him, the document shows.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Land Trust is giving a $5,000 award to a farmer who exemplifies land stewardship, giving back and entrepreneurial farming. The deadline for applications for the Eric Rozendaal Memorial Award is June 30, the Bennington Banner reports. Rozendaal, who died in 2018 at age 51, was a pioneer in the farm-to-plate movement in Vermont and one of the first to sell directly to restaurants, stores and hospitals, the Land Trust said. He also enhanced his farm’s soil, built relationships with customers and farm workers, and shared his knowledge with others, the group said. His family and friends raised money to create the award in his honor. The award will be given out each year through 2028. Corie Pierce of Bread & Butter Farm in Shelburne and South Burlington was the first recipient of the award last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials announced plans Friday to create new habitat for about 25,000 seabirds after their nesting grounds were paved for a state tunnel expansion project – a case that highlighted weakened protections for birds across the U.S. under President Donald Trump. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s office said the state was acting because of the Trump administration’s new interpretation of the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act that says accidental bird deaths are not enforceable under the century-old law. “Had this federal policy remained unchanged, it would have protected the birds on South Island from harm,” Northam’s office said in a statement. The announcement comes after the Virginia Department of Transportation earlier this month confirmed to The Virginian-Pilot the extent of the damage to the decades-old nesting site.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Senate on Friday passed a data privacy measure that would give consumers the right to manage how information held by private companies is used. The measure, called the Washington Privacy Act, passed on a bipartisan 46-1 vote and now heads to the House for consideration. It would require businesses or other entities that control or process the identifiable data of more than 100,000 people to allow consumers to find out what data is stored about them, correct errors or request deletion. It would also allow people the right to opt out of their data being used for the purposes of targeted advertising and to opt out of the sale of their personal data. The measure would also set rules for facial recognition technology for companies. The measure has been modeled on European rules and protections put in place in California.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Friday offered a conditional apology for calling a high school girls’ basketball team “thugs,” saying he didn’t know the remarks would cause any trouble. Justice has drawn criticism for using the term after a scuffle broke out at a heated Tuesday night game between Greenbrier East High School, where he coaches, and Woodrow Wilson High School. The team’s coaches are black, as are some of the players. His comments spread quickly on social media and at the Capitol, with one lawmaker, Del. Mike Pushkin, tweeting that the governor was making “thinly veiled racial slurs.” On Wednesday, the Republican governor defended himself, issuing a statement that said: “Anyone that would accuse me of making a racial slur is totally absurd.” Then on Friday, in an interview with local ABC affiliate WCHS-TV, Justice said he was sorry if he hurt any feelings, while noting others who’ve used the word.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Claims Board on Friday awarded $25,000 to a U.S. Navy veteran who spent 26 years behind bars for a homicide he didn’t commit. Derrick Sanders, now 48, argued he was wrongfully convicted in the fatal shooting of Jason Bowie in Milwaukee in 1992. Prosecutors dropped the charges against him in 2018 after a circuit judge threw out his conviction. “The Board concludes and finds that the evidence is clear and convincing that Sanders was innocent of the charge discussed herein,” the decision said. Sanders had asked the board for $5.7 million, but state law limits compensation for wrongful convictions to $25,000. Sanders’ current attorney, Rex Anderegg, didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Veterans and lawmakers including U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, of Kentucky, rallied in support of a bill in Wyoming that would restrict combat deployment of National Guard troops. The bill failed an initial vote, 35-22, falling far short of the two-thirds majority needed for introduction in the Wyoming House. Under the Defend the Guard Act, Wyoming troops and airmen could only be sent to combat with congressional authorization specifically granted by the Constitution, such as declaration of war. “We now have kids going to war who were born after 9/11. I don’t think one generation should bind another generation in war,” Paul told a small crowd Friday at the Wyoming Capitol. Opponents of such measures in other states have pointed out there’s already a potential check on combat deployments of National Guard troops – they must be approved by a governor. Lawmakers defeated the bill on introduction without debate later Friday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/17/deepening-droughts-saharan-dust-huge-forest-nest-news-around-states/117065366/", "title": "Deepening droughts, Saharan dust, huge forest nest: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Money from a legal settlement will be used to provide funding to add charging stations for electric vehicles at 18 sites in seven Alabama counties. The governor’s office says grants totaling $4.1 million will help fund installing of chargers at fueling stations near interstates and other major highways. The money will provide as much as 80% of the cost of installing stations at existing sites in Jefferson, Tuscaloosa, Calhoun, Cullman, DeKalb, Greene and St. Clair counties. Many of the chargers will be along Interstate 20 from the Georgia line to Tuscaloosa. The money is from a settlement involving Volkswagen and the Environmental Protection Agency over the automaker’s violation of the federal Clean Air Act. In a statement, Gov. Kay Ivey said the grants will help with state move toward electric vehicles. Auto plants located in the state already have started the transition toward vehicles powered by electricity, she said. “This program will have a range of positive impacts in Alabama from creating cleaner air to helping to sell more vehicles manufactured right here in Alabama,” said Kenneth Boswell, director of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, which will administer the grants.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House late Tuesday passed a state budget that would result in a $525 dividend to residents this year and leave in doubt funding for a number of programs and infrastructure projects after it failed to garner sufficient support on a key vote. House leaders left open the potential for continued talks or even possibly another vote as the special session neared its end. Special sessions can last up to 30 days. That limit would be reached Friday. “We’re gonna look for a resolution that we can all live with and be happy with, and the people of Alaska will be very grateful to us,” said House Speaker Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak. “My hope is that the talks don’t stop,” House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton told reporters after the floor session, adding later: “I would hope that we would come together and have serious conversations, where all voices are being heard.” Dividends typically have been paid using earnings from the state’s oil-wealth fund. But the budget agreement that advanced from a six-member conference committee Sunday cobbled together money for dividends of about $1,100 from various sources, including the constitutional budget reserve fund that requires three-fourths support in each the House and Senate to tap. That vote failed Tuesday night in the House. The last time the check was in the $500 range was in 1986.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday blocked a new Arizona State University policy that would have required unvaccinated students to submit to twice-weekly coronavirus testing and wear a mask, calling the decision “bad policy.” The Republican governor issued an executive order saying students at the state’s public universities and community colleges can’t be required to get a COVID-19 vaccine, submit vaccination documents, or be tested or forced to wear masks. ASU and the Board of Regents said they would comply with Ducey’s order. An ASU statement noted that it never issued a vaccine mandate but was following guidelines for universities from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by ensuring unvaccinated people continue to follow protocols like masking. Ducey’s order came after he criticized the policy in a series of tweets Monday night. He said that the rules for students attending class in person this fall have “no basis in public health” and that even the Biden administration has been more reasonable. But the governor also included a screenshot of a quote from the CDC’s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, that appeared to contradict his own position. “It is the people who are not fully vaccinated in those settings, who might not be wearing a mask, who are not protected,” Walensky is quoted as saying.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday asked a federal judge to prevent the state from enforcing its ban on gender-confirming treatments for transgender youth while a lawsuit challenging the prohibition proceeds. The ACLU requested a preliminary injunction against the new law, which is set to take effect July 28. It will prohibit doctors from providing gender-confirming hormone treatment, puberty blockers or surgery to anyone under 18 years old or from referring them to other providers for the treatment. The ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the ban last month on behalf of four transgender youth and their families, as well as two doctors who provide the treatments. The ban is forcing some families of transgender youth to move out of state to continue their children’s treatments, if they can afford to do so, the filing contends. “The threat of harm to plaintiffs is concrete, imminent, and devastating, and far outweighs any conceivable cost to the state of maintaining the status quo while this case proceeds,” the filing says. Republican lawmakers enacted the ban in April, overriding a veto by GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson following pleas from pediatricians, social workers and the parents of transgender youth who said the measure would harm a community already at risk for depression and suicide.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Thousands of Central California farmers were warned Tuesday that they could face water cutoffs this summer as the state deals with a drought that already has curtailed federal and state irrigation supplies. The State Water Resources Control Board notified about 6,600 farmers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed who have rights to use water from the Central Valley estuary of “impending water unavailability” that may continue until winter rains come. “This is how dry things are,” water board Chairman Joaquin Esquivel told the Sacramento Bee. “The hydrology that we’re seeing is not there. … There will not be enough natural flow.” The state also must provide enough flow in the rivers to maintain populations of protected fish species in rivers while keeping “cities and communities from running out of water,” Esquivel said. It’s unclear when the allocations will be cut or whom it will affect. Some farmers have first crack at supplies under a complicated distribution system involving rights-holders. Many farmers already have been told they will get little or nothing from two large allocation systems, the federal Central Valley Project and the State Water Project. “The 2021 water year for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin is currently the driest since 1977,” the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has warned.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis said he will begin phasing out the executive authority he has been granted during the coronavirus pandemic after creating, amending and extending about 400 orders since March 2020. The Democrat told The Denver Post that he’s now ready to let go of his unprecedented authority. “The pandemic still exists,” he said, but “our hospital capacity is no longer threatened. We have 60% of the population vaccinated. So at this point, we would go to kind of regular order, which means the Legislature passes laws, I can sign laws, and you can see the phaseout of those executive powers over time.” Polis has continued to exert his executive authority through multiple emergency mandates, enacting 17 orders in March, 13 in April, 10 in May and six so far this month. “In general, the time for these emergency actions is over, or near over. I believe in a republic, and I believe in three branches of government,” Polis said. “It’s not the role of the governor to do that long-term. It’s the role of the governor to react in an emergency.” Polis’ promise to phase out his powers was well-received news among Republican state officials who have worked for months to remove his additional authority. Republican state Sen. Paul Lundeen said he will believe it when he sees it.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate on Tuesday passed legislation for the second time in about a week that legalizes the recreational use of cannabis for adults. But Gov. Ned Lamont is threatening to veto the retooled bill, arguing it opens the industry up to tens of thousands of people previously ineligible to get priority for licenses. Shortly before the bill cleared the Senate on a 19-12 vote, Paul Mounds, the Democratic governor’s chief of staff, issued a statement promising Lamont would nix the bill in its current form. The House was scheduled to take up the same legislation Wednesday, but it was unclear what would happen given the veto threat. The legislation “simply put, does not meet the goals laid out during negotiations when it comes to equity and ensuring the wrongs of the past are righted,” Mounds said in a statement. “To the contrary, this proposal opens the floodgates for tens of thousands of previously ineligible applicants to enter the adult-use cannabis industry.” He said the bill, which was amended twice Tuesday, allows “just about anyone with a history of cannabis crimes” or a member of their family, regardless of their financial means, who was once arrested for possession of drugs to be considered an “equity applicant,” given the same weight as someone from a neighborhood hit hard by the war on drugs.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill that would bar police from releasing juvenile mug shots for minor crimes. House Bill 243 by Rep. Franklin Cooke, D-New Castle, would apply to booking photos of children 17 or younger. According to the bill, mug shots could still be published if the juvenile is charged with a violent felony and if the mug shot is necessary to protect the public’s safety. The Delaware Police Chiefs Council, which represents all police departments in the state, supports the bill, according to its chair, Patrick Ogden. Jamie Leonard, president of the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police, the officers’ union, said his organization has yet to take a stance on the bill. In a Statehouse where several lawmakers in both parties – including sponsor Cooke – are retired officers or affiliated with police, proposed changes to policing laws historically need support from the police themselves. Cooke has argued that, because information such as mug shots lives forever on the internet, teenage mistakes come back to haunt people in adulthood. “I think everyone can agree that in the vast majority of circumstances, there’s no benefit to publishing juvenile mug shots – only damage to young people,” Cooke said. “I’m committed to getting this bill passed this year and ending this practice.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With all capacity limits and restrictions lifted in the district, plans for Fourth of July celebrations are back in full swing. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that he will host essential workers and military families on the South Lawn to celebrate the nation’s birthday, WUSA-TV reports. “D.C. is open and ready to welcome back visitors to celebrate the way we came together as a city and as a nation this year,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “We have shown once again that when we come together, there is nothing we can’t do.” With the nation inching closer to Biden’s vaccination goal, the country is gearing up for an Independence Day celebration like no other. “We thank President Biden and his team for acting with urgency to get the vaccine to the American people so that we could save lives, get our country open and celebrate together once again,” Bowser said. The district will support the White House and host the annual Fourth of July fireworks celebration on the National Mall. The 17-minute display will be held Sunday, July 4, starting at 9:09 p.m. and will be launched from both sides of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. The city also plans to celebrate the return of the Barracks Row and Palisades 4th of July Parades.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Sunsets across the state in the coming days could become even more spectacular, as clouds of dust from the Sahara desert sweep in across the Atlantic coast. The plume is expected to dampen storm activity but worsen air pollution, causing trouble for some people with allergies and other respiratory problems. Some health experts say symptoms could mimic those from COVID-19. NASA is monitoring the dust, which was swept off Africa by strong winds swirling across the deserts of Mali and Mauritania. Trade winds are carrying the plume across the ocean, with the leading edge expected to arrive in Florida in the coming days. “It’s going to be a major dust outbreak,” Joseph Prospero, professor emeritus at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Prospero pioneered research into African dust clouds. Dry winds carrying the particles could help smother storm systems by drying out the humid tropical air that feeds turbulent weather across a well-traveled route for hurricanes, experts said. “It’s been moving across the Atlantic for the past several days, and it’s expected to be in the area around Friday or Saturday,” Sammy Hadi, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Miami, told the paper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTrenton: A nursing home director in northwestern Georgia was charged with cruelty after a sheriff said authorities discovered the facility didn’t have working air conditioning and had only one staff member looking after residents. Dade County deputies arrested Kent Allen Womack on Monday night, news outlets report. The 55-year-old was in custody at the county jail, and Sheriff Ray Cross said more charges were pending. Authorities reported to Woodhaven Senior Living in Trenton after receiving a call from a family member about the residents, from 61 to 97 years old, being evicted and having an hour to pack their belongings. Deputies who went to the nursing home learned one staff member – who wasn’t a trained nurse – had been watching the residents for 32 hours straight, according to news outlets. Every other employee quit because of the conditions. It was also discovered that the air conditioning in the building only worked near Womack’s office. “We checked the temperature in one of the air units in there, and it registered over 100 degrees,” Cross said Tuesday. The sheriff said Womack smelled of alcohol when he arrived at the facility. Cross asked if he had been drinking, and the nursing home owner responded: “I didn’t drive here.” Authorities found two small bottles of alcohol in Womack’s pocket, Cross said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Eleven inmates at a state jail have asked a judge to release them early for public health reasons amid a COVID-19 outbreak. Hilo Circuit Judge Peter Kubota granted five of the motions but denied or postponed the rest, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Most of the cases he denied were for offenders who had repeatedly violated probation in the past. As of Friday, nearly 200 inmates at the Hawaii Community Correctional Center had tested positive for the coronavirus since May 24. There were seven active cases among staff. The outbreak occurred as the jail struggled with overcrowding. The jail population exceeds operational capacity by more than 100 inmates. Deputy Public Defender Patrick Munoz, who represents some of the people asking to be released early, said the increasingly intolerable conditions at the jail represent an undue hardship for inmates. “Not only are individuals being exposed to the effects of this potentially life-threatening and long-lasting virus, but there’s also the effects on people being in an overcrowded prison afraid for their lives,” he said. “It’s like they’re on a sinking ship. Fear is overcoming them;people are beginning to panic.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Unemployed residents could get kicked out of a state benefits program if they don’t follow new job-seeking requirements that went into effect this month. People receiving unemployment benefits now have two business days to apply for a job opening after receiving a referral from the Idaho Department of Labor, the Idaho Statesman reports. If they don’t, they could lose their unemployment benefits. “Once a job is referred, the claimant must apply for the job or act on that referral,” Idaho Department of Labor director Jani Revier said. “In the past, when referrals were made, there were no consequences if they didn’t follow up.” State workforce consultants will check with the potential employer to verify that the person applied for the referred job. Previously, the labor department didn’t track whether people followed up on referrals. In March, there were 1.4 available jobs for every unemployed Idaho resident, Revier said. Property values and housing costs have climbed dramatically across much of the state in recent years, particularly during the pandemic. Idaho’s minimum wage of $7.25, meanwhile, hasn’t increased since 2009. A full-time minimum-wage worker would earn about $1,250 a month before taxes. Online rental agency ApartmentList.com says median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Boise is just over $900.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A nonprofit formed to highlight the lack of leaders of color within the city’s arts and cultural systems is asking artists of color to imagine what the nation’s third-largest city could look like without stubborn inequities in art, theater and other institutions. The first phase of Enrich Chicago’s new program, called Imagine Just, begins this month. The series of brainstorming sessions will ask artists, performers and other Chicagoans to imagine what an equitable arts and cultural scene could look like. Nina Sanchez, co-director of Enrich Chicago, sees the project as an expansion of the organization’s focus on anti-racism training and education within Chicago’s arts and cultural community. The organization was founded in 2014 by former leaders of the influential Joyce Foundation and the Auditorium Theatre. It now counts more than 50 arts and cultural organizations as partners. But the coronavirus pandemic and widespread activism during the past year in response to George Floyd’s death highlighted stubborn inequities in all aspects of life, prompting conversations about what else the organization could do to force change in Chicago’s arts and culture community, Sanchez said. Imagine Just is the result, attempting to amplify the voices of artists of color and reach leaders of local institutions that can feel out of reach, she said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Several teachers unions are seeking to block a new state law, set to take effect next month, that they say unfairly targets teachers and makes it harder for unions to collect dues. The unions representing Anderson, Avon and Martinsville school districts and the teachers that lead them filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Indiana’s federal Southern District court challenging Senate Enrolled Act 251. The law, which will go into effect July 1, sets out a new process for the collection of teachers union dues, requiring teachers to annually complete a three-step process to have union dues deducted from their paychecks. Jeff Macey, the attorney representing the teachers and their unions, said no other union or organization that allows for wage deductions is required to follow the same process. The law violates the constitutional rights of teachers, he said. “Why are teachers being singled out for these onerous restrictions?” Macey said. “No other union, no other charity, no other organization in the state has to do this to assign a portion of your wages to (them).” The lawsuit names Attorney General Todd Rokita, Secretary of Education Katie Jenner and Tammy Meyer, chair of the Indiana Education Employment Relations Board, as defendants.\n\nIowa\n\nLake City: A fire destroyed an internationally renowned western Iowa business that makes pipe organs for churches, schools and other customers around the world. The fire at Dobson Pipe Organ Builders in Lake City was reported about 4 p.m. Tuesday, officials said. Firefighters who arrived on the scene found the building engulfed in flames, which caused the building’s exterior walls to collapse. One employee of the company was burned when he discovered the fire and tried to put out the flames, according to authorities. The State Fire Marshal’s Office said it believes the fire was started by a malfunctioning fan that caused sawdust to ignite. Dobson Pipe Organ Builders was founded in 1974 by Lynn Dobson, a Carroll native who attended Wayne State College in Nebraska, according to the business’ website. During his years at the college, he built his first 12-top mechanical action organ in a shed on his family’s farm that he sold to Our Savior’s Lutheran Church in Sioux City, where it is still played. Dobson opened the Lake City factory in a former farm implement dealership on the town’s square in 1974. The company installed its 98th organ this year at St. Christopher’s Church in Chatham, Massachusetts, according to its website, and planned its 99th for Saint James Church in Sydney, Australia.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas Statehouse, often dubbed the people’s house, was missing one thing for the past year: the people. Lobbyists and staff joined elected legislators in the building for the January session, but pandemic-related limits on visitors meant no school groups, curious tourists or children standing in front of John Steuart Curry’s epic painting “Tragic Prelude,” a history book textbook brought to life before their very eyes. That changed Monday, when the Statehouse once again resumed tours, bringing a sense of normalcy back to downtown Topeka as a trickle of visitors to the seat of state government turned into a waterfall. Only one person showed up for a 9 a.m. tour, leaving staff wondering how many onlookers would show throughout the day. But almost two dozen visitors came for a tour two hours later – numbers that would have been above average even before COVID-19. Not everything is fully back to normal, though. Tours to the top of the Statehouse dome have yet to resume, with staff hoping to have them back up and running later this summer. And the four-times-a-day tours require juggling for workers, with many part-time guides still laid off.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A 25-foot-tall nest is being pieced together on a massive scale at Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, already home to a family of giant wooden trolls. Artist Jayson Fann is constructing his “Spirit Nest” creation as part of a new “Playcosystem,” a new 10-acre natural playground that stresses the importance of free play and connecting children with nature. The enormous nest’s spiraling branches resemble a prehistoric bird’s nest or a massive clock face to be ogled, climbed on and enjoyed. Fann is working on 12 Spirit Nests this year, with the pandemic slowing his output in 2020. An amphitheater made from salvaged forest wood will encompass the Bernheim nest, providing a place to educate and entertain visitors in the forest. A large drum made from the hollowed stump of a fallen maple tree will sit in the center of the nest. A percussionist himself, Fann’s goal is for the project to be a link to the Indigenous people and African Americans who have a history with the land at Bernheim. It is a nest for all people. “That’s what the nests are. They are storytelling spaces, to bring people together, in the spirit of community. Imagine a full moon and kids are here; maybe there is a campfire, and you’ve got people from different cultures sharing their life story, connecting and healing. That’s a space I want to hang out in,” he said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state has created a framework for self-driving delivery robots to drop off packages and navigate streets, under a bill backed by lawmakers and Gov. John Bel Edwards. The new personal delivery device law sponsored by state Sen. Rick Ward, R-Port Allen, took effect immediately after the Democratic governor signed the legislation. Grocery stores, pizza delivery restaurants and Amazon have started working on delivering items with self-driving robots. Ward told his colleagues he envisioned pharmacies, restaurants or other stores near local neighborhoods possibly using the devices to make short-distance deliveries. “Your constituents would be able to place an order for any number of things, and that personal delivery device would be able to pick that up from a store location and go throughout the neighborhood and deliver it along the way,” Ward told the House transportation committee when it debated and approved the measure. Under the new law, self-driving delivery robots must run at low speeds – up to 12 miles per hour in pedestrian areas and up to 20 mph in others. They must yield to pedestrians and can’t obstruct traffic or transport hazardous materials. Companies using the delivery vehicles must have lights on the front and rear of each device and maintain at least $100,000 of insurance on each one.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposed constitutional amendment to require popular elections for Maine’s attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer has fallen short in the state House. A two-thirds majority is required in both chambers to send the proposed amendment to the voters for approval. The bill won 27-7 support on Monday in the Senate, which approved an amendment to ensure the use of ranked-choice voting. But the House, which previously narrowly approved the measure, rejected the amended version by an 81-62 vote Tuesday, the Bangor Daily News reports. Maine is among a handful of states that do not hold statewide general elections for so-called constitutional officers. The positions are chosen by the Legislature and typically are filled by the party in power. Former Republican Gov. Paul LePage called for a similar change in 2015, when he was involved in a political dispute with then-Attorney General Janet Mills. But Republican support eroded with the ranked-choice voting provision. Republicans have decried the voting system since GOP U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin lost his reelection to Democrat Jared Golden despite winning the plurality of first-place votes. Golden was declared the majority winner after an additional voting round in the three-way race.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Videos showing police officers kneeing one Black teen and using a Taser on another on the beach community’s Boardwalk in separate confrontations that began over vaping are stirring criticism of the department’s use of force in such cases. On June 6, officers tried to stop a teen because he was vaping, police said in a statement. When he pulled away from an officer grabbing him in a “bear hug” and began threatening to kill them, an officer used a Taser, according to charging documents. Video of the encounter shows the teen with his hands up, but as one hand drops toward his backpack, an officer fires a Taser, and he falls to the ground. Other videos show the teen being carried away by officers with his hands and feet tied. Court documents state that the 18-year-old from Perryville teen is Black. A video of another Boardwalk confrontation Saturday shows another Black teen being held by several officers while another knees him repeatedly as a dozen officers and public safety aides hold back an angry crowd. One teen is taken into custody after lifting one of several police bicycles encircling the officers, and another is Tased as he struggles with officers. That confrontation began after officers approached a large group of people vaping to tell them it was prohibited, then returning when they saw one begin to vape again, police said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A company that authorities say failed to deliver on a contract to supply 1 million N95 face masks to the state and then made false statements in connection with its obligation to refund the state has agreed to pay nearly $3.5 million to settle the allegations, the state attorney general’s office said Wednesday. The company, Salem-based Bedrock Group LLC, signed a $3.6 million contract with the state in April 2020 in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic to supply the masks, essential for health care workers, according to a statement from authorities. The state made the purchase after it was contacted by the company’s president with an offer to supply the masks, which the president said would come from a reputable manufacturer in China. The masks were supposed to be shipped to the state in mid-April 2020, but the order was terminated in June after fewer than 100,000 of the masks were delivered. Bedrock repeatedly acknowledged its obligation to refund the state but failed to do so, according to the attorney general’s office. “This company tried to take advantage of the state by holding onto millions of taxpayer dollars it owed for masks that it never delivered,” Attorney General Maura Healey said. In addition to repaying the money, Bedrock is not allowed to seek another state contract for five years.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A school district that never returned to classrooms in the 2020-21 academic year will embrace online education again in the fall and open it to more students. Lansing said it will keep online classes as an option and invite families from other mid-Michigan districts to participate. The district also plans to open schools in a traditional way as the COVID-19 pandemic eases. “We had a number of students who were doing very well” online, said Superintendent Sam Sinicropi. “So we decided to explore what it would look like to offer a virtual option.” The district expects to enroll up to 600 students and hire 15 new teachers, who will teach solely online. Students will be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at Lansing schools. “There are some families that prefer this, and hopefully this will be the answer for them,” Sinicropi said. The capital city’s district has more than 10,000 students.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A bankruptcy trustee’s search to recover assets linked to one of the largest financial crimes in state history has netted $722 million. Doug Kelley said his work to collect assets from Tom Petters’ $1.9 billion Ponzi scheme is nearly done 13 years after the search began. A motion filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis last week shows the amount recovered and returned to victims and creditors, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. “We can see the light at the end of the tunnel here,” Kelley said. “It has been a long and arduous process that was at times bumpy, but I am quite pleased with the collective return of $722 million.” Petters, now 63, was indicted in 2008 on multiple counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy for operating the scheme that spanned 26 countries, including the the Cayman Islands, Germany and Switzerland. A federal jury found him guilty on all counts, and he was sentenced to 50 years in prison. He is currently an inmate at the federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas. Kelley said just four or five cases remain, including one filed against the Bank of Montreal in Canada.\n\nMississippi\n\nBooneville: Friends, family and former colleagues gathered in the city Monday to remember former Mississippi House Speaker Billy McCoy and unveil a sign that names a segment of a highway in his honor. McCoy was 77 when he died in 2019. The farmer from Rienzi was a self-described Franklin D. Roosevelt New Deal Democrat who was first elected to the state House in 1979. McCoy was speaker during his final two terms, ending in 2012. McCoy – known for down-home turns of phrase and the occasional flash of temper – was instrumental in passing the 1987 Highway Program that led to construction of hundreds of miles of four-lane roads across Mississippi, including in rural areas struggling for economic development. Legislators in 2020 passed a bill naming segments of highways, including the stretch of U.S. 45 in Prentiss and Alcorn counties, in honor of McCoy. Both counties were in his House district. Democrat Steve Holland of Plantersville, who served in the House from 1984 to 2020, said McCoy would pick him up in an old blue Oldsmobile, and they’d ride the backroads of Mississippi together, stopping at country stores to see what was on people’s minds. “I don’t need a sign to remember him,” Holland said. “But, my goodness, what a wonderful way because the guy loved the roads. He loved riding them, and he loved seeing people.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Two of the area’s largest employers have announced they will require employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by fall. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports BJC HealthCare and Washington University both announced the requirements Tuesday. The decision comes at a time when demand for vaccines is waning in Missouri, a state that already lags the national average with its COVID-19 immunization rate. The St. Louis region’s three other major health systems – SSM Health, Mercy and St. Luke’s Hospital – have not issued vaccine requirements but said they were discussing the issue. Missouri Hospital Association President and CEO Herb Kuhn said hospitals across the state have “seen COVID-19’s devastation in lives and health lost,” and many are evaluating vaccine requirements. Washington University will require all faculty, staff and trainees to be vaccinated by Aug. 30. BJC will require employees to be fully vaccinated by Sept. 15.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state Department of Corrections will pay $250,000 to settle claims from a guard who claimed he was retaliated against after reporting rape allegations at Montana Women’s Prison. Daniel Root claimed he was passed over twice for a promotion after reporting in 2017 allegations of his supervisor’s sexual misconduct with inmates. The results of an investigation into the claims have not been released, but the lieutenant accused of having sex with an inmate resigned in 2019, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Root said in court filings that he was told filing lawsuits and talking to the press about issues of public concern reflected negatively on his chances for promotion. He resigned under the terms of the agreement. His attorney told the Montana State News Bureau that Root wanted to put the case behind him. Attorney Kevin Brown said he hopes the case will spur other corrections employees to step forward and report violations of rape reporting requirements. The Department of Corrections settled a separate retaliation claim from an agency employee earlier this year, also for $250,000. In that case, a former corrections employee said he faced discrimination and retaliation in 2016 for his post-traumatic stress disorder while working at the men’s state prison near Deer Lodge.\n\nNebraska\n\nSouth Sioux City: The City Council has approved a payment of $500,000 to settle its part in 16 lawsuits filed against the city and a now-defunct biogas plant by homeowners who accused the plant of sending rancid fumes through the city sewer system and ruining their homes. The settlement calls for the city, Big Ox Energy, three insurance companies and two other companies to pay a combined $1.75 million, which will be divided among the homeowners. The City Council approved South Sioux City’s portion Monday, the Sioux City Journal reports. Big Ox began operations in September 2016, separating solids from industry wastewater to create methane. The plant sold the methane and injected it into a nearby natural gas pipeline. Big Ox was subject to odor complaints soon after it began operations and was cited for numerous environmental violations until it shut down in 2019. Neither South Sioux City nor Big Ox, which have both denied the homeowners’ claims, admit liability in the settlement. After the complaints and lawsuit, Big Ox in turn sued two other companies. The first was former soybean processor CHS Inc., which it said illegally released acidic wastewater into the sewer system. The second was Olsson Inc., an engineering firm Big Ox said recommended wastewater from its plant be routed through a sewer main.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A battery recycling company founded by a former executive at Tesla Inc. broke ground on 100 acres of land at an industrial park near the city as part of its expansion plan. Redwood Materials, founded in Nevada in 2017, is expecting its operations to continue growing with a boost in used battery packs from older electric vehicles. As a result, the company plans to expand its facilities and increase its workforce from just over 100 employees to more than 600 in the next couple of years. In addition to the acquisition at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, the company is also undertaking a major project in Carson City to expand its 150,000-square-foot facility to 550,000 square feet within the next two years. “We’ve been on the quiet side because we prefer to make progress and get things done,” Redwood Materials CEO JB Straubel said. “We felt it was time to connect a bit more with the local community and help raise awareness for hiring and make sure people realize this is a worthy and unique opportunity here as well.” Straubel is known for helping launch Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer that has been operating out of the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center for nearly seven years. Tesla works with Panasonic to create battery packs from various components. Redwood Materials, Straubel’s new venture, does the reverse.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Budget negotiators in the state House on Tuesday went along with the Senate version of a provision that would prohibit teaching schoolchildren or public employees that one race is superior to another or that one inherently discriminates against another. The House had included language in its budget defining numerous “divisive concepts” that would be banned from being taught in schools or by public employers during diversity and inclusion training. The Senate overhauled the language in the face of opposition from Gov. Chris Sununu, framing it as an anti-discrimination measure that would not prohibit discussions about history or current events. But opponents have argued it still would limit First Amendment rights by banning discussions about important topics including racism and sexism. Rep. Lynne Ober, R-Hudson, who is leading the committee hashing out a compromise on the budget, said Tuesday that the House acceded to the Senate’s language. There was no debate. Work continued on the larger bill Wednesday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: State lawmakers are considering a bill that would fast-track offshore wind energy projects by removing the ability of local governments to control power lines and other onshore components. The bill, introduced last week and advanced Tuesday, would give wind energy projects approved by the state Board of Public Utilities authority to locate, build, use and maintain wires and associated land-based infrastructure as long as they run underground on public property including streets, though the BPU could determine that some above-ground wires are necessary. It appears to be an effort to head off any local objections to at least one wind power project envisioned to come ashore at two former power plants and run cables under two of the state’s most popular beaches. At a virtual public hearing in April on the Ocean Wind project planned by Orsted, the Danish wind energy developer, and PSEG, a New Jersey utility company, officials revealed that the project would connect to the electric grid at decommissioned power plants in Ocean and Cape May Counties. The northern connection would be at the former Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in Lacey Township; the southern connection would be at the former B.L. England plant in Upper Township.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democrat-backed efforts to expand voter access in the state are coming to fruition, with the rollout of same-day voter registration this month. The first trial run took place in a low-turnout special congressional election June 1, allowing voters to register at early voting centers in the final weeks of balloting and Election Day. In all, 2,012 residents took advantage of the opportunity to register during the final four weeks of the election, according to the New Mexico secretary of state’s office. Late-registering voters flocked primarily to the Democratic Party, accounting for about 53% of those registrations – and 50% of those on Election Day itself. About 32% of the later registrations aligned with the Republican Party. U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a Democrat, won the June 1 election with 60% of the vote to fill the 1st Congressional District seat held previously by Deb Haaland. Same-day registration is likely to be an option in future New Mexico elections, but it requires approval every two years by a panel of voting systems regulators. Approval is pending for the November local election to pick mayors in cities including Albuquerque and Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A former Shake Shack manager has filed a lawsuit against the Detectives’ Endowment Association, the Police Benevolent Association, and about 20 unnamed New York Police Department officers accusing them of false arrest and defamation. Marcus Gilliam and other employees were accused by officers of serving them poisoned milkshakes last June. In a lawsuit filed Monday, Gilliam said the subsequent interrogation caused him “emotional and psychological damages and damage to his reputation.” Three officers complained that their shakes made them sick and had a bitter and unusual taste. Two hours later, 20 officers approached the establishment and began to treat the store as a crime scene, The New York Times reports. As the investigation unfolded, police unions announced on Twitter that officers were intentionally attacked. “Tonight, three of our fellow officers were intentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack,” the detectives’ union tweeted. The Police Benevolent Association made a similar post later alleging that the drinks were intentionally spiked with “a toxic substance, believed to be bleach or a similar cleaning agent.” Rodney Harrison, the NYPD’s chief of detectives at the time and now chief of the department, eventually tweeted that the investigation found “no criminality” by the employees.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s ban on most abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy must remain unenforceable, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday, rejecting arguments that the law should be left intact because prosecutors aren’t going after doctors who violate it. A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, upheld a 2019 lower-court decision striking down the prohibition, which has been on the books since 1973. The Republican-dominated Legislature in 2015 narrowed the scope of medical emergencies under which a woman would be exempt from the 20-week limit. That meant more abortions involving unviable fetuses could be considered criminal, raising the fear for abortion providers that they could face prosecution. A U.S. District Court judge in 2019 agreed and blocked the law’s enforcement in situations where the fetus would be considered not viable. State government lawyers representing some district attorneys and state health officials who were sued have argued the abortion providers lack legal standing to challenge the law. Their arguments for the law’s reinstatement are based on the fact that North Carolina has not charged any abortion providers under a pair of laws being challenged and that prosecutors currently have no plans to do so.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The number of wildfires this year in the state has increased significantly, officials say, citing extremely dry conditions. Data collected by the North Dakota Forest Service and the state Department of Emergency Services shows nearly 1,400 fires have consumed about 156 square miles since the beginning of the year. Last year, about 921 fires burned approximately 18 square miles. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months this year. The U.S. Drought Monitor shows more than two-thirds of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought. State Forester Tom Claeys said limited moisture along with warm temperatures have increased the intensity and size of wildfires this year. “This year, it’s imperative that we all know how to mitigate against wildfires, especially as we make plans to enjoy the summer months by recreating outside with friends and family,” Claeys said. “With Independence Day right around the corner, we need to raise awareness now to reduce wildfire risk. We all can do our part to practice fire safety and protect property and lives.” Tribal, state and federal agencies responded to two large wildfires April 30 through May 2. The Roosevelt Creek Fire in the Little Missouri National Grassland and one on the Fort Berthold Reservation have each burned about 15 square miles or more.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican former Speaker Larry Householder was expelled from the state House in a vote Wednesday following his indictment in an alleged $60 million federal bribery probe – only the second time the Legislature has pushed out a member and the first time in 150 years. The Republican-led House voted 75-21 to remove Householder, of Perry County, approving a resolution that said he was not suited for office because of the indictment. The full House voted after lawmakers forced the measure to the floor instead of waiting for the expulsion resolution to work through the committee process. Reps. Brian Stewart and Mark Frazier, both Republicans representing districts that border Householder’s, encouraged their colleagues to “do the right thing” and vote to expel. “This has been a distraction. This has been a stain on the institution, and it is time for us to come together as one body,” Frazier said, adding that “this institution is greater than any one man.” Householder and four associates were arrested in July in an investigation connected to legislation containing a ratepayer-funded bailout of two Ohio nuclear power plants. The $1 billion rescue would have added a new fee to every electricity bill in the state and directed over $150 million a year through 2026 to the plants near Cleveland and Toledo.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A 24-member joint committee of state House and Senate members has been selected to consider proposals for Oklahoma’s share of funds from the latest federal coronavirus relief legislation. House Speaker Charles McCall and Senate President Pro Tem Greg Treat, both Republicans, announced the committee Wednesday. “This is an opportunity to address needs exposed by the pandemic and support economic recovery without growing state government’s financial obligations,” McCall said. Treat said the one-time funds provide “the opportunity to further strengthen Oklahoma’s position through targeted investments in projects across the state.” Gov. Kevin Stitt said the money can be used to improve the state’s infrastructure and workforce, as well as the health of residents. The state is to receive about $1.9 billion of the total $1.9 trillion in federal funds approved by Congress in March. The bill, among President Joe Biden’s top priorities in addressing the coronavirus pandemic and economic crises, was unanimously opposed by Republicans in Congress. The Oklahoma committee will be co-chaired by Sen. Roger Thompson and Rep. Kevin Wallace, both Republicans.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown has signed a bill passed by the Legislature legalizing human composting. The measure signed Tuesday will legalize what’s also known as natural organic reduction, KOIN-TV reports. It also clarifies rules surrounding alkaline hydrolysis, known as aqua cremation. The law goes into effect July 1, 2022. Rep. Pam Marsh, from in Southern Jackson County, who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Brian Clem, said she decided to sponsor the bill because her constituents are interested in alternative after-death options. “My colleagues could see as well that in addition to providing families with a choice, it also is a business opportunity,” she said. Elizabeth Fournier, owner of Cornerstone Funeral Services in Boring, Oregon, and author of a green burial guidebook, provides “green” and eco-friendly after-death services and has given clients the option of natural organic reduction since it was legalized in Washington state in 2020. Fournier takes bodies to Herland Forest in Wahkiacus, Washington. It’s a natural burial cemetery about 100 miles east of Portland. In 2020, Fournier witnessed her first natural organic reduction and said seeing the process for herself made her more comfortable in talking to her clients about that option.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A western Pennsylvania judge will mediate a dispute over a statue of explorer Christopher Columbus in a city park. Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge John McVay declared an impasse in the dispute between the city of Pittsburgh and the Italian Sons and Daughters of America over the Columbus statue in Schenley Park, the Tribune-Review reports. McVay issued an order last week instructing the parties to identify who will participate from each side during the mediation. City crews last fall covered the 13-foot statue, which was erected in 1955, in advance of Columbus Day. The Pittsburgh Art Commission voted unanimously to remove the statue, and Mayor Bill Peduto agreed, but the Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed a lawsuit. McVay granted an injunction halting the removal but urged the parties to try to reach consensus, saying that “historical figures are people and necessarily come with heroic qualities along with character flaws” but also saying that “racism, slavery and prejudice must always be condemned and rejected by our city.” The group then asked the judge to remove himself, saying the court had adopted “its own beliefs” on settlement discussions that “are based on demonstrably false and biased recitations of history that are swiftly disproven by the primary sources of Columbus’s time.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A doctor has been cited by federal labor officials for failing to take steps to protect his medical office staff from exposure to COVID-19 even after he and other employees contracted the coronavirus. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Tuesday that Dr. Anthony Farina Jr. “willfully exposed” his workers to the virus when he decided to continue working. The agency said he also failed to fully implement safeguards such as cleaning and disinfecting regimens, screening all employees for symptoms, or mandating contact tracing or quarantining after exposure. Labor officials said they’d seek a $136,532 fine against Farina, who runs four medical practices: North Providence Urgent Care Inc., North Providence Primary Care Associates Inc., Center of New England Urgent Care Inc. and Center of New England Primary Care Inc. Farina’s lawyer, Michael Lepizzera, said his client will contest OSHA’s findings and proposed penalty, which he said is “legally excessive.” State officials in January suspended Farina’s license under emergency order, saying he posed a danger to the community, though they restored it the following month. Farina also faces federal allegations that he violated fair labor laws by failing to pay overtime to more than 100 employees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: As the state nears its first execution in a decade, death penalty opponents are renewing calls for South Carolina to toss out its capital punishment statute. A group of faith leaders, academics, organizers and others delivered a letter Wednesday to Gov. Henry McMaster and the General Assembly calling for a halt to two upcoming executions and the repeal of the state’s death penalty law. Group members acknowledge it’s unlikely that the politicians who ushered in a new law aimed at restarting executions after an involuntary 10-year pause will now turn around and repeal that law. Their group, South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, was formed in light of two upcoming executions this month. “We don’t expect that we’re going to stop an execution,” said Abraham Bonowitz, director of Death Penalty Action, a national anti-death penalty group that helps local organizations oppose capital punishment. “What we do expect is that we’re going to create the organization that’s going to abolish the death penalty in this state. It might take two years, it might take 10 years, but that’s what this organization is designed to do.” State prisons officials are planning Friday to electrocute Brad Sigmon, 63, who has spent nearly two decades on death row after he was convicted in 2002 of killing his ex-girlfriend’s parents with a baseball bat.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem indicated Tuesday that she will try again to hold a fireworks display over Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day on the heels of President Joe Biden’s announcement that the White House will be hosting its own “independence from the virus” bash. The National Parks Service in March denied the state’s application to hold the pyrotechnic display, reasoning that fireworks caused safety concerns at the monument, that local Native American tribes objected to the celebration being held on land they hold as sacred and that a mass gathering could still defy coronavirus precautions. In an effort to overturn that decision, the Republican governor has written a letter to the president, bashed Biden in the media and sued the U.S. Department of the Interior. All of those efforts have failed. But after Biden announced Tuesday that he would be encouraging nationwide celebrations to mark the country’s effective return to normalcy, Noem said on Twitter that she would resubmit a request to hold fireworks at the monument on Saturday, July 3. However, even if the federal government reversed its decision, the state would struggle to pull the event together with July Fourth weekend just weeks away. Noem’s administration previously said in court that the state would have to know by June 2 to have ample planning time.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Amazon on Wednesday announced a commitment of $75million for developers to create affordable homes in the city near WeGo Public Transit high-capacity corridors. The company reported 800 homes will be built on private land, and the investment is part of Amazon’s more than $2 billion Housing Equity Fund to preserve and create over 20,000 affordable homes through below-market loans to housing partners, traditional and nontraditional public agencies, and minority-led organizations. The Music City is one of three cities hosting the company’s new headquarters, where Amazon hopes to infuse communities with cash and support over the next five years. Transportation and housing costs account for a significant portion of the average person’s expenses, said Jay Carney, Amazon’s senior vice president of Global Corporate Affairs. “We hope this will pave a path for more inclusive communities,” Carney said. WeGo, the primary regional transit agency operating bus and paratransit service across Nashville, serves close to 30,000 riders daily. Amazon will focus on affordable properties within a half-mile of transit stops and “prioritize opportunities to invest in minority-led organizations and racially and economically diverse communities,” the company reported.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The developer of a long-planned – and controversial – high-speed rail line that would get passengers from Dallas to Houston in 90 minutes announced Tuesday that it signed a $16 billion contract with an Italian company to build the project, in what could be a step toward realization. Webuild, based in Milan, will oversee heavy construction of the planned 236-mile project for developer Texas Central, the companies said in a news release. Webuild will operate through U.S. subsidiary Lane Construction Corporation, based in Cheshire, Connecticut. Nearly half the distance the bullet train will cover – at speeds up to 200 mph – will be elevated to reduce the impact on property owners, the companies said. Residents have fought the high-speed train, which has been discussed for decades and would rely on acquiring land through eminent domain to construct the rail line. Trey Duhon, who heads a group called Texans Against High-Speed Rail, criticized Tuesday’s announcement, saying it was just the developer continuing to try to drum up support for an unpopular project. “Texas Central takes every opportunity to generate what sounds like progress to keep interest and investments alive,” said Duhon, who also is the highest-ranking elected official in Waller County, outside Houston.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s ski resorts set a record for visitors this past winter despite coronavirus-related restrictions and a below-average snowfall, according to industry data released Tuesday. A news release from Ski Utah shows the 5.3 million skier days marked a major rebound from the previous winter, when the state registered 4.3 million after the season was cut short by the pandemic. The industry association said this winter’s figure also surpasses the previous record of 5.13 million skier days set during the 2018-19 ski season. Utah resorts were forced to implement COVID-19 safety protocols, including capacity limitations and mask mandates, but the industry association said those didn’t stop skiers and snowboarders from visiting. “Throughout the season it became clear that skiing provided a respite from the day to day realities of the pandemic and allowed an option for guests to safely socialize outside,” Nathan Rafferty, president of Ski Utah, said in a statement. Utah’s big year mirrors a banner season for ski resorts around the country. The National Ski Areas Association’s said the 59 million skier visits nationally are the fifth-most overall.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: A refugee resettlement nonprofit has plans to start a new program in the state to relocate refugees in smaller, more rural communities across the United States. The Ethiopian Development Community Council, a nonprofit agency that partners with the State Department to resettle refugees in the U.S., wants to launch its program in Brattleboro because of the city’s support. The first families should arrive in the city before the end of the year if the program is approved by the federal government, Vermont Public Radio reports. The nonprofit has also chosen Wausau to test out the program, pending federal approval. The nonprofit is preparing for an influx of refugees because the Biden administration has promised to increase the number of refugees allowed in the country and reopen the refugee resettlement program on which the Trump administration imposed restrictions, the radio station reports. “If we want to create integration of refugees, having them only in big cities where they would be congregating among themselves, only, is not going to help long-term integration,” said Tsehaye Tefera, founder of the Ethiopian Development Community Council. Brattleboro town manager Peter Elwell said he knows there could be opposition to the program, but the plan is in line with the town’s priority to improve equity in one of the nation’s whitest states.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Riders on the city’s transit system won’t have to dig into their pockets for another year. The board of directors of Greater Richmond Transit Company announced Tuesday that the system will remain fare-free through June 30, 2022. The system said in a news release that it has used state and federal COVID-19 relief funds since March 2020 in response to public health measures. GRTC also has sponsored the fare-free rides in the interest of economically distressed communities who rely on public transit to reach jobs, food and other resources. Free fares include rides on local buses, the Pulse, Express Bus, and CARE/Paratransit vans, the news release said. A spokesperson said workers who collected fares were offered other jobs within the company.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Scientists have found a dead Asian giant hornet in Marysville, north of Seattle – the first so-called murder hornet discovered in the country this year, federal and state investigators said Wednesday. Entomologists from the state and U.S. agriculture departments said it’s the first confirmed report from Snohomish County and appears to be unrelated to the 2019 and 2020 findings of the hornets in Canada and Whatcom County, along the Canadian border, that gained widespread attention. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canada border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their stings are extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. The world’s largest hornet is much more of a threat to honeybees that are relied on to pollinate crops. They attack hives, destroying them in mere hours and decapitating bees in what scientists call their “slaughter phase.” How they got here from Asia is unclear, although it is suspected they travel on cargo ships. “Hitchhikers are a side effect of all the commerce we do globally,” said Sven Spichiger, an entomologist with the state Agriculture Department who is leading the fight to eradicate the hornets.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice’s nomination of a Republican Party operative to a public broadcasting oversight board has prompted concern about the appointee’s credentials and whether the GOP governor will use his political muscle to fill multiple expired seats. Members of the state Senate Confirmations Committee received notice Friday of the pending appointment of Greg Thomas to the state Educational Broadcasting Authority, which is the governing body of West Virginia Public Broadcasting, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. Senate Minority Leader Stephen Baldwin, D-Greenbrier County, said Monday that Thomas’ background doesn’t make him a good fit for the authority. The pending appointment “stood out like a sore thumb,” Baldwin said. “You’ve got an outwardly partisan political operative being nominated to a position that doesn’t call for that at all.” Thomas has worked for several GOP politicians, including the campaign of convicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship’s failed U.S. Senate run in 2018. He also works for the nonprofit group West Virginia Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state is on track to scrap a requirement that has been a singular rite of passage for generations: the behind-the-wheel road test for teenagers. The Legislature’s Republican-controlled joint finance committee last week approved the state Department of Transportation’s proposal to continue its program of waiving road tests for 16- and 17-year-olds who have completed all driver’s education requirements. If approved as part of the budget by Gov. Tony Evers, the current pilot program would become a permanent part of how the Department of Motor Vehicles allocates licenses beginning July 1. DOT first began to pilot the waivers in mid-May of last year, citing its desire to reduce interactions between its employees and members of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Department officials also said they hoped the waivers would allow DMV offices to focus on the backlog of adult driver’s tests that had accumulated amid the pandemic. Under state law, those over the age of 18 only require a passing multiple-choice knowledge test before taking the road test. The DMV has said these people cannot waive their road test because they are not required to complete a driver’s education course and behind-the-wheel training with an instructor.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Lawmakers are pursuing two possible hate crimes bills for next year’s legislative session. One bill to be drafted would require law enforcement to report hate crimes. The other would extend protections to more groups. “I want a starting point to move forward,” state Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, told other members of the Joint Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. At least 47 states have adopted hate crimes legislation since the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. National groups such as the Brennan Center for Justice do not classify Wyoming as having a hate crime law, though the American Civil Liberties Union does. The statute makes it a misdemeanor to deny anyone “life, liberty, pursuit of happiness or the necessities of life” due to their “race, color, sex, creed or national origin.” The statute does not require police to report hate crimes and does not protect all vulnerable populations, according to testimony at Tuesday’s hearing. Wyoming has recorded 13 hate crimes since 2015, but the number is believed to be underreported.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/17"}]}

On the West Coast, record-breaking rain and snowmelt in Washington and California are causing river flooding and avalanches. Across much of the South, dropping temperatures are causing icy road conditions that have led to massive backups and accidents in states like Kentucky, where a more than 20 car pile-up yesterday brought traffic to a halt. On the East coast, a fast-moving winter storm is expected to drop several inches of snow on New York, Massachusetts and parts of the mid-Atlantic this weekend. Forecasters say this will create even more disruptions, including school closures, flight cancellations and problems for emergency responders.\n\n2.

What began as demonstrations against rising fuel prices has grown to include larger, long-simmering political grievances. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, however, claims the increasingly violent conditions were caused by \"terrorists\" and \"specialists trained in ideological sabotage.\" Dozens of people have been killed in the violence . Tokayev has appealed to the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization for assistance. The unrest, which experts say is an inevitable consequence of a government ignoring the needs and pleas of its people, is also posing a problem for Russia -- which maintains close relations with Kazakhstan and relies on a spaceport there.\n\nJUST WATCHED Video shows Kazakh security forces use tear gas and stun grenades at protesters Replay More Videos ...

Police are investigating, but have yet to make any arrests.

Adults and adolescents have missed more than 37 million routine vaccinations, according to an analysis of insurance claims by Avalere, a health care consulting firm. Experts are stressing the importance of getting up to date as soon as possible as such widespread lapses in routine vaccinations could put even more strain on the health care system. In a related development, a new spinoff of the Omicron variant called BA.2 is also being talked about , but experts say there's no reason to panic as there's no indication it causes more severe symptoms or spreads more easily than the original strain of Omicron. Some are warning though that BA.2 is a \"stealth variant\" because it doesn't cause a certain signature on lab tests and can look like other variants on a first screen.\n\n4.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said yesterday that the \"bulk of\" the troops on alert were intended to bolster NATO's quick response force, but added they would be \"postured to be ready for any other contingencies as well.\" NATO announced yesterday that some member countries are putting forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to eastern Europe. Separately, the US is keeping a close eye on potential Russian cyberattacks , which the Department of Homeland Security warned could occur if Moscow perceives that a US or NATO response to a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine would threaten Russia's long-term national security.\n\n2.

Sitting alongside him was Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Damiba, who was introduced as the country's new leader. Damiba was recently promoted by Kabore to commander of the country's third military region, which is responsible for security in the capital city of Ouagadougou, according to Reuters.

Ukraine\n\nUrgent warnings of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine intensified again this weekend, with some US officials estimating the conflict could boil over as soon as this week. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said an invasion could happen \"any day now.\" President Joe Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in separate calls this weekend, telling both the US would respond \"decisively\" to any Russian escalation. The threat of a Russian invasion has been looming for weeks now, and the consequences could stretch across the world. In addition to the frightening prospect of mass violence in Eastern Europe, an invasion could create significant economic problems in the US and complicate an already fraught political landscape.\n\n2.

At least eight Westerners, including the one American, have been arrested by the Taliban in Afghanistan during different incidents in the last two months. This marks a sharp escalation of Taliban actions against Westerners living in the country, and reveals yet another ripple of the the US' completed military withdrawal from the country last August. The US National Security Council called the detentions \"unacceptable\" and said the US has been in contact with the Taliban as it urges the group to release the detainees.\n\n4.

That decision, combined with previous protests by Giuliani against the subpoena, created some concern that he may take the path of some other Trump loyalists who have defied subpoenas from the committee at risk of legal action.

A Russian anti-doping agency allowed the 15-year-old to continue working toward the Olympics after December's failed drug test despite concerns from international sports bodies, including the International Olympic Committee. The controversy has drawn comparisons to other doping scandals that have trickled out of the country in recent years.

Gun violence\n\nIn a passionate address to the nation yesterday, President Joe Biden called for stricter gun laws -- including a ban on assault weapons, tougher background check laws and a higher minimum age of purchase if lawmakers cannot agree on an outright ban. His plea to lawmakers comes as many Americans remain rattled by the recent deadly mass shootings in Oklahoma Texas and New York . \"How much more carnage are we willing to accept?\" Biden asked during his speech, demanding Republicans end their blockade of gun control votes. Both Biden and his advisers have suggested they have exhausted their options on executive action to address guns.

Mega Millions tickets – which cost $2 each – are sold in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nWhy shouldn’t you tell everyone?\n\nScammers.\n\n“Some of those scammers have falsely identified themselves as being affiliated with Mega Millions,” Mega Millions said. “These scams all have one thing in common: They try to trick you into sending them money or personal information by claiming that you have won a large lottery prize.”\n\nNo representative of Mega Millions would ever call, text, or email anyone about winning a prize, Mega Millions said.\n\nDON'T GET CONNED:Stay alert against financial scams\n\nWINNING:‘We did it again’: Maryland mom wins $100K jackpot for third time in five years\n\nAlso remember, \"no real lottery tells winners to put up their own money in order to collect a prize they have already won,\" it said.\n\nSteve Azoury, owner of Azoury Financial in Troy, Michigan, said he has advised many lottery winners, including a $181 million winner \"who said ‘If I didn’t know you before, I don’t want to know you now.’”\n\nIf you can’t tell everyone you won, what can, or should you do?\n\n“Get a tax attorney and a tax accountant right off the bat and then a financial advisor,” said Azoury. “They’ll work hand in hand to figure out the plan.”\n\nThe plan will include which payout option to choose:\n\nAn annuity option makes an initial annual payment followed by 29 annual payments. Each payment is 5% larger than the previous one.\n\nThe cash option is a one-time, lump-sum payment equal to all the cash in the Mega Millions jackpot prize pool.\n\nThe plan also should include a “fall guy,” Azoury said. “That’s the person or adviser who keeps you from giving loans to anybody, who tells people all the money’s tied up in investments, not available. We have nothing available to help you out and we’re not interested in your project.”\n\nREGULAR PAYOUTS:Are annuities safe in a recession? Sales are surging, here's what to know\n\nSLIM ODDS:7 things more likely to happen than winning the Powerball or Mega Millions lottery\n\nShould you take the lump sum or installment payments?\n\nThat decision depends on your goals, your age, and what lottery rules are for beneficiaries to continue receiving payments, or if you’d likely squander a lump sum.\n\nMark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt, recommends considering the following:\n\nSize of the lottery winning: That can serve as a guide to determining taxes you may owe and the financial security you can derive from it. If the amount is on the smaller side, a lump sum may simply be easier.\n\nCurrent and projected earnings: Consider your ability to earn money and tax rates over your lifetime.\n\nEASY GAMBLING:Online lottery tickets put Texans’ most-played games a touch away\n\nDIFFERENT GAMBLE:'He won the lottery': Ohio 13-year-old sells Mac Jones football card for $100,000\n\nHow much do you bring home?\n\nThat depends on how you decide to take your money and complex state laws.\n\nIf you win the Mega Millions lottery, you’ll likely be propelled into the highest federal tax bracket. Your state of residency and where you bought the winning ticket can greatly impact what you pay in state taxes.\n\nFor example, if you’re a California resident and purchase your ticket there, then you pay the 37% federal tax rate but are in luck because California doesn't tax lottery winnings, Steber said.\n\nNew York, though, has the highest tax rate on lottery winnings.\n\n.\n\nBut, if you’re a California resident on vacation in Rhode Island and decide to buy a ticket there, you’ll have to include your lottery winnings on your federal and California tax returns and file a nonresident Rhode Island tax return for your jackpot. You should claim a tax credit for the Rhode Island taxes on your California return so you won't be double-taxed on the same income in two states, he said.\n\n“This is where a tax professional really comes in handy,” Steber said. “State taxes can be very tricky.” (Just to show how complicated state taxes can be and why you really should enlist a professional, Steber originally said in this story California would tax your lottery winnings if you're a resident there. He has helped clarify this for our update.)\n\nTAXING:Senate Dems say boosting taxes on higher income earners will extend Medicare solvency\n\nA MILLION MISTAKE:Man claims $1 million Mega Millions prize from ticket he says was a 'mistake'\n\n\"How long does it take to get your money if you win the Mega Millions?\"\n\nOnce you claim the prize, it shouldn’t take too long, Azoury said. “Maybe a couple of weeks,” he said.\n\nRemember, most people won’t claim their winnings right away because they'll take time to set their plan. Claim periods vary by jurisdiction so people should check with the lottery in the state where the ticket was purchased to get the applicable claim period for that ticket.\n\nMega Millions claim periods range from 90 days to one year from the draw date, the lottery said.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

It puts the federal funds rate – which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans – at a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, close to the Fed’s 2.5% long-run, or neutral rate. In recent months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank must “move expeditiously” to that neutral level and then likely beyond it to cool the economy and bring inflation under control.

One local Nebraska newspaper reports that tickets sold at a rate of about 400 a minute on Friday. In California, the lottery Thursday sold 5.7 million during the first half of the day. Mega Millions tickets can be purchased in 44 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThere were also no winners in Saturday's $476.7 million Powerball jackpot, ratcheting up the next jackpot Wednesday to $620 million, the lottery said.\n\nIf it seems that the lines have gotten longer with every drawing or that jackpots have exploded in growth lately – that's because they have.\n\nWith the next Mega Millions drawing on Tuesday at 11 p.m. ET, here is a look behind the numbers.\n\nWhy have jackpots gotten so big?\n\nIt was all by design.\n\nLottery officials began tinkering with the odds in 2015 to lessen the chance of winning a jackpot, which in turn increased the opportunity for top prizes to reach exorbitant levels. As the money grows to those high figures, an increasing number of skeptics and first-time players are swayed to get in on the action.\n\nPowerball was the first to try out the new formula when it changed the potential number of combinations three years ago. That change reduced the odds of winning from one in 175 million to one in 292 million.\n\nMega Millions, which has been around since 1996, followed suit with a similar move in October 2017, worsening the odds from one in 259 million to one in 302 million. Mega Millions also doubled the entry ticket price from $1 to $2 and has seen three of its six-ever largest payouts since making the changes.\n\nAs the pot grows, people are more likely to buy a greater number of tickets. The process happens semi-weekly until one or more people guess the winning combination.\n\n“I’m surprised that no one won the last round, honestly,\" said Chris O’Byrne, a professor of management information at San Diego State University, referring to Friday's drawing.\n\n\"There were over 800 million ticket purchases. ... It's pretty shocking that not one person had the exact combination.”\n\nO'Byrne said he believes Tuesday's drawing will almost certainly yield one or more winners.\n\nHow can I increase my odds of winning?\n\nYou could buy a ticket with each of the possible six-number combinations. That is, if you can afford it.\n\n“If you wanted to guarantee yourself a win, it would cost you around 600 million bucks,” O'Byrne said. “Even if you won, you could have to split the winnings with someone else who guesses the right numbers. So, good luck doing that.”\n\nDoes that mean I shouldn't play?\n\nIt depends on what you're playing for, O'Byrne said. \"You have a better shot of flipping a coin and having it land on heads 28 times in a row than to win.\"\n\nBut if you are getting something out of it – even if it's just a fantasy – that might be reason enough to join those long lines.\n\n\"I'm investing $2 in the ability to dream about how I would spend the money until Tuesday night. It's a cheap price to pay for that,\" O'Byrne said. \"Also, the potential return on your $2 at this point is better than when the lottery started off at $40 million. So there's that.\"\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/07/29/kentucky-flooding-monkeypox-vaccines-beyonce-5-things-know-friday/10151482002/", "title": "Kentucky flooding, monkeypox vaccines, Beyoncé': 5 things to know ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFlooding in Kentucky leaves at least 8 people dead\n\nMore rain is expected in Kentucky after heavy downpours caused massive flooding across the eastern part of the state, leaving at least eight people dead Thursday.

As of Wednesday, over 20,000 cases of monkeypox had been detected globally in 77 countries, the CDC's Jennifer McQuiston said. U.S. health officials are still weighing whether to call the outbreak a public health emergency, a move that would free up more resources.\n\nDrawing for $1.1 billion Mega Millions jackpot, the nation's 3rd largest\n\nOne of the nation’s biggest lottery prizes got a little bigger Thursday as the Mega Millions jackpot increased to an estimated $1.1 billion.

The odds of winning the largest prize in U.S. lottery history were 1 in 292.2 million.\n\n\"That just shows the total randomness of Powerball,\" Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery, told NBC News'Weekend Today on Sunday. \"At our peak last night, we were selling more than $1.2 million in Powerball tickets every single minute.\"\n\nRoughly speaking, the chances of picking the right combination of numbers is like flipping a coin and getting heads 28 times in a row, according to Jeffrey Miecznikowski, an associate professor of biostatistics at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\n“It’s very unlikely,” said Miecznikowski, who doesn't play Powerball himself.\n\nOdds are, you won't like this Powerball story\n\nThe odds of winning are so small that it’s hard to conceptualize it. A person is more likely to get struck by lightning or bitten by a shark, but Miecznikowski says most people don’t know someone personally who has had either of those things happen.\n\nPicking all the winners in the 64-team NCAA basketball tournament is harder — much harder — than guessing the right Powerball numbers, he said.\n\nIt would be about 1 billion times harder to pick all the winning teams randomly, Miecznikowski said. It would still be 500 times more difficult to fill out a bracket by allowing some strategy, such as knowing that a No. 16 seed hasn’t beaten a No. 1 seed, he said.\n\nSaturday's winning numbers were 16-19-32-34-57 and Powerball number 13. Miecznikowski speculated that one reason for no winner might be the Powerball number 13, which players who chose their own numbers might have avoided as unlucky.\n\nThe latest jackpot estimate of $1.3 billion would be twice as large as the previous biggest U.S. lottery prize from March 30, 2012, when Mega Millions paid $656 million for three tickets from Kansas, Illinois and Maryland. The total would also more than double the $590.5 million that Powerball paid May 18, 2013, for one ticket in Florida.\n\nWhile the $1.3 billion is by far the largest ever up for grabs in North America, Spain's latest elGordo lottery, or \"The Fat One,\" had a prize pool of $2.4 billion prize. But it was awarded to thousands of ticketholders, elGordo's website said. Powerball's riches could go to a single ticketholder.\n\nThe huge jackpot is creating an unforeseen advertising problem in several states: many electronic billboards promoting Powerball aren't configured to display billion-dollar prizes, since the phrase \"MILLION\" is affixed to the signs, the director of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency toldThe Baltimore Sun.\n\nThat issue might have seemed unimaginable last summer as Powerball sales declined due to competition from casinos and instant scratch-off games — as well as a phenomenon industry insiders call \"jackpot fatigue,\" in which players ignore lotteries until the prize grows astronomically.\n\nThe 10 biggest U.S. lottery jackpots\n\nIn October, Powerball officials tweaked the game's \"matrix,\" making it harder to win the grand prize, The Sun reported. The chances of winning the biggest prize shrank from 1 in 175 million to 1 in 292 million. But the odds of winning any prize grew from 1 in 32 to 1 in 25.\n\nDespite the lack of an overall winner, Powerball's Saturday drawing still had nearly $160 million in smaller prizes. Among them were $2 million prizes for tickets sold in Connecticut and Texas. And $1 million tickets were sold in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia.\n\nIn Arizona, two tickets paid out $1 million each, said the Arizona State Lottery. In addition to the two millionaires, there was one $150,000 and fifteen $50,000 winners in the state after Saturday night's drawing, The Arizona Republicreported. More than 448,000 Arizona tickets had winning combinations, totaling $4.8 million in cash prizes, lottery officials said.\n\nPowerball is still generating frenzied sales of the $2 tickets for the Wednesday drawing.\n\nPatti McFadden of Fort Myers, Fla., a lottery-playing veteran, said before Saturday's drawing that she visited multiple Powerball sellers to improve her chances.\n\n$900M Powerball Jackpot: What you can and can't buy\n\nThe whopping jackpot started out Nov. 4 at a mere $40 million. Drawing after drawing, there has been no winner — and the pot, which has rolled over 18 times, has swollen to eye-popping levels. A winner Saturday night would have been a record.\n\nWinners of the top prize are paid in 30 annual installments or as a one-time, lump-sum payment.

Coronavirus\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to begin distributing 400 million free N95 masks to Americans this week, the latest federal step aimed at reining in the spread of Covid-19. The masks -- which are coming from the Strategic National Stockpile -- will be made available at a number of local pharmacies and community health centers . A White House official described the distribution as \"the largest deployment of personal protective equipment in US history.\" The huge allotment amounts to more than half of the 750 million N95 masks currently stored in the reserve, a figure that tripled over the last year as the administration sought to boost reserves. The move comes as the US grapples with an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases due to the Omicron variant.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nThe US is amplifying calls for Russia to cease its aggressive actions along the Ukrainian border, where more than 100,000 troops have been amassed. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned yesterday that there would be a severe response by the US and its allies if \" a single additional Russian force \" enters Ukraine in an aggressive way. In preparation for a possible invasion, the US sent Ukraine a second weapons supply shipment of close to 200,000 pounds of lethal aid. Some political leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, are urging the US and its allies to penalize Moscow with sanctions now before any lives are lost. The US, however, has shown unwillingness to punish Russia preemptively. The Biden administration and its NATO allies are instead focused on bolstering troop levels in the region to support Eastern European and Baltic allies.\n\nJUST WATCHED Blinken: 'Single additional Russian force' in Ukraine would trigger sanctions Replay More Videos ...

Sinema -- who started her political career as a progressive -- has been a target on the left during Biden's administration for her stances. Sinema and Sen.

Separately, Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, acknowledged late last week that he was part of the effort to prop up so-called \"alternate electors\" to support Trump in key states. Former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani supervised that effort, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the scheme . It involved helping pro-Trump electors access state Capitol buildings, drafting language for fake electoral certificates to send to the federal government, and finding replacements for electors who refused to go along with the plot.\n\nJUST WATCHED January 6 committee chairman says panel is speaking with Barr Replay More Videos ...

Ukraine\n\nA Russian airstrike last night hit an apartment building in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, killing at least 21 people -- including two children. Sumy has been under sustained attacks in recent days, and now Ukraine and Russia have agreed on one evacuation route so Ukrainians can safely leave the region. Several previous attempts to evacuate civilians failed earlier this week, with Western leaders accusing Russian forces of continuing to target pre-approved safe routes. The Biden administration is emphasizing that American troops won't engage directly with Russian forces, and NATO members have also pushed back on calls for a no-fly zone in Ukraine, warning that it could lead to a \"full-fledged war in Europe.\" But things could swiftly change if Moscow's attack spills into a NATO member nation -- a move that would trigger the alliance's Article 5 -- the principle that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all members. Follow CNN's full coverage of Russia's attack on Ukraine here\n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nThe global Covid-19 death toll surpassed 6 million yesterday , according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has reported more Covid-19 deaths than any other country -- about 960,000 total -- but the CDC estimates that the actual figure is much higher. Separately, the White House is now rolling out its test-to-treat program , and more than 1,000 in-pharmacy clinics have registered to receive shipments of Covid-19 antiviral medications. Meanwhile in Florida, health officials declared the state will soon issue guidance urging parents not to vaccinate their children. The move would make Florida the first state to break from CDC guidance on Covid-19 vaccines for kids, which are recommended for those ages 5 and up.\n\n3. School shooting\n\nOne teenager is dead and two remain hospitalized after a shooting yesterday outside a high school in Des Moines, Iowa. Two of the three victims were students at the school. The gunfire appeared to have come from a passing vehicle, police said. Potential suspects have been detained, but no charges have been filed as police continue their investigation. The incident is at least the 13th shooting at an American campus with K-12 students in 2022, according to a CNN tally . The school is closed today and grief counselors will be available for students and staff for the remainder of the week.\n\n4. Extreme weather\n\nMore than 130,000 homes and businesses in the Northeast were without power this morning after a series of strong storms brought heavy rain and damaging winds to the region. Approximately 65 million people from the mountains of North Carolina to Cape Cod -- including Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York -- were under wind advisories overnight as forecasters warned gusts of up to 50 mph were possible, raising the potential for tree damage and dangerous road conditions. Hail was also falling in some areas, though the severe conditions that spawned deadly tornadoes over the weekend have faded. On Saturday, seven people were killed in a series of tornadoes that ripped through multiple counties near Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n5. LGBTQ rights\n\nFlorida's state Senate is set to consider the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill this week amid a wave of student protests and walkouts. The bill would effectively ban teachers from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms for young students. LGBTQ advocates say the measure would lead to further stigmatization of gay, lesbian and transgender children. More than 500 students participated in a massive walkout yesterday at a high school in Orange County, Florida, following similar protests at other schools last week. Separately, Disney's CEO said the company, which employs over 75,000 in Florida, is committed to inclusivity -- but would not publicly condemn the controversial bill . The bill passed the Florida House of Representatives in February and now heads to the Republican-controlled Senate, which could set the stage for a final vote as soon as today.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Absolutely': Pete Buttigieg on whether 'Don't Say Gay' bill is dangerous Replay More Videos ...

January 6\n\nThe chairman of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol told reporters that the panel won't criminally refer former President Donald Trump or others to the Justice Department. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson's statement on Monday drew quick reactions from other members of the committee, revealing the panel is split over how to handle potential criminal referrals of Trump and his associates for prosecution. In Monday's hearing , Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren laid out evidence that Trump knew he had lost the 2020 election, was told he had lost on dozens of occasions, and not only refused to accept it but actively pushed conspiracy theories and other false claims that he knew were wrong to stir up his party's base. In response, Trump lashed out in a 12-page statement trashing the committee's work.\n\n2. Stocks\n\nStocks plunged again Monday, officially pushing the S&P 500 into bear market territory -- which happens when stocks close down 20% or more from their most recent high. In short, stocks are tumbling due to inflation and the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame it, experts say. One month ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank was not \"actively considering\" raising interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to fight inflation, but Wall Street is now worried that Powell may have to change his tune. The S&P 500, the broadest measure of Wall Street, is down more than 21% from its high reached in early January -- and cryptocurrencies have also joined the meltdown.

Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- the most conservative Democrat in the Senate -- defended the newly reached bipartisan agreement on Monday, adding it takes \"no rights away, no privileges away\" from gun owners.

Ukraine\n\nAs Ukrainian forces aggressively fight to take back their territory , President Joe Biden will depart for Europe today on one of the highest-stakes presidential trips in recent memory to rally the West at a pivotal moment for Ukraine -- and his presidency. At the emergency summits in Brussels, US and NATO allies will focus on ways to continue cracking down on Russia while providing support to Ukraine. For Biden, the talks are also a venue to demonstrate the foreign policy credentials he promised as a candidate, when he vowed to restore American leadership and repair broken alliances. While there, Biden is expected to announce additional sanctions on Russia, but so far, the measures seem to have done little to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia is now refusing to rule out the possibility of using nuclear weapons , and their troops have begun firing on the city of Mariupol from ships in the Sea of Azov , according to a senior US defense official.\n\n2. Supreme Court\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a third day of confirmation hearings today for Biden's Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Facing Republican skepticism , Jackson -- who currently sits on DC's federal appellate court -- defended her judicial record yesterday as she answered questions from lawmakers and was grilled on some sentencing decisions. Jackson also outlined what she described as her \"methodology\" for approaching cases . As long as Senate Democrats keep their caucus unified behind Jackson, they will have the 50 votes they need for her confirmation. If confirmed, Jackson will fill Justice Stephen Breyer's upcoming vacancy and become the first Black woman to serve on the nation's highest court.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lindsey Graham grills Ketanji Brown Jackson over defending Guantanamo detainees Replay More Videos ...

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state and local agencies are working together to assess the damage.

This comes as millions of Americans -- not just those with weakened immune systems -- are wondering about their protection after enduring a winter of booster shots and Omicron infections. Some doctors currently use tests that measure antibodies as a way to check immune protection in people who are immunocompromised. But not all antibodies are created the same. Of all the antibodies that the body may make after infection or vaccination, only a fraction can actively prevent infection. About 95% of Americans 16 and older have antibodies against Covid-19 as of December, according to recent data from the CDC .

Earlier this month, Disney CEO Bob Chapek spoke about the bill in a note to employees but refused to directly condemn it publicly . Instead, Chapek said Disney's focus on continuing to tell \"diverse stories\" is a more appropriate response to the legislation, which prohibits teachers from discussing LGBTQ+ issues with children in third grade and below.

Ukraine\n\nFinland's president and prime minister have announced their support for joining NATO , moving the Nordic nation -- which shares an 800-mile border with Russia -- one step closer to membership of the US-led military alliance. Since the end of World War II, Finland has been militarily non-aligned and neutral to avoid provoking Russia. The war in Ukraine, however, has sufficiently changed the calculation, so that joining NATO now seems the best way forward, regardless of what Russia's reaction might be . It is also expected that Sweden, Finland's neighbor to the west, will soon announce its intention to join the alliance. Russia has warned both countries against joining NATO, saying there would be consequences.

The final tally was 49 to 51, with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia joining with Republicans to vote against the measure and stop it from advancing. President Joe Biden lashed out at Senate Republicans yesterday for blocking the passage of the Women's Health Protection Act. \"This failure to act comes at a time when women's constitutional rights are under unprecedented attack -- and it runs counter to the will of the majority of American people,\" Biden said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Abortion rights supporters chant outside Supreme Court Justices' homes Replay More Videos ...

Prices still increased, but at a slower pace than in previous months. The Consumer Price Index was up 8.3% in the 12 months ended in April, slightly higher than economists had predicted, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said yesterday . It was a decrease from the 8.5% recorded in March, which had been the highest level in more than 40 years. Yesterday's data suggests that the inflation peak is behind us, just as economists, the Federal Reserve, the White House and the American people hoped. But some economists say the war in Ukraine, bad weather, and renewed Covid-related lockdowns in China will likely keep prices elevated over the summer. The cost of food also continued to rise in the last 12 months, and the highest increases were seen among some grocery staples such as eggs, milk, citrus fruits and margarine.\n\nJUST WATCHED Inflation dips, but still high Replay More Videos ...

Overdose deaths have been on the rise for years in the US, but surged amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which accelerated trends that were already heading in the wrong direction. Experts say that reversing course will require concentrated efforts -- and it will take time, both strategically and ideologically.\n\nJUST WATCHED They bring their own illegal drugs.

Several recording artists highlighted by the the former president also weighed in.\n\n\"WE’RE FRIENDS NOW I DONT MAKE THE RULES!!!\" Lizzo tweeted to Obama.\n\nGoldLink, an underground rapper from Washington, D.C., tweeted, \"Thank You, Mr. President.\"\n\nLizzo seems to be popular among several 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls — Kirsten Gillibrand has used \"Good As Hell\" as her walkout song at some rallies, and shared a video of her dancing to the song on her campaign bus.

They've released just two singles so far — including the brooding and brilliant \"Shrap.nel\" — but it's the most absorbing music either of them has made to date.

Make sure you're vaccinated, and make sure your kids wear masks.\n\nSept. 3\n\nTop headliner: Chance The Rapper\n\nThe underwhelming 2019 album \"The Big Day\" was a bit of a setback, but Chance The Rapper's new concert film \"Magnificent Coloring Book\" is a potent reminder of how boisterous his live shows can be. Summerfest will be the only place Chance will perform for an audience in 2021; he's hinted there'll be special guests. (Past collaborator and Milwaukee native Grace Weber, and his brother Taylor Bennett, are playing the Big Gig earlier in the day, so expect them to show up.) (7:30 p.m., American Family Insurance Amphitheater)\n\nBest discovery: Yola\n\nAt Farm Aid 2019 at Alpine Valley Music Theatre, on a bill including legends Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt and Neil Young, no one had a more stunning voice than English artist Yola. And she has one of the most beautiful voices you're going to hear at the Big Gig this year, with a new '60s-soul-inspired album, \"Stand for Myself,\" that uses her gift to great effect. (4 p.m., BMO Harris Pavilion)\n\nLocal pick: Grace Weber\n\nWorking with Chance The Rapper's creative team the Social Experiment, and on one song with Chance himself, the Milwaukee native made by far the finest album of her career with the empowering \"A Beautiful Space,\" and one of the most stirring R&B albums in recent memory. (3:30 p.m., Miller Lite Oasis)\n\nSept. 4\n\nEven with a revered catalog 10 albums deep, the alt-country band reached new peaks 20 years into its career with its politically charged 11th full-length release \"American Bandit\" in 2016, and followed it up with two more albums, \"The Unraveling\" and \"The New OK,\" in that same vein. (8 p.m., Johnson Controls World Sound Stage)\n\nBest discovery: Cannons\n\nCannons' career blasted off when its song \"Fire For You,\" led by Michelle Joy's cool, breathy vocals, landed a crucial placement on the hit Netflix series \"Never Have I Ever.\" The dreamy album it came from, 2019's \"Shadows,\" suggests the group is no one-hit wonder, although you can expect to hear its take on other stars' hits from the new EP \"Covers by Cannons.\" (4 p.m., Miller Lite Oasis)\n\nWhen storms raged through Summerfest in 2019, a huge crowd took shelter at the Johnson Controls World Sound Stage, where Zed Kenzo undoubtedly won over a whole bunch of new fans. A singular voice in hip-hop — not just locally, but nationally — Kenzo is going to have an even bigger crowd for her encore Summerfest appearance, as the direct support for Flo Rida. (8 p.m., Miller Lite Oasis)\n\nSept. 9\n\nTop headliner: Chris Stapleton\n\nThe veteran singer-songwriter shook up Nashville with “Traveller” in 2015, becoming the embodiment of traditional country music storytelling, soul and grit in our modern times. But instead of shrinking under the glare of that spotlight, he’s stuck to his guns and released three more equally solid albums — last year’s “Starting Over” being the latest — filling up his trophy case in the process. Make sure you arrive early for Milwaukee Bucks superfan Sheryl Crow’s opening set. (7:30 p.m., American Family Insurance Amphitheater\n\nBest discovery: Them Coulee Boys\n\nAt the risk of overwhelming the Uline Warehouse stage, every person with a ticket to Stapleton at the amphitheater should arrive early and check out these remarkable roots rockers from Eau Claire, who resemble the heart and soul of their deepest influence the Avett Brothers, and worked with Grammy-winning Bon Iver producer Brian Joseph on their nourishing new album “Namesake.” (6:30 p.m., Uline Warehouse)\n\nLocal pick: Peter Mulvey and SistaStrings\n\nYou’d be hard pressed to find a Milwaukee-born songwriter penning such smart and heartfelt lyrics as Peter Mulvey. His latest album was produced by Ani Difranco, who signed him to her record label. Singers and string players the Ross sisters Chauntee and Monique (aka SistaStrings) add grandeur and intimacy to his material. Mulvey is in Boston now, and the sisters are in Nashville, so don’t miss this rare opportunity to see them together. (6:45 p.m., Johnson Controls World Sound Stage)\n\nSept. 10\n\nTop headliner: Wilco\n\nEven though Wilco isn’t too far away in Chicago, the band has been on Summerfest’s wish list for years. Finally, they’re playing the Big Gig, bringing with them one of the most esteemed indie-rock catalogs of the 21st century, recently enhanced by the weathered protest album “Ode to Joy.\" (10 p.m., Miller Lite Oasis)\n\nBest discovery: Torres\n\nTorres’ “Silver Tongue” was one of the most intriguing albums of last year — with the misfortune of coming out shortly before the pandemic stifled word of mouth. But the Brooklyn-based indie rocker born Mackenzie Scott simply regrouped and returned last month with an even bolder album “Thirstier.” Fans of Phoebe Bridgers and early St. Vincent won’t be able to get enough of it. (6:45 p.m., Johnson Controls World Sound Stage)\n\nLocal pick: Trapper Schoepp\n\nWhat does a musician do after completing a Bob Dylan song with his approval? In Schoepp’s case, go back to proving why one of the greatest songwriters of all time gave you his blessing. That's exactly what the Milwaukee songwriter has done with his latest album “May Day.” (8 p.m., Miller Lite Oasis)\n\nSept. 11\n\nTop headliner: Kesha\n\nProcessing the pain of alleged abuse and legal challenges from former producer Dr. Luke on the 2017 comeback album “Rainbow” and its heart-shattering #MeToo anthem “Praying,” Kesha returned to her hard-partying ways on last year’s “High Road.” It's a fitting, liberating soundtrack as we return to some sense of normalcy from the pandemic. (10 p.m., BMO Harris Pavilion)\n\nBest discovery: The Weather Station\n\nWith the opening track \"Robber\" on The Weather Station's \"Ignorance\" — currently the sixth best-reviewed album of the year so far, according to Metacritic — Canadian singer-songwriter Tamara Lindeman eschews her traditional folk sound by adding some bass-stirring grooves and abstract jazz touches. It's mesmerizing hearing it through headphones; seeing it live should be electrifying. (8 p.m., Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard)\n\nLocal pick: Klassik\n\nWith an unbridled ambition evident from his first album 10 years ago, Milwaukee singer and rapper Klassik has eclipsed the loftiest of expectations as a songwriter — 2019's \"Quiet\" is a masterclass in production and mood — and with his one-of-a-kind, one-man show. (6:45 p.m., Johnson Controls World Sound Stage)\n\nSept. 16\n\nTop headliner: Megan Thee Stallion\n\nNo new artist dominated music — nay, the pop culture universe — like Megan Thee Stallion in 2020, with the one-two punch of \"Savage\" (and its remix with Beyoncé) and \"WAP\" with Cardi B, two explosive anthems about female autonomy that provided levity and empowerment during a difficult time. She's playing practically all the U.S. festivals this year, but Summerfest is one of her few headlining slots. Make sure to arrive early for Polo G, who has topped both the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 albums chart this year. (7:30 p.m., American Family Insurance Amphitheater)\n\nBest discovery: Masked Wolf\n\nFormer president and eclectic music fan Barack Obama included the Greek-Australian rapper's \"Astronaut in the Ocean\" on his summer Spotify playlist this year. While Wolf may not have another hit the size of that TikTok-fueled mega hit on the horizon, he's proven he has a good ear for catchy hip-hop-flavored pop hooks. (4 p.m., Generac Power Stage)\n\nLocal pick: Caley Conway\n\nA superb addition to Field Report, one of Milwaukee's most consistently accomplished bands this past decade, the folk-leaning Conway sharpened her own songwriting skills during the pandemic. She embraced more elements of jazz and post-rock to complement her sharp vocals and guitar skills on this spring's \"Bliss or Bust\" EP, which handily evoked the former. (6:45 p.m., Johnson Controls World Sound Stage)\n\nSept. 17\n\nTop headliner: Run The Jewels\n\nDays after George Floyd's horrific murder and the rise of Black Lives Matter protests around the world, Run The Jewels dropped its fourth album, which became in part the soundtrack for the movement. Killer Mike and El-P's rallying cries against injustice — on \"RTJ4\" and their previous albums — are as relevant as ever, and are bound to draw some of the largest crowds to a grounds stage this year. (10 p.m., Generac Power Stage)\n\nBest discovery: Claud\n\nHailing none-too-far from Milwaukee in Highland Park, Illinois, Claud caught the attention of Phoebe Bridgers, who made the bedroom pop artist the first signee of her record label Saddest Factory. The label released Claud's debut album \"Super Monster,\" led by heart-on-the-sleeve singles like \"Wish You Were Gay\" and \"Miss You.\" (8 p.m., Miller Lite Oasis)\n\nLocal pick: Nora Collins\n\nArguably the hardest-working teenager and early twenty-something musician in Milwaukee when she lived here — she did 18 sets at Summerfest 2016 before landing main-stage slots in subsequent years — the country singer-songwriter took her talents to Nashville six years ago. The move is paying off with her glossy radio-ready tunes like the new \"Neon Healing.\" (6 p.m., UScellular Connection Stage)\n\nSept. 18\n\nGuns N' Roses' initial reunion run bringing the once-estranged Axl Rose and Slash back together was appropriately dubbed the \"Not In This Lifetime Tour.\" But Guns N' Roses weren't just back; they were a better live act than ever, erasing the memory of erratic performances earlier in their career with massive three-hour-plus sets. Their 2017 show was one of the best in Milwaukee that year, and this one's gonna be another contender. (6 p.m., American Family Insurance Amphitheater)\n\nBest discovery: Mammoth WVH\n\nGuns N' Roses is gonna give you a long show, but it's still worth showing up early for one of the debut performances for Wolfgang Van Halen's new rock project, who is carrying on his father Eddie Van Halen's guitar-worship legacy proudly. He also paid touching homage to his father after his passing last year with moving debut single \"Distance.\" (6 p.m., American Family Insurance Amphitheater)\n\nAs co-writer, guitarist and keyboardist for Talking Heads — to say nothing of his time in Modern Lovers or his production work for No Doubt, Violent Femmes and others — Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Jerry Harrison is one of the most accomplished musicians to come from Milwaukee. He doesn't play many concerts these days, but here's a homecoming show, with former Head collaborator Adrian Belew and funk band Turkuaz, who together will perform the Heads' classic \"Remain in Light\" album live front to back.

And with Labor Day marking the unofficial end of the season on Monday, it’s time to look back at the hits that dominated summer 2017 — and pit them against each other for a definitive ranking.\n\nWondering why some summertime hits didn't make the list? The 20 songs listed below had the longest reigns on Billboard’s songs of summer chart, which left out favorites like Cardi B's Bodak Yellow and new songs like Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do.\n\nJudgement time!\n\n20. Say You Won't Let Go, James Arthur\n\nPerhaps you were among the many listeners touched by Arthur’s British accent and acoustic-guitar strumming. We, on the other hand, couldn’t get past his mildly creepy opening verse where the object of Arthur’s affections pukes, smiles and asks him to stay over.\n\n19. That's What I Like, Bruno Mars\n\nAt this point, most songs-of-summer contenders have been overplayed to the point of delirium. But few tracks feel as weary as That's What I Like, the sonic equivalent of massaging your brain with a cheese grater.\n\n18. Believer, Imagine Dragons\n\nNot only are we subjected to hearing an Imagine Dragons song in seemingly every single movie trailer, but Believer also turned into a radio hit this summer, the latest ploddingly rousing track from a band whose songs continue to be near-indistinguishable from one another.\n\n17. There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back, Shawn Mendes\n\nAnother faceless pop hit that could've been performed by any number of other artists on this list, Mendes' Energizer Bunny of a track is earnest to the point of embarrassing, destined to live on via upbeat commercials and spin class soundtracks.\n\n16. Issues, Julia Michaels\n\nMichaels is legitimately an artist to root for, a pop songwriter who stepped out of the shadows and landed a breakout solo hit. Despite its sugar-headache sweetness, Issues is a promising start for Michaels, even if the track has, er, problems.\n\n15. Shape Of You, Ed Sheeran\n\nThere's something annoyingly hypnotic about Shape of You, the kind of song you'll be absentmindedly humming for days before realizing how deep it's seeped into your psyche. A new crop of remixes have breathed new life into Sheeran's megahit, though there's not much that can help its chorus' audaciously bad grammar: \"I'm in love with the shape of you / We push and pull like a magnet do.\"\n\n14. Unforgettable, French Montana featuring Swae Lee\n\nFrench Montana gets bonus points for snagging Rae Sremmurd's Swae Lee for the chorus' vocals, but unfortunately, thanks to the glut of similar, vaguely-tropical songs that arrived this summer, this track may not be as enduring as its title promises.\n\n13. Attention, Charlie Puth\n\nLike Puth's weirdly magnetic We Don't Talk Anymore, Attention is better than it deserves to be, considering the entire song is basically Kanye West and Jay Z's No Church in the Wild beat with Puth's paper-thin vocals on top. Still, for Kanye karaoke, it's not bad.\n\n12. Something Just Like This, The Chainsmokers & Coldplay\n\nThe Chainsmokers are 2017's kings of soullessly-thumping background music. Yes, Something Just Like This is easily among their best-ever tracks, largely thanks to Chris Martin's presence, his vocals elevating the song to something that's at least distinctive and listenable.\n\n11. Stay, Zedd & Alessia Cara\n\nStay is the kind of shamelessly dramatic, swing-for-the-rafters EDM that sounds laughably bombastic in most settings — but under dark enough cover, with enough adrenaline (or booze) in the listener's bloodstream, has the potential to be magnetic. And while it's currently in vogue to hate on Taylor Swift, it's worth noting that Zedd's track is questionably similar to 1989's All You Had To Do Was Stay...but worse.\n\n10. Body Like a Back Road, Sam Hunt\n\nHunt boasting about \"drivin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in a hurry\" may give us secondhand road rage, but once we figured out that Hunt calling someone's \"body like a back road\" was a compliment and not a comment on their personal hygiene, the track became a lot more enjoyable.\n\n9. It Ain't Me, Kygo and Selena Gomez\n\nNobody ever said songs of the summer had to be upbeat, and few tracks on this list are as \"openly weeping in the club\" depressing as It Ain't Me, another one of Kygo's trop-house sound-alikes that gets its sting from Selena Gomez' quietly devastating performance.\n\n8. I'm The One, DJ Khaled featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance The Rapper & Lil Wayne\n\nI'm the One is a maddeningly obvious hit, a parade of 2017's favorite artists that's seemingly reverse-engineered for radio success. And yet this dumb song, with its ice cream truck jingle of a chorus and Chance's winking verse, still makes us sing along, even when we hate ourselves for it.\n\n7. Mask Off, Future\n\nRap flutes are easily the year's most inscrutable hip hop trend, and Mask Off is its definitive song. Even Future's prescription pill-happy chorus wasn't enough to deter its popularity, thanks to its infectious sample that inspired the year's purest meme — the #maskoffchallenge, featuring kids wailing away at the song on their flutes, violins and other instruments of choice.\n\n6. Congratulations, Post Malone featuring Quavo\n\n2017 was one never-ending Quavo guest verse, and his presence is felt heavy here, a woozy victory parade full of Instagram bio-ready lyrics that deservedly earned Post Malone his biggest hit yet.\n\n5. Redbone, Childish Gambino\n\nAmong Donald Glover's many 2017 wins was his first proper hit song, which he landed by making Redbone sound like nothing else on pop radio right now, a slice of vintage soul with pitched-up vocals rendering his falsetto completely unrecognizable. But for an artist whose music has a tendency toward self-indulgence, going incognito was exactly what Glover needed.\n\n4. XO TOUR Llif3, Lil Uzi Vert\n\nXO TOUR Llif3 won the VMAs’ song-of-summer award, and in a year that feels like its foundation is crumbling under us, it’s fitting that MTV’s frothy summertime category was won by an emo-pop track with the chorus “Push me to the edge / all my friends are dead,\" from hip hop's straight-outta-Hot Topic personality Lil Uzi Vert.\n\nDespacito, Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber\n\nYes, it’s everywhere. And overplayed. And, thanks to Justin Bieber and his “burrito” lyrics-flubbing, arguably problematic. And yet, much has been written about its flawless construction, how each track continually builds on the last one, how the subtle minor keys in its chord progression give the song its uniquely yearning quality. Sorry, everyone, but the song still rules.\n\n2. Humble, Kendrick Lamar\n\nSyrup sandwiches, Obama pagers, Kool-Aid for the analysts, that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk — with everything going wrong in the world today, at least we've progressed enough as a society that Kendrick Lamar's Humble, a vividly-imagined song from arguably the greatest rapper of his generation, can rule the radio all summer.\n\n1. Wild Thoughts, DJ Khaled Featuring Rihanna & Bryson Tiller\n\nDespacito, with its 16-week chart-topping run, has a lock on 2017's official song-of-the-summer title, with Humble likely to go down as the critical favorite. And then, there's Wild Thoughts, the true victor of 2017's best summertime song, blessed with the same golden Rihanna touch that made last summer's This Is What You Came For so electric.\n\nYet, the best songs of summer don't take themselves too seriously. Wild Thoughts tempers Rihanna's lusty presence with silly lyrics and an endearingly familiar Santana sample, giving the track the same kind of levity that's made other historic summertime favorites, from Nelly's Hot in Herre to Carly Rae Jepsen's Call Me Maybe, so much fun.\n\nAnd even after a million and one listens, Bryson Tiller’s Bobby Boucher line still, unintentionally, makes us laugh.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/08/13/beyonce-black-is-king-burna-boy-davido-african-artists-listen/3343901001/", "title": "Liked Beyoncé's 'Black is King'? 10 African artists for your playlist ...", "text": "Beyoncé blessed us with \"Black is King\" and just left us hanging. What are we supposed to do with our lives now, Bey?!\n\nThe companion piece to \"The Lion King: The Gift” soundtrack gave us big African vibes. From the Nigerian and Ghanaian backdrops to the Afrofusion sounds and the choreography with hints of Gwara Gwara and Zanku, \"Black is King\" was a celebration of Pan-African culture.\n\nIf you want to keep that same energy, but have grown tired of having \"The Gift\" on repeat (as much as we all love Beyoncé, there are only so many times we can replay \"MOOD 4 EVA\"), here are 10 African artists you should add to your playlist.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list, as the continent is overflowing with talented artists, but it's a start to get you on your way to enriching your music library with a bit of African music.\n\nNow go forth and Gbese!\n\nTiwa Savage\n\nThink of Tiwa Savage as the Beyoncé of Nigeria – she was featured on Queen Bey's song \"Keys to the Kingdom,\" and her star power is undeniable.\n\nThe 40-year-old artist used to sing back up vocals for powerhouse singers like Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston and Chaka Khan before carving out a big name for herself in the Nigerian music industry and on the African continent.\n\nDespite her queendom and large fan base (she has more than 11 million followers on Instagram), Savage remains humble, telling Billboard in a September interview, \"I see myself as a new artist again who’s hustling. That’s my mentality. I don’t walk into a room expecting anyone to know who I am. I’m just here to get a seat at the table.\"\n\nAside from appearing on \"Black is King,\" Savage most recently released \"Koroba\" and a music video for \"Dangerous Love.\"\n\nBurna Boy\n\nAfter Tiwa Savage, Burna Boy is the biggest act to come out of Nigeria, though the man behind the \"African Giant\" album has seen more commercial traction in the United States than Savage.\n\nBurna Boy, born Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu Rex, began gaining an audience with his debut album, \"L.I.F.E (Leaving an Impact for Eternity),\" but it was perhaps single \"Ye\" from his 2018 \"Outside\" album, that catapulted him to fame.\n\nSince then, the 29-year-old artist performed at Coachella in 2019, was featured as a solo artist on Beyoncé's \"Ja Ara E,\" and has secured a spot on Barack Obama's favorite songs of 2019 list, which some would say is a bigger feat than being nominated for a Grammy (which he was in 2019).\n\nHis latest project \"Twice as Tall,\" which was released Thursday, was mostly recorded during the pandemic and produced by the iconic Diddy.\n\nMaleek Berry\n\nLondon born Berry, real name Maleek Shoyebi, was one of the voices behind one of 2017's unofficial summer anthems, \"Juice.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old artist released an EP titled \"Isolation Room\" on July 31 – and it has a feature from Tiwa Savage.\n\nBerry is also a producer (he was nominated for producer of the year at the Nigerian Entertainment Awards in 2014) and songwriter so it's no wonder that his songs are fire.\n\nDavido\n\nYou couldn't walk into a club in 2019 and not hear Davido's \"Fall\" at one point in the night.\n\n*Sings🎶: \"Money fall on you, Banana fall on you, Prada fall on you oh, 'Cause, I'm in love with you ohhhh\"*\n\nThe single, which was released in 2017, didn't see commercial success until two years later, when it ended up making history by being the longest-charting Nigerian song on Billboard.\n\n\"I’m just as surprised as everybody else (at ‘Fall”s belated success),\" Davido, real name David Adeleke, told Rolling Stone in an April 2019 interview. \"I released almost 10 records after ‘Fall.’ I’d forgotten about ‘Fall,’ basically.\"\n\nThe Atlanta-born, Nigerian-raised artist is right: He's gone on to have other catchy releases like \"Risky\" and \"Blow My Mind,\" which features Chris Brown. He most recently lent his talents to singer Mayorkun's \"Betty Butter.\"\n\nVanessa Mdee\n\nAside from being an artist, Mdee is a television and radio personality as well as a judge on \"East Africa's Got Talent.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old Tanzanian singer studied law at Catholic University of Eastern Africa, but decided to pursue music fulltime after her father died, according to her website.\n\nMdee sings in both English and Swahili, telling OkayAfrica in a 2019 interview that she does so because the language is \"poetic\" and the melodies are \"harmonious… they just sound great to anyone's ear whether they understand the language or not – so it's very important for me to sing in Swahili.\"\n\nYa Levis\n\nYa Levis is a fairly new artist, but the Congolese singer came out the gates swinging with his 2019 debut EP, \"El Mayalove.\"\n\nHis music is mostly sung in French, and even after four years of exchanging \"ça va biens\" in high school, I haven't been able to decipher the lyrics as of yet. But you don't need to know what he's saying to know that the songs are bangers. The melody, the flow, the instrumentals – we are here for them all.\n\nLevis, 25, was also nominated in three different categories for the African Muzik Magazine Awards in 2019. His father, who died when Ya Levis was 5, inspired him to get into music and his mother, who died in April, was a singer in the church, so he's been immersed in music since childhood.\n\nYa Levis this year released the single \"Snapchat,\" and is gearing up to release his debut album in 2021.\n\nSho Madjozi\n\nMadjozi, real name Maya Wegerif,went viral with her single \"John Cena\" named after the famous wrestler.\n\nDuring an interview with Kelly Clarkson in November, Madjozi said the song was inspired by her love for Cena.\n\n\"I grew up in a very rural area, Limpopo in South Africa, and there was one television in my village where we were growing up and we got to watch two TV shows. One was a local drama called 'Generations,' and the other one was wrestling,\" she said before adding that if she didn't go by her stage name, she probably would've gone by John Cena.\n\nMadjozi's music and style is a celebration of her Tsonga heritage, and she sings across three languages: Xitsonga, Swahili and English.\n\nYemi Alade\n\nThe first thing you should know about Alade is that she's the genius behind the hit 2014 single \"Johnny.\" Please listen before proceeding.\n\nThe 31-year-old Nigerian artist performed at \"Global Goal: Unite for Our Future\" in June, a virtual concert and summit aimed at raising awareness on the coronavirus pandemic and systemic racism.\n\nAside from being featured in \"Black is King,\" Alade's most recent work is a single she released this month titled \"True Love.\" In true Alade fashion, it is everything.\n\nMr. Eazi\n\nLike Burna Boy, Mr. Eazi performed at Coachella in 2019. Speaking to Billboard in a May interview, Mr. Eazi credited the rise in African music's popularity to a renewed pride in being from the continent.\n\n\"There’s also a general wind of appreciation now for what being African is about: 'Hey, I’m African, it’s great to be African, and we’re flaunting it',\" he said. \"Back in the day, even in the villages you’d hear people singing Céline Dion. But now people are playing 99% Nigerian music because that’s what’s hip.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Eazi's music is definitely hip as he blends Ghanaian and Nigerian musical styles.\n\nDiamond Platnumz\n\nThe 30-year-old artist, born Naseeb Abdul JumaIssack, is another Tanzanian star to take the African music industry by storm.\n\nHe's collaborated with Davido, Ne-Yo, Tiwa Savage, Rick Ross and fellow Tanzanian pop star Vanessa Mdee. His music is described as Bongo Flava, a style created in the East African country and influenced by different genres together.\n\nDiamond Platnumz's last album, \"A Boy from Tandale,\" was released in 2018, but he's been dropping singles well into 2020.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/06/15/summer-concerts-phoenix-tempe-guide-upcoming-tours/692561002/", "title": "Summer concerts in Phoenix: Jay-Z, Beyonce", "text": "This summer concert season brings a mix of multi-platinum hip-hop, classic rock, country and more to a venue near you.\n\nHere's a look at the biggest tours headed our way, from the Eagles to Jay-Z and Beyonce.\n\n9/9: Bishop Briggs\n\nBorn in London to Scottish parents, this L.A. singer-songwriter hit the rock and alternative radio formats hard in 2016 with a handclap-driven triumph of post-Adele soul titled \"River,\" which kicked off her promising self-titled debut EP.\n\n\"River\" also appeared on her breathtaking full-length debut, \"Church of Scars,\" which hit the charts at No. 29 not long after the singer emerged as a crowd-pleasing highlight of the Innings Festival at Tempe Beach Park.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 9.

Reed said the two-month process leading to the vote showed that he was wrong to tell companies how far the city has come. If the vote failed, he said, he would be forced to tell businesses that value diversity and inclusiveness that “maybe this isn’t the place for that project because I can’t stand behind it. Maybe this isn’t the place for what your employees are looking for because I can’t tell you in good faith that this city ... shares your values and your vision.” He also threatened to give Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin’s cellphone number to those businesses. Birmingham’s council passed a similar ordinance in 2017. “They’ve learned from their mistakes,” Reed said. Councilwoman Audrey Graham, who voted against the Montgomery ordinance, asked Reed if he’s serious about that threat. He responded: “Those individuals that ask me an honest question, then I’m going to give them an honest answer.” The ordinance would have made it illegal to discriminate against a range of groups in the areas of public accommodation, housing and employment, as well as in all city practices, including contracting.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal judge on Wednesday threw out Trump administration approvals for a large planned oil project on Alaska’s North Slope, saying the federal review was flawed and didn’t include mitigation measures for polar bears. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason in Anchorage vacated permits for ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska in a 110-page ruling. The Trump administration approved the project in late 2020, and the Biden administration defended the project in court. Rebecca Boys, a ConocoPhillips spokesperson, said the company would review Gleason’s decision “and evaluate the options available regarding this project.” Spokespersons for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Interior Department said their agencies had no comment. The Bureau of Land Management conducted the environmental review of the project that Gleason found flawed. Conservation groups and Sovereign Inupiat for a Living Arctic, described as a grassroots organization, had challenged the adequacy of the review process. Karlin Itchoak, Alaska director for The Wilderness Society, in a statement called the ruling “a step toward protecting public lands and the people who would be most negatively impacted by the BLM’s haphazard greenlighting of the Willow project.”\n\nArizona\n\nBullhead City: Employees in a northwestern Arizona school district cannot discuss vaccination status or mask-wearing with students under a motion approved unanimously by the local school board. The edict from the Colorado River Union High School District Governing Board carries no repercussions for administrators, staff or teachers who violate it. That would be up to Superintendent Monte Silk, who supported the motion. The debate over masks and vaccines in schools has been heated. At least 26 school districts in Arizona have enacted their own mask mandates, even as Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has tried to prevent them and threatened schools with a loss of funding. Those school districts account for nearly 300,000 students and 450 schools, mostly around Phoenix and Tucson. The Colorado River Union High School District’s gag rule, however, is rare. Board member Ashley Gerich, who calls herself a “non-vaxxer,” requested the item be put on the board’s agenda this week. She said a couple of students, including her daughter, told her conversations about the vaccine made them feel uncomfortable, the Mohave Daily News reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Three parents are suing over a northwest Arkansas school district’s decision to require face masks after a judge blocked the state’s mask mandate ban. The lawsuit filed Wednesday over the Bentonville School District’s mandate argues the local school board had no authority to impose the requirement. The parents are asking a Benton County judge to temporarily block the district from enforcing the ban while they challenge it. The parents are “forced to choose either to exercise their fundamental liberty interests in refusing to place face coverings on their children against their will or for the children to face expulsion from school,” the lawsuit said. Public health officials have urged schools to require masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus due to the highly contagious delta variant. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. More than 70 public school districts and charter schools have imposed mask mandates since Arkansas’ ban against them was blocked. The requirements cover more than half of the state’s public school students. “Our legal counsel is currently reviewing the matter and we look forward to a vigorous defense of our district,” Leslee Wright, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville School District, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A major Southern California water agency has declared a water supply alert for the first time in seven years and is asking residents to voluntarily conserve. The Los Angeles Times reports the board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California took the step Tuesday, hoping to lessen the need for more severe actions such as reducing water supplies to member agencies. The move came a day after U.S. officials declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River, a key water source for Southern California. “This is a wake-up call for what lies ahead,” said Deven Upadhyay, chief operating officer for the district that supplies water to 19 million Californians, from the Los Angeles area to U.S.-Mexico border. “We cannot overstate the seriousness of this drought,” he said. “Conditions are getting worse, and more importantly, we don’t know how long it will last.” Gov. Gavin Newsom last month asked Californians to scale back water use, and many of the state’s counties, mostly in Central and Northern California, are already under a state of drought emergency. Concern about water supplies spread to the state’s heavily populated southern region following a winter of low precipitation and shrinking reservoirs throughout the West.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: Forest Service officials said Wednesday that Hanging Lake Trail, a popular tourist destination in western Colorado, will be closed for the rest of the summer season and likely beyond because of extensive damage caused by large mudslides in late July. The announcement came after a preliminary assessment earlier in the week that revealed damaged and destroyed bridges, as well as large sections of the trail blocked by debris and mud. “The Hanging Lake Trail is not safe and impassable in some areas and will remain closed for the foreseeable future,” said White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams. “The debris flows we saw in July are probably not the last we will see, so there could be additional damage in the weeks and months ahead.” The trail leads to the emerald-colored Hanging Lake, which is designated as a National Natural Landmark and is about 1,000 feet up a side canyon of Glenwood Canyon. The lake was discolored by mud flows that resulted from a wildfire that torched the area last summer. “The good news is that the water in Hanging Lake is clearing from the debris flow, the boardwalk at the lake wasn’t damaged, and the fish are still swimming,” Fitzwilliams said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nAshford: Ground was broken Wednesday at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp for seriously ill children to replace buildings that burned to the ground in a February fire. The Feb. 12 blaze at the camp founded by the late actor Paul Newman destroyed a section of the eastern Connecticut camp that was made to look like the center of an Old West town. It had housed the camp’s woodworking shop, the arts and crafts area, the camp store, and its educational kitchen. Camp officials said they have received 4,500 donations for the rebuild, including a $1 million match from Travelers and the Travelers Championship golf tournament and a $1 million gift from Newman’s Own Foundation. That will allow the camp to build a new, accessible single-level “creative complex” that will not only replace what was lost but also include new features, such as a quiet sensory area for campers and dedicated space for parents and caregivers. “We want to dedicate this moment to everyone who helped us heal and made us whole again,” said Jimmy Canton, the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp’s chief executive officer. “Your kindness was the bridge that brought us from grief to gratitude, and your friendship is why we are able to celebrate this milestone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Police are investigating after photos of two officers who appear to be sleeping in their patrol vehicles were posted on social media. Police said in a Facebook post Tuesday that the department was looking into the matter and that such “behavior is unacceptable to our agency, unfair to our citizens, and certainly outside of department policy.” One photo shows an officer leaned back in his driver’s seat with his eyes shut and his mouth partially open. The other shows an officer leaned back in a police SUV driver’s seat facing away from the car window and toward a computer screen. The officers, who have not been named, were scheduled to meet with command staff late Tuesday, police spokesman Sgt. Mark Hoffman said. The department’s code of conduct states that the health, well-being and overall safety of officers is a top priority. Police said in a statement that officers are encouraged not to operate vehicles when fatigued and urged to speak with a supervisor “so proper measures can be taken” if they feel unwell or unusually fatigued. “With that being said, there is no language that allows such activity,” the department said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Canceled because of the pandemic 16 months ago, Honor Flights to Washington resumed Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The program brings veterans from around the nation to D.C. to see the memorials built in their honor. The flights and tours are free. At the World War II Memorial, 113 veterans were visiting Wednesday from the Honor Flight hub in Chicago. “Probably the most touching moments are watching watching the veterans reflect as they look at the Wall of Stars,” said David Smith, president of the Honor Flight Network. “There are over 400,000 stars there; it represents those that were lost.” Wednesday’s visit honored three veterans from World War II, 34 who served in the Korean War, and 76 veterans of the Vietnam conflict.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The number of U.S. tourists who came to Sunshine State in the second quarter of this year has returned to pre-pandemic levels, though the international market is still lagging, according to figures released Thursday. Florida received about 30.6 million domestic visitors from April through June, a 6% increase over the same time in 2019 and a 216% jump from the same time last year, during the height of COVID-19 pandemic closures, state tourism marketing firm Visit Florida said in a news release. Overall, the state had 31.4 million visitors in the second quarter of this year, an increase of 220% from the same period a year earlier. Florida’s international market has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due in part to restrictions on entering the United States. Florida welcomed only 1.1 million visitors from overseas and Canada in the second quarter of this year, compared to 3.5 million visitors in the second quarter of 2019. During the spring of 2020, Florida’s major theme parks and hotels around the state were either shuttered or had limited operations due to the pandemic. As of Thursday, though, Walt Disney World is tweaking its face mask policy, allowing visitors to choose whether to wear face coverings in outdoor lines, outdoor theaters and outdoor attractions. Masks had been required previously.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Health care providers at some of the state’s largest hospital systems warned Thursday about the increasing toll of the latest coronavirus surge on younger patients, hospital staffs and health care capacity as they implored people to get vaccinated, wear masks and avoid large gatherings. The guidance came as the state’s hospitals – already struggling with rising patient numbers – brace for even higher COVID-19 case counts that could surpass a winter peak. “The unfortunate thing is we don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘We’re full, and we’re closed,’ ” said Robert Jansen, chief medical officer at Atlanta’s Grady Health System. “We’re not a hotel, so people will continue to come and our staff will continue to cope, and we’ll continue to find places to take care of these patients, but it is going to be difficult, and it’s not going to be easy, and it won’t make people happy.” Jansen said the hospital’s emergency room is facing a “tsunami” of patients infected with the delta variant of the coronavirus, forcing staff to divert ambulances to other hospitals for quicker care. As at other hospitals in the state, the influx is primarily people who are unvaccinated.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Officials on the Big Island are considering closing beaches and canceling the Ironman World Championship in response to a surge of coronavirus cases. “Right now our numbers are skyrocketing. It’s a shame because we as a county have been doing a great job,” Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth told County Council members. “But we let down our guards – I let down my guard.” The administration is revising its emergency rules and will submit the changes to Gov. David Ige for approval, West Hawaii Today reports. That revision could include a return to restrictions at parks and beaches that allow people to cross the sand only to get to the ocean to surf, swim or fish but not to gather or sit. Similar restrictions were enacted across Hawaii during the peak of the pandemic last year. The Ironman World Championship is currently set for Oct. 9 in Kailua-Kona. Roth said a decision would be made soon about whether the event could go on. “Unfortunately, it doesn’t look too positive for Ironman this year,” the mayor said. “The question with Ironman is what do you do with all the people who come to spectate.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Students across the state lost some academic ground during the coronavirus pandemic, with standardized testing scores dropping in math and language arts compared to 2019. The Idaho Department of Education released the Idaho Standardized Achievement Test scores Tuesday. The test – required under federal rules – is typically administered to students in third through eighth grades and 10th grade each spring. But the 2020 test was canceled after the federal requirement was temporarily lifted as schools closed amid the coronavirus pandemic. For the 2021 round of testing, students showed the biggest decline in math skills, with 39.6% of students testing at “proficient” or “advanced” levels this spring, compared to 44.4% two years ago. English language arts skills had a smaller drop, with just over 54% of students scoring as proficient or advanced compared to 55% in 2019. “The onset of the pandemic in spring 2020 disrupted the ISAT along with all Idaho school operations, so we weren’t surprised that scores did not continue the gradual upward trend of the previous few years of testing,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Sherri Ybarra said in a statement. “We expected an impact, and now we can use these results to move forward to rebuild academic performance.”\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Some residents are crying foul over a proposed museum for women’s baseball in a city that had one of the sport’s most successful teams in the 1940s. A zoning board postponed a decision Tuesday on a permit for the project at Beyer Park. The Rockford Park District is willing to sell an acre of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. A group called Friends of Beyer Stadium said it supports the concept but has acquired land directly west of Beyer Park.“Shame on you,” said Greg Schwanke, president of Friends of Beyer Stadium. “I spent 14 years out there building this place and turned it into a national attraction for the city of Rockford. We’re not going down. We’re fighting all of the way.” The Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League played at Beyer Stadium. The team was featured in the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own,” with Tom Hanks, Madonna and Geena Davis. The International Women’s Baseball Center is launching a $10 million fundraising campaign for construction of a museum and activity center. “We’ve had people already calling us from outside the area asking us when the museum is going to open,” said Rosemary Collins, a retired judge involved with the group. “They will travel here to see it. It will have an economic boon for the entire area.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Facing a pandemic unlike any his predecessors have seen, Gov. Eric Holcomb on Wednesday announced the formation of a public health commission that will spend the next year finding ways to improve the overall health of Hoosiers. While COVID-19 response will figure into the work of the 15-person commission, Holcomb said the panel’s scope would go far beyond this latest crisis. “We’ve got our game plan right now to continue to work through the pandemic,” he said. “That’s not what this commission or this task force is about. This is a long-term look at where we want our state to be decades from now.” Holcomb tapped longtime Republican politician Luke Kenley and former state health commissioner Dr. Judy Monroe to co-chair the body. The group will convene for the first time next month and is expected to issue a report by next summer, in time for 2023 budget discussions, Holcomb said. Over the past year, Holcomb has weathered criticism from all sides for his handling of the pandemic. Some have complained that he has not done enough to halt the spread of the coronavirus, lifting restrictions like the mask mandate too soon. Others have complained that he overreached his authority in taking steps such as that mask mandate.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said the state would welcome refugees from Afghanistan who want to resettle in Iowa, saying their situation is much different from the immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border whom the Republican governor refused to accept in April. Reynolds and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst discussed plans to take refugees while attending the Iowa State Fair on Wednesday. “We’re working with the State Department right now; we’re offering our opportunity to settle here in Iowa,” Ernst said. The Republican senator said she is working with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., to push the U.S. Department of State to allow as many people as possible to qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa Program, designed to aid people who worked with the U.S. military as interpreters or translators in Iraq or Afghanistan. The U.S. Bureau of Refugee Services has said Iowa could take as many as 2,000 refugees a year, and Reynolds didn’t disagree with that number. “We’ll work with them to determine what that looks like and just make sure we have a process in place and we have families and homes for them to go,” she said. “We want to be a partner, we want them here, and we want them to know that.” In April Reynolds said she rejected a federal request to accept migrant children from the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that “is the president’s problem.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Officials in some communities are battling a rise in COVID-19 cases by mandating masks for kids, issuing emergency orders and requiring vaccines. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Kansas has risen over the past two weeks from 605.14 new cases per day Aug. 3 to 797.14 new cases per day Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In the Lawrence area, Douglas County leaders approved a health order Wednesday that will require children ages 2 to 12 to wear masks while in indoor public spaces. The decision followed four hours of public comment that included jeering and interruptions from a largely maskless crowd, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. Douglas County’s health officer, Dr. Thomas Marcellino was momentarily drowned out by laughter and heckling from the crowd when he tried to explain the reasoning for the order. One person called him a liar and disgusting, and some in the crowd started chanting “no more masks.” One public commenter even compared maskless children being excluded from activities to racial segregation. There are various exceptions to the proposed order, including youth with a medical condition, mental health condition or disability that prevents wearing a face covering.\n\nKentucky\n\nPine Top: During a five-year span that ended last year, Kentucky State Police fatally shot at least 41 people – more than any other law enforcement agency in the commonwealth, according to a published report. Police declined to release the numbers, but the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting and the Marshall Project built a database using a combination of publicly available data and state police records, according to an article the entities published in partnership with the Lexington Herald-Leader. The report said Kentucky troopers killed more people in rural communities than any other department in the nation, according to the partnership’s analysis of data compiled by the Washington Post. None of the 41 fatal shootings resulted in troopers being prosecuted. Of those killed, about 75% were armed, and a majority were suffering from addiction or mental health problems, according to the investigation. Kentucky State Police investigate shootings with no outside oversight, a practice some experts and prosecutors say is problematic. “I don’t think it should be done,” said Dave Stengel, the former commonwealth’s attorney in Louisville. He said there is potential for conflicts of interest. “Everybody knows everybody else.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A civilian Pentagon official ordered the Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday to conduct a full environmental assessment of a $9.4 billion Formosa Plastics complex planned in the state, drawing praise from environmentalists. Jaime Pinkham, the Army’s acting assistant secretary for civil works, ordered the review after a virtual meeting with opponents of a Corps wetlands permit that allowed Formosa Plastics Group member FG LA LLC to build 10 chemical plants and four other major facilities on the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Critics praised the decision. “The Army Corps has finally heard our pleas and understands our pain. With God’s help, Formosa Plastics will soon pull out of our community,” said a statement by Sharon Lavigne, who founded the local group Rise St. James to fight the planned complex announced in 2018. Formosa, based in Taiwan, wants to produce polyethylene, polypropylene, polymer and ethylene glycol on 2,400 acres in St. James Parish. Dubbed the Sunshine Project because it’s near the Sunshine Bridge, the project is expected to provide 1,200 permanent jobs and up to 8,000 construction jobs, the state has said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Several music venues plan to require vaccinations for concertgoers. State Theater, Thompson’s Point and Portland House of Music are among those in the city requiring COVID-19 shots or a negative test for the coronavirus. Elsewhere, the Opera House at Boothbay Harbor and Stone Mountain Arts Center in Brownfield are also requiring proof of vaccination. The marquee sign above State Theater says: “Vaccines are a gateway drug to concerts.” “We hope we can keep our doors open, and we need your support and understanding to do so,” the Portland House of Music said. The announcements come amid a surge in the delta variant of the coronavirus, which now accounts for virtually all infections in Maine. Meanwhile, the University of Maine System is requiring all students, faculty, staff and visitors to wear wear face coverings inside its buildings. The new policy applies to all, regardless of vaccination status. “With our classrooms and other indoor spaces no longer set up to impose social distancing, face coverings are an important strategy we can employ to effectively control the transmission of COVID, regardless of an individual’s vaccination status and testing participation,” Chancellor Dannel Malloy wrote. Bates College has adopted a similar requirement at its Lewiston campus.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has filed a lawsuit against Shore Transit after the public transit agency refused to display PETA advertisements on its buses. The animal rights group applied to display two advertisements on Shore Transit buses in May 2020. Both advertisements read: “No One Needs to Kill to Eat. Close the slaughterhouses: Save the workers, their families, and the animals.” Shore Transit denied the application, saying the advertisements violated its advertising policy. The agency prohibits advertisements that are “political, controversial, offensive, objectionable or in poor taste,” according to the suit. However, PETA claims Shore Transit does not have any written guidance for following these terms. PETA alleges that by denying the application, Shore Transit violated the First and 14th Amendments. In July 2021, PETA renewed its application to advertise, and it says it has not received a response. PETA filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing PETA. The suit names Shore Transit, Shore Transit Director Brad Bellacicco and the Tri-County Council for the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland as defendants. Shore Transit offers public transportation in Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset counties.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: More than three centuries after a woman was wrongly convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to death, she’s finally on the verge of being exonerated, thanks to a curious eighth grade civics class. State Sen. Diana DiZoglio, D-Methuen, has introduced legislation to clear the name of Elizabeth Johnson Jr., who was condemned in 1693 at the height of the Salem Witch Trials but never executed. DiZoglio said she was inspired by sleuthing done by a group of 13- and 14-year-olds at North Andover Middle School. Civics teacher Carrie LaPierre’s students painstakingly researched Johnson and the steps that would need to be taken to make sure she was formally pardoned. “It is important that we work to correct history,” DiZoglio said Wednesday. “We will never be able to change what happened to these victims, but at the very least, we can set the record straight.” If lawmakers approve the measure, Johnson will be the last accused witch to be cleared, according to Witches of Massachusetts Bay, a group devoted to the history and lore of the 17th-century witch hunts. In the 328 years since a frenzy of Puritan injustice that began in 1692, dozens of suspects officially were cleared, including Johnson’s own mother, the daughter of a minister whose conviction eventually was reversed. But for some reason, Johnson’s name wasn’t included in various legislative attempts to set the record straight.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: In need of quick cash and find yourself in a forest? Well, you may have an opportunity on your hands. The state Department of Natural Resources is offering $75 for bushels of pine cones for the month of September. The agency is in need of these for replanting purposes, refilling forests with new conifer trees. But the DNR is requesting a specific kind of cone: the red pine cone, marked by its craggy, reddish bark and 4- to 6-inch needles that grow in pairs. The DNR notes that Scotch and Austrian pine cones will not be accepted. Scotch cones are marked by their flayed and thick bark, while Austrian cones are more orb-like than red cones. Cones should be picked off the tree, as fallen cones are usually too old or wet. And one can tell the age of the cone from the way the scales are arranged. The scales should be closed with a hint of green or purple. All brown and they’re too far gone. The correct kind of bag is being distributed at select DNR locations. The cones will be processed in machines that harvest their seeds, which will be used to replenish the in-high-demand red pine, among other initiatives to refill Michigan forests.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: A wildfire in the Superior National Forest that crews have been fighting since the weekend has grown to 61/ 4 square miles, but U.S. Forest Service officials said Thursday morning that it grew little overnight. The Forest Service said lightning caused the fire first spotted Sunday near Greenwood Lake, about 25 miles southwest of Isabella. It grew from 5 square miles to 61/ 4 by Wednesday evening, after what officials described as a “very active” afternoon of expansion on its western flank. But in an update posted Thursday morning, Forest Service officials said there was no significant change overnight, which is often the case with forest fires. Thursday’s forecast in the area called for continued hot, dry weather, with thunderstorms expected Friday night and Saturday. The fire led authorities to evacuate about 75 homes Monday near McDougal Lake, just north of where the fire started. Many dwellings in the area, which is deep in the forest, are seasonal cabins. Some small portions of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area to the north and northeast have been closed as a precaution due to the blaze, and two smaller fires spotted over the weekend in the wilderness. No injuries or damage to structures has been reported. Crews are also fighting several smaller wildfires in northeastern Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s only pediatric hospital is treating its largest number of COVID-19 cases so far during the pandemic, the hospital said Thursday. Children’s of Mississippi is part of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. “Today, Children’s of Mississippi and the University of Mississippi Medical Center reported 28 children with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, the highest number of pediatric COVID-19 patients at the state’s only children’s hospital since the beginning of the pandemic,” the hospital said on Facebook. “Of these hospitalized children, 100% are unvaccinated. This number includes eight children in the ICU, including five who are too young to receive the vaccine.” Meanwhile, state health officials say almost 1,000 hospital beds that could be used to treat patients during the latest surge of coronavirus are unstaffed because of a shortage of health care workers. Mississippi is facing a record number of people hospitalized with the virus – 1,633 on Tuesday, according to the state Department of Health – and has the highest per capita rate of new COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 case tracker.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Two employees are suing Springfield Public Schools over the district’s mandatory racial equity training, which they contend violates their rights and is an “unconstitutional condition of employment.” The federal lawsuit was filed Wednesday by Jennifer Lumley, a records secretary for the special services department, and Brooke Henderson, who works on plans for students with disabilities. Henderson is a member of Back on Track America and has frequently accused the district of inserting critical race theory into its training. Critical race theory, which studies America’s history through the lens of racism, is not mentioned in the lawsuit. But the women allege the term “equity” and other phrases used during the training are code for the theory, which they contend conditions “individuals to see each other’s skin color first and foremost.” All employees were required to take the training during the 2020-21 school year or lose pay. As part of the training, they were required to commit to equity and becoming “anti-racist educators,” according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed against the district, its school board and four district officials. Stephen Hall, spokesman for the district, said the district is prepared to defend its equity efforts and is confident the court will find the lawsuit is without merit.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University and the University of Montana are telling everyone to wear masks indoors on campus. Montana State University President Waded Cruzado and University of Montana President Seth Bodnar both cited the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus as one reason for their requests and also urged people to get COVID-19 vaccinations. Cruzado said Montana State’s decision would last through Oct. 1 but said in a message to students, staff and faculty that mandates “foment dissension and division.” She also said she understands people find pandemic-related mandates “odious,” and they require enforcement, so she is asking people to voluntarily wear their masks because it is the right thing to do. Bodnar also said UM is urging but not requiring masks, and he said the university will revisit its stance Sept. 20. He noted the uptick in cases in Missoula County had placed it in a “high risk” zone based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and he pointed to advice from health officials that says masks can help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials are dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak at a state correctional facility as coronavirus cases surge statewide. After 33 inmates tested positive for the virus at the Diagnostic and Evaluation Center in Lincoln, officials paused all visits and volunteer activities there and asked county jails to delay sending new inmates if they can. All adult men who enter the state prison system go through the facility. Officials said all inmates who test positive for the virus are being housed away from other inmates to limit the spread of COVID-19, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The state Department of Correctional Services has also started providing bars of soap, which inmates had to purchase before the pandemic, and masks to inmates who request them. Officials say they have also stepped up efforts to disinfect spaces where people live and congregate in prisons. Department Director Scott Frakes said the increase in cases in the prison system – which lists 36 active cases – follows an increase in the community. “It is not a surprise that we have an uptick in cases now, especially at DEC which serves as the intake facility for all male inmates who are new admits or returning to us from the community,” Frakes said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The U.S. debut of a long-established international food and beverage industry trade show could make Las Vegas a magnet for foodies and food product retailers, distributors and wholesalers, event producers and tourism officials said. An announcement Tuesday by Emerald Holding Inc. and Comexposium, owner of the SIAL brand of worldwide food shows, was timed as a topper to Emerald’s ongoing International Pizza Expo now at the Las Vegas Convention Center. “This partnership underscores the ever-increasing importance of creating a single event for the food industry,” Jessica Blue, Emerald executive vice president, said in a statement. SIAL, for Salon International de L’Alimentation, has a 50-year history and says it draws some 16,000 exhibitors and 700,000 visitors from 200 countries to 10 shows in France, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. “We plan to bring a new international food exhibition to life in Las Vegas to enable comprehensive sourcing of new products,” said Nicolas Trentesaux, SIAL Network Global CEO. The announcement hosted by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority puts the SIAL America show on the Convention Center schedule for March 2022.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A billionaire software company CEO has given a former hermit $180,000 to rebuild his cabin in a new location. Alexander Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, gave David Lidstone a personal check last week, Lidstone’s friend, Jodie Gedeon said on Facebook. A spokesperson for the data analytics software company confirmed the donation to the Concord Monitor. “How can I express myself and my gratitude towards something like that? I start to tear up whenever I think about it,” Lidstone told the Monitor. “For an old logger who always had to work, for anyone to give you that type of money, it’s incredibly difficult for me to get my head around.” There has been an outpouring of support for Lidstone since he was jailed July 15 and accused of squatting for nearly 30 years on property owned by a Vermont man. His cabin burned down this month shortly before his release, but he recently secured temporary housing through the winter. The location is being kept secret to protect Lidstone’s privacy, Gedeon said. But supporters will have a chance to meet Lidstone at a “thank you” event in Warner, New Hampshire, on Saturday. Lidstone has said he doesn’t think he can go back to being a hermit. “Maybe the things I’ve been trying to avoid are the things that I really need in life,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nManasquan: Huge gates that could be slammed shut when major storms approach would be built across the mouths of three inlets in New Jersey, closable barriers would cut parts of two bays in half, and 19,000 homes would be raised as part of a $16 billion plan to address back bay flooding, one of the major sources of storm damage at the Jersey Shore. After five years of study, federal and state officials unveiled recommendations Thursday that would drastically change the appearance of some iconic spots at the shore. It also would be one of the most ambitious and costly efforts any U.S. state has yet taken to address back bay flooding. The term refers to floods that are not primarily caused by waves crashing over ocean barriers but by stealthily rising water levels in bays along inland shorelines. Although ocean waves caused severe damage during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, back bay flooding also caused extensive damage in that storm. In numerous places, it was the primary source of property damage during Sandy. “To better protect New Jersey’s residents, communities, and economy, we must plan and prepare today for the climate change risks of tomorrow,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm heard from industry officials Wednesday about what it will take to boost renewable energy development in the state and across the nation as the Biden administration pushes its initiatives to reduce emissions and address climate change. Developers and policy experts said without more transmission infrastructure and a cohesive grid, renewable energy will be stranded in remote spots like rural New Mexico, and opportunities for economic development will be hampered as a result. “This stuff is as important as building highways. It’s as important as building hospitals and schools,” said Fernando Martinez, executive director of the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority. “The only way we’re going to accomplish this … is that we really do need a predictable regulatory landscape.” He and others told Granholm about permitting bottlenecks that have slowed the development of major transmission projects in New Mexico. They said if the Biden administration wants to reach its goals, the U.S. can’t afford to take decades to site and build transmission lines. A major line to connect wind farms in eastern New Mexico to the grid, for example, is almost complete but needs the approval of more than 430 easements from ranchers and other landowners.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A group of restaurants asked a judge this week to block the city’s latest effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, calling the city’s mandate that customers show proof of vaccination “arbitrary, irrational, unscientific and unlawful.” The group argued that the new rules would severely harm their businesses and livelihood. The city’s proof-of-vaccination edict went into effect Tuesday and requires anyone dining indoors at restaurants, going to museums, attending concerts, working out at a gym or entering many indoor public venues show proof that they have been inoculated against COVID-19. The group of restaurateurs that filed the lawsuit in Richmond County, which encompasses Staten Island, said restaurants and other establishments included in the city’s vaccine mandate were unfairly targeted because many other places such as grocery stores, hair salons, churches, schools and office buildings were excluded from the mandate. “This vaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious due to the fact that it targets certain establishments but not others with no rational whatsoever,” the lawsuit says. Mayor Bill de Blasio first announced the new rules Aug. 3. He said enforcement won’t begin until Sept. 13 to give businesses more time to prepare and people an opportunity to get vaccinated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: A college tradition has come under scrutiny after pictures the school posted on social media showed hundreds of students gathered at a campus landmark waiting to get a drink of water in the midst of a COVID-19 surge. Pictures posted to Twitter by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill showed a line of students approaching the Old Well on Wednesday waiting to get a drink and a picture. According to tradition, students who drink from the fountain at the well on the first day of classes will get good grades for the entire school year. It was first reported by The News & Observer of Raleigh. The tradition was canceled last year because of the pandemic. The resumption brought a thread of negative reactions. “Tradition aside, you couldn’t just find a couple paper cups for this? In the middle of the fourth wave of a global pandemic?” said one response. “It would have been a great idea to put this tradition on hold,” said another response. According to the newspaper, the university issued a statement saying it had consulted with public health experts who agreed it was OK to proceed with the tradition since there is little to no evidence of surface transmission of the coronavirus. Students who chose to participate were encouraged to wear a mask and maintain distance while waiting in line.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There are no current plans to bring any of the people fleeing the conflict in Afghanistan to the state, officials said. The North Dakota Department of Human Services, who oversees the Refugee Resettlement Program, said the process is actually quite extensive. It takes eight different government agencies and six background checks for a person to gain clearance for the Refugee Resettlement Program in North Dakota, officials said. The state’s refugee coordinator said the people being transported to the U.S. are classified as Special Immigrant Visa Holders. Each person will be resettled in an area of the country in which Afghans have already settled, KXNET-TV reports. “There are strong communities that have already been set up for individuals that have a successful history of gaining employment, assimilating within the community, learning English and, you know, really developing successful relationships with a variety of different community members,” Holly Triska-Dally said. The Pentagon said that over the prior 24 hours about 2,000 people, including 325 American citizens, had been flown out of the Kabul international airport on 18 flights by U.S. Air Force C-17 transport planes.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Whether because of a lack of computer access, lack of awareness or mistrust, about 180,000 children in the state are not benefiting from the government’s enhanced Child Tax Credit program. That’s the conclusion drawn by Alex Coccia, a senior policy analyst at the Center for the Study of Social Policy, a national nonprofit organization. On a conference call with several members of local and national nonprofits this week, Coccia said that through the first two months of the program, 2.151 million Ohio children have received the tax credit’s advance payments, but he estimated that 2.33 million children are eligible. The monthly payments of either $250 or $300 per child began in July and will continue through December, with another six months’ worth of money available upon filing a tax return in 2022. The payments go out automatically to the roughly 90% of eligible Americans who filed a tax return this year, but the concern is that the “non-filers” still may be unaware of the benefit. Those who do not file a tax return, because of very low incomes or several other reasons, must “opt in” through an online portal on the IRS website. And that’s where access issues begin. “We’re worried about non-English speakers, those who lack secure housing, and those with limited internet access,” Coccia said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s school districts should have “the autonomy” to enact mask requirements, which are banned by state law, according to the superintendent of schools. “School districts deserve the autonomy to enact policies that protect our schoolchildren and staff from COVID exposure and infection,” Oklahoma Superintendent Joy Hofmeister said in a statement Wednesday. Hofmeister’s comments came after U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in letters to her and Gov. Kevin Stitt that the ban may violate the American Rescue Plan Act that provided $123 billion to the nation’s schools to help them return to the classroom. Cardona sent similar letters to several other states with similar mask bans. Stitt’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. A spokesperson for Stitt told the Tulsa World on Wednesday that the governor had not yet seen the letter. Hofmeister, whose recommendation for a statewide mask mandate in schools was rejected in July 2020 in a 4-3 vote by the state Board of Education, said vaccinations and mask wearing are key to keeping schools open for in-person classes. “I think Ronald Reagan was right when he said those closest to the problem are the ones best suited to address it,” Hofmeister said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: President Joe Biden on Wednesday nominated Oregon resident and tribal citizen Charles F. “Chuck” Sams III to head the National Park Service. If confirmed by the Senate, Sams would be the first Native American to hold the position. He is Cayuse and Walla Walla and a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Sams has worked in state and tribal governments and the nonprofit natural resource and conservation management fields for over 25 years, White House officials said. “The diverse experience that Chuck brings to the National Park Service will be an incredible asset as we work to conserve and protect our national parks to make them more accessible for everyone,” U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release. “The outdoors are for everyone, and we have an obligation to protect them for generations to come.” Currently, Sams is a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, a role appointed by Gov. Kate Brown. The Democratic governor said in a statement Wednesday that it was a proud day for Oregon. She described Sams as a “passionate student and teacher of the history and culture of our lands and our people.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Mister Rogers’ deliveryman’s son, who’s now a real-life mail carrier, briefly appeared this week on an episode of a children’s show based on one of Mister Rogers’ puppets. Alex Newell, 39, is the son of David Newell, who played Mr. McFeely on “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” Alex Newell had a cameo on “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. In Wednesday’s episode, Newell appears as a mail carrier ensuring a little girl’s care package has been delivered to a friend, according to the newspaper. David Newell said Rogers was the first person who came to visit him at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital after each of his three children were born, including Alex. “In a way, Alex grew up in Mister Rogers’ neighborhood, in reality and in pretend,” his dad said. “He watched the program as he was growing up, and now he’s making a delivery on (‘Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood’). And that makes me so proud.” “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood” features 4-year-old Daniel Tiger, son of the original show’s Daniel Striped Tiger.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The cost of running the city’s guaranteed-income pilot program will be more than the total of cash payments given to low-income families. The 110 households selected to take part in the pilot will receive $500 monthly, adding up to $6,000 over the course of the one-year experiment. In total, $660,000 will be given away in no-strings-attached cash grants. Meanwhile, expenses associated with administering the program and researching its effectiveness are already expected to top $723,000, according to an estimate provided by Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office. While that means that the total cost of the pilot program will exceed the $1.1 million that Elorza had originally anticipated, none of that is taxpayer money. The pilot program is being fully funded by private donors, including Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey. Joining a growing number of Democratic mayors nationwide, Elorza has championed the idea that a guaranteed income can help lift people out of poverty, pointing to Stockton, California, which found that many recipients used the money for basic needs and that they were more likely to be employed full time after taking part in the program. Providence is now encouraging anyone who makes less than 200% of the federal poverty level to apply before the Saturday deadline.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: The Myrtle Beach International Airport has been the busiest airport in the Palmetto State this summer. The airport set a record for passenger traffic with more than 500,000 total passengers in July, WBTW-TV reports. That’s the highest monthly passenger count ever recorded at an airport in South Carolina’s history. Total passenger traffic for July totaled nearly 550,000 – a 49% increase over July 2019, airport officials said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The head of the South Dakota National Guard says Gov. Kristi Noem didn’t tell him she would use a private donation for the deployment to the U.S. border with Mexico until after the mission was already planned. Noem’s decision to accept a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire last month was met with hefty criticism from those who said it allowed a private donor to commandeer a military force. But Maj. Gen. Jeffery Marlette told a legislative budgeting committee Wednesday that the donation was not a factor in planning the deployment. “Our National Guard is not for hire,” he told lawmakers. “Nowhere in this planning process was there a discussion of, ‘I’ll go send the Guard if I can find somebody to pay for it.’ ” The Republican governor last month described the $1 million donation offer from billionaire Republican donor Willis Johnson as a “surprise” that came as she was deciding whether to send police officers or National Guard troops, as well as how to fund the deployment. The state was responding to a request from Texas and Arizona to send law enforcement officers under an agreement between states to assist during emergencies\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Hospitals warned Thursday that the intensive care units are full in nearly every hospital in the state’s major metropolitan areas, pleading with Tennesseans to get vaccinated and wear masks while not going so far as to criticize Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order allowing parents to opt their children out of mask mandates in K-12 schools. Meanwhile, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona warned Tennessee in a letter Wednesday that the order might violate federal law. The Tennessee Hospital Association said in its statement that the hospitals in metropolitan areas with full ICUs are the same ones that normally accept transfers from smaller hospitals of the sickest patients. “This means that if you or a loved one need treatment for any type of serious healthcare problem like a severe injury, heart attack, or stroke, you may not be able to access the care you need, when you need it,” the statement says. It cites Tennessee Department of Health data from May and July that found “at least 88% of these COVID hospitalizations and 94% of COVID deaths are among unvaccinated individuals.” And a Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt School of Medicine report released Thursday found hospitalizations have increased more than tenfold in a little more than a month, the fastest rate of increase of the pandemic.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Austin City Limits Music Festival announced plans Thursday to require a negative coronavirus test or proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all patrons attending the event, scheduled to take place Oct. 1-3 and 8-10 in Zilker Park. While the festival will still admit children 10 and younger for free with a ticketed adult, the popular Austin Kiddie Limits section of festival programming has been paused for the 2021 event. Families attending the festival will be required to provide a negative virus test result for unvaccinated children. The festival also has added a “fan health pledge” to the website. It requests that fans skip the festival if they have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus within 14 days of the beginning of the festival or if they experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 48 hours of the festival. It also requests that fans do not attend if they “have travelled to any international territory identified by federal or applicable state or local governments as being subject to travel or quarantine advisories due to COVID-19.” The move comes as Austin grapples with rising coronavirus hospitalizations in the area. Music venues and industry leaders have been trying to figure out how to increase safety measures right as large events return.\n\nUtah\n\nLehi: A teacher is no longer employed at a high school after a video of her sharing political opinions in class began circulating online, school district officials said Wednesday. The teacher at Lehi High School was initially placed on administrative leave after the video surfaced, but Alpine School District officials confirmed she no longer works there. District spokesman David Stephenson declined to say whether the teacher was fired or resigned. Video that appears to be surreptitiously recorded by a student in the classroom shows the teacher criticizing people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The video was shared online by conservative activists who have led demonstrations against mask mandates and vaccines throughout the state. “I don’t have to be happy about the fact that there’s kids coming in here with their variants that could possibly get me or my family sick,” the video showed the teacher saying. “That’s rude, and I’m not going to pretend like it’s not.” She can also be heard saying that most students are smarter than their parents and that they don’t need to believe everything their parents believe. The Alpine School District, which declined to identify the teacher, said in a statement that the district disavowed her comments.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: The state’s largest utility is reminding customers that they can apply for grant money to get caught up on past-due utility bills related to the pandemic. A total of $55 million in free grant money is available to help renters, homeowners, businesses and farms pay overdue utility bills tied to the pandemic, Green Mountain Power said in a statement Tuesday. “More than 20,000 GMP customers have fallen at least two months behind on their accounts during the pandemic, yet only about 2,000 have applied for these new assistance programs,” said Steve Costello, a GMP vice president. The Vermont Department of Public Service is taking grant applications through Oct. 25. The money, which does not have to be repaid, can go toward past-due landline phone, electric, natural gas and water service bills, the utility said.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A school board has voted to ignore state guidelines on protecting transgender students rather than change its policies as the law requires before the school year starts. The Newport News School Board voted 5-1 against the change with one member abstaining at a crowded meeting Tuesday, The Daily Press reports. Newport News is one of the largest districts in the state and among the first in Hampton Roads to refuse to follow the law passed last year. Under the law, school districts must adopt policies consistent with or more comprehensive than the model policies. They include allowing students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms that conform to their gender identity and allowing students to use pronouns and a name that reflect their gender identity. Most board members said they wanted more information, citing their discomfort with parts of the guidelines. Before the vote, Chair Douglas Brown said there’s nothing stopping the district from spending more time on the matter before revisiting it. Still, Brown said the law violates the rights of Christian parents like him who believe kids aren’t capable of making choices about their gender.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities say there are more people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state than at any time during the pandemic. Cassie Sauer, president of the Washington State Hospital Association. said as of Thursday morning there were 1,240 people with the coronavirus in state hospitals. The previous highest number was about 1,100 in December. “Hospitals are still really, really full across the state,” Sauer said at a news conference. Hospitals are also seeing more people due to the effects of recent heat waves, smoke from wildfires and injuries due to summer activities. Sauer said until the recent uptick in cases and hospitalizations due to the delta variant, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate in the state had been holding steady at about 300 to 350 people. The numbers began increasing in early July and have been doubling about every two weeks. There has been a slight slowing in COVID-19 admissions recently, but Sauer said it’s too early to say if that’s a trend. To help free up capacity, Sauer said hospitals have been working with the state to move other patients who can be discharged into places like long-term care facilities. “We will have plenty of capacity if we can move patients out,” she said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh toured an underground coal mine for the first time, joining U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin at a northern West Virginia facility Wednesday. Walsh did his best to signal that Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration won’t be an enemy of the coal industry as he and Manchin visited American Consolidated Natural Resources’ Golden Ridge Portal Mine near Wheeling. “It was quite the experience, I’ll tell you that,” Walsh said in a telephone interview on his way back to Washington, D.C. He described donning the proper safety equipment, taking an elevator ride down to the mine, and then a mantrip ride by rail to the longwall to watch a machine grind and extract coal from the seam. Walsh’s agency oversees the Mine Safety and Health Administration as well as the administration of benefits for coal miners disabled by black lung disease. “I felt it was really important for me to go down and get a feel for what mine workers do,” Walsh said. “I have a different understanding and appreciation of the work.” Democratic candidates for president have struggled in recent years to connect with voters in West Virginia, in part due to a push toward clean energy under the Obama administration. Still, despite his promises, coal did not come roaring back under Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin Dells: The Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park is building the nation’s first rotating waterslide as part of a $23 million expansion. The project includes a new 22,500-square-foot building attached to the indoor waterpark. The rotating waterslide, named Medusa’s Slidewheel, is a four-person raft ride that combines the rotation of a Ferris wheel with the propulsion of a waterslide, according to a news release from architecture and engineer firm Ramaker and Associates, which is working on the project. Outside the United States, the only other rotating waterslides are in China and Poland, the news release said. Mount Olympus announced the project on its Facebook page Aug. 6. Construction began in July and is scheduled to be completed by Memorial Day 2022. “It will be the coolest slide that ever hit the waterpark industry,” Mount Olympus CEO and owner Nick Laskaris told WiscNews. “Not just the Dells, but the industry as a whole.” In addition to Medusa’s Slidewheel, the indoor waterpark expansion project will include a large swimming pool area, Laskaris told WiscNews. The existing indoor waterpark will be remodeled to match the new addition, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Marijuana advocates plan to begin circulating petitions in September for two proposed ballot measures – one asking if the state should legalize medical marijuana, and the other if it should decriminalize pot. The Wyoming Attorney General’s Office this week approved the wording of the proposed questions. The Secretary of State’s Office has now begun the process of seeking bids for printing the petitions. The process ends Aug. 25. The Wyoming chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws plans to begin gathering signatures on or soon after Sept. 1. “We’ll be hitting events, going door to door. We intend to get it all wrapped up by February,” Wyoming NORML Executive Director Bennett Sondeno said Wednesday. The group has a “big list” of Wyoming events where it plans to gather signatures in the next few months, Sondeno said. February is the deadline to submit enough valid signatures to the Wyoming secretary of state to get the measures before voters in the 2022 general election, Sondeno said. Wyoming is among a minority of states that don’t allow cannabis in some fashion.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/25/oil-train-conversion-sit-anniversary-healing-garden-expansion-news-around-states/111368136/", "title": "Oil train conversion, sit-in anniversary: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A three-day event is marking the 60th anniversary of the state’s first sit-in against racial segregation. Five of the surviving demonstrators were on hand Monday for a remembrance at Alabama State University in Montgomery. Civil rights lawyer Fred Gray of Tuskegee was also set to participate, according to an announcement from the school. Alabama State, a center of activity during the civil rights era, is also hosting events through Wednesday, including a panel discussion of elected officials and a presentation of scholarly papers about the sit-in and its legacy. A student sit-in began Feb. 25, 1960, at the Montgomery County Courthouse snack bar, where 35 black women and men asked to be served in defiance of the city’s segregation law. They were inspired by the Greensboro four, who started the sit-ins campaign at a lunch counter in North Carolina just weeks earlier. Then-Gov. John Patterson, a segregationist, made Alabama State expel any students who participated by threatening its state funding. Nine students identified as leaders were kicked out of school.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Landslides that caused road closures last year have raised concerns about whether there will be full access to Denali National Park and Preserve for the upcoming tourism season. The National Park Service has said it plans to open the entire Denali Park Road by early June, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The 92-mile road running through steep mountain passes provides the only driving access into the park’s 7,344 square miles. The park service repeatedly closed parts of the road last summer amid heavy rains, rockfall and mudslides. Recent National Park Service surveys found the speed of a landslide at Pretty Rocks section of the road has increased dramatically since September, and the road was slumping nearly 2 inches every day after August. Private vehicles are restricted beyond Mile 15 of the road. But hundreds of thousands of visitors each year use buses run by commercial operators to take them farther into the park. Business owners inside the park rely on the road to bring in supplies for guests.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A new task force will focus on decreasing cases of animal hoarding across Pima County. The Pima Animal Care Center and other community organizations will meet Tuesday to discuss how to help overwhelmed pet owners before they get to the point of hoarding. Center officials say animal hoarding is not necessarily just about the number of pets in a home but about whether the owner can actually support them, the Arizona Daily Star reports. Kristen Hassen, animal services director, says the task force wants to change how hoarding cases are handled. It will work with pet owners and connect them with community resources. Two part-time public health nurses will be available to talk with owners, Hassen says. In addition, owners will get assistance with spaying, neutering and pet vaccination services. In 2019, the Pima County animal shelter took in almost 19,000 animals – many from hoarding situations and with medical conditions.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The Baxter County Historical and Genealogical Society will meet Tuesday at 6p.m. in the Knox Community Room of the Baxter County Library. Admission is free, and guests are welcome. The evening’s guest speaker will be Roy Stovall, speaking about “The de Soto Entrada” and its significance to Arkansas history and archaeology. Conquistador Hernando de Soto and his men, the first Europeans to explore Arkansas, trekked 4,000 miles from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Brazos River 480 years ago. The adventurers spent two years in what would become Arkansas before de Soto met his death near the Mississippi River. Stovall has made an extensive study of the expedition as a lifetime member of the Arkansas Archeological Society.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The first new state park campground on the California coast in 30 years is expected to feature ocean frontage on Monterey Bay when it opens in 2022. Fort Ord Dunes State Park has 4 miles of ocean beach on the bay and is located near Marina, south of Moss Landing and north of Monterey, The San Francisco Chronicle reports. A former military unit, Fort Ord Dunes opened 10 years ago with little supporting infrastructure and is one of a handful of state parks providing free parking and access. The area is sometimes overlooked because unlike most state parks along the Pacific Coast Highway, Fort Ord Dunes does not have a direct turnoff to parking from Highway 1. A boardwalk has been planned to allow access to the beach without damage crossing sensitive dunes. Two overlook areas are expected to provide views of Monterey Bay, historic Fort Ord, and oceanfront cities Sand City, Seaside and Monterey.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad has debuted its first locomotive that runs on oil, a more environmentally friendly fuel source that holds less fire risk than a traditional coal-burning engine. For the past two years, the D&SNG’s crews have worked to convert the No. 493, an early 1900s coal-burning locomotive, to be able to run off oil. It’s the first of what’s expected to be several conversions from coal-fired to oil-burning engines as the city’s top tourist attraction braces itself for the future. “We need to be prepared and just recognize the changing climate,” owner Al Harper told The Durango Herald. Coal-burning engines can emit small cinders from their smokestacks and start fires. Harper said it’s important to have the option of running oil-powered locomotives during extreme drought. This issue came to a head in summer 2018, when drought, high fire danger and the 416 Fire caused the D&SNG to shut down for more than 40 days.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStratford: A school board member who was accused of sexually assaulting a teen is resisting calls to resign from his post. Stratford Board of Education Member Robert DeLorenzo took a plea deal in the case and was convicted of first-degree reckless endangerment, The Connecticut Post reports. Democratic Town Committee Chair Stephanie Phillips and others have called on DeLorenzo, a Democrat, to resign from the board. But DeLorenzo says he has no plans to step down and insists the efforts to get him to resign are politically motivated. “I said 10 times I am not stepping down,” he told the newspaper. Police said DeLorenzo assaulted a 13-year-old girl, who told authorities that DeLorenzo told her he would kill her if she told anyone about it. DeLorenzo denies ever assaulting the girl.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s Council on Development Finance on Monday approved a $4.5million grant for Amazon, which says it is bringing about 1,000 full-time jobs to the former General Motors plant in Newport. A Nevada-based distribution company that counts Amazon as a client plans those jobs and more seasonal ones for a 3.7 million-square-foot logistics warehouse, according to a presentation from Amazon at the Buena Vista conference center in New Castle. Amazon’s application for the money was not readily available to the public during the hearing. Monday’s agenda offered little more detail on the application, only revealing that Amazon was seeking the $4.5 million to “establish its operations in Wilmington, Delaware.” The $4.5 million will come from Delaware’s Strategic Fund, a pool of state money meant for attracting businesses and growing jobs in the First State.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Children’s Museum of D.C. officially opened Monday. The new attraction is the perfect place to spark a child’s curiosity and creativity, WUSA-TV reports. Located at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, adjacent to the Ronald Reagan Building, it features exhibits including the Dream Machine, which allows kids to climb up to the clouds and slide down a huge slide that is also wheelchair-accessible. The museum was built to connect with all kids and also includes a mother’s room with stroller parking, quiet rooms for sensory-friendly kids, open captioning with audio for every video and, upon request, a personalized verbal description and sighted guide for guests who are blind. Admission is just $10.95 for adults and children over 1 year old. Pop-ups and family workshops are also expected to be a part of the experience.\n\nFlorida\n\nTavares: Seven decades after four young black men were accused of raping a white woman in a 1949 case now seen as a miscarriage of justice, the central Florida county where their case took place has erected a monument in their honor. The monument honoring Charles Greenlee, Walter Irvin, Samuel Shepherd and Ernest Thomas was unveiled Friday during a ceremony at the Lake County Historic Courthouse. The granite memorial for the men known as the Groveland Four features a bronze plaque imprinted with a written account of the men’s ordeal, which was prepared with the help of their families. “While we cannot change the past, we can learn from it, and we can assure that our institutions today provide equal and fair justice to all,” said Lake County Commission Chairman Leslie Campione. A year ago, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state’s three-member Cabinet granted posthumous pardons to the men. The case of the Groveland Four is considered a blight on Florida’s history. One of the four was killed before he could be charged. One of the remaining men was fatally shot by the local sheriff and another shot and wounded by the sheriff and a deputy. A third man was wrongly imprisoned.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgians could get a chance to vote on making it easier to sue state government under a constitutional amendment moving forward in the General Assembly. The House voted 163-0 on Thursday to pass House Resolution 1023. It moves to the Senate, where it would need a two-thirds vote to make it to the election ballot for a referendum. “It makes sense to amend the constitution so that people can come to the courthouse and seek redress,” said Rep. Andy Welch, a McDonough Republican who has been pushing the effort for several years. Bills to broaden the grounds for suits have been vetoed twice, first by Gov. Nathan Deal in 2016 and then again by Gov. Brian Kemp last year. However, the governor has no power to reject a proposed constitutional amendment. Lawmakers are reacting to a 2014 state Supreme Court decision that says state and local governments can only be sued when they have waived a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity. That’s a principle descended from English common law, commonly described as “the king can do no wrong.” When Georgia overthrew the king in 1776, that cloak of legal protection transferred to the state government.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A bill aimed at raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco and electronic smoking devices has stalled in the state House of Representatives. The bill proposed to make it illegal for anyone younger than 25 to buy the products, West Hawaii Today reports. Democratic Reps. Richard Creagan and John Mizuno, the chairman of the House Committee on Health, introduced the bill that was unanimously passed by the health committee Feb. 4. The measure also passed a full reading on the House floor but did not secure required hearings before the House Judiciary and Finance committees. The bill subsequently missed a deadline for moving bills with multiple referrals to a final committee. The bill cited the harmful effect of nicotine on developing brains, particularly youth and young adults and unborn children, as well as a study by the Institute of Medicine that found raising the minimum purchase age led to decreases in smoking prevalence and mortality.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A transgender rights group says it’s suing the state over a proposed bill that makes it illegal for someone to change their gender identity on a birth certificate, according to a television station’s report. The National Association of Transgendered People prepared the lawsuit and planned to file it Monday, KBOI-TV reports. The House Education Committee held a hearing on the bill last week and recommended sending it to the full House for a vote. The bill introduced by Rep. Julianne Young, a Republican, would ban changes to a birth certificate if more than a year has passed since the person’s birth. The bill is in conflict with a 2018 ruling by a federal magistrate that said Idaho must accept applications from transgender people who wish to change their gender on their birth certificates to confirm with their gender identity. Idaho has been complying with the federal ruling.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Supporters of the revitalization of the historic Pullman neighborhood say they have the money for more restoration work, five years after then-President Barack Obama designated part of the area as a national monument. Longtime supporters gathered with National Park Service officials Wednesday on the city’s Far South Side to celebrate the five-year anniversary of the monument designation as leaders unveiled the latest renderings for a more than $56 million revitalization project. A central part of the restoration is the Pullman Clock Tower and Administration building, which will convert into a visitors center. That’s expected to be completed next year. The neighborhood was built by industrialist George M. Pullman in the 19th century for people who worked at his state-of-the-art factory building luxurious railroad sleeping cars. The harsh working conditions aboard Pullman’s sleeping cars helped spur the birth of the African American labor movement.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local government officials and environmentalists oppose a project proposing to burn or harvest parts of the Hoosier National Forest because they are concerned it could contaminate the only source of drinking water for more than 140,000 people. The U.S. Forest Service approved the Houston South Vegetation Management and Restoration project last week. Federal officials point out that projects such as this are a common means of maintaining forest health. But critics say it could worsen existing water-quality issues in the Lake Monroe reservoir, which serves all of Monroe County. “Lake Monroe is the surface drinking water source for not only Monroe County but also surrounding areas,” said Monroe County Commissioner Julie Thomas, a vocal opponent of the project. “We’re really concerned.” It wasn’t until Lake Monroe was created in the 1960s that Bloomington finally had a stable source of drinking water.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court elected Justice Susan Christensen as its next chief justice Monday, making her only the second woman to rise to chief of the seven-member court. Appointed by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2018, Christensen is part of a new, more conservatively constituted court. Reynolds has named three justices to the court since becoming governor and will name a fourth after acting Chief Justice David Wiggins retires next month. Wiggins, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack, became acting chief after the unexpected death of Chief Justice Mark Cady in November from a heart attack. Cady had chosen Wiggins to take the post if he were to become incapacitated. Wiggins announced last month his plans to retire March 13. Christensen was a lawyer before becoming a district court judge. She is married with five children and five grandchildren. Her father, Jerry Larson, was a justice on the Iowa Supreme Court for 30 years until his retirement in 2008.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State lawmakers are considering making changes to the criminal public offender registry system and cutting back on penalties. The expansive system that publicly tracks convicted criminals after they’ve served their time covers a wide range of crimes beyond sex offenses, Kansas News Service reports. Now, some policymakers believe it’s time to ease the rules. Marc Schultz, convicted of manslaughter for hitting and killing a cyclist while driving drunk in 2010, said he didn’t intentionally commit a violent crime but still has to be listed among those who committed crimes like sexual assault, human trafficking or kidnapping. “When people look at that map, they don’t know the difference between the dots that they see,” Schultz said, noting a map with too many offenders makes it less useful for the public. Proposed changes include reducing penalties for not registering properly and changing the 15-year registration term for those convicted of crimes, like drug distribution, to only face a five-year registration term.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Authorities are asking for the public’s help in finding those responsible for poaching two elk. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources said on its Facebook page that two bull elk were poached Thursday in the Ball Creek area of Knott County. The post shows a photo of two severed elk heads. The department said it is offering a $4,000 reward leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. It said the League of Kentucky Sportsmen and Safari Club International’s Kentuckiana Chapter donated toward the reward. Tips can be called in to the department or to Kentucky State Police in Hazard.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A textile museum at Louisiana State University is growing and will reopen its renovated, larger space with an exhibition celebrating four decades of its collection. The opening exhibition in the LSU Textile and Costume Museum’s new gallery will include a 1960s special occasion dress designed by American designer James Galanos; a 1938 SEC Championship LSU boxing robe; and the outfit worn by Baton Rouge WAFB-TV personality “Buckskin Bill” Black. Other items include clothing from past governors and their spouses; an 1840s/1850s day dress; a Haspel labeled seersucker man’s suit; and non-western artifacts such as a 19th century Chinese “dragon robe.” The exhibition can be viewed by the public Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. from March 30 to April 6. The museum will celebrate the grand opening of its exhibition gallery March 28. The event will feature local reality TV star Anthony Ryan, winner of “Project Runway All Stars” and an alumnus of the university’s textiles, apparel and merchandising program.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State conservation officials are asking residents to take a few steps to cut down the spread of invasive species. The Pine Tree State’s effort is taking place during National Invasive Species Awareness Week. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry said the state suffers from non-native species such as the emerald ash borer and green crab that have a negative impact on natural resources. The department is asking residents to take steps such as clipping the webs of browntail moth caterpillars before they get active. The caterpillars can cause a painful rash in humans. Residents should also avoid releasing aquarium fish and plants, live bait or other exotic animals into the wild, the state said. Another helpful step is to learn how to identify invasive plants that might be growing on private property and take steps to control them.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Some state lawmakers want to ban the practice of offering sexual assault victims a waiver that says they don’t want to go forward their case. The Baltimore Sun reports some legislators want to do away with the waivers so that victims aren’t discouraged to report and prosecute the crimes. Experts say investigators sometimes misuse waiver forms to pressure victims to stop pursuing charges or to get cases off their plate without a thorough investigation. Some police departments have recently stopped the practice. But the Harford County Sheriff’s Office continues to use waiver forms. The sheriff said the waivers are used “sparingly” and only when a victim has requested that an investigation end. The proposed legislation would stop police from presenting victims with forms that prevent prosecution of the crime or waive the victim’s rights.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A week after Plymouth Rock was defaced with graffiti, it appears as if vandals have targeted the historic town’s 9/11 memorial. A statue of a police officer was knocked over sometime over the weekend, and two nearby lamp posts were knocked over. The statue’s head was knocked off. A nearby figure of a firefighter was untouched. On Feb. 16, Plymouth Rock, the symbolic spot of the Pilgrims’ landing 400 years ago, was covered in paint. Vandals also targeted the Pilgrim Maiden statue and several other significant spots. It was not clear if the two vandalism cases are connected. The Sept. 11 memorial, unveiled in 2004, was privately funded by businessman and former Selectman Richard Quintal, who donated the land on which the memorial sits. No arrests have been announced in either case.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State officials have recognized three trails as “Pure Michigan Trails” because they provide access to high-quality scenic views. They also designated three communities as “Pure Michigan Trail Towns.” The label refers to towns or cities along trail routes that provide vibrant experiences for users. The Canada Lakes Pathway in Luce County, the historic Haywire Grade in Schoolcraft and Alger counties, and the Kal-Haven Trail in Van Buren and Kalamazoo counties joined the ranks of Pure Michigan Trails. Cheboygan, Reed City and Oakland County’s Orion Township were added to the roster of Pure Michigan Trail Towns. “With four seasons of trail recreation fun available, Michigan truly is home to a variety of great trails and trail towns,” said Paul Yauk, DNR state trails coordinator. He said the trails and towns receiving Pure Michigan designation provide some of the state’s elite trail experiences; promote healthy lifestyles; conserve natural and cultural resources; and boost local economies.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The city has paused plans to issue its own identification cards that would be available regardless of a person’s immigration status. Mayor Jacob Frey said Friday that the move was made in part because of concerns that the information could be used to identify immigrants for deportation. He said the city wants to ensure “people signing up for the ID card are protected.” The Star Tribune reports the discussions about how and whether to proceed come at a time when many cities are looking for ways to resist immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump. Minneapolis approved the creation of a municipal ID program in 2018 but had been discussing it for many years. Supporters said having a form of identification is crucial to opening a bank account, receiving health care and, in some cases, picking up children from school.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: About 450 homes were damaged in Hinds and Madison counties from flooding in the Jackson metro area earlier this month. Before the flooding from the Pearl River started, officials had projected up to 2,500 structures, including about 1,000 homes, could be affected. Mississippi Emergency Management officials said Monday in an email that the number is a rough estimate and is likely to change. MEMA on Monday began conducting in-depth damage assessments. In Rankin County, about 18 structures reportedly were damaged, with fewer than five that were homes, Rankin County Emergency Management Director Mike Word said. The Pearl River at Jackson is slowly receding but will take a few days before it reaches below-flood stage levels. MEMA officials said the water has receded across affected areas around Jackson, and river levels will continue to fall throughout the week.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A fired Kansas City Public Schools secretary who was among seven employees accused of falsifying attendance data in a bid to help the district regain accreditation said she and her co-workers were following orders from top administrators. Former Central Middle School secretary LaQuyn Collier told The Kansas City Star that she gave administrators “exactly what they said they needed.” She and another fired employee have hired an attorney to try to get their jobs back. Emails obtained by the newspaper show that administrators asked secretaries to gather at the district’s central office to review “several attendance recording issues” in the summer of 2014 during the time in which an investigation found the tampering happened. Attendance is among the criteria Missouri uses in giving out performance scores that determine whether a district is unaccredited, partially accredited or fully accredited.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana State Parks’ free lease of 337 acres at Hell Creek on Fort Peck Reservoir expires in 2021, and between now and then, the state is planning to negotiate a new 20-year lease with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Hell Creek Marina and adjoining state park create a complexity not found at other state parks, the Billings Gazette reports. Clint and Deb Thomas own and run Hell Creek Marina. The marina operates on a lease from Montana State Parks, which oversees adjacent Hell Creek State Park. “I am not a concessionaire,” Thomas emphasized. He owns the marina buildings, including a small motel, docks, store and other improvements to the property. “I’ve got $2 million invested.” That’s not the case at other areas, such as Tongue River Reservoir State Park, where Montana State Parks owns the marina’s facilities and hires a concessionaire to operate it.\n\nNebraska\n\nGretna: A wildlife biologist will present a program next month about people-powered science and wildlife observation. The presentation March 15 is part of a Sunday speaker series at Schramm Education Center. The presenter will be Alie Mayes, a biologist with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. Her program is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. at the center, which sits along Nebraska Highway 31 near the Platte River, about 6 miles south of Exit 432 off Interstate 80. Contact Amber Schiltz for more information at amber.schiltz@nebraska.gov or 402-332-5022.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sanctuary garden for those affected by the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting is expanding. The city will be adding more features – including a fire pit, a walkway covered in greenery and a pear tree – to the Healing Garden, which was created also as a place to honor the 58 victims, KTNV-TV reports. City officials say they hope to complete the expansion in May, with access for the public in June. A Callery pear tree near the World Trade Center in New York City became known as the “Survivor Tree” after the 9/11 attacks. Its seedlings are given to communities who have also experienced tragedy. The Oct. 1, 2017, shooting during an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The volunteer-built garden features a tree for each of the 58 victims and an oak that represents life. It was dedicated during the shooting’s first anniversary.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Statistics released for 2018 show that heart disease was the leading cause of death in New Hampshire, marking the first time in over a decade that it surpassed cancer, state health officials said Monday. More than 2,600 New Hampshire residents died from heart disease that year, the state Department of Health and Human Services said. Nationally, heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women. About 647,000 Americans die from heart disease each year, accounting for 1 in every 4 deaths. High blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking are major risk factors for heart disease.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHardwick Township: A forest fire burning through a popular hiking area that is crossed by the Appalachian Trail and a major interstate highway was about 80% contained by Monday afternoon, state fire officials said. The fire began Sunday afternoon on Mount Tammany, a steep, rugged area of New Jersey’s Worthington State Forest and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area on the New Jersey-Pennsylvania border. Fire officials said about 80 acres had burned by Monday. A helicopter and 40 firefighters were working to put the fire out Monday, officials said. Greg McLaughlin, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fires Service, said no injuries had been reported. A cause for the fire had not been determined, officials said. Chris Franek, the state forest fire service’s assistant division fire warden, said fires on similar terrain usually burn upward, but Sunday’s fire, which started below a trail at an elevation of about 1,400 feet, burned downhill because the trail area is rocky and without abundant vegetation. He said fires are rare there at this time of year because the area usually has a layer of snow.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An analysis shows the city’s police are taking 93% longer to respond to 911 calls than nine years ago. KOAT-TV reports an examination on the Albuquerque Police Department’s response times shows officers now take an average of 48 minutes to arrive to a scene. That’s a 23-minute jump from 2011. Albuquerque Emergency Communications Center manager Erika Wilson says police are during the best they can with the resources available. Albuquerque police say the department currently has about 950 officers. In 2011, it had about 1,100 officers. “We are in a pickle,” said Shaun Willoughby, president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, the union that represents Albuquerque cops. “The Albuquerque Police Department is understaffed. It has been for a number of years.” FBI statistics show Albuquerque had a violent crime rate of 1,365 per 100,000 residents in 2018. The national rate was about 369 violent crimes per 100,000 residents that year.\n\nNew York\n\nSeneca Falls: A long-simmering leadership dispute in the Cayuga Indian Nation erupted over the weekend with bulldozers razing several buildings on Cayuga land in western New York. The buildings demolished early Saturday in Seneca Falls housed several businesses, a longhouse and a day care center. A statement from the Cayuga Nation said it demolished the buildings for public safety reasons. It said the properties were seized in 2014 by a group that disputes the authority of Cayuga leader Clint Halftown, who ordered the demolition. Halftown’s Cayuga Nation Council is officially recognized by the U.S. government. The opposing faction that controlled the buildings since 2014 is the Traditional Cayuga Nation Chiefs and Clan Mothers. A statement from the traditional faction’s counsel, Joe Heath, called Saturday’s demolition “viciously unlawful.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nForneys Creek: The Hidgon Family Cemetery in the Great Smoky Mountains has become a source of mystery for the National Park Service. On the North Carolina side of the park stands a slanted granite tombstone that says only: “A Black Man” – no name, no date, no epitaph, The Charlotte Observer reports. Now park historians say they’re determined to figure out who he was and why he was afforded a costly grave marker with no hint of identification, as part of a project documenting “the African American experience in the Smokies.” “This research project is facing common obstacles: the African American members of the communities are nameless and faceless in typical historical records,” the park service wrote on Facebook. Some bloggers believe the man was “elderly” when he died around 1920, during a period when the “Spanish Flue” had overtaken Swain County, according to a report in Reflections of Olde Swain.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A nonprofit group that arranges trips for veterans to visit Washington memorials dedicated to them will now have its first honor flight chapter dedicated to area veterans in western North Dakota. The local chapter, Western North Dakota Honor Flight, announced its start a week ago with Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., in attendance, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The local chapter is the first since the Rough Rider Honor Flight Network ceased in 2011 after operating for two years. The group hopes to raise $160,000 through sponsorships, fundraisers and donations to send about 100 area veterans to the nation’s capital on a private plane. The two-day trip planned for this fall will be free to the veterans, but they do have to apply to participate in the program.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has signed a bill under which motorcyclists in the state would be allowed to wear earphones or earplugs while riding to ward off hearing loss. The state House and Senate previously approved the legislation, which would prohibit motorcyclists from listening to music or other entertainment while wearing the ear protection. The Republican DeWine signed it into law Friday, and it takes effect in 90 days. Noise from the wind and engines can produce severe hearing loss for motorcyclists, said Sen. Rob McColley, a Republican from Napoleon in northwestern Ohio. There was no public opposition, and proponents said riders would still be able to hear sirens and car horns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Native American tribes suing the state over tribal gambling compacts oppose requests by two tribes to intervene in the lawsuit. The Dec. 31 lawsuit by the Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw nations asks a federal judge to determine whether compacts allowing gambling exclusively at tribal casinos automatically renewed Jan. 1. Mediation was ordered after Gov. Kevin Stitt asked the judge to order the casinos to stop offering certain games, including electronic and table games. Several tribes intervened, but they oppose intervention by the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians and the Kialegee Tribal Town, saying they have no valid claim. “UKB and Kialegee do not conduct gaming pursuant to (Indian Gaming and Regulatory Act) Compacts and are not developing any projects to engage in gaming,” as do the tribes in the lawsuit, according to the Feb. 18 motion.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city intentionally allows drivers to park vehicles illegally close to crosswalks and intersections, making it difficult to navigate the city and potentially deadly for all road users, a lawsuit filed last week in Multnomah County Circuit Court says. The lawsuit seeks to address what attorney Scott Kocher describes as Portland’s “ongoing failure” to provide adequate sight distance at street corners or crosswalks, the Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Kocher is using the 2019 death of a motorcyclist, one of 49 people killed in what was the deadliest year since 1997, as a test case to argue the city’s negligence. The family of Elijah Coe, a 48-year-old chef who was killed on East Burnside Street in May, is seeking $5.9 million in damages and demands the city retrofit its intersections to comply with its own code governing sight distances as well as state law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nState College: Hundreds of Penn State students have raised more than $11 million dollars for pediatric cancer patients in the annual 46-hour dance marathon known as Thon. The $11,696,942.38 total was announced Sunday afternoon at the conclusion of the Penn State Interfraternity Council/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, billed as the world’s largest student-run philanthropy. Money raised benefits pediatric cancer patients and their families at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. Child cancer survivors and their families also participate along with the dancers, who aren’t allowed to sleep or even sit and are helped by thousands of other students in support roles. The amount raised this year was more than $1 million beyond last year’s total. Before this year’s event, officials said the dance marathon had raised more than $168 million since 1977.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s main airport is getting a $4.7 million grant to modernize the terminal, acquire land and study effective noise reduction strategies. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, announced the Airport Improvement Program grant for the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, the quasi-public agency that oversees the airport’s operations. Most of the federal funding will be used to renovate restrooms and other public facilities in the 24-year-old airport terminal, Reed said. The renovations are expected to be complete this summer. About $400,000 will be used to purchase 1.3 acres of vacant property within a runway protection zone for one of the runways. About $90,000 will be used to help update noise exposure maps that were generated in 2010.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State lawmakers are looking to end a practice that allowed police officers to patrol by themselves for up to a year without training. The idea for decades was to allow small police forces to use newly hired officers immediately after putting them on the payroll because it could take months to get a slot in the state’s only police training academy in Columbia. But the death of an untrained officer in a shooting during a traffic stop in Florence in January and the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy revamping its training program to eliminate the months­long wait have four former law enforcement members writing a bill to change things. The proposal would only allow an officer without the certification earned through 12 weeks of training to patrol or arrest someone if they are with a certified officer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A new app is helping American Indian youth learn math that can be taught in their native Lakota language. The bilingual English and Lakota math video game was created by the Thunder Valley Community Development Corp., a South Dakota nonprofit that promotes Native American issues. The “Making Camp: Lakota” app is free and can be downloaded on mobile devices and computer desktops, KOTA-TV reports. It is meant mainly to help fourth- and fifth-grade students. A historical video introduces each section of the game explaining cultural symbols like eagle feathers, buffalo and horses. Mary Bowman, an Oceti Sakhalin teacher with the Rapid City Area School District, said it’s a key part of the curriculum. Culturally responsive teaching increases children’s achievement levels because the children are more engaged and learn more, she said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: As part of the kickoff to its 20th anniversary year, Stax Music Academy will present a special Black History Month concert Tuesday. The event, titled “Let’s Do It Again,” will take place at the Rose Theatre on the campus of the University of Memphis. In addition to performing the classics, Stax Music Academy will show the lasting influence and continuing impact of the label by playing contemporary songs – by artists ranging from Destiny’s Child to Ariana Grande – that incorporate or sample familiar Stax sounds. Pat Mitchell Worley, executive director of Stax Music Academy, said the theme of the concert is a way to connect multiple generations of music fans. The Black History Month concert is typically Stax Music Academy’s biggest show of the year, and “Let’s Do It Again” will feature appearances by all its various groups, including the a capella, jazz, and junior and senior high school ensembles. There will be two performances Tuesday: a daytime event exclusively for Memphis middle and high school students and an evening concert that will be open to the public. Tickets are $20 for adults. Youth tickets are $10.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The “Leaning Tower of Dallas,” a social media sensation born when a part of a building survived implosion, endured scores of blows from a wrecking ball Monday. Dozens of people gathered downtown to watch as a crane was used to batter the former Affiliated Computer Services building. The 11-story building found a second life online after surviving a first demolition attempt. It inspired jokes and comparisons to Italy’s Leaning Tower of Pisa when a Feb. 16 implosion failed to bring down its core. The company that engineered the blast said some explosives did not go off. In the following week, people flocked to the site to post photos of themselves pretending to prop up the lopsided tower. The remainder of the building proved resilient Monday, and some onlookers were nonplussed by the ball that began swinging about 9 a.m. As demolition work took place, an online petition to “save this landmark from destruction” continued to draw signatures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: U.S. officials have dropped plans to sell energy leases in a popular recreational area renowned for its mountain biking trails. The reversal by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management comes after local businesses, officials and Gov. Gary Herbert raised concerns about potential effects to the Slickrock Trail near Moab. The two lease parcels would have covered about two-thirds of the 10.5-mile trail and been barely a mile from Arches National Park. The 9,000-acre Sand Flats area that includes the trail is visited by 160,000 people a year, many of them drawn to the undulating, rocky trails that pose a challenge to mountain bikers. The U.S. land agency co-manages the recreation area with Grand County, an arrangement in place since 1994. Under President Donald Trump, the amount of acreage leased for oil and gas in Western states has been sharply increasing, raising concerns among conservationists about potential damage to the environment.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Department of Fish and Wildlife is proposing to issue 55 moose hunting permits for this fall in the wildlife management unit along the state’s borders with Quebec and New Hampshire. The October hunt would result in the taking of an estimated 33 moose. The target for the area known as Wildlife Management Unit E is designed to reduce the impact of winter ticks on the moose population. “Moose density in WMU E is more than one moose per square mile, significantly higher than any other part of the state,” said moose biologist Nick Fortin. The suggestion for the number of moose hunting permits came after Fish and Wildlife worked with University of Vermont researchers to study moose health and survival in the wildlife management unit by tagging 36 cows and 90 calves with GPS tracking collars. The study found that chronic high winter tick loads have caused the decline in moose health.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers passed a bill Monday that scraps the state’s Lee-Jackson holiday celebrating two Confederate generals and replaces it with one on Election Day. The House approved legislation that had already cleared the Senate, advancing the measure to Gov. Ralph Northam, who supports it. Lee-Jackson Day, established more than 100 years ago, is observed annually on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January. It honors Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, both native Virginians. Critics of the Lee-Jackson holiday view it as a celebration of the state’s slaveholding history that’s offensive to African Americans. Many cities and counties have opted not to observe it. “Voting is our most fundamental right as Americans – and it is past time we stopped celebrating men who worked actively to uphold the system of slavery,” Northam said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Potato farmers in Skagit County suffered big losses after they were unable to harvest some of their crops due to early and heavy rainfall. The county’s farmers were unable to harvest an estimated 3 square miles of potatoes in the fall, with losses valued between $5 million and $10 million, The Skagit Valley Herald reports. Don McMoran of the Washington State University Skagit County Extension said farmers often do not harvest some land each season, but a loss of that size is rare. Farmers are also worried about the condition of potatoes they harvested that are sitting in storage, McMoran said. “When you harvest under wet conditions, you’re going to have the potential for more disease concerns,” he said. Potatoes are the county’s most valuable crop, bringing in about $60 million to growers annually, according to extension statistics.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Wildlife officials have proposed 16 changes to the state’s hunting and fishing regulations. Officials with the Division of Natural Resources met Sunday and explained the rationale for the changes, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. The proposals will be voted on during meetings in May and August. Some of the bigger proposals included lengthening the spring turkey-hunting season, changing smallmouth-bass fishing regulations along the New River, expanding nighttime hunting for coyotes and imposing a creel limit on panfish. The proposal to lengthen the spring turkey season from 27 days to 35 days would provide additional days of hunting recreation, said Paul Johansen, the agency’s wildlife chief. The proposal to expand nighttime hunting for coyotes to year-round is an answer to requests from predator hunters.\n\nWisconsin\n\nElm Grove: A historic church and convent is being sold to a local development firm that plans to convert much of that space to apartments. Mandel Group Inc. has agreed to buy the 30-acre School Sisters of Notre Dame complex, according to an announcement Monday. Mandel has done some preliminary work on plans to redevelop the site but hasn’t yet determined how many apartments could be built there, said Dan Romnek, a development associate at the firm. The development would likely blend preserved buildings with new construction, he said. The two main buildings, Notre Dame Hall and Maria Hall, are to be preserved, Romnek said. Mandel is considering plans for the property’s other buildings, some of which could be demolished, he said. A detailed proposal is to be filed with Elm Grove officials this summer for a Plan Commission and Village Board review, Romnek said. Mandel plans to talk to neighbors before submitting those plans.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Land owners on a Native American reservation will be able to sell their property to the federal government through a program meant to return ownership to the reservation’s two tribes. The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Land Buy-Back Program for tribal nations will enable the purchases on the Wind River Reservation, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. Participation in the program is voluntary, and only tribal members with allotments will be eligible to sell their land. Much of the property was allotted to tribal members by the government but is often underutilized due to a tangle of ownership. The original allotments have been passed down through generations for the reservation’s tribes to control, but tangled ownership webs can result in hundreds or thousands of owners of a single allotment. After the property is returned to tribal jurisdiction, the land could be used for purposes including economic development, right-of-ways, cultural preservation and housing.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/25"}]}

Orthopox refers to pox viruses in general.\n\n\"It is likely that there are going to be additional cases reported in the United States,\" said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, a veterinarian and deputy director of the CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology.\n\nBrooks said the CDC decided to hold a news conference about the outbreak now because LGBTQ Pride month usually kicks off around the Memorial Day weekend, and officials wanted to make sure the community was aware of the situation. He also urged doctors to be on the lookout for the disease, because it can look like other types of STDs.\n\n\"In some cases, during the early stages of illness, the rash has been mostly in the genital and perianal area,\" Brooks said. \"In some cases, it has produced anal or genital lesions that look like other diseases like herpes or chickenpox or syphilis.\n\n\"What we're trying to do by bringing attention to the fact that some of these cases have had a genital and perianal presentation is just to remind people that people may come in for an evaluation of what they think is an STD, but we'd like the provider to think 'could it be monkeypox as well?' if the circumstances fit the story,\" Brooks added.\n\nMonkeypox is an extremely rare viral disease that is similar to smallpox, but it is considered clinically less severe, according to the World Health Organization. Cases usually happen in West and Central Africa. But several people have been diagnosed with monkeypox recently in areas that don't typically see the disease, including in Canada, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the US.\n\nMonkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, but it can spread through intimate contact during sex when someone has an active rash.\n\nIt also can spread through large respiratory droplets, but because large droplets don't travel far in the air, the contact has to be prolonged for this to happen.\n\nMonkeypox can spread through direct contact with bodily fluids or through contact with contaminated clothes or bedsheets, according to the CDC.\n\n\"Anyone can spread monkeypox [from] contact with body fluid or monkeypox sores or respiratory droplets when close to someone,\" Brooks said.\n\nThe virus typically incubates for seven to 14 days before symptoms appear, according to the CDC\n\nInitial symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, headache, fever, muscle aches and fatigue. The disease then progresses into a rash and lesions that blister and scab over. This can happen all over the body. The illness usually lasts two to four weeks.\n\nA person can be contagious from one day before the rash appears until up to 21 days after symptoms began. Once the scabs fall off, the person is no longer contagious, the CDC says.\n\nThe risk to the general public from this outbreak is low, according to the CDC.\n\n\"I don't think that there's a great risk to the general community from monkeypox right now in the United States. I think that we need to pay close attention to the communities in which this might be circulating so that we can communicate effectively with them and help bring this outbreak under control,\" McQuiston said.\n\nMonkeypox doesn't seem to be spreading so quickly that parties or events needed to be canceled to stop the spread.\n\n\"This is not Covid,\" McQuiston said. \"Respiratory spread is not the predominant worry. It is contact, and intimate contact, in the current outbreak setting and population. And that's really what we want to emphasize.\"\n\nIt's also important that this outbreak not cause stigma toward the LGBTQ community, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. It warned that some reporting and commentary on monkeypox has used language and imagery that reinforce stereotypes and exacerbate stigma.\n\ncommunity for having led the way on raising awareness -- and we reiterate that this disease can affect anyone,\" UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director Matthew Kavanagh said in a \"Experience shows that stigmatizing rhetoric can quickly disable evidence-based response by stoking cycles of fear, driving people away from health services, impeding efforts to identify cases, and encouraging ineffective, punitive measures. We appreciate the LGBTIcommunity for having led the way on raising awareness -- and we reiterate that this disease can affect anyone,\" UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director Matthew Kavanagh said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe WHO also cautioned people not to use the disease as a way to negatively label any particular community.\n\n\"There's a lot of stigma and discrimination that surrounds many diseases, and I think the key thing we need to look out for is, as WHO, to work with our partners in communities and elsewhere to make sure that the messaging is correct. So while we are seeing some cases among men who have sex with men, this is not a gay disease,\" WHO adviser Andy Seale said Monday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThere is no proven, safe treatment specifically for monkeypox, but a vaccine made by a Danish company called Bavarian Nordic has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

And in New York City, one patient has tested positive for orthopoxvirus, the family of viruses to which monkeypox belongs, NYC health officials announced in a news release Friday.\n\nThe case is being treated as a \"presumptive positive\" case until confirmed pending CDC testing and the patient is currently isolating, the release states.\n\nNew York City health officials had also tested one other patient for monkeypox, but that case has been ruled out, health officials said. City officials have been working with state authorities from the New York State Department of Health in their investigation of the two cases, both of which were identified Thursday.\n\nNew York State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said in a statement Friday that \"the current risk to the public is low.\"\n\n\"Reports of suspected cases of monkeypox in the United States and elsewhere are concerning. While a possible case in New York State awaits confirmatory testing by our local and federal partners, the Department has alerted health care providers in New York State so that they can consider this unusual diagnosis if their patients present with symptoms,\" Bassett said.\n\nMeanwhile, recent monkeypox infections have been identified in several other regions around the world where the virus is not usually common, including Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Northern Ireland and Spain.\n\n\"We have a level of scientific concern about what we're seeing because this is a very unusual situation. Monkeypox is normally only reported in West Africa or Central Africa, and we don't see it in the United States or in Europe -- and the number of cases that are being reported is definitely outside the level of normal for what we would see,\" Jennifer McQuiston , deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology within the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"At the same time, there really aren't that many cases that are being reported -- I think maybe a dozen, a couple dozen -- so, the general public should not be concerned that they are at immediate risk for monkeypox,\" she said. \"We're working through the investigations.\"\n\nOverall, \"we have people who are being monitored for diseases all the time,\" CDC spokesperson Christine Pearson wrote in an email, Thursday. That means that if someone might have been exposed to a pathogen, their health is monitored, and they should see physicians if they develop symptoms.\n\nAs for the six people currently being monitored for potential monkeypox, they all \"are healthy, with no symptoms and are considered at low risk for monkeypox,\" Pearson wrote, adding that none were seated next to the ill passenger and none had direct contact.\n\nAs the CDC's investigation continues, discussions have started to include the topic of vaccines.\n\nCDC 'discussing and evaluating' smallpox vaccine\n\nCDC officials are evaluating whether smallpox vaccine should be offered to healthcare workers treating monkeypox patients and other people who may be at \"high risk\" for exposure to monkeypox, McQuiston said.\n\n\"It's definitely something that we're discussing and evaluating, whether offering smallpox vaccine makes sense in the current setting,\" she said. \"We'll be closer to making recommendations for that in the next day or so.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED How vaccines stop the spread of viruses Replay More Videos ...

But cases have been identified that were associated with international travel or importing animals from areas where the disease is more common. After the virus jumps from an animal to a human, human-to-human transmission of monkeypox can occur when a person encounters the virus through direct contact to: large respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, or lesions on the skin.\n\nMonkeypox symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes. A characteristic of the disease is that it can cause lesions and a rash on the body , including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.\n\n\"This is not a disease that is going to sweep across the country,\" Dr. Daniel Bausch, president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"From a public health angle, of course, we need to investigate and respond -- I think the general population should just be aware of this -- but there's certainly no reason to panic and I think it's highly, highly, highly unlikely that we will get any sort of large outbreak of this,\" he said. \"And if you haven't had contact in Massachusetts and you're not related to the person who had disease or in that link at all -- until we have any other reason to expect or to understand how this disease got into the United States -- your risk of getting monkeypox is really low.\"\n\nA monkeypox mystery\n\nIn Massachusetts, physicians donning the same personal protective equipment they wear for Covid-19 patients have been treating the US monkeypox patient at a special pathogens unit within Massachusetts General Hospital, where he originally was diagnosed.\n\n\"They were undergoing a workup related to symptoms and the infectious diseases physician seeing the patient, learning about some of the cases in the United Kingdom, decided that the patient could possibly have monkeypox,\" Dr. Erica Shenoy, medical director for the Regional Emerging Special Pathogens Treatment Center and associate chief of the infection control unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"Then we had discussions with our state public health officials. The decision was made that yes, they did meet criteria for testing,\" Shenoy said. The patient tested positive.\n\n\"I think to the public overall, there really is no clear risk at this point,\" Shenoy said. \"This is an evolving situation that we're looking to understand better -- why these clusters that have been reported as well in the UK and in Portugal and Spain are happening, and to better understand the epidemiology.\"\n\nBoth in the United Kingdom and Canada, health authorities have noted that many of the monkeypox cases were identified in men who have sex with men -- but the virus is not typically described as a sexually transmitted infection and investigations into these recent cases continue.\n\nMonkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like illness were seen in colonies of monkeys that were kept for research, leading to the name \"monkeypox,\" according to the CDC. The first human case of monkeypox was reported years later in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, during a time when intense efforts were underway to eliminate smallpox.\n\nIn the United States, the last outbreak of monkeypox recorded was in 2003, when 47 confirmed and probable cases were reported in six states: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin. \"No instances of monkeypox infection were attributed exclusively to person-to-person contact,\" according to CDC.\n\nAll of the people infected with monkeypox during that outbreak became ill after having contact with pet prairie dogs, the CDC found. Those pets were housed at an animal vendor's facilities in Illinois where they may have been infected with the virus. The facilities housed other small mammals imported from Ghana that tested positive for monkeypox virus: two African giant pouched rats, nine dormice and three rope squirrels.\n\n\"The prairie dogs got monkeypox from the imported animals and then passed it on to the humans,\" Bausch said. \"It's a bit of a misnomer calling it monkeypox.

Smallpox gets comfortable inside its unwitting host for a week or two — known as the incubation period — before rashes appear all over the body, known as the eruptive stage. These raised, pus-filled rashes develop over a course of 10 days, giving the skin the appearance of bubble wrap.\n\nToward the later stages of infection, the rashes scab over and slough off. Survivors are left with pockmarks and scarring, particularly on the face since it has the highest concentration of oil-producing sebaceous glands. Other aftereffects include infertility in men, stillbirths and miscarriage in infected pregnant women, infections of the bones or brain, and blindness in rare instances, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMore:Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine mandates don't violate US employment law\n\nSmallpox in antiquity\n\nSmallpox itself is ancient, with historians speculating it first appeared around 10,000 B.C. in northeastern Africa, although evidence suggests it emerged 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. The virus spreads with its human hosts, through trade, war and later colonization, reaching the Americas via the Spanish and Portuguese by the 1500s.\n\nIt is estimated nearly 400,000 people died from smallpox annually in Europe by the end of the 18th century and 300 million in the 20th century alone, as the Facebook post claimed.\n\nDespite the tremendous death toll, people were not completely defenseless. Accounts of the 430 B.C. plague of Athens by Greek historian Thucydides mention those who initially survived smallpox appeared immune to subsequent infection. These survivors were often called upon to nurse the sick whenever any new epidemic struck.\n\nIn the 10th century, this observed immunity gave rise to a rudimentary vaccination method believed developed independently by Chinese and Indian physicians. Variolation, as the method came to be known, involved pulverizing smallpox scabs or pus from an infected individual to be sniffed up the nose or scratched into the skin.\n\nWhile the practice did confer immunity, recipients ran the risk of contracting smallpox themselves, albeit a milder form of the disease, and even causing epidemics. From the procedure, 1%-2% of variolated individuals died, compared to 30% after naturally contracting smallpox.\n\nMore:Fact check: Doctors say Hilary Duff likely didn't contract pink eye from COVID-19 tests\n\nA little help from a cow\n\nVariolation remained an important practice throughout Asia and Africa, reaching Europe and the New World colonies by the early 18th century, where it was first used to stop the Boston smallpox epidemic of 1721.\n\nIn the late 18th century, English physician Edward Jenner arrived at the observation that dairymaids were protected against smallpox because of their contact with cowpox, a now rare, self-limiting disease transmitted through lesions on the udder and teats to humans. Jenner postulated that to confer biological protection, much like with variolation, cowpox could be deliberately acquired through some sort of inoculation.\n\nIn May 1796, Jenner collected pus from the fresh scabs of a young dairymaid recently infected with cowpox and injected it into a 8-year-old boy. While testing what was essentially a live vaccine — a vaccine containing a weakened or attenuated form of a virus — on a human subject is ethically disconcerting, the young boy did not develop smallpox when injected with it six weeks later.\n\nVaccination, as the practice eventually came to be known, from the Latin for cow or vacca, was considered a groundbreaking medical discovery, gaining acceptance throughout Europe and paving the road for future vaccines. In the U.S., Jennerian vaccination was encouraged partly thanks to Thomas Jefferson, who conducted small vaccine trials himself and made it one of the new nation's first health priorities when elected president in 1801.\n\nMore:Fact check: Pregnant women do receive vaccines, but more study needed on COVID-19 shot\n\nSmallpox in the 20th century and beyond\n\nThere were some hiccups in smallpox vaccination as the 19th century progressed — moral stigmatization due to cases of syphilis inadvertently transmitted with vaccination, the scarce availability of infected animal sources, the discovery that smallpox immunity was not lifelong and required revaccination, to name a few. But by the end of World War II, smallpox was eradicated throughout Europe and North America.\n\nElsewhere, smallpox remained endemic in less developed regions like South America, West and East Africa, India and Indonesia. The Pan American Sanitary Organization, part of the World Health Organization, initiated a smallpox eradication program in 1950, which successfully eliminated the virus in all countries of the Americas except for Brazil. Years later, a global vaccination effort by the WHO implemented in 1959, at the behest of the Soviet Union, and again in 1967 wiped out smallpox in 31 countries.\n\nThere would be two more outbreaks and isolated cases of smallpox before the WHO would declare \"the world and all its people have won freedom from smallpox\" in May 1980. One of those outbreaks — the New York City smallpox outbreak of 1947 — has stood as a poignant example of swift public health planning: After an American businessman unwittingly brought the virus with him from Mexico City, those he had come in contact with were vaccinated, as well as over 6 million New Yorkers, in a span of less than a month.\n\nMore:Fact check: Improper use of COVID-19 test gives false positive for Coca-Cola\n\nEffective herd immunity depends on vaccination\n\nBecause immunity varies with age and not everyone can get vaccinated — such as those who are immunocompromised, have specific allergies or pregnant women with certain types of vaccines — herd immunity is a crucial protective phenomenon.\n\nTo establish it, one important factor is the number of immunized people within a population has to be at a certain percentage or threshold. According to the WHO, this figure was eight out of every 10 people for smallpox, based on its early eradication effort.\n\nAnd because pathogens are not confined by geographical borders, this 80% immunization or higher is not a threshold restricted to one population — it has to be shared by all, whether at a local, national or global level. This means if any populations have vaccination rates below the threshold, there is a great risk for disease transmission to other unvaccinated or vulnerable individuals, even in populations with adequate herd immunity, such as in the case with measles outbreaks in recent years.\n\nFor smallpox, this homogeneity in vaccination rates across varying populations was only successfully achieved with mass smallpox vaccination, as claimed by the Facebook post.\n\nA second important determinant for herd immunity is how long biological immunity against a pathogen lasts. While immunological memory forms with every new infectious encounter, this can fade over time, which is why booster shots are typically given. Smallpox immunity unfortunately does decline — after five to 10 years — but it is believed vaccinated individuals still have some protection against fatal outcomes should an outbreak, in the very rare event, reappear.\n\nRoutine smallpox vaccination in the U.S. was stopped in 1972, after it was declared eradicated. The CDC only recommends the vaccine to lab workers who work with smallpox or smallpox-like viruses, and to those who need long-term protection like military personnel.\n\nOur ruling: True\n\nWe rate the claim that smallpox, which killed 300 million people in the 20th century alone and was eliminated through vaccination, not herd immunity, as TRUE, as it is supported by our research. Smallpox is an ancient virus. The first vaccine created by Edward Jenner in the late 18th century helped control disease transmission and, two centuries later, eliminate smallpox worldwide, thanks to a global eradication effort implemented by the World Health Organization. Herd immunity, the phenomenon when immunized people within a community or population protect those who lack immunity by preventing disease transmission, is not possible unless a certain percentage or threshold of immunity is held uniformly across a population. For smallpox, this uniformity has only been achieved successfully through vaccination and not through any natural occurrence of herd immunity.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

But details about those cases and other epidemiological data aren't spreading nearly as quickly as the virus itself, leaving holes in the response.\n\n\"It's a new and really fast-moving outbreak, and I think there have been some challenges around having a smooth and efficient way for the data to be sent from jurisdictions\" to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.\n\nThe CDC only recently shared a first public look at monkeypox case demographics, which showed that the vast majority of cases have been among men who have sex with men, with a median age of 36.\n\nBut the agency has detailed information on only about half of the reported cases, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said.\n\nMonkeypox is now a reportable disease, which means public health departments work with local health care providers to collect information about people who are diagnosed and how they became ill. But it is still completely voluntary for states to share data on monkeypox with the CDC.\n\nCNN reached out to the health departments of all 50 states; 29 responded, and they all said they are committed to sharing case data with the CDC. Some, however, said that they are collecting more information than they share.\n\nAs the US battles another public health challenge amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Walensky said she is \"struck\" by \"how little authority we at CDC have to receive the data.\"\n\n\"We very much want to get as much information and informed decisions out to the American public as possible. And yet again, like we were for Covid, we are again really challenged by the fact that we at the agency have no authority to receive those data. We're working on that right now,\" she said in a conversation with The Washington Post on Friday.\n\nFor example, Walensky said, the CDC has no data on who has been vaccinated for monkeypox and does not yet have the authority to collect that data.\n\nThe only data shared publicly on monkeypox vaccines is weekly updates from the US Department of Health and Human Services on how many doses have been distributed to each state.\n\nLast month, the CDC shared an initial draft of a data use agreement with states and other jurisdictions, essentially a contract that would broaden the agency's access to data that states are collecting.\n\nAfter soliciting feedback from states, the CDC shared a revised version of the agreement that focuses exclusively on vaccine administration data. States are reviewing the document, and a few have signed it.\n\nThe latest version of the data use agreement has \"similar requirements and infrastructure as the states already use for Covid-19 vaccine data reporting,\" according to the CDC.\n\nMonkeypox not yet a public health emergency in US\n\nLast month, the CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center to coordinate the response to the monkeypox outbreak and mobilize additional resources. And over the weekend, the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern\n\nBut so far, monkeypox has not been declared a public health emergency in the United States. US health officials said over the weekend that the United States is still assessing the situation. US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement Saturday the US is \"determined to accelerate our response in the days ahead.\"\n\nA US declaration of a public health emergency could bring with it an official requirement to report certain data, but it's more often used to move funds around, Hamilton said.\n\nAlthough the public health emergency for Covid-19 brought reporting requirements to health care, like hospitals, the same wasn't true for states and public health.\n\n\"Health departments have a vested interest in providing the agency data,\" Hamilton said. \"The public health system needs and wants to submit data.\"\n\nEven if the motivation is there, the infrastructure in place to do so can make the process challenging.\n\n\"We would love to have a regular, standardized process -- even for when new diseases and conditions emerge -- that at least has a way for core data to automatically be sent out of a state's reportable disease system,\" Hamilton said. \"But in the current infrastructure, that does not exist.\"\n\nInstead, it's a \"very manual process\" in which, for each case, states have to either enter all of the information by hand or upload a file into the system that might miss some fields if they're not formatted the same way.\n\nWith monkeypox, for example, evidence shows that it spreads mostly through prolonged physical contact, such as sex. People being tested for the virus may be more willing to give their clinician with a range of how many sexual partners they've have. But if the surveillance database requires a specific number for that question, then the categorical data collected by the clinician or health department might not be included when the case report is submitted.\n\nData modernization at the CDC has been greatly underfunded, Hamilton said.\n\n\"2020, believe it or not, was the first year that the agency received appropriations for a more integrated approach to managing disease surveillance data.

If we do that again and again -- and that's our approach at the White House and across the government -- then we have a better chance of ending this outbreak.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED How vaccines stop the spread of viruses Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How vaccines stop the spread of viruses 01:26\n\nDr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, says not to expect a large-scale rollout of vaccines.\n\n\"I think that we will need to use vaccinations in contacts of cases. This isn't something where everybody lines up and gets vaccinated,\" he said of the current outbreak. \"That's going to be critical to stopping cases.\"\n\nWhat vaccines could work against monkeypox?\n\nA senior Biden administration official said Tuesday that there's sufficient vaccine to cover the United States' current level of cases.\n\n\"Right now, we have over 1,000 doses of [Jynneos] available, and we expect that level to ramp up very quickly in the coming weeks as the company provides more doses to us,\" McQuiston said Monday.\n\nThe CDC estimates that the vaccine is at least 85% effective in preventing monkeypox , based on data from Africa.\n\nAnother vaccine, called ACAM2000, is licensed in the United States to prevent smallpox. Although the vaccine could be used to prevent monkeypox, it is not licensed for that.\n\nThe United States has more than 100 million doses of ACAM2000, McQuiston said.\n\n\"ACAM2000 is an older-generation smallpox vaccine that has some potential significant side effects with it,\" she said. \"So a decision to use that widely would have to have some serious discussion behind it.\"\n\nACAM2000 is a live virus vaccine -- and once the shot is given, a lesion will develop at that site. Because the virus grows at the site of the lesion, it can spread to other parts of the body or even to other people, according to the CDC, which is why people who get ACAM2000 \"must take precautions\" to prevent the spread.\n\nIn comparison, the Jynneos vaccine is given as a live virus that is non-replicating. That means there is no visible \"take\" and, as a result, no risk of viral spread, according to the CDC. Some common vaccine side effects include pain at the injection site, muscle pain, headache or fatigue.\n\nWho should get vaccinated against monkeypox?\n\nMost people won't be vaccinated against monkeypox.\n\nThe CDC's Advisory Committee and Immunization Practices voted last year to recommend vaccination for select groups at risk for monkeypox and other related viruses due to their occupations, like research lab personnel and health care workers.\n\nAmid the global outbreak, World Health Organization officials plan to make recommendations on who should be prioritized to receive a smallpox vaccination to lower their risk of monkeypox.\n\n\"We will be making recommendations on who should be prioritized for this,\" Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's emerging diseases and zoonoses lead and technical lead on Covid-19, said during a social media Q&A Monday.\n\n\"This is not something that everybody needs. It is a virus that is spreading between people who are coming in close contact with those who are cases,\" Van Kerkhove said. \"We really need to discuss evidence-based use of these measures, access and equity.\"\n\nAndy Seale, strategies adviser for the WHO Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes, added that vaccinations should be considered for countries where monkeypox is endemic, which are in West and Central Africa.\n\n\"Communities are already saying to us, 'if we get this right, if we contain this, if we get the access right for the outbreak, we have to do this for the endemic countries as well,' \" Seale said.\n\nCan someone get vaccinated after being exposed to monkeypox?\n\nVaccination after exposure to monkeypox virus can still offer some protection, according to the CDC\n\n\"That's the norm. We usually don't do vaccination of everybody beforehand. We use vaccination as post-exposure prophylaxis,\" Adalja said.\n\n\"Because monkeypox has a long incubation period, just like smallpox -- it's 12 days or so, on average, for monkeypox -- you can intervene with a vaccine in an exposed person, and it will abort the infection,\" he said. \"Or if you do get an infection, maybe it gets to them really late or late in the incubation period, it makes the infection less severe.\"\n\nBut the sooner an exposed person gets the vaccine, the better. The CDC recommends giving the vaccine within four days of exposure in order to prevent illness. If it's given between four and 14 days of exposure, vaccination may reduce the symptoms but may not prevent the disease itself.\n\nOverall, people who have been exposed to the monkeypox virus and have not gotten the vaccine within the past three years should consider getting vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nWill a smallpox vaccination protect against monkeypox?\n\n\"Because monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, the smallpox vaccine can protect people from getting monkeypox,\" the CDC website says. \"Smallpox and monkeypox vaccines are effective at protecting people against monkeypox when given before exposure to monkeypox. Experts also believe that vaccination after a monkeypox exposure may help prevent the disease or make it less severe.\"\n\nScientists have known for years that smallpox vaccines can be effective in preventing monkeypox, too. The variola virus that causes smallpox and the monkeypox virus belong to the same family.\n\n\"The viruses come from the same family of viruses, and what we've seen in prior monkeypox outbreaks is that vaccinating contacts does abort infection or attenuate infection in those individuals with monkeypox,\" Adalja said.\n\nThere probably is some \"remnant\" of protection against monkeypox for adults who were vaccinated against smallpox as children, he said, but it may not be full protection.\n\n\"The smallpox vaccination program ended in the 1970s in the United States. Obviously, if someone is in the US military and they got vaccinated last year, I'm sure they're completely protected,\" Adalja said. \"But people who got vaccinated as children in the era when smallpox was a routine childhood vaccination, they may have some residual immunity.\"\n\nThe senior administration official said Tuesday that, theoretically, there is some protection offered from a previous smallpox vaccination, but there is not good evidence on how much protection -- and that protection could wane over time.\n\nHas the monkeypox virus changed with this outbreak?\n\nThe official said that it doesn't seem like anything has changed about the biology of the monkeypox virus and that the chances of contracting it are still very low for the general public.\n\nWHO officials have not found evidence of the monkeypox virus changing or mutating in this outbreak. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the licensed vaccines won't work against the currently circulating virus.\n\n\"It's a very stable virus. So we don't yet have evidence that there's mutation in the virus itself,\" Rosamund Lewis, head of smallpox secretariat at WHO Emergencies Programme, said during the Q&A on Monday.\n\n\"We are beginning to collect that information,\" Lewis added. \"We will be convening our groups of virologists and other experts who will discuss this very question based on the sequence of the genome of some of the cases that are being detected.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat is a \"key question\" that is important to answer, said Dr. Daniel Rhoads, co-chair of the College of American Pathologists Microbiology Committee.\n\n\"Did something change with the biology, or is this just an unusual situation that hasn't happened before or we haven't recognized it before? I think anytime there's a change in geography for these endemic diseases, that's a key question,\" said Rhoads, a pathologist at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\n\"Whenever we see a new infection or an infection transmitted in what seems to be a new way, I always wonder, is this just something we haven't recognized before that's always been around? Or is this an actual biological change, which would be due to a mutation in the virus? I don't know,\" Rhoads said.\n\n\"My guess is, once they sequence the virus causing the current outbreak, they'll be able to compare it to known sequences, and then hopefully we'll have some insight as to whether or not this is kind of the same old monkeypox or if there's something that appears to be different.\"", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/07/16/monkeypox-hitting-lgbtq-communities-hard-leaders-want-more-help/10027836002/", "title": "Monkeypox is not a gay disease.

There are at least 16,000 infections documented in over 40 countries, and the World Health Organization has declared it a public health emergency of international concern. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting more than 3,000 infections , just two months after monkeypox was first detected in this outbreak.\n\nHow much should people worry about contracting monkeypox? Should everyone be trying to get the vaccine? Who are the groups most at risk, and what actions should they take? How exactly is monkeypox spread and how can people prevent from trying to get it? What are common symptoms to look out for?\n\nTo help us better understand monkeypox and the risk it poses, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of \" Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health .\"\n\nCNN: How is monkeypox spread? Is it as transmissible as Covid-19, another disease that we know very well by now?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: Monkeypox is not spread like Covid-19. As we know by now, Covid-19 is highly transmissible and can be spread through microscopic aerosols. That means you could be infected by someone who you're having a casual conversation with or even someone who happens to be in the same conference room or restaurant as you.\n\nMonkeypox is primarily spread through prolonged, direct, skin-to-skin contact. Most cases thus far have been linked to sexual activity though this is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. Rather, individuals can spread monkeypox through intimate contact, such as kissing, hugging, cuddling and sexual intercourse.\n\nThis illustration shows monkeypox virus particles, which are composed of a DNA genome surrounded by a protein coat and lipid envelope.\n\nIndividuals who have lesions can also shed virus onto bedsheets, towels and other linens that can spread the virus to others. This is why people with active monkeypox lesions are instructed not to share potentially contaminated items like linens, towels, drinking glasses and eating utensils with others.\n\nCNN: What kinds of symptoms do patients with monkeypox have?\n\nWen: People who contract monkeypox often first start developing fever, headache, muscles aches and overall fatigue — similar to many other viral illnesses. Many people also have lymph node swelling. They then develop a rash that progresses into blisters, pimples or sores. The lesions can be all over the body or only in one part. It could be localized to just the anal or genital area, on the face, inside the mouth, or any other part of the body.\n\nA large study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine examined 528 infections across 43 sites in 16 countries. It found that the most common symptoms are fever, tiredness, muscle aches and lymph node swelling. Nearly all had a rash with blisters, though some individuals only had one lesion while others had several or more. Some people only had sores inside their mouth or in their anal or genital areas.\n\nClinicians seeing patients with a fever and new rash should have a low threshold for testing for monkeypox, especially if the patient is in a high-risk group for contracting monkeypox. Importantly, the recent study also found that 29% of people diagnosed with monkeypox had a sexually transmitted infection. To me, this means that just because a patient is diagnosed with one thing doesn't mean they can't have another, too, and patients in high-risk groups who have new lesions need to get tested to rule out monkeypox.\n\nCNN: What started monkeypox, and how widespread is it in the United States?\n\nWen: Monkeypox is a virus that is in the same family as the smallpox virus. It was first discovered in 1958 in monkeys, hence the name, though its usual animal hosts are rodents and other small mammals. It first appeared in humans in 1970 in east Africa. It has been endemic in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with outbreaks sometimes occurring when infected travelers bring back the disease to their home countries. There was a big outbreak in the United States in 2003 due to imported rodents.\n\nThis outbreak is much larger. More than 3,000 people have been infected in the United States thus far, with infections seen in almost every state. The CDC has an updated map of cases and infections here\n\nCNN: Who are the individuals in the high-risk groups for contracting monkeypox?\n\nWen: Thus far, monkeypox has predominantly affected gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. In the Thus far, monkeypox has predominantly affected gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. In the New England Journal of Medicine international case series, 98% of people with monkeypox were gay or bisexual, and the transmission was linked to sexual activity in 95% of the cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the \"vast majority\" of cases in the United States are in men who have sex with men, with a median age of 36.\n\nCurrently individuals at high risk are men who have sex with men and who have sex with multiple or anonymous partners. There are also reports in the United States of some women and two children who have contracted monkeypox, who are all believed to be direct contacts of men who have sex with men.\n\nCNN: Has anyone died from monkeypox?\n\nWen: Monkeypox usually has a Monkeypox usually has a fatality rate of 3% to 6% , according to the World Health Organization. Thankfully, no one has died from monkeypox in the United States yet, but this is a painful disease that can and does lead to severe illness and death. Those particularly vulnerable include pregnant women, young children and immunocompromised people.\n\nCNN: How much should people worry about monkeypox?\n\nWen: Because of the way that monkeypox is spread, it is not yet a concern for most Americans. However, individuals who are gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, who have intimate contact with multiple or anonymous people, are at high risk.\n\nThese individuals should immediately seek testing if they have a new rash or sore, and they should avoid close physical contact in the meantime. People who wish to reduce their risk should avoid crowded clubs, raves, sex parties and other places where there is prolonged skin-to-skin or face-to-face contact with many people who may be wearing less clothing.\n\nCNN: Should everyone try to get the monkeypox vaccine?\n\nWen: No. First of all, the monkeypox vaccine is extremely limited right now. About 300,000 doses of the two-dose vaccine have been delivered thus far, much less than the 1.5 million people the CDC says are eligible.\n\nThose who should definitely get the vaccine are those with known exposure to someone with monkeypox. If given within four days of exposure , the vaccine can prevent someone from developing monkeypox. If given within two weeks, it lessens the likelihood of progression to severe illness.\n\nSoon, I hope there will be enough vaccine so that people in high-risk groups are able to access it. But given the way that monkeypox is spread, most Americans are not likely to contract it, and a mass vaccination campaign targeting the general population is probably not going to be recommended any time soon.\n\nCNN: Is monkeypox going to be yet another virus that will be endemic in the United States?\n\nWen: I really hope not. It is still possible to contain monkeypox through testing and vaccination. I hope that the WHO's declaration of a global health emergency will spur more countries, including ours, to put every effort to try to prevent monkeypox from taking hold and becoming endemic here.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/health/monkeypox-children-vaccine/index.html", "title": "CDC reports the first two monkeypox cases in children in the US - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Two cases of monkeypox have been identified in children in the United States, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.\n\nThe two cases are unrelated and probably the result of household transmission, the CDC said.\n\nOne case is a toddler who is a resident of California.

Initial symptoms are typically flu-like, such as fever, chills, exhaustion, headache and muscle weakness, followed by swelling in the lymph nodes, which help the body fight infection and disease.\n\n\"A feature that distinguishes infection with monkeypox from that of smallpox is the development of swollen lymph nodes,\" the CDC said.\n\nNext comes a widespread rash on the face and body, including inside the mouth and on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\n\nThe painful, raised poxes are pearly and fluid-filled, often surrounded by red circles. The lesions finally scab over and resolve over a period of two to three weeks, the CDC said.\n\n\"Treatment is generally supportive as there are no specific drugs available. However, a vaccine is available that can be given to prevent the development of disease,\" Jimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said in a statement.\n\nHow is monkeypox spread?\n\nClose contact with an infected individual is required for the spread of the monkeypox virus, experts say.\n\nInfection can develop after exposure to \"broken skin, mucous membranes, respiratory droplets, infected body fluids or even contact with contaminated linen,\" Neil Mabbott, personal chair in immunopathology at the veterinary school of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said in a statement.\n\n\"When the lesions have healed, the scabs (which might carry infectious virus) can be shed as dust, which could be inhaled,\" said Dr. Michael Skinner, who is on the faculty of medicine in the department of infectious disease at Imperial College London, in a statement.\n\nTransmission between people occurs primarily through large respiratory droplets, and because such droplets typically travel only a few feet, \"prolonged face-to-face contact is required,\" the CDC said.\n\nThis 2003 electron microscope image made available by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows mature, oval-shaped monkeypox virions, left, and spherical immature virions, right, obtained from a sample of human skin associated with the 2003 prairie dog outbreak.\n\n\"Monkeypox can be a serious infection, with mortality rates from this type of monkeypox virus having been around 1% in other outbreaks. These are often in lower-income settings with limited access to health care,\" said Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton in the UK.\n\nHowever, in the developed world, \"it would be very unusual to see anything more than a handful of cases in any outbreak, and we won't be seeing (Covid)-style levels of transmission,\" Head said in a statement.\n\nCommon household disinfectants can kill the monkeypox virus, according to the CDC.\n\nWhere did monkeypox originate?\n\nMonkeypox got its name in 1958 when \"two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research,\" the CDC said\n\nHowever, the main disease carrier of monkeypox is still unknown, although \"African rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission,\" the agency said.\n\nThe first known case of monkeypox in people was \"recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo during a period of intensified effort to eliminate smallpox,\" the CDC said.\n\nAfter 40 years with no reported cases, monkeypox reemerged in Nigeria in 2017, the CDC said. Since then, there have been more than 450 reported cases in Nigeria and at least eight known exported cases internationally, the agency said.\n\nA outbreak occurred in the US in 2003 after forty-seven people in six states -- Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin -- became ill due to contact with their pet prairie dogs, the CDC said.\n\n\"The pets were infected after being housed near imported small mammals from Ghana,\" the CDC said. \"This was the first time that human monkeypox was reported outside of Africa.\"", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}]}

Kelis responded, \"it’s not a collab it’s theft.\"\n\nIn a pair of follow-up videos on Instagram, Kelis said her main issue was not with Beyoncé personally, but rather because she was not notified about the sample. She also said the interpolation of her song was a \"direct hit\" from past collaborators Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, who make up the production and songwriting duo The Neptunes.\n\n\"It has to do with the fact that, from one artist to another, you should have the decency and the common sense and the courtesy to call, reach out,\" Kelis said. \"Even if you're going to do it anyway.\"\n\nKelis has previously opened up about being shortchanged professionally, telling The Guardian in 2020 that she made nothing from sales of her first two albums, both of which were produced by The Neptunes.\n\n'We got shafted':Rob Halford isn't happy about Judas Priest's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame award\n\nMaggie Rogers got a Harvard degree:Now, she's back with her most 'personal' lyrics yet\n\nBeyoncé unveils 16-song 'Renaissance' track list\n\nWith a week to go until the release of “Renaissance,” Beyoncé teased the faithful by sharing a screenshot of the album’s track list in her Instagram Story on July 20.\n\nFans quickly set about analyzing the meaning of titles such as “America Has a Problem,” “Virgo's Groove,” “Plastic Off the Sofa” and “Thique.”\n\nThe 16-song track list:\n\n“I’m That Girl”\n\n“Cozy”\n\n“Alien Superstar”\n\n“Cuff It”\n\n“Energy”\n\n“Break My Soul”\n\n“Church Girl”\n\n“Plastic Off the Sofa”\n\n“Virgo’s Groove”\n\n“Move”\n\n“Heated”\n\n“Thique”\n\n“All Up in Your Mind”\n\n“America Has a Problem”\n\n“Pure/Honey”\n\n“Summer Renaissance”\n\nBeyoncé breaks record with 'Break My Soul'\n\nBeyoncé's album hasn't come out yet, but it's already notched her another record.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Break My Soul,\" her first single from the album, the singer became the first woman ever to earn at least 10 top 10 hits as a soloist and 10 or more top 10s as a member of a group, according to Billboard.\n\nOther artists who have achieved this milestone include Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, Billboard reports.\n\nBeyoncé drops album art\n\nThe Houston-born singer posted album art for \"Renaissance\" on Instagram June 30, which showed the singer sitting on an illuminating glass-like horse wearing a barely-there sparkling ensemble. In the caption, she said creating the album allowed her to escape from \"a scary time for the world.\"\n\n\"It allowed me to feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving.

And this could be the first in a series as it was also titled \"Act I.\" On the Grammy-winning artist's official website, her new music has become the focal point of the homepage with options to pre-save the album and shop \"Renaissance\" merchandise.\n\nBeyoncé first teased the \"Renaissance\" title in an August interview with Harper's Bazaar, saying she'd been in the studio for a year and a half working on something new.\n\n\"With all the isolation and injustice over the past year, I think we are all ready to escape, travel, love, and laugh again.

At 40, Beyoncé knows there is no need to make apologies. Not that she ever felt that way, but now, she is completely unfettered.\n\nRanking Beyoncé:Which of her 15 best songs made the cut?\n\nThe cover for the new release – featuring the scantily clad singer regally posed atop a silver, glowing horse – indicated that she might bare more than a well-toned thigh with “Renaissance.”\n\nBeyoncé also intentionally shunned a visual component – integral elements of “Lemonade” and 2020’s “Black is King” project – to allow listeners to conjure their own musical journey with the songs she’s worked on for nearly three years.\n\nWhen “Break My Soul,” the inaugural single from “Renaissance,” arrived in June, fans thrilled to its dance floor vibe provided largely by a glorious sample of Robin S.’s 1993 club anthem, “Show Me Love,” and anticipated the full album containing a similar thrust of house music.\n\nMost follow the blueprint, anchored by heavy percussion, disorienting beats and intriguing segues, with Beyoncé delving her deepest into hip-hop and salacious come-ons.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from the album, subtitled “Act 1,” with two more planned. Because as her disciples know, Beyoncé always has her next act ready to roll.\n\n“Alien Superstar”: Synthesizers creep in the background of this futuristic romp that is lyrically rich and musically zigzagging. “I’m the only one/don’t even waste your time trying to compete with me,” Beyoncé declares over the stomping beat that eventually gets to its thesis: Celebrate being unique.\n\n“Cuff It\": A soulful bop that finds Beyoncé, “in the mood to (expletive) something up.\" It might sound like an Yvonne Elliman throwback, but Beyoncé has something racier in mind for her extracurricular activities. Dabbles of trombones, the signature guitar-funk sound of co-writer Nile Rodgers and percussion courtesy of Sheila E. equate to a pulsing head-nodder. “Have you ever had fun like this?\" Beyoncé would like to know.\n\n“Cozy”: Thick, layered shuffles and an intoxicating rhythm drive her theme of acceptance. “I’m comfortable in my skin, cozy with who I am... I love myself, goddamn,” she intones over heavy percussion. She also reminds anyone silly enough to question her Beyoncé-ness, “Still a 10, still here.”\n\n“Move”: With guests Grace Jones (!) and Nigerian singer Tems backing her, Beyoncé is strident and fierce. With Jones she informs, “Move out the way, I'm with my girls and we all need space/When the queens come through, don't try like the rest say.”\n\nMaking history: Beyoncé now holds a prestigious Grammy record\n\n“Pure/Honey”: A split-personality song with ricocheting synth-bass leading the track and Beyoncé directing “bad (expletives) to the left, money (expletives) to the right” before sharing in a knowing tone, “It should cost a billion to look this good.” Shades of Madonna’s “MDNA” phase also brush its edges. The second, less-explicit section of the song detours into pop, with a sashaying melody that is as carefree as a roller rink spinner.\n\n“America Has a Problem”: The most intriguingly titled song on the album includes production from The-Dream, a co-write by husband Jay-Z and a jittery hi-hat powering the production. Beyoncé tears into a liquid rap sandwiched between a heavenly refrain: \"You can get no higher than this...love don't get no higher than this.” Just in case things get too lovey-dovey, she also reminds, \"the booty gonna do what it want to.\"\n\n“Energy”: A spicy banger that features Jamaican rapper Beam and samples Kelis’ 1999 song “Get Along With You,” which has incited some controversy. On Wednesday, Kelis responded to a fan’s Instagram comment about the song – following a leak of “Renaissance” after an early European arrival – saying, “the level of disrespect and utter ignorance of all 3 parties involved is astounding.” (The song was written by Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo under their Neptunes moniker.) But conflict aside, it’s a quick, adept prelude to “Break My Soul,” melding into the track with the precision of an old-school club DJ.\n\n“Plastic Off the Sofa”: Beyoncé’s tremendous vocals are showcased in this pretty package of soulful nostalgia that cools down the tempo with woozy guitar strains and angelic backing vocals. It’s a straight-up love song that finds Beyoncé playing cute. “I think you're so cool, even though I'm cooler than you,” she sings with a wink and a laugh.\n\n“Virgo’s Groove”: The longest song on the album (just over six minutes) is a flawless complement to “Plastic Off the Sofa” – assuming the album is consumed in the order it was intended – with its spongy groove and Beyoncé’s declarations of affection (“You are the love of my life” she repeats throughout the song) that veer into explicit territory. In case you were wondering, yes, Beyoncé is a Virgo.\n\n“Summer Renaissance”: Beyoncé wraps her ambitious opus with a nod to Donna Summer as a sample of “I Feel Love” swirls in the background. The pop leanings of the song and its loping gait are countered by her unsubtle teases: “Know you love when I roleplay, who am I now?/I'm a doc, I'm a nurse, I'm a teacher/Dominate is the best way to beat ya.” A fitting coda to an album gripped by desires.\n\n'Hello' to Vegas: Adele unveils residency dates", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}]}

A popular jock, Wally was also ensnared in the schemes of his friend, the mischievous and smooth-talking Eddie Haskell (Ken Osmond).\n\n\"Tony was not only my brother on TV, but in many ways in life as well. He leaves an empty place in my heart that won’t be filled,\" Mathers said in a Facebook post Wednesday. \"Tony was always the kindest, most generous, gentle, loving, sincere, and humble man, and it was my honor and privilege to be able to share memories together with him for 65 years.\"\n\n'It is truly heartbreaking':'Leave It To Beaver' actor Tony Dow announces cancer diagnosis\n\nThe news of his death comes less than three months after the actor and his wife, Lauren Shulkind put out a joint statement sharing the \"very sad news\" of his cancer diagnosis, though they didn't disclose details of the disease.\n\n\"Dear Friends & Fans of Tony Dow, I have some very sad news to share with you.

In August he was hospitalized with pneumonia, Bilotta confirmed at the time.\n\nDow later reprised his role as Wally in a \"Beaver\" spinoff from 1983 to 1989. He also directed several episodes of 1993's \"Babylon 5\" along with 1999 episodes of \"Crusade\" and \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\"\n\nDow’s death leaves Mathers and Rusty Stevens, who played Beaver’s friend Larry Mondello, as the only surviving members of the show’s core cast.

He was my coach, my mentor, my voice of reason, my best friend, my best man in my wedding, and my hero,\" Christopher Dow said, according to a statement that Bilotta shared on Tony Dow's official Facebook page.\n\nNews of the actor's passing comes one day after a premature announcement of his death. Dow revealed in May he had been diagnosed with cancer and was receiving hospice care this week, according to his son.\n\nDow was thrust into stardom at age 12, when he was cast on the soon-to-be-smash sitcom \"Leave It to Beaver.\" In the role, Dow helped create the archetype of a suburban nuclear family and became a household name to millions of viewers.

(AP) — The actress who became famous playing the Jamaican psychic Miss Cleo, claiming to know callers' futures in ubiquitous TV infomercials and commercials 15 years ago, has died of cancer.\n\nYouree Dell Harris, 53, died in Palm Beach, her lawyer, William J. Cone Jr. said.\n\nThe Los Angeles-born Harris was a struggling actress when the Psychic Readers Network hired her in the late 1990s to play Miss Cleo. She adopted her family's Jamaican heritage for the role, persuading viewers to call for allegedly free psychic readings.\n\nIn one commercial, she is seen poring over tarot cards before telling a caller that the father of her baby is the \"one who is very unpleasant and had another girlfriend while he was sleeping with you ... but you knew that.\" The commercials ended with the tagline, \"Call me now!\"\n\nThe federal government said those \"free\" calls cost consumers about $1 billion. The Federal Trade Commission said the psychic service promised a free reading, but consumers calling a toll-free number were directed to a 900 number charging $4.99 per minute. The agency said nearly 6 million people made such calls and were charged an average of about $60 apiece.\n\nThe Psychic Readers Network's parent company forgave $500 million in customer charges in a 2002 settlement.\n\nAfter the settlement, Harris mostly faded from view for over a decade. She voiced a character in the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City video game and was an advocate for gay rights after coming out as a lesbian.\n\nHarris returned to the public eye in 2014 when she appeared in the documentary Hotline, which looked at the world of telephone psychics, phone-sex workers and suicide prevention specialists.\n\nTony Shaff, the film's producer, said he found her to be \"warm and welcoming and bigger than life.\"\n\n\"She was smart as a whip and very intuitive,\" Shaff said. \"There was so much negativity surrounding psychic hotlines that she wanted to tell her personal story.\" He said she understood that some consumers felt they were swindled, \"but she was being paid to do a job.\"\n\nHe said Harris claimed to have paranormal abilities but didn't like to be called a psychic or tarot reader because she felt her powers were much broader than that.\n\nHarris briefly reprised the Miss Cleo character last year in a series of online advertisements for General Mills, which was bringing back its French Toast Crunch cereal. The ads stopped after the Psychic Readers Network sued, saying it owned the character.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/04/08/annette-funicello-appreciation/2064097/", "title": "Annette Funicello was made for you and me", "text": "Susan Wloszczyna, USA TODAY\n\nFunicello dies from complications of multiple sclerosis\n\nShe was signed as the 24th and final Mouseketeer in 1955\n\nFunicello was the inspiration for the 1960 Paul Anka hit %27Puppy Love%27\n\nLong before Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera sported rodent ears, there was the original Disney girl — Annette — who won America's heart.\n\nAnnette Funicello, whose pubescent pulchritude made her a standout on TV's first Mickey Mouse Club in the '50s and an early crush for many a Baby Boomer boy, died Monday at age 70 in Bakersfield, Calif., from complications of multiple sclerosis. Her family confirmed she had been in a coma for years before being taken off life support.\n\nHer daughter, Gina Gilardi, said in a statement: \"She's on her toes dancing in heaven. ... No more MS. My brothers and I were there holding her sweet hands when she left us.\"\n\nFunicello was born in Utica, N.Y., and moved to Southern California at age 4. Trained as a singer and dancer, she would get her break in show business after Walt Disney was among those who saw her as the ballerina in Swan Lake during a recital held at the Burbank Starlight Bowl in 1955.\n\nSoon she was signed up as the 24th and final Mouseketeer on a popular variety show for kids, appearing in her own self-titled serial (where her signature tune, How Will I Know My Love, performed during a hayride scene, would lead to a singing career). With her innate wholesomeness and sweet disposition, the brunette beauty's pinup appeal was a major draw, generating more than 6,000 fan letters a week. She would go on to inspire one of her early beaus, Paul Anka, to write his 1960 hit Puppy Love about her.\n\nThe self-described \"queen of teen\" also became a recording sensation, releasing 15 albums for Disney that featured the top-10 hits Tall Paul and O Dio Mio. After the show ended in 1959, Funicello remained under contract with Disney, appearing in the Zorro TV series in the late 1950s and such family films as 1959'sThe Shaggy Dogand 1961'sBabes in Toyland. Once out of her teens, she traded in her mouse ears for a curve-revealing bathing suit for 1963's Beach Party, the kickoff title in a series of six youth-oriented romps that paired her with Frankie Avalon.\n\n\"Mr. Disney,\" whom Funicello considered a second father, made one request of his demure discovery: that she not reveal her navel on-screen and besmirch her pure image. She complied in the first movie but would wear a two-piece fishnet suit in 1964's Muscle Beach Party and a blue-and-white bikini in 1964's Bikini Beach.\n\nShe left show business — save for her Skippy peanut butter commercials — to become a homemaker after marrying her first husband, Jack Gilardi, in 1965. They had three children before divorcing in 1981. She then married horse breeder Glen Holt in 1986.\n\nWhen she and Avalon made a comeback as a team in the 1987 spoof Back to the Beach, she first noticed signs of multiple sclerosis. She kept the condition under wraps despite having obvious symptoms during a yearlong concert tour with her co-star. After news reports claimed her ailments were signs of alcohol abuse, she went public with news of her illness to USA TODAY reporter Tom Green in 1992. She would go on to raise awareness about MS and started a research fund in her name in 1993.\n\nShe said of her decision: \"Sometimes I can't help but ask, 'Why me?' But I believe everything happens for a reason, and I know now that my mission is to help others raise funds for MS.\"\n\nFunicello released an autobiography, A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: My Story in 1994, and the book would be turned into a made-for-TV movie in 1995.

He had previously taken care of his wife, Colleen, until she died from complications of Pick's Disease, a form of dementia, in 2009.\n\nDuring Howe's peak years in the 1950s and 1960s, he seemed more popular than his sport. Howe was often featured in newsreels. The late Detroit Red Wings general manager Jack Adams called Howe \"the Babe Ruth of hockey.\" His fame stretched beyond the confines of the sports pages. His exploits were written about in Look magazine.\n\nFamed NBC broadcaster Mike Emrick said Howe did as much for the NHL as an ambassador as he did on the ice, where he was the second-leading goal scorer in league history.\n\n\"What he did for the sport in the U.S. — during its several eras of growth — was to epitomize the humility and friendliness of hockey athletes.\" Emrick said. \"People came up to Gordie Howe because they knew they could. And they would walk away with a smile on their face, just like they expected to.\"\n\nAccording to legendary coach Scotty Bowman, those who played against Howe \"thought he was close to Superman.\"\n\nFormer NHL and World Hockey Association coach Harry Neale has long said that Howe is the best all-around player in NHL history. Howe played his first game in the NHL for the Detroit Red Wings in 1946 at age 18, and played his last game for the Hartford Whalers at age 52 in 1980.\n\n\"He has been omnipresent forever,\" said former NHL player Ray Ferraro in a recent radio interview.\n\nCounting his time in both the NHL and World Hockey Association, Howe played 32 pro seasons.\n\nSTEM CELLS: Howe made dramatic recovery after stem cell therapy in 2015\n\n\"If you equate greatness with superior play and durability, there is no match for Gordie Howe — I don't even think there is a challenger,\" Neale once told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nHe was born and raised in Saskatchewan, where he once was banned from playing forward and defense in elementary school hockey because he was too talented. He only was allowed to play as a goaltender.\n\n\"His roots and the roots of the game were the same: rural Canada,\" Emrick said.\n\nIn an era when 20 goals confirmed a player was near the head of his class, Howe scored at least 23 for 22 consecutive NHL seasons and the next five in the WHA. He won the scoring title six times and won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's Most Valuable Player six times.\n\n\"When I think about players, I consider three ingredients: the head, heart and the feet,\" Bowman has said. \"Some players don't have any of those, and some players have one or two. But Gordie had all three in high dimensions.\"\n\nHowe played with left wing Ted Lindsay and center Sid Abel on the famed Production Line. The name was chosen to salute fact that the three players played in a team famous for automobile assembly lines. Coach Tommy Ivan put the Red Wings trio together in 1947 when Howe was 19. In 1949-50, Lindsay, Abel and Howe finished first, second and third in the NHL scoring race and the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup championship.\n\nThe following season, Howe started a run of four consecutive NHL scoring championships.\n\n\"I always said that being with Teddy helped (Howe) become a better hockey player,\" said their former Red Wings teammate Marty Pavelich. \"Teddy was so aggressive that I think that Gordie got caught up in that, too.\"\n\nHowe scored 801 goals in the NHL, second only to Wayne Gretzky's 894, and another 174 in the WHA. Counting his regular-season and playoff goals in both leagues, Howe totaled 1,071.\n\nAnd Howe did it all seemingly effortlessly.\n\nAppreciation: Gordie Howe radiated greatness\n\n\"It is like a great golfer,\" Hall of Fame hockey coach Al Arbour said. \"They swing so nice and easy and they make it seem so simple. You try to duplicate that swing and it's impossible.\n\n\"No one could do it like Mr. Hockey. No matter what it was, he could do it well, whether it was penalty killing, power play or making passes.\"\n\nArbour died in 2015 at the age of 82.\n\nHowe was a right-hand shot, and yet he sometimes would shoot left-handed just to confuse the goalie.\n\n\"He probably got 50 or 60 goals in his career like that,\" former NHL goalie Eddie Johnston said. \"A puck would be in his skates and he would kick it to the wrong side. Then he would shoot left-handed and catch you by surprise.\"\n\nHall of Fame player Bill Gadsby, Howe's close friend who passed away earlier this year, often said he would be amused when he read or heard it suggested that Howe wasn't fast.\n\n\"I watched a lot of good skaters try to catch him from behind and never do it,\" Gadsby said.\n\nArbour said when a defender came close to catching Howe, \"he would put it into the next gear.\"\n\n'Meanest, nastiest' on skates\n\nBut there was a flip side, too.\n\nWhile Howe seemed to have more skill than anyone, he also would use his brute strength as an effective weapon.\n\n\"He was a bull,\" Johnston once told USA TODAY Sports. \"If there was no room, he would jam on you. He would drive you and the puck into the net.\"\n\nHowe stood only 6 feet tall and weighed a little more than 200 pounds. Even so, he was so physically intimidating that he seemed monstrous to his opponents.\n\n\"He looked six-foot-eight,\" Hall of Fame goalie Glenn Hall said. \"We thought he should have been playing basketball.\"\n\nHowe was known as a ruthless competitor, a man who didn't use his stick simply to score goals.\n\n\"(Howe) was a miserable guy to play against,\" said Neale, who coached Howe in Hartford. \"He had no conscience when he hit you with his stick. Players didn't touch him very often.\"\n\nHowe had a knack for sending an opponent flying without the victim knowing exactly what had happened to him.\n\n\"He lived up to his reputation of Mr. Elbows,\" former NHL player Ralph Backstrom said in a 2004 interview.\n\nIn 1959, Howe beat up Lou Fontinato in one of the most famous fights in NHL history. Howe was the MVP of the league that season and Fontinato was supposed to be the toughest fighter in the league.\n\nRemembering Gordie Howe: Mr. Hockey to generations\n\nWhen Howe felt wronged, there was no statute of limitations on his vengeance. In 1959, then-Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Bobby Baun knocked Howe senseless with a bodycheck.\n\nin 1967-68, so the story goes, Baun was playing for the Oakland Seals when he saw Howe in a vulnerable position. But this time, just as Baun was about to strike, Howe whacked Baun in the throat with his stick.\n\n\"Baun told me he was lying on the ice. ... He couldn't breathe. He couldn't talk,\" Neale said. \"There was Gordie coasting over to him. He looked down and said, 'Now we are even.' \"\n\nNeale laughed. \"He waited eight years.\"\n\nDuring the 1950 playoffs, Howe suffered a near-fatal brain injury after a collision with Toronto Maple Leafs forward Teeder Kennedy.\n\nWhat actually happened has been the subject of debate for many years, but Howe's brother, Vic, was in the stands and he said Kennedy's stick caught Howe above the eye as Howe was coming at him. Howe's helmetless head struck the ice when he went down.\n\nVic Howe said in a 2004 interview that he went to see Gordie after the period and was told that Howe just needed stitches.\n\n\"But when I went down after the game, trainer Lefty Wilson had a different expression,\" Vic Howe said.\n\nWilson told Vic that his brother was being rushed the hospital. During the night, surgeons had to drill a hole in Howe's skull to relieve the pressure. The story that came out over the next couple of days was that Howe had nearly died.\n\nHe didn't play for the rest of the playoffs, but he was ready to play the following season.\n\nAfter Sid Abel was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in 1952, Alex Delvecchio became the Production Line center. The line continued to have success.\n\n\"Ted and I played together so long that we could anticipate each other's moves,\" Howe once said.\n\nLegendary ambassador for the game\n\nHowe's blend of durability and longevity is unmatched in NHL history.\n\nIn 26 NHL seasons, he played 97% of all of his team's games. From 1961 to 1970, he missed only two games.\n\nHe registered his first 100-point season for the Red Wings when he was 40. At 50, he scored 34 goals for the New England Whalers in 1977-78. At 52, he scored 16 goals in his final NHL season.\n\n\"I would not seriously try to convince anyone that Wayne Gretzky, Bobby Orr or Mario Lemieux wasn't as good as Gordie, because that is an argument that will go on forever,\" Neale said. \"All I know is that I had Gordie when he was 49 and 50, and he was still a phenomenal athlete. ... His passion for the game was unequaled.\"\n\nThe reason why Howe jumped to the WHA was for a chance to play on a professional team with two sons, Mark and Marty. They played together for the Houston Aeros and New England Whalers.\n\nGordie Howe was known for looking out for his sons. Mark Howe has said through the years that the force of Gordie coming after someone who checked his son hurt more than the initial check.\n\n\"The second after I would get hit there would be a much bigger thud,\" Mark Howe said. \"Finally, I had to say to him, 'Dad, I can take a hit from anybody. But you are killing me by hitting the guy who hits me.' \"\n\nHowe has long had a reputation as one of the NHL's top ambassadors. Mark Howe has often told the story of how he was able to hone his hockey skills by playing ball hockey after every Detroit home game, because he knew his father would always spend an hour signing autographs for every person who waited.\n\nIn 2004, rival Bobby Hull said about Howe: \"When everything is gone by the wayside, the only thing that remains is character — and Gordie Howe has character.\"\n\n***\n\nGordon \"Gordie\" Howe\n\nBorn: March 31, 1928, in Floral, Saskatchewan, Canada\n\nNickname: Mr. Hockey\n\nEducation: Attended but did not graduate from King George Community (High) School in Saskatoon\n\nHall of Fame: Inducted in 1972 into the Hockey Hall of Fame; member of 11 halls of fame\n\nPlaying career: 1946-71 with the Detroit Red Wings; 1973-77 with the World Hockey Association's Houston Aeros; 1977-79 with the WHA's New England Whalers; 1979-80 with the NHL's Hartford Whalers.

But, you can still have all of that without the large crowds or high prices. Here are 10 great alternatives to traditionally popular holiday destinations. Happy holidays, indeed.\n\nInstead of South Florida, go to Cape San Blas\n\nPopular South Florida spots like the Florida Keys, Miami, Orlando and Palm Beach get crowded during the holiday season. Hotel prices for a three-star property are close to $250 per night in Downtown Miami for December holiday dates, according to CheapTickets.com. However, you can beat the high prices by opting for Florida’s “Forgotten Coast,” the area around Cape San Blas near the Panhandle. According to experiential travel company Natural Retreats, three- to four-bedroom vacation homes are about $600 less on average compared to Miami in winter.\n\nTemperatures might not be as warm as they are in the south, but you'll still enjoy plenty of sunshine and water activities. Visit the Cape San Blas Lighthouse, take a hike in Dead Lakes Recreation Area, fish at Indian Pass or enjoy dinner along Port St. Joe Marina. The area is also dog-friendly, so it's a great destination for the whole family.\n\nInstead of Switzerland, go to Slovenia\n\nNot only do the Swiss Alps and picturesque Swiss cities like Lucerne attract European winter crowds, Switzerland is also the most expensive country in the world to visit, according to last year's World Economic Forum Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report. For a cheaper alternative ski destination that’s on the euro, look east, to Slovenia.\n\nSlovenia — tucked into Central Europe just south of Austria — is known for its mountains, ski resorts, glacial lakes and Gothic churches. Slovenia has 10 major ski resorts sure to be less crowded than other popular European skiing destinations around the holidays. Head to Maribor or Bled for skiing, culture, natural sights and castles.\n\nInstead of Cancun, go to Costa Maya\n\nCancun is predicted to be the most popular holiday destination this year, according to booking data from CheapOair. If you have your heart set on a Mexican getaway, look beyond Cancun to Costa Maya, about three hours south of the Yucatan Peninsula. This area is less developed, but thanks to a newer cruise port, it's getting better tourist services and infrastructure. And it’s far less pricey: According to Shore Excursions Group, the average four-star hotel stay along the Costa Maya in December can be up to 25% less expensive than Cancun.\n\nCosta Maya has a coral reef, pristine beaches and a rich history, with access to some of the lesser-known Maya sites like Chacchoben, Kohunlich, and Dzibanche.\n\nInstead of Aspen, go to Taos\n\nSkiers flock to Colorado's mountains during winter, especially Aspen, and that means expensive lift tickets, accommodations and airfare. For fewer crowds and lower prices, look toward Taos Ski Valley in New Mexico. Natural Retreats reports that ski condos are about $400 less per night in Taos than Aspen, and three- and four-bedroom homes are close to $1,000 less.\n\nLess than two hours from Santa Fe, you'll find the brand new village and base area in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, close to the New Mexico-Colorado border. Outside the ski village are Ojo Hot Springs, the oldest hot springs in the country, and the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge. Just 30 minutes away is the town of Taos Pueblo, a 1,000-year-old adobe city and UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nInstead of Bora Bora, go to Boracay Island\n\nIf you're looking for an exotic and far-off getaway, avoid popular tropical islands like Bora Bora, Bali and Phuket unless you want to deal with crowds and inflated holiday prices. Instead explore the Philippines, in particular Boracay.\n\nNamed one of Travel + Leisure's Best Islands, Boracay is still relatively undiscovered and has bargain prices. December temperatures stay around 80 degrees and hotel prices are well under $100 per night for comfortable accommodations.\n\nInstead of Los Angeles, go to Palm Springs\n\nLos Angeles is one of the most popular holiday destinations this year for Christmas, according to CheapTickets.com. On top of the crowds, L.A. has expensive hotel prices, with average nightly rates at $250 for three-star properties. Instead, look at Palm Springs for a less-crowded California holiday retreat with a huge vacation rental market to help save on accommodations.\n\nYou'll be able to avoid the city crowds and have perfect temperatures in the desert to enjoy golfing, pool lounging, spa going and hiking. And, with the vast inventory of vacation rentals, it's the perfect place to rent a house for the extended family; check out some options on FlipKey.\n\nInstead of New York City, go to Philadelphia\n\nNew York City is at its best in early winter, with festive decorations and plenty of shopping. It’s a particularly popular destination this year, according to liligo.com, and that will mean jammed-packed streets and sky-high prices. Instead, go to nearby Philly, which offers the same urban-holiday feel with smaller crowds and lower prices.\n\nThe City of Brotherly Love rings in the holiday with a \"winterized\" riverfront park overlooking the Delaware River and a skating rink next to City Hall. There's also the Christmas Village at Love Park, Chestnut Hill Stag and Doe Nights, Macy's Christmas Light Show in the Grand Court, and countless holiday markets around town.\n\nInstead of Las Vegas, go to New Orleans\n\nLooking for the glitz, glam and gambling, but don't want to deal with the expensive hotel suites or big crowds of Las Vegas? Try New Orleans this upcoming season for similar excitement, great food and holiday fun.\n\nYou may see some rain, but mild temperatures and fewer crowds make the holiday season a great time to go. You'll be ahead of the Mardi Gras crowds, but will still get to enjoy the festive spirit that starts in the Big Easy during the holidays with caroling and light festivals. If gambling is more what you're looking for, head to Harrah's Casino downtown or go all out on a Riverboat casino.\n\nInstead of Paris, go to Barcelona\n\nFrance took third place in the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report, and Paris is always a popular European destination around the holidays. Instead, explore a warmer, less-crowded option that still encompasses the euro-holiday spirit. Marina Manasyan of Barcelona Eat Local Food Tours recommends the Catalonian capital as an alternative.\n\nDecember in Barcelona sees temperatures in the mid-50s, and with the summer crowds gone, you can enjoy city walks, famous architectural sites and outdoor restaurants without freezing temperatures. Manasyan estimates an average hotel nightly price to be around $135. Food is also inexpensive compared to Paris, with an average meal costing around $20 (including alcohol). Don't miss the Santa Llucia Christmas Fair and life-size nativity scene for the holidays.\n\nInstead of San Juan, go to Rincon, Puerto Rico\n\nPuerto Rico is always a popular holiday destination, and San Juan in particular is a top-booked spot this year, according to liligo.com. If you want to avoid the crowds of San Juan but still go to Puerto Rico, head to Rincon, which is west of the capital. Tom Spagnola, CheapOair Senior Vice President of Supplier Relations, recommends this less-visited side to Puerto Rico.\n\nRincon sits along the coast that spans from Aguadilla to Cabo Rojo, and is well known for big waves and surfing. In Rincon, you'll find smaller hotels and laid-back bars and restaurants along the beach, all without the crowds of San Juan. Off the coast you'll find Mona Island, which boasts a variety of wildlife that rivals the Galapagos.\n\nREAD THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE: 10 perfect alternatives to popular holiday destinations", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/13"}]}

Besides the standard pledges of tax cuts or a slimmed down state, there has also been an enthusiastic promotion of anti-trans positions, potentially marking an intensification of the current government's \"war on woke.\"\n\nLeading the pack of hopefuls is Rishi Sunak, Britain's former Chancellor of the Exchequer whose resignation from the government last week contributed to the resignation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. After the second round of voting among Conservative Party lawmakers earlier this month, Sunak topped the list of the five candidates who remain in the running.\n\nOne of Sunak's first policy pledges, after he announced his intention to run, was protecting \"women's rights,\" he wrote in a Twitter post , linking to an article in which an unnamed Sunak ally was quoted as saying the lawmaker was \"critical of recent trends to erase women via the use of clumsy, gender-neutral language.\"\n\nSunak will create a manifesto, this ally told British tabloid the Daily Mail , that will oppose trans women competing in women's sport and \"will call on schools to be more careful in how they teach on issues of sex and gender.\"\n\nRishi Sunak, who won the first two rounds of the Conservative leadership contest, will oppose trans women competing in women's sport in his manifesto, an ally told the Daily Mail.\n\nThe Johnson-led government leaned into culture war issues during the pandemic as it attempted to play to its traditional, southern Conservative Party base and new northern English voters won over from the center-left opposition Labour party in the 2019 general election. Even if polling suggests culture war issues, like trans rights, do not preoccupy the day-to-day lives of the British public, many of the candidates have taken up the government's mantle, staking their positions in the debate over sex and gender identity.\n\nOver the past week, Conservative candidates are more likely to have been asked \"what is a woman\" by British journalists than to have been tripped up by more traditional questions, like the cost of a pint of milk. On Wednesday, Sunak's biggest rival in the race, the once relatively little-known junior minister Penny Mordaunt, was asked if she would continue with culture war issues like trans rights.\n\n\"Let me deal with the issue floating around in the background. It was (former UK Prime Minister) Margaret Thatcher who said that 'every Prime Minister needs a Willie,'\" Mordaunt said in reference to Thatcher's deputy, William \"Willie\" Whitelaw. \"A woman like me doesn't have one,\" she added.\n\nMordaunt has spent a lot of time this week rowing back on her past pro-trans views. She told online newspaper Pink News in 2018, for example, that \"trans women are women.\"\n\nIn a 10-part Twitter thread posted last Sunday, Mordaunt u-turned, stressing that trans women might be legally female by law but \"that DOES NOT mean they are biological women, like me.\" She added: \"I am biologically a woman. If I have a hysterectomy or mastectomy, I am still a woman. And I am legally a woman.\"\n\nPenny Mordaunt has come under fire for walking back on her statement that \"trans women are women.\"\n\nDescriptors like \"biological woman\" are considered slurs by trans advocates when they are deployed by gender critical activists, who believe the sex one is assigned with at birth is immutable, and any rights or privileges associated with it cannot be extended to those who choose to identify as that gender.\n\nThe repeated misgendering of trans people in the public sphere is not only harmful to their wellbeing, but suggesting gender does not exist and that a person is the sum total of their reproductive organs is reductive, erasing the existence of trans and non-binary people, say advocates.\n\nYet these gender critical views, parroted by a largely sympathetic British press , have helped restrict efforts to broaden trans rights, say campaigners. This includes trans people potentially being left out of plans for a ban on conversion therapy, and the Conservative-led government scrapping efforts to make it easy for trans people to change their gender marker without medical requirements.\n\n\"Not in my adult lifetime can I remember a situation where in a leadership election or selection process, there's been this amount of focus on LGBTQ+ rights measures,\" Nancy Kelley, chief executive of LGBTQ rights group Stonewall, told CNN.\n\nThe British public is more tolerant than some politicians or the press care to acknowledge, she said. \"I think it's part of a wider phenomenon that we're experiencing in the UK where we have really progressive, positive public attitudes to lesbian, gay, bi and trans people, but we've got plenty of media and political conversation quite obsessively talking about trans people, and largely in a negative way,\" Kelley said.\n\n'Disproportionate and scary'\n\nStonewall CEO Nancy Kelley told CNN \"negative\" media and political rhetoric surrounding trans people in the UK is at odds with \"positive public attitudes\" to LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nA study by think tank More in Common , published in June, found that \"few Britons spend very much of their time thinking about issues of gender identity.\" It added that in focus group conversations \"most Britons, even those who are opposed to trans people using single-sex spaces, look for common sense ways of handling issues around changing rooms and toilets that involve being aware of people and treating one another with respect.\"\n\nAlmost every focus group participant \"asked why there were not also now more unisex toilet options available, which seemed for many to be a practical solution to the issue of single-sex spaces,\" it wrote.\n\nWhat is dominating public discourse is the state of the UK economy , where inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in May, the highest among the G7 leading economies -- and is forecast to climb above 11% later this year despite a series of interest rate hikes. The country is in the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades, forcing households to choose between eating or heating this winter amid no real wage growth for over a decade, say economists.\n\n\"We've got major cost-of-living crisis, we are facing down a global climate emergency, there is war in Ukraine... (and we are) dealing with the aftermath of Brexit -- the fact that the media are asking so obsessively about (trans) issues, and candidates are all being expected to pronounce their views on trans people's place in society is so disproportionate and scary,\" for a group that only accounts for an estimated 0.6% of the population, Kelley said.\n\nWhile Liz Truss has avoided culture war issues in her bid for Conservative party leader, her allies have positioned her against Penny Mordaunt's pro-trans record.\n\nTransphobia might not be an electorally viable strategy, but that has not stopped this year's leadership hopefuls.\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss, who placed third in the second round of voting, has been vocal in her opposition to making it easier for trans people to change their gender markers in England and Wales. While she steered clear of culture wars issues in her leadership speech on Thursday, her allies have been briefing against Mordaunt's pro-trans record.\n\nBehind Truss was former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, a spirited culture wars proponent who warned in 2020 that teaching \"critical race theory as fact\" would be against the law. There is no evidence however that schools have been doing that. Vice News reported this week that Badenoch urged the country's financial services regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to drop its policy on trans inclusion.\n\nBadenoch's spokesperson did not deny the allegation, telling CNN in a statement that \"In response to a FCA consultation, and in her capacity as Equalities Minister, Kemi wrote to the FCA on how they could comply with the Equality Act and improve the representation of women on city boards.\"", "authors": ["Analysis Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/21/mitch-mcconnell-wants-end-beefed-up-unemployment-benefits/5237309002/", "title": "Mitch McConnell wants to end beefed-up unemployment benefits", "text": "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is being accused by Democrats at home and across the country of turning his back on Kentucky at a critical time after he reportedly vowed to put a stop to enhanced unemployment benefits.\n\nMcConnell made clear during a conference call with House GOP members on Wednesday how the $600 weekly boost — which was provided to help those who lost their jobs because of the coronavirus — \"will not be in the next bill\" out of Washington.\n\nA source familiar with the conversation on Thursday told The Courier Journal that McConnell said the Senate was, \"going to have to clean up the Democrats' crazy policy that is paying people more to remain unemployed than they would earn if they went back to work.\"\n\nThis statement comes as 47,000 Kentuckians filed initial unemployment claims as of May 16, and more than 246,000 Kentuckians are asking for continued assistance as parts of the state economy begin to reopen.\n\nOregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee, told The Courier-Journal in an interview Thursday the numbers he's seen show COVID-19 has hit Kentucky with a \"wrecking ball\" economically.\n\n\"Mitch McConnell's comments indicate he either doesn't care or doesn't understand that unemployment insurance doesn't just protect families who've had misfortune, it's a lifeline for communities,\" he said.\n\nWyden said those benefits are more than just wage replacement but also inject demand into the market as a way to stabilize the economy. He is pushing for a bill that would link unemployment benefits to economic conditions and continue the extra $600 until a state's unemployment rate falls below 11%.\n\nRead more:Coronavirus pandemic pushes Mitch McConnell and other Senate candidates to change tactics\n\nKentucky has seen nearly 800,000 people apply for unemployment benefits since mid-March, when the coronavirus first put a choke hold on the U.S. economy. Since then, the state's jobless rate has surged to a little more than 15% in April.\n\nThe Kentucky Democratic Party also pounced on McConnell's hardening position in the context of those statistics, saying it comes as the GOP leader is holding up additional financial aid for states and local governments withstanding massive budget deficits because of the contagion.\n\n“This is what happens when you surround yourself with expensive D.C. consultants who don’t care about Kentucky,\" Democratic Party spokeswoman Marisa McNee said.\n\n\"First, Mitch wanted to let states go bankrupt, leading to layoffs for first responders and public health officials,\" she added. \"Now, he wants to cut unemployment benefits for Kentuckians who are out of work through no fault of their own. Kentucky deserves better.”\n\nRelated:More than 40,000 people filed for unemployment last week in Kentucky\n\nMcConnell said during a Thursday interview with Fox News that continuing unemployment insurance is important amid the coronavirus crisis but emphasized the extra $600 benefits will end in July.\n\n\"We think that in order to create jobs, we need to incentivize people to go back to work, not encourage them to stay home,\" he said.\n\nUnemployment insurance typically covers up to 45% of lost wages, but Congress took an extraordinary and bipartisan step with the CARES Act to provide 100% of lost wages for many Americans.\n\nThe thinking at the time was this was needed in order to keep people safe from the coronavirus while also stabilizing the economy, but McConnell's comments indicate how conservatives are beginning to thaw on the idea.\n\nMcConnell's office pointed to an ABC News story on Thursday about how some employers are having a hard time competing with the boosted benefits.\n\nIn it, ABC draws attention to a study showing roughly 40% of workers made less in their jobs than they would on the new unemployment, according to national data gathered by Noah Williams at the Center for Research On the Wisconsin Economy.\n\nMcConnell has reportedly told President Donald Trump any new legislation must create incentives for people to get back to work. He said previously he wants see how the previous COVID-19 relief bills, which total about $3 trillion, play out before the Senate moves on any new proposals.\n\nGov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said earlier this week how his administration believes it has enough money in its Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund to last through the spring and at least part of the summer.\n\nKentucky took out a $972 million loan to cover unemployment benefits when it zeroed out its trust fund during the Great Recession of 2008-09. The state finished repaying the federal government in 2015.\n\nBut with nearly two in five Kentucky workers out of a job, the governor said he expects the state will have to take out a loan unless the federal government provides more direct assistance.\n\nAsked Thursday if he's worried that unemployment benefits outpacing private sector wages will dampen the reopening, Beshear said he thinks plenty of people are ready to get back to work.\n\n\"I'm not for cutting the benefits they are getting at this time,\" he said.\n\nMcConnell has conceded, according to other reports about Wednesday's conference call, how further aid may be necessary in the coming weeks but that it must be more short-term relief.\n\nHouse Democrats passed the HEROES Act last week with a $3 trillion price tag, but McConnell reportedly told the GOP House members the bill will have to go through serious changes in the Republican-controlled Senate before being considered.\n\nReach Phillip M.

Residents in San Francisco have been contending with a rise in burglaries and car thefts, as well an alarming spate of hate crimes directed against Asian Americans. Los Angeles residents have witnessed a sharp increase in violent crime, while city leaders have been grappling with a homelessness crisis that has led to the proliferation of tents and trash across parks, sidewalks and public spaces, while exposing an untreated mental health emergency on their streets.\n\nOn Tuesday, San Francisco voters registered their disquiet by recalling District Attorney Chesa Boudin amid concern that he was advancing progressive policies as a national criminal justice reform advocate at the cost of their safety. It was a move that signaled just how far the political pendulum has swung since the 2020 election cycle when many Democratic voters cited police accountability and criminal justice overhauls among their top concerns -- a debate that reached a crescendo following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nOn the same night, voters in the overwhelmingly progressive city of Los Angeles signaled their unease with Democrats' handling of crime and homelessness by elevating billionaire shopping mall magnate Rick Caruso, a former Republican who became a Democrat earlier this year, into a runoff race to replace term-limited Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\nSix-term US Rep. Karen Bass was once viewed as the frontrunner in the mayor's race, but Caruso mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge against her, spending $40 million to push the argument that city leaders have failed to keep people safe and have proven inept in finding solutions to house some 41,000 people living on the streets.\n\nBass, a Democrat who led the House negotiations on legislation to increase police accountability after Floyd's death, has promised to make public safety a priority. She pledged to restore the Los Angeles Police Department to its authorized force of 9,700 officers, in part by hiring more civilians to free up 250 officers to return to street patrols. But she has not gone as far as Caruso, who has promised to hire 1,500 additional officers and to bring on some 500 sanitation workers to clean up the streets -- proposals that his critics say the city cannot afford.\n\nFor months now, the crosswinds facing Democrats nationally as they struggle to find an effective message on crime and inflation have been apparent in races across California, where Democrats currently hold all the statewide offices and dominate the congressional delegation.\n\nThe new map that was drawn by the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission last year yielded as many as ten competitive House races in California, where Democrats were bullish about the potential for pickups.\n\nBut those ambitions have been tempered by the fact that Golden State voters are contending with the highest gas prices in the nation, unsettled by the spike in violent crime and frustrated by the fact that they see no improvement in homelessness even though billions of dollars are flowing to build housing and shelters. All those issues have surfaced in close races in the state, emboldening Republicans who are advancing the notion that Democratic policies are leading to chaos.\n\nThe low turnout in Tuesday's elections in California and New Jersey was another sign that Democrats are failing to energize their voters in states that will be key to their hopes of holding control of Congress.\n\nJUST WATCHED Hear Elizabeth Warren's plan to avoid an election loss for Democrats Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hear Elizabeth Warren's plan to avoid an election loss for Democrats 01:19\n\nDespite an array of competitive House races -- where the top two vote-getters regardless of party will advance to the general election -- only 19% of California ballots had been returned as of Tuesday even though they were mailed to nearly 22 million voters weeks ago, according to ballot tracking data from the California-based firm Political Data Intelligence.\n\nMississippi, Montana, Voters also cast ballots in Iowa New Mexico and South Dakota on Tuesday in primary contests that offered a window into how much voters intend to blame the party in power for their dissatisfaction about the state of the economy and the country.\n\nSeveral California Republican incumbents faced their own challenges as the various factions of the GOP continue to wrestle for dominance. Rep. David Valadao, one of ten GOP members who supported Trump's 2021 impeachment, faced a challenge on his right in his Democratic-leaning Central Valley seat -- the new 22nd District. Former Fresno City Councilmember Chris Mathys said he decided to run because of Valadao's impeachment vote, but Trump has not gotten involved in the race.\n\nGOP Rep. Young Kim confronted strong competition from her right flank in the newly drawn 40th District in Orange County from Marine veteran Greg Raths, another Trump loyalist.\n\nOn the flip side, Democrats hope to use GOP Rep. Mike Garcia's ties to Trump against him in California's 27th District after redistricting made his northern Los Angeles County seat more Democratic. (Garcia voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania.) Former state Assemblywoman Christy Smith, a Democrat, will advance to a runoff in the district with Garcia, CNN projected.\n\nIowa Democrats delivered an upset on Tuesday night by rejecting a onetime star in the party, former Rep. Abby Finkenauer, in her bid to take on veteran GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley in November.\n\nFollowing Finkenauer's recent blunder -- where she almost failed to qualify for the ballot when a judge found that she had not met the signature requirements -- as well as her loss two years ago to Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson, Democrats in the Hawkeye State went in a different direction. They chose retired Navy Adm. Mike Franken to go up against Grassley, the longest-serving Republican in the US Senate, who will win his party's primary as he seeks an eighth term, CNN projected.\n\nFinkenauer served for one term in Congress after she won a district in 2018 that former President Donald Trump had carried two years earlier. At that time, she was the second-youngest woman ever elected to Congress, at the age of 29.\n\nElsewhere in Iowa, one of the most competitive races is in the 3rd District, where Rep. Cindy Axne, the only Democrat in the congressional delegation, hopes to hold her seat in a district that Trump would have won by less than half a point. CNN projected that state Sen. Zach Nunn, an Air Force veteran, will win the Republican primary in the Des Moines-area district.\n\nThe other two competitive House races in Iowa are set. GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks will face Democratic state Rep. Christina Bohannan in the new 1st District. In the 2nd District, Hinson will face Democratic state Sen. Liz Mathis, who is also a former local TV news anchor.\n\nThere were also several high-profile congressional races in New Jersey. In the state's 7th District, a battleground that became more Republican in redistricting, CNN projected that Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski and Republican Tom Kean Jr., the former state Senate minority leader and son of former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, will face off in the general election.\n\nIn the 8th District in northern New Jersey, Democrat Rob Menendez Jr., son of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, will win the Democratic primary, CNN projects, as he runs for the seat of retiring Democratic Rep. Albio Sires.\n\nGOP Rep. Chris Smith, who voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill, fended off an array of primary challengers in the 4th District in central New Jersey, including Mike Crispi, a talk show host endorsed by Trump allies such as Roger Stone and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIn Montana, Trump backed his former Interior secretary Ryan Zinke -- despite his history of controversy -- as the candidate attempts to return to Congress . The state won a second congressional seat following the 2020 census results. Zinke faced four other candidates in the GOP primary, including former state Sen. Al Olszewski and pastor Mary Todd, as questions swirl about Zinke's residency\n\nIn South Dakota, Rep. Dusty Johnson will win the GOP primary for the state's only congressional seat, CNN projected. He faced a primary challenge after voting to certify the 2020 presidential election results. CNN also projected that South Dakota GOP Gov. Kristi Noem , a potential 2024 contender, will defeat her primary challenger, state Rep. Steven Haugaard, who had accused her of being insufficiently conservative and spending too much time as governor tending to her ambitions for higher office.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/tn-elections/2018/09/24/marsha-blackburn-phil-bredesen-debate-tuesday-cumberland-university-us-senate-campaign-tennessee/1366780002/", "title": "How Tuesday's debate between Marsha Blackburn, Phil Bredesen ...", "text": "The debate will begin at 6 p.m. CDT\n\nWatch live at Tennessean.com and across the USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee\n\nThe event will take place at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tenn.\n\nAs polls continue to show a tight race between U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn and former Gov. Phil Bredesen, Tuesday's debate at Cumberland University will offer the Republican and Democratic nominees for U.S. Senate an opportunity to make their case to voters.\n\nIt will also pit a candidate who has not debated in at least 16 years but has made regular national TV appearances against someone who has been in dozens of debates since first running for office in Tennessee decades ago.\n\nFor political insiders, Tuesday's event is the most anticipated debate in Tennessee politics since Bob Corker and former U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Jr. squared off three times in 2006.\n\nAnd just like the Corker-Ford race, this year's campaign between Blackburn and Bredesen has high stakes, as national interests have descended into the state while Republicans seek to maintain control of the Senate.\n\nThe debate will also provide the two candidates — who, since entering the race, have only shared a stage at the same time once — an opportunity to go on the offensive and showcase the differences between them.\n\nAs he's campaigned, Bredesen has criticized Blackburn for co-sponsoring a bill that some said hamstrung the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nBlackburn, meanwhile, has tried to tie Bredesen to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nOn the campaign trail:How Phil Bredesen hopes to win Tennessee's US Senate race\n\nOn the campaign trail:How Marsha Blackburn hopes to win Tennessee's US Senate race\n\n\"Inevitably in debates, you try to put your opponent on the defensive,\" said Vanderbilt University political science professor Bruce Oppenheimer. \"The winner is usually the person who can put their opponent on the defensive but how you do that without going overboard — it's a little bit of a balancing act.\"\n\nOppenheimer said candidates can separate themselves in both overt and subtle ways. When Corker and Ford debated in Nashville in 2006, Oppenheimer said he remembers the Republican and former Chattanooga mayor talking about his wife and family. Ford wasn't married at the time.\n\n\"(Corker) talked about that on some issues,\" Oppenheimer said. \"I think it was to soften sort of the hard Republican image that he might have otherwise.\"\n\nOppenheimer said candidates often try to connect with voters by showing how much they are like the viewer.\n\nBlackburn taps debate consultant\n\nTo prepare for Tuesday's debate, the campaigns have seemingly taken different approaches.\n\nBlackburn's campaign hired Brett O'Donnell, a nationally recognized GOP debate coach who has helped Republican presidential candidates, including President George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, John McCain and Michele Bachmann, prepare for debates.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, Time Magazine named O'Donnell one of the \"Five Most Important People Not Running For President.\" O'Donnell's biography boasts of him being described as the \"best political debate coach\" in the country.\n\nTennessee U.S. Senate race polls:Phil Bredesen, Marsha Blackburn vie to replace Bob Corker\n\nBlackburn's campaign has downplayed O'Donnell's work, saying he has largely helped with logistics and planning.\n\nCampaign spokeswoman Abbi Sigler declined to say how the congressman is preparing for the debate but said, \"Marsha looks forward to debating Phil Bredesen and discussing their significant differences.\"\n\nIn an interview, Bredesen said he prefers not to use any debate coaches because they can \"turn you into this caricature of a politician.\"\n\n\"I’ve done (debates) enough and I’m confident enough that I don’t need somebody to pat me on the back and tell me I can do it or something like that,\" he said.\n\nBredesen’s last debate came in 2006, when he squared off against Republican gubernatorial candidate Jim Bryson three times in the lead up to the general election.\n\nDuring the 2002 general election, Bredesen participated in three general election debates, one of which was only broadcast on radio, against Republican nominee Van Hilleary.\n\nBredesen also participated in dozens of debates and forums in primary races and when he was running for Nashville mayor.\n\nWith an eye on Tuesday's debate, Bredesen said he views the event as an opportunity to persuade a handful of voters.\n\n\"It’s a chance to see candidates in the raw where it’s not a TV commercial you shot four times before you got it right,\" he said. \"I think it helps to lessen the distance a little bit between the voter and the candidate and see people in an unscripted situation.\"\n\nBredesen said he would not take the debate for granted.\n\n\"Since we only have two, I can’t have a disastrous first one,\" he said.\n\nBredesen brings debate experience, Blackburn has TV, national speaking exposure\n\nBredesen's breadth of debate experience is a stark contrast to Blackburn, who has debated politicians significantly less, although in recent years she has made more than a hundred of appearances on Fox — according to the Tennessee Democratic Party —and spoken at three Republican National Conventions.\n\nIn 1992, Blackburn had one debate against U.S. Rep. Bart Gordon in the lead up to her first and only unsuccessful bid for office, when she challenged the incumbent Democrat.\n\nBlackburn's campaign said she also participated in a debate in 2002. A review of news articles from the time could not find such a debate.\n\nIn the Republican primary for the 7th Congressional District, Blackburn shared a stage with several of her opponents, including state Sen. Mark Norris, in Cordova.\n\nWhen Blackburn was facing Democrat Tim Barron in the 2002 general election, she did not attend a televised political forum in Clarksville, citing a prior engagement.\n\nHouse Speaker Beth Harwell, R-Nashville, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor this year, said Blackburn needs to reach out voters in the middle.\n\n\"She hasn't asked for my advice but if she did, I would certainly say you've got your conservative base,\" Harwell told Grand Divisions, the USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee's policy and politics podcast. \"To continue to go after them — really?\"\n\nHarwell, who tried to differentiate herself from her GOP opponents by supporting medical marijuana, said one way Blackburn and Bredesen could try set themselves apart is by generating a catchy soundbite.\n\nPrevious Senate debates in Tennessee have featured some memorable moments\n\nIn 1984, Republican Victor Ashe offered Al Gore Jr. a $5 bill if he mentioned presidential candidate Walter Mondale by name.\n\nDuring a 1994 radio debate, Republican Fred Thompson told his opponent Rep. Jim Cooper to \"shut up\" in response to the Democrat raising a question about Thompson's lobbying experience.\n\nIn a 2002 debate between Lamar Alexander and Bob Clement, the Democratic congressman pulled a dollar out of his pocket and asked Alexander to take it. The dollar was a reference to an investment Alexander made when he was governor.\n\nMust-see broadcast for those following politics\n\nOppenheimer said most of the people who will tune into the debate are those who have already been paying attention. But there's always the possibility that the debate could lead one candidate to making a gaffe.\n\nIn terms of what to expect on Tuesday, Bredesen will likely highlight his independence and experience as governor as he points out Blackburn's longevity in Washington, D.C.\n\nBlackburn is expected to remind viewers of her support for President Donald Trump while arguing that Bredesen would fall in lock step with national Democrats.\n\nAlthough the debate might not lead voters to change their minds, it will be must-see-TV for fans of Tennessee politics.\n\nJoey Garrison contributed to this report.\n\nReach Joel Ebert at jebert@tennessean.com or 615-772-1681 and on Twitter @joelebert29.\n\nHow to watch\n\nWhen: 6 p.m. Tuesday\n\nWhere: Cumberland University, Lebanon, Tenn.\n\nWhere to watch: Live on all six sites of the USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee, including Tennessean.com; NewsChannel 5 WTVF-TV; Nashville Public Television will air the debate live at 6 p.m. on NPT-2, with an encore on NPT-1 at 7 p.m.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/politics/primaries-what-to-watch/index.html", "title": "8 things to watch in Tuesday's primaries | CNN Politics", "text": "(CNN) Tuesday's primary elections in seven states will once again test whether Republican voters are willing to punish incumbents with track records of winning competitive races for failing to be sufficiently supportive of former President Donald Trump .\n\nMeanwhile, in California , frustrations over crime and homelessness have shaped an effort to recall San Francisco's district attorney. And the Los Angeles mayor's race pits a billionaire Republican-turned-Democrat against a veteran congresswoman who was on President Joe Biden's vice presidential short list.\n\nCalifornia, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, New Jersey and South Dakota are all set to hold primaries Tuesday. In California, the top two finishers regardless of party will advance to November's general election; the other states' parties will select their nominees for the midterms.\n\nHere are eight things to watch in Tuesday's primaries:\n\nBillionaire former Republican vs. progressive Democrat in liberal Los Angeles\n\nCan a former Republican real estate developer cash in his years of private power in Los Angeles to become the liberal bastion's next mayor?\n\nThat is the question at stake in Southern California on Tuesday, where billionaire Rick Caruso is giving Rep. Karen Bass a stout challenge in their bids to be mayor of Los Angeles.\n\nCaruso has poured millions of his own fortune into the race, pledging to tackle the city's pervasive homelessness, combat corruption and address the city's crime rate by increasing the size of the police force. In a television ad, the former Republican said he was running \"because the city we love is in a state of emergency,\" citing \"rampant homelessness\" and \"people living in fear for their safety.\"\n\nBass, a longtime congresswoman and former member of the California State Assembly, is highlighting many of the same issues -- including crime and homelessness -- but with a more progressive message and is touting her connection to the city. If she were to become Los Angeles' mayor , she would be the first woman to hold the office.\n\nThere is a good chance this could be just the first time Caruso and Bass face off. If no candidate in the 12-person field gets 50% of the vote, the top two finishers in the race move on to a runoff in November.\n\nSan Francisco district attorney at risk of recall\n\nSan Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin was swept into office in 2019 on concerns over police misconduct, criminal justice reform and mass incarceration, a high point for the movement to elect more progressive prosecutors.\n\nThree years -- and one pandemic -- later, the winds have so dramatically shifted against the progressive district attorney and his lax approach to certain kinds of crime that he is facing a recall.\n\nThe effort, and Boudin's time in office, cannot be separated from the coronavirus pandemic, which coincided with a rise in property crime rates in San Francisco. The recall is as much about the feeling among San Francisco residents as it is about crime rates -- homelessness remains a persistent issue in the city as residents report feeling uncomfortable in large swaths of commercial areas because of drug use and crime.\n\nBoudin has sought to fight the effort by labeling it a natural reaction to the election of a progressive prosecutor, linking the effort to Republicans and police unions. But while Republican money is helping the effort, the push to recall Boudin was initially supported by Democrats.\n\nHouse Republicans face challenges from the right\n\nAcross Tuesday's primary map, House Republicans are facing challengers who have cast doubt on their conservative bona fides and their loyalty to Trump.\n\nIn California, Rep. David Valadao -- one of 10 Republicans to support Trump's 2021 impeachment -- is facing a challenge from Republican Chris Mathys, who has campaigned as an ardent Trump supporter and made Valadao's vote his core argument against the incumbent.\n\nIn South Dakota , a trio of statewide elected Republicans, Gov. Kristi Noem, Sen. John Thune and Rep. Dusty Johnson, face primaries from the right. The most serious challenge appears to be state Rep. Taffy Howard's effort to oust Johnson. She has embraced Trump's lies about the 2020 election results and criticized Johnson for voting to certify Electoral College votes.\n\nAnd in New Jersey, Rep. Chris Smith, who was first elected in 1980, is squaring off with conservative talk-radio host Mike Crispi and former FBI agent Steve Gray, who cast the veteran incumbent as too moderate.\n\nCalifornia's 'Orange Curtain' trends back toward Republicans\n\nIn 2018, Orange County offered Democrats what it had offered millions of people before: endless opportunity and significant promise. The party seized on anti-Republican sentiments and turned the historically Republican area -- known politically as California's Orange Curtain -- into a Democratic stronghold, winning all six congressional seats in the county that year.\n\nBut times have changed.\n\nIn 2020, Republicans won back two seats in Orange County -- Michelle Steel and Young Kim defeated Democratic incumbents to flip two seats -- and the party is hopeful it could win at least two other Orange County congressional seats this year, which could be a historically bad year for Democrats.\n\nThe shift highlights how quickly the political landscape in an area can shift. In just four years, Democrats went from newly dominant in Orange County to notably threatened.\n\nA changing of the guard in New Jersey? (Sort of.)\n\nThe candidates might be new, but the names are not.\n\nNew Jersey is home to some of the most powerful political machines in the country and, though a few have been rattled in recent election cycles, their strength is expected to be on display again this year.\n\nIn northern Jersey's 8th Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Albio Sires' retirement announcement did not trigger a rush of candidates to the safe blue district across the Hudson River from New York City. Instead, Sires and other local leaders quickly endorsed Robert Menendez Jr., son of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez. The younger Menendez has vastly outraised and outspent the two other candidates, David Ocampo Grajales and Ane Roseborough-Eberhard.\n\nNearby, in the heavily Democratic 10th Congressional District, Rep. Donald Payne Jr. is a strong favorite to win the nomination again despite a spirited challenge from Imani Oakley, the former New Jersey Working Families legislative director. Oakley's campaign was dealt a blow during a redistricting process that helped consolidate Payne's base. Akil Khalfani, director of the Africana Institute at Essex County College, is also in the race. He ran as an independent in the 2020 election, but won barely 1% of the vote.\n\nOn the Republican side, the big race on Tuesday is in central Jersey's 7th Congressional District, where former state Senate Minority Leader Thomas Kean Jr., son of former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, is the leader in a crowded field vying for a general election date with Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski, who narrowly defeated Kean Jr. in 2020. But Malinowski, who has faced ethics questions, will have an uphill battle to win again after the seat was shorn of some Democratic strongholds during redistricting.\n\nTroubled Mississippi Republican faces primary challenge\n\nRep. Steven Palazzo, first elected to Congress during the tea party wave of 2010, faces six Republican primary challengers amid allegations he misspent hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign and congressional funds and used his office to help his brother's effort to reenlist in the Navy.\n\nAmong his rivals in the Gulf Coast district, Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell and Hancock County businessman Clay Wagner are considered the most likely to, if not defeat Palazzo, then to send the race to a June 28 runoff. The winner on Tuesday needs more than 50% of the vote to clinch the nomination. State Sen. Brice Wiggins, Carl Boyanton, Kidron Peterson and Raymond Brooks are also in the running.\n\nIn addition to the ethics controversies, Palazzo's opponents have criticized him over his attendance record in Congress. Despite publicly opposing proxy voting in the House, he has made good use of the option, exercising it dozens of times even after joining a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi trying to stop it.\n\nAnd in another potentially damaging episode, Palazzo made headlines last month when he bowed out of a candidate forum citing \"meetings dealing with national security\" -- then posted a picture online with his son at a restaurant during the event.\n\nCalifornia Central Valley seat to be filled\n\nThe next occupant of former GOP Rep. Devin Nunes' onetime congressional district will be selected on Tuesday.\n\nThe seat was vacated when Nunes, the controversial congressman who attempted to help Trump avoid scrutiny around Russia's involvement in the 2016 election, decided to leave Congress to become CEO of Trump's media company, Trump Media & Technology Group.\n\nThe seat, which includes much of California's San Joaquin Valley, leans toward Republicans and all indications are that Republican Connie Conway, the former minority leader in the California State Assembly, will win the race. She finished well ahead of Democrat Lourin Hubbard in the April primary.\n\nZinke tries for Montana comeback\n\nFormer Rep. Ryan Zinke, who left his seat for a scandal-plagued tenure as Trump's interior secretary, is attempting a political comeback in Montana -- but is facing familiar questions about whether he spends most of his time there or in California.\n\nZinke, a former Navy SEAL and Montana state senator who was first elected to the House in 2014 and reelected in 2016 before resigning to join Trump's Cabinet, is seizing on an opening created when the 2020 census results handed the Treasure State a second congressional district. Rep. Matt Rosendale, who holds the state's one at-large district seat, is running for reelection in the newly created 2nd District, while Zinke campaigns in the 1st District.\n\nBut Zinke is facing criticism from rivals to his right over whether he was sufficiently supportive of Trump and the former President's effort to build a wall on the US-Mexico border.\n\nHe also faces questions about whether he lives in Montana after Politico reported last month that his wife had claimed a home in Santa Barbara, California, as her primary residence on tax records and other forms. Zinke's campaign responded to the report by saying he lives in Whitefish, Montana, and that his wife had inherited and kept her parents' former home in California, of which she is the sole owner.\n\nZinke faces four other candidates in Tuesday's primary, including former state Sen. Albert Olszewski and pastor Mary Todd.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner", "Dan Merica", "Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/15/politics/cheney-trump-rice-south-carolina-primary-impeach/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Tuesday was a very bad political omen for Liz Cheney ...", "text": "(CNN) For Liz Cheney, Tuesday was a bad day for her political future.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep.

Kim Reynolds signs law shortening early voting", "text": "Four months after Iowans voted in record numbers, Gov. Kim Reynolds has signed legislation cutting the state's early voting period and closing the polls an hour earlier on Election Day.\n\nThe Iowa Legislature approved the measure and sent it to Reynolds' desk late last month. Every Republican present for debate in the House and Senate voted for the legislation. Every Democrat voted against it. Reynolds, a Republican, signed the law Tuesday.\n\nIowa is among a national wave of Republican-led states whose leaders have expressed concerns about the integrity of the 2020 elections, taking the lead from former President Donald Trump, who falsely claimed the election was stolen from him. States such as Florida and Georgia have undertaken high-profile efforts to limit absentee voting after the practice surged in 2020.\n\nWhile there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Iowa or nationally, Republicans have described the state's legislation as an election integrity measure and said it will bring uniformity across Iowa's 99 counties. Democrats say the law will suppress votes and does nothing to improve election security.\n\n\"It’s our duty and responsibility to protect the integrity of every election,\" Reynolds said in a statement. \"This legislation strengthens uniformity by providing Iowa’s election officials with consistent parameters for Election Day, absentee voting, database maintenance, as well as a clear appeals process for local county auditors. All of these additional steps promote more transparency and accountability, giving Iowans even greater confidence to cast their ballot.\"\n\nMore:Group sues over Iowa's new election law, which cuts early and Election Day voting\n\nWhat does Iowa's new election law do?\n\nThe law cuts Iowa's early voting period from 29 days to 20. Polls will now close at 8 p.m. for state and federal elections instead of 9 p.m.\n\nIt significantly tightens the rules for when absentee ballots must be received by county auditors in order to be counted. Ballots must now arrive by the time polls close in order to be counted. Previously, ballots placed in the mail the day before Election Day could be counted as long as they arrived by noon the following Monday.\n\nFor subscribers:The Iowa Legislature's first 'funnel' week is over. Which bills lived and which ones died?\n\nRepublicans have sharply criticized county auditors who they say acted inappropriately during the 2020 election. The law strips auditors of much of their discretion in running elections in their counties. Auditors may no longer establish satellite in-person early voting sites unless petitioned to do so by residents, and they may not mail absentee ballot request forms to voters unless a voter asks for one.\n\nThe law makes it a felony for auditors, or any other election officials, to fail to carry out state election laws or to violate guidance from the Iowa secretary of state. Auditors could also face fines of up to $10,000 for \"technical infractions\" of their duties.\n\nFor subscribers:How do Iowa's early voting period, poll close times compare with those in other states?\n\nThe law also limits who can return a voter's absentee ballot. Only the voter, an immediate family member, household member or caregiver may return the ballot to the auditor's office or place it in the mail. Previously, anyone the voter designated could deliver the ballot on the voter's behalf, but the new law makes it a serious misdemeanor for any unauthorized person to do so. Republicans said the restriction is necessary to prevent \"ballot harvesting\" by political parties or outside groups.\n\nThe law allows counties to establish one ballot drop box at the auditor's office, under video surveillance.\n\nRepublicans argue 'election integrity'; Democrats allege 'voter suppression'\n\nIowa Democrats slammed Reynolds for signing what they describe as a \"partisan voter suppression bill,\" while Republicans said the law would provide \"targeted\" solutions to fix shortfalls in the 2020 election.\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Ross Wilburn said in a statement that the law would \"suppress the voice of Iowans\" and criticized Republicans for fast-tracking the legislation.\n\n\"Iowans have always had a proud tradition of participating in the democratic process with accessible and secure elections,\" Wilburn said in the statement. \"Today, Kim Reynolds and Iowa Republicans have made it more difficult for Iowans, especially seniors and those with disabilities, to be part of this process and have their voices heard.\"\n\n\"This isn't about improving our election process, it's about continuing the Republican Party's outrageous lies and attacks on the democratic process across the country,\" he added.\n\nRepublican Party of Iowa Chair Jeff Kaufmann said Reynolds displayed leadership by signing the legislation and that \"Democrat spin is strong and wild, but truth shines through.\"\n\n\"I applaud Gov. Reynolds and legislative Republicans for showing Iowans that the GOP is listening to their concerns and defending the integrity of our state's election system,\" Kaufmann said in the statement. \"While our election systems were already strong, this bill improves upon the work Republicans did in 2017 when they passed Voter ID laws. The 2020 election showed us where shortfalls in our system existed and Iowa Republicans created solutions targeted at fixing those shortfalls.\"\n\nMarc Elias, an attorney who represents Democrats in court battles around the country over election laws, wrote on Twitter that Iowa should \"expect litigation\" over the new law. Elias has challenged previous election law changes in Iowa, including the 2017 voter ID law.\n\nNational battle over voting rights\n\nIowa's law fits within a national trend by Republican legislatures and GOP-aligned groups to limit absentee and early voting and crack down on other election procedures this year.\n\nEarlier, the Republican State Leadership Committee, which works to elect Republicans to statehouses across the country, announced it was adding House Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford, and Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, R-Ankeny, to a national election integrity commission.\n\nThe panel is made up of Republican secretaries of state and legislative leaders from around the country and aims to share among states best practices \"that make it easier to vote and harder to cheat,\" according to a news release.\n\nOn Monday, Heritage Action, a national conservative group, announced it would spend $10 million across eight states, including Iowa, to run advertising, mobilize volunteers and work with state lawmakers to promote legislation limiting use of absentee ballots, requiring voter ID, verifying voter citizenship and requiring verification of the accuracy of voter registration lists.\n\nThe group's executive director, Jessica Anderson, praised Iowa's law in a statement Monday afternoon and urged the Legislature to go further.\n\n\"By enacting this critical election integrity bill, Gov. Reynolds and the Iowa Legislature have made Iowa one of the states leading the charge to secure our nation’s election,\" she said.\n\nSome Republican-controlled states have moved to rein in voting by mail after the practice surged nationally last year during the coronavirus pandemic. In Georgia, lawmakers are considering limiting early voting on weekends and ending no-excuse absentee voting. In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has proposed restrictions on absentee ballots and limits on ballot drop boxes.\n\nAs of Feb. 19, the Brennan Center for Justice has tracked 253 bills introduced around the country this year with provisions that would restrict voting access and 704 bills that would expand voting access.\n\nThe Supreme Court last week heard arguments in a case challenging voting restrictions in Arizona that voting rights groups fear could weaken an anti-discrimination provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation last week that would expand access to voting, including early voting. It's unclear if the U.S. Senate will approve the measure. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed an executive order on Sunday directing the federal government to promote voting access.\n\nThe federal legislation, if enacted, would do little to reverse the changes to Iowa law that Reynolds signed on Tuesday. It would require all states to offer same-day voter registration, which Iowa already does, and would set a minimum of 15 days of early voting. But it would also require states to set up automatic voter registration systems, which Iowa currently does not provide.\n\nMore than 1.7 million Iowans cast ballots in last year's election — nearly 76% of registered voters. That included more than 1 million people who voted early, either by mail or in person. Both those figures broke state records.\n\nAccording to data from the Iowa secretary of state, 76% of Democrats and 52% of Republicans voted early in the 2020 election, either by mail or in person.\n\nThat turnout propelled Republicans to victory up and down the ballot in Iowa, where Trump and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst won high-profile races and the party gained seats in the Iowa House.\n\nIowa Republicans, like the bill's House floor manager, Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, say it will remain easy to vote early or on Election Day in Iowa.\n\n\"It’s going to remain really easy to vote after this legislation is signed into law,\" Kaufmann said during debate last month. \"This bill protects Iowans’ right to vote and it adds certainty and security to it. This bill does not suppress one single vote.\"\n\nThere were 12 convictions for election misconduct in Iowa in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, according to a fiscal note on the legislation compiled by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency.\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

Madison Cawthorn to lose his North Carolina primary race on Tuesday. But they're also preparing for an alternate scenario: how to deal with the embattled freshman if he returns to Congress after becoming a party pariah.\n\nIn private discussions, GOP lawmakers are debating ways to keep Cawthorn on the sidelines should he prevail in his North Carolina reelection race , from relegating him to less favorable committees to warning the punishments could get even stiffer should his controversial antics continue, according to interviews with more than a dozen lawmakers from across the House Republican conference.\n\nOne GOP lawmaker affiliated with the Trump wing of the party told CNN they bluntly warned Cawthorn that they would publicly call for him to be removed from the House GOP conference if he breaks the law again, furious that Cawthorn was cited twice for bringing a gun to the airport and was caught driving with a revoked license for the second time in 5 years in North Carolina.\n\n\"I met with the guy and said, 'Don't break the law again. You break the law one more time, I'm going to start calling for you to be kicked out,'\" the lawmaker said. \"And I don't mean kicked out of (the House Freedom) Caucus, I mean kicked out of Conference. Voting him out. He's a black eye on our conference.\"\n\nThat idea of ousting Cawthorn from conference has not been discussed by Republican leadership and doesn't appear to have wide traction inside the GOP but has been kicked around by some rank-and-file members, the lawmaker said, demonstrating the level of frustration with Cawthorn inside the House GOP.\n\nThrough a spokesman, Cawthorn declined to comment to CNN for this story.\n\n\"We're declining to participate in this piece,\" Cawthorn spokesman Luke Ball wrote in an email.\n\nMeanwhile, some members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, of which Cawthorn is a member, have sat him down and told the 26-year-old to get his act together, according to multiple GOP lawmakers familiar with the conversations.\n\nAfter Cawthorn sparked an uproar for insinuating his colleagues had invited him to orgies and done cocaine in front of him, the conservative crew briefly contemplated booting Cawthorn from the caucus, though they never followed through with the threat. But one member of the group also suggested it's not a given that the MAGA firebrand will be invited back to the House Freedom Caucus next year, if he is reelected, noting that the group is invite only, and said Cawthorn is going to have to \"own up\" to his mistakes.\n\nAs his colleagues debate his future in the party, Cawthorn -- once seen as a rising star in the GOP -- increasingly finds himself on an island on Capitol Hill, suggesting his problems won't end if he manages to clinch the GOP nomination for his seat.\n\nMadison Cawthorn speaks to the crowd before former President Donald Trump takes the stage at a rally in April in Selma, North Carolina.\n\nHis mentors in Congress have given up on him, and when asked by CNN, none of the other nine Republican members of the North Carolina delegation offered support for his reelection campaign. One, Sen. Thom Tillis, is now a part of the effort to defeat him, supporting State Sen. Chuck Edwards in an effort to unseat Cawthorn.\n\nEven one of his biggest cheerleaders, former President Donald Trump, does not appear to be riding to the rescue. Trump did not respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\n\"There's no one thing that put me in a position to where the first time in my career I'm opposing a sitting Republican,\" Tillis told CNN. \"I've never done it. But it's the totality. It's a lack of seriousness.\"\n\n'It's kind of up to him to get his act together'\n\nBefore he was elected, Cawthorn had a slim resume: he worked as a manager at a Chick-fil-A, as a staff assistant in former Rep. Mark Meadows' district office and completed one semester of college.\n\nHe portrayed himself as an owner of a real estate investment company but did not disclose any income from it.\n\nBut Cawthorn won his primary against a Trump-endorsed candidate in 2020, and quickly became a rising star on the right. He spoke at the Republican Party's 2020 convention about how a car crash in 2014 left him paralyzed from the waist down. He began the speech from his wheelchair and ended it standing up with the support of staff and crutches.\n\nWhen Cawthorn arrived in Congress, he was interested in serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. But the GOP Steering Committee -- which doles out committee assignments and includes members of leadership -- was concerned that he had posted a picture of Hitler's vacation home on his Instagram and referred to it as a bucket list item, according to GOP lawmakers with direct knowledge of the internal conversations. In the post, Cawthorn did denounce Hitler as \"a supreme evil.\"\n\nYet Republicans still saw potential in Cawthorn and decided to team him up with a set of mentors to help groom him for a future seat on his desired committee. Both Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a member of GOP leadership, and Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs panel, were tasked with showing him the ropes, sources said.\n\nBut multiple frustrated lawmakers familiar with the situation say Cawthorn has consistently rebuffed McCaul and Johnson's efforts to take him under their wing. They also said Cawthorn would thank lawmakers for their advice -- which has ranged from getting off Twitter to stop breaking the law -- and then turn around and do the exact opposite.\n\nNow, if Cawthorn returns to Congress, top tier committees like House Foreign Affairs are out of the question, according to GOP members who have insight into the decision-making process.\n\n\"If he gets a committee at all, it will be some obscure assignment. He has zero chance (of getting on a good committee),\" said a senior GOP lawmaker \"We would be mocked as a conference if we put him on anything meaningful.\"\n\nRep. Madison Cawthorn leaves a meeting of the House Republican Conference at the Capitol Hill Club in December 2021.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise hauled Cawthorn in for a meeting in March , where McCarthy told the freshman lawmaker that he lost his confidence in him and needs to turn his life around. At the time, McCarthy said his committee seats could be on the line if he doesn't. Since that meeting, Cawthorn was cited a second time for bringing a firearm to the airport.\n\nMcCarthy did not answer a question from CNN on Thursday about whether he's seen signs of improvement in Cawthorn's behavior. But lawmakers see him as highly unlikely to boot Cawthorn from conference or committees, wanting to maintain a sense of party unity.\n\nScalise, when asked by CNN about Cawthorn's future committee assignments, said: \"Steering Committee makes that decision.\" And when asked if the House GOP's campaign arm is supporting Cawthorn in his primary, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer said: \"We don't get involved in primaries\"\n\nSome Republicans think Cawthorn could still redeem himself if he offered a sincere apology to the conference and started listening to their advice. But most lawmakers are doubtful Cawthorn would do that.\n\n\"It's kind of up to him to get his act together. ... But at some point in time, the conference is going to have to cut its losses,\" said another GOP lawmaker. \"My hope is that North Carolina-11 will deal with it. But if they don't, my argument has always been: we should.\"\n\nOthers have taken a more sympathetic tone with Cawthorn. Said Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican: \"I actually pray for him, because I know he's made some big blunders. And you know, it's probably not a good thing to say, but it's the truth. And I've talked to him and I've told him I pray for him.\"\n\nRep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, said he and Cawthorn have a \"common bond\" given injuries they both have endured.\n\n\"But the last thing I told him was this, and that as a member of Congress, you're going to be known -- right, wrong or indifferent -- you're going to be known for something. So figure out what you want to be known for. And make that it,\" Mast told CNN.\n\nAsked if Cawthorn would be welcomed back into the conference if wins his primary, Mast said: \"By some yes, by some no.\"\n\n'He's an embarrassment on any day that ends in \"y\"'\n\nNone of Cawthorn's North Carolina Republican colleagues are coming to his aid against state Sen. Chuck Edwards, GOP official Michele Woodhouse and others.\n\nAsked whether he supported Cawthorn for his reelection, Rep. David Rouzer said, \"I'm not getting involved in the primary one way or another.\"\n\nRep. Dan Bishop said, \"I don't have a comment on that.\"\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx laughed, paused, and said, \"Right now, I'm just going to vote.\" Her campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLast spring, Foxx posted online Cawthorn's effusive endorsement of her. Much has changed since then.\n\nSeveral former college classmates accused Cawthorn of sexual harassment and misconduct; he denied doing anything inappropriate\n\nHe was charged with driving with a revoked license and cited for bringing a loaded gun to the Charlotte airport . A spokesman said he brought the gun \"by mistake.\" The congressman was not charged for a similar incident in Asheville last year, but was charged with a misdemeanor for the Charlotte airport episode.\n\nMadison Cawthorn speaks at an event held at the Hilton Anatole in July 2021 in Dallas, Texas.\n\nHe called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"thug\" and the Ukrainian government \"incredibly evil,\" shortly after Russia invaded their country. He claimed that he had been invited to an orgy in Washington and had personally seen people do \"a key bump of cocaine.\"\n\nIn April, Tillis said the House Ethics Committee should investigate whether he violated federal insider trading laws in promoting an anti-Biden cryptocurrency\n\nAnd this month, Cawthorn said he was \"being crass with a friend, trying to be funny,\" and just \"acting foolish\" after an opposition group released a video of the congressman appearing to be naked in bed with another man\n\n\"I told you there would be a drip drip campaign,\" tweeted Cawthorn. \"Blackmail won't win. We will.\"\n\nSome of Cawthorn's allies think he should be given some slack given his age and the era\n\n\"I think Madison is the first Zoomer elected to Congress,\" said Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. \"And I think if a lot of these Boomers and Gen Xers and a few of the older millennials had had a video camera attached to them at all times through their adolescence and in their early 20s we might think differently about them too.\"\n\nBut many of those officials don't. Retiring North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr said, \"He's an embarrassment on any day that ends in 'y.'\"\n\nCawthorn also aggravated politically powerful critics back home, which viewed him as either unwilling or unable to deliver for his district. They chafed at stories about him closing district offices -- which he denied -- and his attempt to be a young kingmaker in his first year in public office.\n\nIn November 2021, he announced plans that he would change districts, kneecapping state House Speaker Tim Moore, who had been expected to run for the seat. A few weeks later at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Cawthorn gave the former President a map of the state titled \"Congressman Cawthorn's plan for North Carolina,\" recommending that Trump back local GOP official Michele Woodhouse for his old district and Republican candidate Bo Hines, 26, for another House race.\n\nRep. Madison Cawthorn arrives for the State of the Union address at the US Capitol on March 1.\n\nThis past winter, Cawthorn privately floated running against veteran North Carolina Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry, according to people familiar with the matter and closely connected to North Carolina politics. But in late February, after the congressional map was set, Cawthorn decided to stay put in his district in the western part of the state and run for reelection.\n\nAfter the series of damaging revelations, Hines recently told Axios , \"We're nothing alike.\"\n\nEven Trump appears to be putting some distance between him and Cawthorn. Trump endorsed him in a video last year, but people close to the former president have been privately pointing out to others in the party that there's no formal press release on Trump's website touting the endorsement, according to one GOP lawmaker who has been closely following the primary race.\n\n\"I would say everybody comes to Congress with a little bit different approach. Some people are clearly workhorses and then you get some that seem to be more interested in being show horses,\" said Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican. \"It only takes about five or six months before you figure out what really makes somebody tick around here.\"\n\nWhen asked where Cawthorn falls on the list, Johnson replied: \"I think it's pretty obvious.\"\n\nRep. Tom Rice of South Carolina, one of ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection, was blunter.\n\n\"He said he wasn't here to legislate, that he's here to build up public relations,\" Rice told CNN. \"He certainly would have bothered a lot of people with his lies. It bothers me when he talks about being invited to orgies and such.

The former law professor at the University of Louisville is only 38 and was appointed to the federal district bench just last October.\n\nBut Walker, a graduate of St. Xavier High School and later Duke and Harvard Law School, had a power ally in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a family friend and mentor.\n\nThe confirmation puts Walker in line for a future nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Donald Trump, if he wins reelection, or a future Republican president. The appellate court in the nation’s capital has long been a springboard for future justices.\n\nThe confirmation vote went along party lines. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only Republican to vote against Walker. Forty Democrats and one Independent voted against, while seven senators were absent.\n\nLegal paper:Some U of L law professors have turned on Justin Walker\n\nWalker will be the youngest judge on the court, according to Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who follows judicial nominations.\n\nIn a tweet, McConnell said, “We Kentuckians are sorry to lose Judge Justin Walker, but we’re very proud this brilliant and fair jurist will be serving our nation on the D.C. Circuit.”\n\nThe National Law Journal reported this month that five U of L law professors who supported Walker for U.S. District Court said he needed more seasoning before he was elevated to the higher court.\n\nOne of them, Sam Marcosson, also said Walker's order allowing to a church to hold drive-in services on Easter Sunday amid the coronavirus pandemic was “troubling” because it reached unnecessary legal conclusions and had a “tenor and a tone that I thought was over the top.” Walker wrote that Mayor Greg Fischer was trying to “criminalize Easter.”\n\nWalker has no trial experience but had the conservative pedigree that McConnell has embraced in trying to remake the federal courts, which he has cited as his legacy.\n\nWalker was a star in the Federalist Society and clerked for both Justice Anthony Kennedy and Judge Brett Kavanaugh when he was on the D.C. Circuit. Walker then campaigned for Kavanaugh’s nomination to the highest court when he came under fire over reports that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when the two were in high school.\n\nWalker gave 119 interviews to the news media and made several speeches paid for by the Federalist Society rebutting Kavanaugh critics, The New York Times has reported, and Kavanaugh attended Walker’s swearing-in ceremony last fall.\n\nRead this:5 things to know about Walker and his backing by McConnell\n\nDemocratic opponents on the Senate Judiciary Committee portrayed Walker as a conservative ideologue and noted he said at the ceremony that “in Brett Kavanaugh’s America, we will not surrender while you wage war on our work, or our cause, or our hope, or our dream.”\n\nWalker also said: “Although we are winning we have not won. Although we celebrate today, we cannot take for granted tomorrow — or we will lose our courts and our country to critics who call us terrifying and who describe us as deplorable.”\n\nDemocrats also said Walker had denounced the Affordable Care Act, but Walker testified he did so in his private capacity and would abide by the Supreme Court decision upholding it.\n\nHis confirmation came despite last-minute misgivings expressed by some of his former colleagues at U of L's Brandeis School of Law, who questioned his experience and judgment.\n\nWalker was raised in Louisville by his mother, Deborah Walker, whom The Times said he once described as “a single working mom” who “made indescribable sacrifices to provide me, the first in my family to graduate from college, with the opportunities she didn’t have herself.”\n\nBut his maternal grandfather, Frank R. Metts, was a millionaire real estate developer and Kentucky Transportation Cabinet secretary under Gov. John Y. Brown Jr. Walker’s parents divorced in 1985, when he was 3.\n\nTop headlines:Daniel Cameron won't put timetable on Breonna Taylor investigation\n\nWalker grew up in a Democratic family but was a conservative from a young age. At 13, he wrote a letter to The Courier Journal praising the Christian Coalition and saying he had recently attended its convention.\n\nHe met McConnell when he was in high school, introduced by the husband of his grandmother after she she remarried.\n\nIn 2002, Walker interned in McConnell’s office, and after graduating from Duke two years later, he worked on the reelection campaign of President George W. Bush, and then served as a speechwriter for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.\n\nWalker worked at a large D.C. law firm before and after his clerkships, then moved in 2015 to Louisville, where he practiced law on his own before joining the Louisville office of Dinsmore & Shohl last year.\n\nAt U of L, he co-directed the Ordered Liberty Program at Brandeis Law School — a fellowship devoted to the study of “federalism, separation of powers, originalism, natural rights, and the common good.”\n\nWalker is married, and he and his wife, Anne, whom he met at Duke, have one daughter. They have run a nonprofit in Louisville called Global Game Changers for children from grades K-5 that tries to “transform student outcomes and empower them to overcome apathy and feel empathy,” according to its website.\n\nWalker was well-liked at Brandeis Law School. Last July, 16 faculty and staff of various political persuasions signed a letter submitted to the Judiciary Committee endorsing his nomination for U.S. District Court.\n\nSome professors independently supported his elevation to the appellate court, but there was no letter sent by the faculty.\n\nMore news:DACA recipients relieved SCOTUS denies Trump bid to end protections\n\nAndrew Wolfson: 502-582-7189; awolfson@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @adwolfson.

At Bramall Lane in Sheffield the Lionesses turned on the style as they powered past the world’s second-highest ranked team with goals from Beth Mead, Lucy Bronze, Alessia Russo and Fran Kirby.\n\nThe victory over Sweden ended England’s semi-final hoodoo after losses at the 2017 Women’s Euros and the 2019 and 2015 World Cups. They will now play Germany in Sunday’s showpiece at Wembley Stadium in London (5pm kick-off, live on BBC One).\n\nSunday will represent England’s third appearance in the competition’s final, said Sky Sports. At the inaugural Women’s Euros in 1984 they were beaten on penalties by Sweden after the two-legged final ended 1-1 on aggregate. Then in 2009 they lost 6-2 to Germany.\n\nShould England triumph at Wembley it would also see Wiegman win the tournament for the second time in succession. She led her native Netherlands to victory in 2017.\n\nLegacy programme goals\n\nBefore and throughout the tournament Wiegman has spoken about how the Lionesses had aimed to “inspire the nation” at their home Euros. When asked in the post-match press conference if the win over Sweden was a statement to their rivals, she said: “Yes, I think so. We said we’re ready to write history and this is it.”\n\nWhen England won the bid to host this year’s tournament, the Football Association (FA) said it hoped that the major event would “inspire positive change” and develop the women’s and girls’ game in Sheffield, Rotherham, Manchester, Trafford, Wigan and Leigh, Milton Keynes, London, Southampton and Brighton & Hove.\n\nAs part of the FA and Uefa’s Women’s Euro 2022 legacy programme, the three main goals were to “give access for all girls to play football in school and clubs”; create a diverse workforce of coaches, referees and local leaders “delivering and organising football for their communities”; and provide inclusive, safe and welcoming environments for “every woman and girl to play competitive or recreational grassroots football, irrespective of ability, disability, age or ambition”.\n\nHead coach Wiegman believes that the team’s performances are “making a difference” and that the “whole country is proud” of the progress. “Even more girls and boys will want to play football.”\n\nEnd the ‘eyebrow-raising disparities’\n\nWatching the semi-final from the gantry at Bramall Lane, BBC pundit Ian Wright said he felt “as proud as I’ve ever felt of any England side”. However, the former Arsenal and England striker did send a warning to the authorities who run the game. “Whatever happens in the final now, if girls are not allowed to play football in their PE, just like the boys can, what are we doing?” he said. “We have got to make sure they are able to play and get the opportunity to do so. If there’s no legacy to this – like with the Olympics – then what are we doing.”\n\nThis year’s European Championship has “caught the imagination of football fans and the wider public” and the women’s game is “undoubtedly, having a moment”, said Marie-Christine Bouchier, the Professional Footballers’ Association’s director of women’s football, writing in The Guardian. England’s performances have led the newspaper back pages and “even more of the players are becoming household names”.\n\nThe real legacy, however, “must be true parity” for female footballers in England, Bouchier added. In April the government endorsed ten key strategic recommendations set out in a fan-led review of football in England. Published in November 2021 by former sports minister Tracey Crouch, a number of “detailed recommendations” were made, including that women’s football “should be treated with parity and given its own dedicated review”.\n\n“Now is the perfect time” to launch the promised review and “end eyebrow-raising disparities”, Bouchier said. “It’s an opportunity that we need to make sure we don’t miss.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/football/womens-euro-2022-preview-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Women's Euro 2022: Record-breaking crowds, the favorites and ...", "text": "(CNN) Euro 2022 looks set to be the crescendo for a record-breaking wave of support for women's football in Europe this season.\n\nAround 450,000 tickets have already been sold for the 16-team tournament -- including a sellout 73,200 for England's opener against Austria at Old Trafford and 87,200 for the Wembley final -- far exceeding the previous record of 240,000 set in the Netherlands four years ago.\n\nThe hype around the tournament follows on from a season that saw numerous attendance records broken across the continent.\n\nIn Spain, Barcelona set a new world record attendance figure for a women's game as 91,648 packed a sold out Camp Nou for the first leg of its Champions League semifinal against Wolfsburg, breaking a record that had stood since the 1999 Women's World Cup final.\n\nThere were also records broken in France, where 43,254 fans turned up at the Parc des Princes to watch Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League semifinal against Lyon, while England also saw its club attendance record broken as 49,094 saw Chelsea beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\n\nExcitement for the start of the Euro 2022 is palpable in Sweden, too, where a record 33,218 turned out to watch the national team beat Brazil in its final warmup game.\n\nThis season has proved, beyond doubt, that a huge appetite for women's football exists across Europe.\n\nFor that reason, there has been some consternation around UEFA's decision to use stadiums, such as the Manchester City Academy Stadium and Leigh Sports Village, that some players and fans consider too small for such a major tournament.\n\nBarcelona twice broke the world record for largest women's attendance last season.\n\nEuro 2022 favorites\n\nEngland\n\nHost nation England comes into Euro 2022 with a realistic chance of winning the first major trophy in the national team's history.\n\nHome advantage in front of a record-breaking English crowd will no doubt play its part, but the team has been hugely impressive under head coach Sarina Wiegman since her appointment in September 2021.\n\nEngland remains unbeaten under the Dutchwoman, who guided the Netherlands to glory at the championship four years ago. Under Wiegman, England has scored a remarkable 84 goals, including a record-breaking 20-0 win over Latvia, and conceding just three.\n\nThe Lionesses continued their impressive buildup to the tournament with an eye-catching 5-1 win over Wiegman's former team, before going on to beat Switzerland 4-0.\n\nA team boasting the talents of forward Lauren Hemp, striker Ellen White and defender Lucy Bronze can compete with the very best, but the overriding question is whether this group can cope with the weight of expectation.\n\nThe national team has reached the semifinals in each of the last three major tournaments, but fallen short of reaching the final every time.\n\nThis iteration of the side is arguably the most talented of them all and, after the men's team reached the Euro 2020 final last year, England fans are understandably optimistic about seeing their national team in a Wembley final for the second summer running.\n\nJill Scott celebrates after scoring England's fourth goal during its win over Switzerland.\n\nSpain\n\nWhile the bookmakers have Spain going into the tournament as the narrow favorite, it is perhaps more accurate to view this team as the favorite among the dark horses.\n\nThe team laid down a marker with an impressive 7-0 rout of slightly understrength Australia in its penultimate warmup game ahead of the tournament, before drawing 1-1 against Italy on Friday.\n\nHowever, just a day before the tournament was set to begin, Spain was dealt the huge blow that star player and 2021 Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas had ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament, meaning she will miss the tournament and several months beyond.\n\n, and her absence likely ends Spain's chances of upsetting one of the more established nations. Putellas is arguably the most gifted player in the world and someone who is able to single-handedly win a match with a moment of individual geniusand her absence likely ends Spain's chances of upsetting one of the more established nations.\n\nSpain's rise on the international stage has coincided with Barcelona becoming a domestic and European powerhouse over the past couple of seasons, and no less than nine Barcelona players have made it into Jorge Vilda's final 23-player squad.\n\nJUST WATCHED Alexia Putellas is hungry for more success in 2022 Replay More Videos ...

The 26-year-old only returned to Norway's national team in April after a five-year absence.\n\nAfter finishing as runner-up at Euro 2013, Norway went into the tournament in the Netherlands five years ago with high hopes.\n\nHowever, the team finished bottom of its group and Hegerberg subsequently quit the national team setup, saying her experiences with the side left her \"mentally broken\" and frustrated with the way women's football was regarded in Norway.\n\nHegerberg continued to excel at club level for Lyon and her form led her to being crowned the winner of the inaugural women's Ballon d'Or in 2018\n\nBut in January 2020, Hegerberg ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament, which sidelined her for almost two years.\n\nWhen she returned in October 2021, she hit the ground running and helped Lyon reclaim the French league title it had lost to Paris Saint-Germain the previous season. She also notched a goal and an assist in the Champions League final to wrestle the crown back from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the most lethal goalscorers in the women's game -- her prowess in front of goal epitomized by a hat-trick in her first game back for Norway after five years -- Hegerberg will be gunning to make up for lost time on the international stage.\n\nAda Hegerberg scored on her return to the Norway national team.\n\nVivianne Miedema\n\nOver the past few years, Vivianne Miedema has become one of the most prolific and feared strikers in world football.\n\nStill only 25, the Arsenal star boasts an eye-watering 92 goals in 109 games for the Netherlands and is the all-time top scorer in a Dutch national team shirt, women's or men's.\n\nHer exploits for Arsenal in the Women's Super League -- she is now the top scorer in the league's history -- recently earned her a new contract that reportedly makes her the highest paid women's player in England.\n\nMiedema finished second in the Golden Boot race at Euro 2017 -- scoring four goals, including two in the final -- as the Netherlands' women won their first major international trophy. It seems more than likely she will once again be among the leading scorers this time around.\n\nVivianne Miedema is now reportedly the highest paid women's player in England.\n\nLauren Hemp\n\nFew players in Europe will get you out of your seat like Lauren Hemp.\n\nA tricky winger with blistering pace, magical close control and an eye for goal, the 21-year-old ticks perhaps every box imaginable for an attacking player.\n\nHemp scored 20 goals and notched 10 assists in 36 games for Manchester City last season on her way to being voted the PFA's Young Female Player of the Year for a record fourth time.\n\nSuch has been her form both domestically and internationally, Hemp has moved the conversation on from her being England's best young player to being England's best player full stop.\n\nHer goal against Chelsea in the FA Cup final -- which City ultimately lost -- showcased all of her abilities, as she jinked inside onto her weaker right foot and curled the ball into the far corner.\n\nGoing into this tournament, few players will be giving opposition defenders nightmares like Hemp.\n\nLauren Hemp is one of the most exciting players at Euro 2022.\n\nHow to watch\n\nIn the United Kingdom, all Euro 2022 matches will be shown across the BBC, the national broadcaster, while ESPN and TUDN will be showing the tournament in the United States.", "authors": ["Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2021/09/09/new-england-coach-wiegman-against-biennial-womens-world-cup/49077949/", "title": "New England coach Wiegman against biennial Women's World Cup", "text": "AP\n\nLONDON (AP) — Setting out her vision as England manager, Sarina Wiegman was sure of one thing — the Women's World Cup should remain every four years.\n\nThere's no need for FIFA to push through plans to double the frequency of its flagship tournament, according to Weigman.\n\n“The Euros are great, the World Cup is great, the Olympics are great so that is three tournaments,\" she said, pitchside at Wembley Stadium on Thursday. \"I think if you have a World Cup every two years that is too much for the players at the moment so I wouldn’t be cheering for it right now.\n\n“It is too many tournaments, for Europe it is good (at the moment), the development in Europe for women’s football is ahead of most other continents. So for Europe it is not necessary.\"\n\nWiegman is taking charge of England after a five-year stint in charge of her native Netherlands that saw her win the Women's European Championship in 2017 and reach the 2019 World Cup final. Jill Ellis, who led the U.S. to victory in that final, is now heading a FIFA technical advisory group that will explore the merits of biennial World Cups. The prospect of more regular World Cups has already been talked up by FIFA Presient Gianni Infantino despite resistance from European football's governing body UEFA.\n\n“It is about visibility,\" Wiegman said, “but I think also think we need to take care of the well-being of the players and sometimes they need a rest.”\n\nIt's taken a year since Wiegman's appointment was announced for her to start with England. Her last game as Netherlands coach was at the Tokyo Olympics in July, a quarterfinal loss to the U.S. on penalties.\n\nThe pandemic disruption to the calendar means the Women's European Championship, which England is hosting, now starts in July 2022. Then there's the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 2023, followed by the Paris Olympics in 2024 and the Euros in 2025.\n\n“Of course because of COVID we have five tournaments in a row, which is enough,\" Wiegman said. \"At big tournaments you want the best players on the pitch.\n\n“If you look now at the competitions in England there are so many games, Champions League, international players and you play for your club team — you play so many games because you are one of the best, you are a game-changer so when can you have a rest, we should take care of the welfare of the players.\"\n\nFIFA's plans could ultimately see men's and women's tournaments played every year around June and July. That would prevent women's football having odd-numbered years largely clear currently for its tournaments in a period of growth and trying to attract new audiences.\n\n“You don’t want two tournaments (men and women’s) at the same time,\" she said, \"because people are going to have to choose.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/957423/england-lionesses-simply-dont-know-when-theyre-beaten", "title": "Uefa Women's Euro: Lionesses 'simply don't know when they're ...", "text": "Georgia Stanway was England’s hero after scoring a spectacular extra-time winner in last night’s Uefa Women’s Euro quarter-final against Spain. The 2-1 victory over the pre-tournament favourites means the Lionesses will now take on Sweden or Belgium in the semi-final next Tuesday.\n\nSpain had been “sharp” going forward and took a deserved lead in the 53rd minute through Esther Gonzalez, said Reuters. It was the first goal conceded by the Lionesses in 482 minutes of play and “left them in unfamiliar territory” – having to come from a goal behind.\n\nWith six minutes left to play in normal time England did get the equaliser when substitute Ella Toone volleyed in. Then six minutes into the first half of extra-time Stanway’s rocket proved to be the difference between the two sides.\n\nAs Stanway sprinted over to the corner to celebrate, “a rendition of Football’s Coming Home broke out in the stands” at the Amex Stadium in Brighton, said Emma Sanders on the BBC. The “significance” of this victory “was clear” as England’s bench ran on to the pitch at full-time to celebrate. The Lionesses are “on a winning run” and they are “desperate for it to continue all the way to the final at Wembley”.\n\nWinning goal ‘straight out of a comic’\n\nThe goal that took England to the last four was “one of those moments you could see unfold and may well be watching for years”, said Sid Lowe in The Guardian. Striding forward, Stanway was “willed on by everyone” and from 25 yards out “smashed in a shot straight out of a comic”.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who signed for German club Bayern Munich in May, was “already enjoying a solid performance” in midfield before popping up with the stunning winner, said Sky Sports. Hers was a display “full of typically strong challenges” and “defensive awareness”.\n\nWiegman’s ‘brave’ decisions\n\nSince Sarina Wiegman took over as head coach last September, the Lionesses are unbeaten in 18 matches with 16 wins, two draws, 100 goals scored and just four conceded. She will be looking to win the Uefa Women’s Euros for the second time in succession having coached her native Netherlands to victory in 2017. She also led the Dutch to the 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup final, where they lost to the US.\n\nWiegman’s experience in big matches was needed last night when England found themselves a goal behind. And it was her “bold substitutions” that earned England the semi-final place, said Molly Hudson in The Times.\n\nResponding to the Spain opener, Wiegman took off England women’s all-time leading goalscorer Ellen White, the tournament’s top goalscorer Beth Mead and experienced forward Fran Kirby. Bringing on Alessia Russo, Chloe Kelly and Toone respectively, “it proved to be inspired”, said Sanders on the BBC. Kelly “reignited” the energy of the team, while Toone and Russo “combined for the equaliser to take the game to extra time”.\n\nEngland pass a ‘true test’\n\nBoth teams played “smart technical football at a high-tempo”, said Reuters. This quarter-final clash “showcased the European women’s game at its best”.\n\nOn a “thunderous night” in Brighton, the match contained “all the classic ingredients of tournament football”, said Phil McNulty on the BBC. And with their win over the strong Spaniards, England have shown their “credentials” by passing a “true test”. The Lionesses looked “tired and beaten at one stage”, so to “leap that hurdle” while being “second best for so long”, will provide “huge reserves of confidence and self-belief for what they hope will be two more dates with destiny in this tournament”.\n\nThere’s something about this England team, said Tom Hamilton on ESPN. “They simply don’t know when they’re beaten.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/957255/uefa-womens-euro-2022-england-guide-fixtures-tv-stadiums", "title": "Uefa Women's Euro 2022: fixtures, results and TV coverage | The ...", "text": "Germany head coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg is expecting a “great football feast” when her side take on host nation England in the Uefa Women’s Euro 2022 final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nEight-time winners of the tournament, the Germans progressed to the final after beating France 2-1 in Milton Keynes.

It will be a great football feast.”\n\nEngland’s ‘beacon of calm’\n\nThe England women’s football team were “once treated as a niche, an afterthought, an esoteric concern”, said Oliver Brown in The Telegraph. “Now, they are at the top of the Ten O’Clock News.” Tuesday night’s semi-final victory over Sweden was watched by an average TV audience of 7.9m – the country has “fallen in love with the Lionesses”.\n\nCaptain Leah Williamson has been one of England’s leading lights in the run to the final and she delivered “a performance of the very highest order” against Sweden, said Henry Winter in The Times. The Arsenal defender has been “a beacon of calm at the back” and has “set the tone with everything she did”.\n\nWilliamson insists that the players are now fully focused on winning the trophy. “It is about doing our job on the pitch,” said the 25-year-old. “That’s the most powerful thing, the biggest way we can contribute, and that is what we are focusing on.”\n\nWiegman’s toughest test yet\n\nSunday will represent England’s third appearance in the competition’s final, said Sky Sports.

Ten Hag, currently head coach of Ajax, will replace interim boss Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season. The 52-year-old Dutchman has signed a three-year deal until June 2025 which can be extended by a further year.\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday United football director John Murtough said that during the past four years at Ajax Ten Hag has “proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe” and he is renowned for his team’s “attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth”.\n\nTen Hag said it was a “great honour” to be appointed manager of United and he is “hugely excited” by the challenge ahead. “I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve,” he added. “It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United.”\n\nFormer glories\n\nThe club may have given the impression that four candidates were in the running to be their 12th permanent post-war manager, said Samuel Luckhurst in the Manchester Evening News. However, it was “always between two”: Ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino. “Ultimately, United decided Ten Hag was the manager most closely aligned with the club’s identity and strategy.”\n\nSixth in the Premier League, three points off the top four and risking missing out on qualifying for next season’s Uefa Champions League, this current United team have been described as the “worst for 30 years”. The Red Devils have turned to Ten Hag to try and “restore the club to their former glory”, said Chris Wheeler in the Daily Mail. He will double his salary and earn close to £30m over his contract.\n\n‘Relentless upward coaching curve’\n\nTen Hag’s “journey from altar boy” in his native Holland to manager of United is the “culmination of a career path carefully considered and acted upon”, said Phil Blanche in the Irish Independent. His appointment “might seem swift considering he has not managed in the top five leagues of European football”, but he has been on a “relentless upward coaching curve over the past two decades”.", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/956878/2022-uefa-champions-league-final-liverpool-vs-real-madrid", "title": "2022 Uefa Champions League final: Liverpool vs. Real Madrid ...", "text": "Michael Owen, who played for both clubs in his career, does not think that the final will be such a close affair. Speaking to the Daily Mail, the former England striker is backing Liverpool to “blow away” the Spaniards and predicts a “3-1 or 3-0” victory for the Merseysiders. “I think they could beat them reasonably convincingly because they are an exceptional team at the minute and are too good for Madrid.”\n\nEx-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher is also “confident” that his former team will beat Real. Speaking on Sky Bet’s The Overlap podcast, the pundit acknowledged that “of course, Real can win – it’s a one-off game”, but believes that the Reds will come through. On the same podcast Gary Neville said he doesn’t think Liverpool will lift the trophy. When discussing Real’s ability for comebacks, he picked out their midfield as the key area. “I look at Real Madrid’s midfield in Casemiro, [Toni] Kroos, [Luka] Modric – plus the two that come in late with [Federico] Valverde and [Eduardo] Camavinga – those five players drive them right from the first minute and right to the end,” Neville said. “I think Liverpool’s midfield is their weak point and in the last 15 minutes that midfield for Real Madrid – the five of them combined – will see them win the game on Saturday.”\n\nReal Madrid have pulled off some “dizzying comebacks” in this season’s Champions League, said Tom Kershaw in The Independent. But Liverpool are a “stronger squad” and have “consistently shown the ability to rise to the occasion themselves”. He predicts a 3-1 win for Klopp’s side.\n\n“On paper”, Liverpool are the “better” team, said Paul Kasabian on Bleacher Report. But after their “sensational and mystifying” Champions League run, Real Madrid appear to be “a team of destiny after living on the edge for the entire knockout round and somehow surviving”. In the end, “all signs point to a tremendous finish” to one of the most exciting knockout rounds in history. “The guess here is Liverpool wins a classic, 3-2.”\n\nLiverpool go into the final as favourites and “rightfully so after a stellar season”, said Matt Verri in the London Evening Standard. Real captain Karim Benzema, the tournament’s top scorer this season with 15 goals, and his strike partner Vinicius Jr will “fancy their chances of getting success against Liverpool’s high-line”. However, the Reds are the “more complete team” and are well placed to secure a third trophy of the season. “Liverpool to win, 3-1.”\n\n“Talk about a tough game to call,” said Ben Knapton on SportsMole. After their penalty shoot-out wins in the League Cup and FA Cup finals, Klopp’s side “may be taken all the way to spot kicks again”. “We believe that Liverpool’s recent experience from 12 yards will help them get their hands on Europe’s biggest prize for the seventh time and end the Real fairytale. Liverpool 2-2 Real Madrid (A.E.T - Liverpool to win on penalties).”\n\nSome fans and pundits will argue that Real Madrid have been “lucky” in this season’s Champions League, said tipster Fredo on Oddschecker.com. But it takes “another type of mentality” to be down two goals in the 89th minute and still prevail against the champions of England. That is why the “champions mentality” will give Real their 14th title.\n\nWhile “conventional wisdom” would have Liverpool as the “better” team – “whatever that’s worth in a massive game such as this” – betting against Real Madrid’s Champions League magic “feels foolish”, said Kyle Bonn on SportingNews.com. “In a game in which it’s impossible to separate the teams, it’s perhaps best not to try separating them at all.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/956417/champions-league-real-madrid-knock-out-chelsea", "title": "Champions League: 'what a night, what delirium' as Real Madrid ...", "text": "The knockout stages of the Uefa Champions League have become “an absolute must-watch”, the BBC said last year.

On a dramatic Champions League night Real Madrid survived a stirring comeback from Chelsea to reach the last four.\n\nReal, who needed their own comeback to beat Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16, took a 3-1 lead into the second leg thanks to Karim Benzema’s hat-trick in last week’s match at Stamford Bridge. Defending champions Chelsea travelled to Spain requiring a miracle to reach the semi-finals – and the miracle was “soo close”, said Daniel Childs on Football.London.\n\nThomas Tuchel’s side went into a 3-0 lead on the night, 4-3 up on aggregate, after goals from Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner. The “greatest comeback result in the club’s history was on”, said David Hytner in The Guardian.\n\nBut just after Werner’s 75th-minute goal, Real substitute Rodrygo forced extra-time with a superb volley and then in the 96th-minute in-form French striker Benzema “broke Chelsea’s hearts” with a headed winner, said the Mail. The Blues “will not get the credit they deserve for this performance, that is the pity”. It will go down as a defeat “when on the night Chelsea won”.\n\nThe clash at the Bernabéu will go down in history as a “Champions League classic”, said James Stroud on GiveMeSport. And the night “will live long in the memories of everyone present”, Hytner added.\n\nWhen are the semi-finals?\n\nThere could be further drama when the remaining quarter-final second legs are played on Wednesday evening. After their 1-0 win at the Etihad Stadium last week, Premier League champions Manchester City will travel to Spain to face Atlético Madrid. Liverpool host Benfica at Anfield and will be confident of reaching the last four having beaten the Portuguese side 3-1 in the first leg.\n\nReal Madrid and Villarreal are the first two teams through to the Champions League semi-finals, which will be played on 26-27 April and 3-4 May. Thirteen-time winners Real will play Man City or Atlético and Villarreal will face Benfica or Liverpool.\n\nChampions League semi-final draw", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}]}

The 60-year-old was found guilty of “carrying out a years-long scheme with her longtime confidante Jeffrey Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls”, said CNN. Yesterday, at the Federal District Court in Manhattan Judge Alison Nathan delivered a sentence slightly above the guidelines, saying “the damage done to these young girls was incalculable”. CNN said the sentencing represented a “pivotal moment” in a case that “exemplified the ways that the rich and powerful can avoid - or, at least, delay - consequences for their actions”. Maxwell, who denied the charges, has been in jail in Brooklyn since July 2020. Long fall Maxwell’s current circumstances are a world away from her grand beginnings. She was born in Maisons-Laffitte, Ile-de-France, in 1961, but grew up in the Oxfordshire countryside with her family in a 53-room mansion, Headington Hill Hall. The youngest of nine children, she is the daughter of disgraced late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell, one-time owner of the Mirror Group, and his wife, Betty, a prominent Holocaust researcher. Maxwell was “rumoured to be her father’s favourite child”, reported The Guardian, and he named his $15m yacht after her, the Lady Ghislaine, from which he fell overboard and died in 1991. After his death, a $460m hole was found to be missing from the Mirror Group’s pension funds. This “daddy-daughter dynamic is given a great deal of space” in the three-part Sky documentary Ghislaine Maxwell: Epstein’s Shadow out last year, “partly because it explains so much of Maxwell’s psychology”, said The Telegraph. The series offered a “grimly fascinating portrait” of the woman who stands accused of enabling his “depravity”, said the paper. Using testimony of those who knew Maxwell, it paints a picture of her childhood, her days of partying with A-listers and her relationship with the financier and convicted paedophile Epstein, who hanged himself in a Manhattan prison cell while awaiting his own sex trafficking trial. Skip advert The Times contended that “Maxwell was brought up by a monstrous, rich, powerful man, so the terrible things that monstrous, rich, powerful men do were normal to her”. A ‘mutually beneficial relationship’ The socialite arrived in New York in the early 1990s “looking for a new start”, having lost not only a parent, but much of her family fortune and social standing, reported The New York Times.\n\nShe was “soon on the rise” again with the help of her financier Epstein. It was the beginning of a “mutually beneficial relationship”, reports the paper, with Maxwell “able to resurrect the lifestyle she coveted” alongside her new boyfriend. For Epstein, who had grown up in Coney Island and was “a college dropout”, the “gregarious”, Oxford-educated and socially connected Maxwell was able to provide “new social pathways” for the financier. A “networker” who “revelled in her unrivalled connections”, Maxwell’s friends included Prince Andrew, who she reportedly introduced to Epstein in 1999 and is said to have been a frequent guest in Epstein’s homes, said The Telegraph. “She had an upbringing and taste and knew how to run a house and a boat and how to entertain,” an acquaintance told the paper. “You can’t buy that. You can’t buy access, either.” The relationship between Maxwell and Epstein was “deep and entangled”, said The New York Times, and continued long after their romance ended. Maxwell appeared to manage Epstein’s homes, “facilitate his social relationships and recruit masseuses to help satisfy his seemingly insatiable appetite for massages”, reported the paper. One associate of the pair described Maxwell as “half ex-girlfriend, half employee, half best friend, and fixer”. Epstein’s arrest In 2008, Epstein was sentenced to 18 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to soliciting for prostitution, including soliciting an underage girl. His interest in young girls seems to have been known amongst at least some of his associates: “He has never been secretive about the girls”, said columnist Michael Wolff in a profile for New York magazine in 2007. “At one point, when his troubles began, he was talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, “I like young women”,’” said Wolff. Skip advert A decade later, in 2019, Epstein was arrested again, this time on sex-trafficking charges. He was accused of running a “vast network” of underage girls for sex, reported the BBC. He was found dead in his Manhattan prison cell in August 2019 as he awaited trial, having apparently killed himself. ‘Slithering away’ In July 2020, Maxwell was arrested by the FBI at a secluded and luxurious house in Bradford, New Hampshire, by the FBI on charges that she helped procure teenage girls for Epstein and sometimes joined in the abuse. Prosecutors accused her of “slithering away” into hiding and of lying about her involvement in Epstein’s abuse of underage girls because, they claimed, the truth was “almost unspeakable”, reported The Guardian.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2021/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/us/five-things-june-28-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for June 28:Roe v.

The latest salvo is designed to spark a banking crisis , overwhelm Moscow's financial defenses and tip the Russian economy into a deep recession.\n\nNever before has an economy with the global importance of Russia's been targeted with sanctions at this level, according to analysts, who say there is now a high risk that Russia will face a financial crisis that pushes its largest banks to the brink of collapse.\n\nWestern officials have described their campaign as an economic war meant to punish President Vladimir Putin and turn the country he leads into an international pariah — even if it takes years for sanctions to destroy the defenses of Russia's \" fortress economy .\"\n\n\"We will provoke the collapse of the Russian economy,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a local news channel on Tuesday.\n\nRussia's status as a global energy supplier will make that mission all the more difficult. Europe gets nearly 40% of its natural gas and 25% of its oil from Russia, and any disruptions to those exports would cause already elevated global prices to rise even further.\n\nHow the West is fighting\n\nPutin's invasion of Ukraine has been met with an unprecedented response from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia and other countries. Even Switzerland , famous for its neutrality and banking secrecy, has pledged to impose sanctions on Russia.\n\nSberbank SBRCY The West has cut off Russia's two largest banks,and VTB, from direct access to the US dollar. It has also taken steps to remove some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global messaging service that connects financial institutions and facilitates rapid and secure payments.\n\nThe coalition is trying to prevent Russia's central bank from selling dollars and other foreign currencies to defend the ruble and its economy. In total, nearly $1 trillion worth of Russian assets have now been frozen by sanctions, according to Le Maire.\n\n\"Western democracies have surprised many by pursuing a strategy of exerting intense economic pressure on Russia through effectively cutting it off from global financial markets,\" Oliver Allen, markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.\n\n\"If Russia continues on its current path, it is quite easy to see how the latest sanctions could be just the first steps in a severe and enduring severing of Russia's financial and economic ties with the rest of the world,\" he added.\n\nWestern countries have ruled out sending troops to fight in Ukraine, leaving sanctions as the primary means of challenging Russia. The measures could wipe as much as 6% off Russia's gross domestic product, according to Oxford Economics.\n\n\"Our strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backward as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine,\" a senior US administration official told reporters.\n\nRussia's 'fortress' economy\n\nSince 2014, when the United States and its Western allies imposed sanctions on Moscow following the annexation of Crimea and the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, Putin has been trying to sanction-proof Russia's $1.5 trillion economy, the 11th largest in the world.\n\nMoscow has attempted to wean its oil-dependent economy off the dollar, limited government spending and stockpiled foreign currencies.\n\nPutin's economic planners have also sought to boost domestic production of certain goods by blocking equivalent products from abroad. Russia's central bank has meanwhile amassed a war chest of $630 billion in reserves including foreign currencies and gold — a huge sum compared to most other countries.\n\nThose defenses are now being severely tested.\n\nThe sanctions have rendered roughly 50% of Russia's foreign reserve stockpile useless, according to Capital Economics.\n\n\"External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,\" the Russian central bank said Monday, announcing that it would roughly double interest rates to 20%. \"This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation,\" the bank added.\n\nRussia is also imposing capital controls. The central bank ordered companies to sell foreign currencies on Monday to prop up the ruble as it plunged to a record low against the US dollar. And Putin is planning a decree that would temporarily ban foreign companies and investors from selling Russian assets — which have become toxic for many since the invasion.\n\n\"The $600 billion-plus war chest of Russia's foreign reserves is only powerful if Putin can use it,\" a senior Biden administration official told reporters.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nAll eyes are on the Russian financial system.\n\nThere were reports over the weekend that Russians were standing in long lines to withdraw cash from ATMs, raising the prospect of a run on the country's banks. Already the main target of sanctions, Russian banks could come under even greater pressure if borrowers are unable to repay loans as the inevitable recession hits businesses and households.\n\nLiam Peach, an emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that Russian banks could be forced to respond by selling assets — probably on the cheap. Credit could become scarce, making the economic pain from sanctions even worse.\n\n\"The ratcheting up of Western sanctions over the weekend has left Russian banks on the edge of crisis,\" said Peach.\n\nOne early casualty was the European subsidiary of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender that has been sanctioned by Western allies. The European Central Bank said Monday that Sberbank Europe, including its Austrian and Croatian branches, was failing, or likely to fail, because of \"significant deposit outflows\" triggered by the crisis.\n\nAnother problem is that Russian banks only have enough foreign cash on hand to cover roughly 15% of the foreign currency deposits on their books. The central bank would normally supply banks with foreign currency, but with half its war chest out of bounds it may not be able to do that, and defend the ruble at the same time.\n\nThe central bank could be under pressure for months or even years.\n\nThanks to oil and gas, the value of Russia's exports far exceeds imports, and payments into the country are a major source of foreign currency. But investors and businesses could try to move large amounts of foreign cash outside the country as the ruble falls, forcing the central bank to spend up to $100 billion of its available reserves this year, according to Capital Economics.\n\nAt the same time, the West could crack down even harder. The United States and its allies could remove more Russian banks from SWIFT and further restrict their access to dollars and euros, according to the Institute of International Finance. They could also cut off Russian energy exports, although that would cause prices to spike.\n\nFurther escalation of the economic conflict could have major consequences.\n\n\"Don't forget that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones,\" former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Thursday in response to Le Maire's comments.", "authors": ["Analysis Charles Riley", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/investing/swift-russia-ukraine/index.html", "title": "What is SWIFT and why it might be the weapon Russia fears most ...", "text": "As Western governments threaten Russia with a package of unprecedented sanctions aimed at deterring President Vladimir Putin from ordering an invasion of Ukraine, there's one measure in particular that appears to strike fear at the heart of the Kremlin: cutting the country off from the global banking system.\n\nUS lawmakers have suggested in recent weeks that Russia could be removed from SWIFT, a high security network that connect thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\nSenior Russian lawmakers have responded by saying that shipments of oil, gas and metals to Europe would stop if that happened.\n\n\"If Russia is disconnected from SWIFT, then we will not receive [foreign] currency, but buyers, European countries in the first place, will not receive our goods — oil, gas, metals and other important components,\" Nikolai Zhuravlev, vice speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, said Tuesday, according to state media outlet TASS.\n\nWhat is SWIFT?\n\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication was founded in 1973 to replace the telex and is now used by over 11,000 financial institutions to send secure messages and payment orders. With no globally accepted alternative, it is essential plumbing for global finance.\n\nRemoving Russia from SWIFT would make it nearly impossible for financial institutions to send money in or out of the country, delivering a sudden shock to Russian companies and their foreign customers — especially buyers of oil and gas exports denominated in US dollars.\n\n\"The cutoff would terminate all international transactions, trigger currency volatility, and cause massive capital outflows,\" Maria Shagina, a visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, wrote in a paper last year for Carnegie Moscow Center . Excluding Russia from SWIFT would cause its economy to shrink by 5%, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin estimated in 2014.\n\nSWIFT is based in Belgium and governed by a board consisting of 25 people, including Eddie Astanin, chairman of the management board at Russia's Central Counterparty Clearing Centre. SWIFT, which describes itself as a \"neutral utility,\" is incorporated under Belgian law and must comply with EU regulations.\n\nWhat happens if Russia is removed?\n\nThere is precedent for removing a country from SWIFT.\n\nSWIFT unplugged Iranian banks in 2012 after they were sanctioned by the European Union over the country's nuclear program. Iran lost almost half of its oil export revenue and 30% of foreign trade following the disconnection, according to Shagina.\n\nHave you read these yet?

The United States and Germany have the most to lose if Russia is disconnected, because their banks are the most frequent SWIFT users to communicate with Russian banks, according to Shagina.\n\nThe European Central Bank has warned lenders with significant exposure to Russia to prepare for sanctions against Moscow, according to the Financial Times . ECB officials have also asked banks how they would respond to scenarios including a move to prevent Russian banks accessing SWIFT.\n\nThe European Union is ready to respond to a Russian invasion of Ukraine with \"comprehensive sanctions never seen before,\" Danish foreign minister Jeppe Kofod said on Monday. EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell said Tuesday that sanctions would be \"the most consequential leverage that the West, or at least the European Union, has.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson told lawmakers on Tuesday that his government was discussing the possibility of banning Russia from SWIFT with the United States.\n\n\"There is no doubt that that would be a very potent weapon [against Russia]. I'm afraid it can only really be deployed with the assistance of the United States though. We are in discussions about that,\" Johnson said.\n\nRussia's countermeasures\n\nRussia has taken steps in recent years to blunt the trauma should it be removed from SWIFT.\n\nMoscow established its own payment system, SPFS, after it was hit by Western sanctions in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea early that year. SPFS now has around 400 users, according to Russia's central bank. Twenty percent of domestic transfers are currently done through SPFS, according to Shagina, but the size of messages are limited and operations are limited to weekday hours.\n\nChina's fledgling Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS, may provide another alternative to SWIFT. Moscow could also be forced to resort to using cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut these are not appealing alternatives.\n\n\"SWIFT is an European company, an association of many participating countries. To make a decision on disconnection, a united decision of all participating countries is needed. The decisions of the United States and Great Britain are definitely not enough,\" Zhuravlev said, according to TASS.\n\n\"I'm not sure that other countries, especially those whose share of trade with Russia is large in balance, will support the shutdown,\" he added.", "authors": ["Charles Riley", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/business/food-crisis-ukraine-russia/index.html", "title": "War has brought the world to the brink of a food crisis | CNN Business", "text": "London (CNN Business) Svein Tore Holsether says the world is careening toward a food crisis that could affect millions of people.\n\nRecord high natural gas prices have forced the company he runs, fertilizer producer Yara International , to curtail its production of ammonia and urea in Europe to 45% of capacity. With less of those two essential agricultural ingredients, he expects knock-on effects for global food supplies\n\n\"It's not whether we are going to have a food crisis. It's how large that crisis will be,\" Holsether told CNN Business.\n\nTwo weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of key agricultural products produced in the region have skyrocketed. The biggest problem is wheat , a pantry staple. Supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which together account for almost 30% of global wheat trade, are now at risk. Global wheat prices hit an all-time high earlier this week.\n\nAnother major problem is access to fertilizer. Essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops, it's never been more expensive, as exports from Russia grind to a halt. Output in Europe has also plunged thanks to the surging price of natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.\n\nThe situation is ringing alarm bells for global health experts. The cost of corn, soybeans and vegetable oils has been jumping, too.\n\nAgriculture ministers from the G7 countries said Friday they \"remain determined to do what is necessary to prevent and respond to a food crisis.\"\n\nBut fearing shortages, countries are already turning inward, which could ultimately leave less food for those in need.\n\nEgypt just banned the export of wheat, flour, lentils and beans amid growing concerns over food reserves in the Arab world's most populous state. Indonesia has also tightened export restrictions on palm oil, which is a component in cooking oil as well as in cosmetics and some packaged goods like chocolate. It's the world's top producer of the product.\n\nThe G7 ministers called on countries to \"keep their food and agricultural markets open and to guard against any unjustified restrictive measures on their exports.\"\n\n\"Any further increase in food price levels and volatility in international markets could threaten food security and nutrition at a global scale, especially among the most vulnerable living in environments of low food security,\" they said in a statement.\n\nWestern countries with more access to agriculture will be hurt, too. Consumers there have already been stung by higher prices, and the situation is poised to deteriorate further.\n\nRussia, Ukraine and global food supplies\n\nEven before Russia launched a war in Ukraine, the global food system was strained. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.\n\nThe number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the UN's World Food Programme said this month.\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which both play crucial roles in the carefully calibrated system of global food production, stands to make the situation worse.\n\nGlobal wheat prices have fallen from record highs in recent days, but remain elevated. They're expected to stay that way for some time, according to Rabobank commodity analyst Carlos Mera.\n\nThe wheat planting season, which is about to begin in Ukraine, will be disrupted by fighting. It's not clear there will be enough farmers to till the land, as people in the country take up arms — or whether they'll be able to access machinery and other essential products that would typically arrive through Black Sea ports.\n\n\"It's anyone's guess if Ukraine will be able to export anything for the rest of this year, or next year, or in the foreseeable future,\" Mera said. The country also accounts for half of all exports of sunflower oil\n\nGetting products from Russia onto the world market has also gotten more difficult, because businesses don't want to risk running afoul of sanctions or deal with the logistics of traveling near a war zone.\n\nRussia and Ukraine serve as the breadbasket for countries in the Middle East and North Africa that depend on imports. Many will be hit hard as a result. The United States and Europe will feel the pain, too, since the run-up in prices for important agricultural goods will affect businesses that produce food in every market.\n\n\"Any serious disruption of production and exports from these suppliers will no doubt drive up prices further and erode food security for millions of people,\" the Agricultural Market Information System said in a recent report\n\nFertilizer costs soar\n\nThe brewing crisis goes beyond wheat and oils. Russia, along with its ally Belarus, is also a major exporter of the fertilizers needed to plant a wide range of crops. But right now, everyone is shunning their stock.\n\n\"Nobody wants to touch a Russian product right now,\" said Deepika Thapliyal, a fertilizer expert at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. \"If you look at all of the traders, all of the buyers, they're very scared.\"\n\nThe price of natural gas is exacerbating the issue. Fertilizer producers outside of Russia and Belarus need gas to make nitrogen-based products like urea, which is used when sowing crops to boost yield and even promotes their deep-green color.\n\nBut Holsether, the CEO of Yara, said costs have gotten too high to keep operations running at scale. He's not sure when European production will be at full capacity again.\n\n\"There's a large part of the industry that's at risk of not being able to deliver products to the farmers, and that will have an impact on the crop yields quite rapidly,\" he said.\n\nFarmers have the incentive right now to pay what they need to get fertilizer, since prices for their products are going up, too. Not everyone has this option, however. Urea has been trading near $1,000 per metric ton, about four times the price at the start of 2021, according to Chris Lawson, the head of fertilizers at CRU Group, a market intelligence firm.\n\nCountries without domestic fertilizer production may also struggle to access it, with huge consequences for the global food system.\n\n\"You can't grow massive fields of wheat, barley or soy without fertilizer,\" said Johanna Mendelson Forman, a professor at American University who specializes in war and food. Farmers in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil are already worried about shortages, she added.\n\nThe consequences\n\nOn Monday, Russian fertilizer and coal billionaire Andrey Melnichenko broke with President Vladimir Putin and called for peace in Ukraine, noting that a global food crisis looms.\n\nThe war \"has already led to soaring prices in fertilizers which are no longer affordable to farmers,\" Melnichenko told Reuters. \"Now it will lead to even higher food inflation in Europe and likely food shortages in the world's poorest countries,\" he added.\n\nThe G7 agriculture ministers said Friday that their countries would leverage humanitarian aid where they can to mitigate fallout from the war. But they may also be hamstrung by a dearth of supplies and rising prices.\n\n\"If Ukrainian fields lie fallow this year, aid agencies such as ours will be forced to source new markets to compensate for the loss of some of the world's best wheat,\" David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, said in an op-ed published in the Washington Post this week. \"Doing so will come at a vastly inflated cost.\"\n\nBeasley noted that Ukrainian wheat has also been essential to feeding populations in other countries facing conflict, including Afghanistan, Sudan and Yemen.\n\n\"The vast majority of wheat is used for human consumption, and that's irreplaceable,\" Rabobank's Mera said.\n\nAnd it won't just be countries grappling with famine or war that feel the effects.\n\nThe affordability of food is a problem for lower-income shoppers everywhere, Mendelson Forman emphasized. In April 2021, about one in seven American adults experienced food insecurity over the past 30 days, according to the Urban Institute.\n\n\"We're used to a globalized system of trade to get all kinds of varieties of food,\" she said. \"People will see it in their pocketbooks, and they'll see it in the grocery stores.\"\n\n— Mostafa Salem contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/success/irs-tax-letters-suspended/index.html", "title": "IRS to temporarily stop sending many taxpayer notices - CNN", "text": "Imagine having filed and paid your taxes last year, then months later you get a letter in the mail from the IRS saying you didn't.\n\nThat's what's happening to many taxpayers this year thanks to automated notices being sent by the IRS.\n\nBut if you got one, don't panic. There's a fair chance the IRS simply hasn't seen what you already sent in. That's because it's dealing with a mountain of returns and correspondence that has built up over the past two years. During that time, the agency was called on to deliver several rounds of economic impact payments and other financial Covid-19 relief , while trying to protect its own workforce from Covid.\n\nThe good news is thatyou're not likely to get another notice for awhile.The IRS announced this week that it will temporarily suspend issuing more than a dozen different types of automated notices indicating balances due, unfiled returns and other deficiencies so that it can work through its pandemic-induced backlog. [Here is the list of notices being suspended.]\n\nAutomatic notices typically require you to respond -- for example, by filing a return, making a payment, providing requested information or explaining why the notice is inaccurate.\n\nBut the IRS is too busy at the moment to respond in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nLast year, the agency took an average of 199 days to process 6.2 million responses from filers to IRS-proposed adjustments on their returns, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate\n\nTax preparer and enrolled agent Donna Byrne herself got a notice asserting she hadn't filed her 2019 tax return, even though she did, she said. \"It drives you nuts, because you know you did stuff.\"\n\nAnd trying to reach an IRS representative by phone to address a matter can feel futile: The agency has been getting 1,500 calls per second, according to a recent IRS letter to lawmakers.\n\nThis week's announcement is a good first step but more still needs to be done, according to the American Institute of CPAs. The AICPA is part of a coalition of tax professional associations that has been urging the IRS to implement four short-term recommendations to provide relief for tax filers this year, of which notice suspension is one.\n\n\"We are encouraged by recent actions taken by the IRS to suspend more automated notices and pleased to know that the IRS is listening and acting. Taxpayers, practitioners and IRS will benefit from reducing unnecessary contact, such as erroneous notices or warnings of levy, and provide much-needed relief during an already stressful and overwhelming tax season,\" the AICPA said in a statement Thursday.\n\nWhat to do if you already got an automated notice\n\nThe IRS did not provide an estimate of how many tax filers may have already received the automated notices in the past few months. But it did note that some notices may still be on their way to tax filers and may be received over the next few weeks.\n\nIf you already have received a notice or soon get one, \"Generally, there is no need to call or respond to the notice as the IRS continues to process prior year tax returns as quickly as possible,\" the agency said in a statement. That is, unless you or your tax preparer think the information in the notice is accurate. In that case, the IRS said, \"act to rectify the situation for the well-being of the taxpayer.\"\n\nBut Edward Karl, AICPA's vice president of taxation, recommends you respond in either case. The letter should indicate where to send your response.\n\nOtherwise, he said, \"you could continue to get additional notices when they turn the [automatic notification] machine back on. And you want to make sure you try to stop it as soon as possible.\"\n\nHere's why, Karl said: At some point, if the assertion is you owe more in tax and penalties and IRS records show you haven't responded at all, it could escalate to the point where the agency can garnish money from your wages or bank account.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this article incorrectly stated the reason Byrne got an IRS notice.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/12/01/american-billionaires-that-got-richer-during-covid/43205617/", "title": "American Billionaires That Got Richer During COVID – 24/7 Wall St.", "text": "Samuel Stebbins and Grant Suneson\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an economic crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression.

We only reviewed changes in net worth for American citizens who were considered billionaires as of April 7, 2020.\n\nThe vast majority of people on this list are high-profile executives or founders and investors at publicly traded companies – and much of their wealth is invested in the company with which they are associated. And though the U.S. economy is facing its worst economic and health crises in over half a century, the stock market has fared relatively well. Since the market crash in mid-March, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged, appreciating in value by over 50% as of mid-October, even reaching new record highs. Here is a look at how the COVID stock market crash compares to others in history.\n\nNotably, many of the billionaires on this list are associated with technology companies – and many of those companies have done especially well during the pandemic. The tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index reported even stronger growth than the Dow in recent months, surging by about 66% from mid-March to mid-October – and generating billions of dollars for major shareholders in the process.\n\n30.

About 48 million Americans will be hit by the reduction in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), which will subtract $36 per month for a family of four. Total benefit amounts vary by state.\n\n\"Nobody's been able to catch their breath,\" said Ross Fraser of Feeding America, a nationwide network of 200 food banks that supplies 63,000 agencies around the country. \"Everyone's scared to death about these SNAP cuts.\"\n\nBad timing\n\nAs advocates for the hungry tell it, the reduction in food stamp benefits — the result of an expiration of a temporary boost enacted in 2009 — couldn't have come at worse time.\n\nThe Great Recession has already stretched food banks' ability to help the 15% of all Americans who are considered \"food insecure,\" according to an Agriculture Department report. Many of those people do not use food stamps.\n\nMany food banks are holding extra food drives, or asking companies to make special seasonal donations – turkeys, for example. Others food banks just buy more food; one reported buying 50% more this month compared to October.\n\nThe cut in food stamp benefits will only increase the demand.\n\nEnrollment in food stamps is almost three times what it was in 2000, but that hasn't lessened the dependence on food banks. Since 2006, the number of Americans receiving aid from food pantries and similar services is up almost 50%, according to Feeding America.\n\nA survey by the nonprofit Food Bank for New York City found that almost half of its food pantries and soup kitchens were forced to turn visitors away at some point last year, with 83% blaming a lack of food. At the same time, the group said their ranks shrank during the recession, with 247 of its partners closing since 2007.\n\nIn Indiana this year, lawmakers approved using state funds to pay for the processing of deer meat donated by hunters across the state. This was the first year the state chipped in to pay for the processing in an attempt to boost donations. In the past, hunters or processors covered the cost.\n\nThat led to a welcome infusion of meat donations to the state's food banks, supplementing the normal fare comprised largely of canned vegetables and other non-perishables, said Jake Bruner of the Hoosier Hills Food Bank in Bloomington, Ind.\n\nThose additional donations were well-timed. Hoosier Hills has already distributed more than 3.2 million pounds of food this year, Bruner said, more than in 2011 or 2012.\n\n\"Some pantries are serving thousands of people a week,\" he said.\n\nPerishables move\n\nThe spike in demand has led to an unexpected benefit: In the past, fresh food and produce often lingered on shelves so long it went bad. Now, that's not a concern.\n\n\"A lot of those are fairly rural counties,\" Bruner said of the areas his food bank serves. \"We're seeing agencies, a mom-and-pop food pantry, being able to take full bins of bananas and distribute them quickly.\"\n\nIn Fort Smith, Ark., near the Oklahoma border, the River Valley Food Bank is nearing the end of its own record-setting year, having distributed more than 8 million pounds of food in 2013, compared to 6.7 million last year.\n\nThe reason for the jump is a mix of still-increasing demand and the bank's ability to store more food, said its director, Ted Clemons. \"When you can distribute 8 million pounds and the pantries are still taking that food, that shows there is a demand,\" he said.\n\nUnlike past years, the food bank didn't receive any donated turkeys this year. So River Valley held a one-day \"turkey drive\" last week. Halfway through Friday's effort, Clemons, reached by phone while out collecting turkeys, said they'd already collected more than 300, with a goal of 800 for the day.\n\nStill not enough\n\nBut even the most robust food banks aren't able to fill the need, a fact that was true even before the recent food stamp cuts. By Feeding America's estimate, the benefit cuts will cost 1.9 million meals for low-income Americans next year—more than half the number of meals the organization distributes in a given year.\n\nEven at Washington, D.C.'s Capital Area Food Bank, which moves 45 million pounds of food each year from its 100,000-square-foot facility a few miles from the U.S. Capitol, organizers know they can't feed everybody who is hungry.\n\nThe facility covers parts of Virginia and Maryland, along with the nation's capital itself, where almost one in four residents is on food stamps. In preparation for the holidays, the food bank bought 50% more food this month than it did in October. Two weeks ago, it received a donation of 1,000 turkeys from a grocer.\n\n\"It would be great to put ourselves out of business,\" Page Crosland, director of media and events at the food bank, said last week. \"But I don't see that happening.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/26"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/02/28/coronavirus-arizona-updates-virus-travel-safety-more/4903384002/", "title": "LIVE Arizona coronavirus updates: New cases, closures, advisories", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nThe spread of a highly contagious coronavirus has had wide-ranging global impacts, including in the financial markets and government travel policies.\n\nTHE LATEST: This blog has moved.

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions: Ask us a new question here.\n\nTop White House advisers predict as many as 240,000 US deaths from coronavirus\n\nMarch 31: Members of President Donald Trump’s administration laid out dire estimates Tuesday to underscore the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, a grim prediction they said was at the center of the president’s decision to extend strict social distancing guidelines through the end of April.\n\nFederal public health officials said that between 100,000 and 240,000 could succumb to the virus by the end of the year — making it one of the nation’s worst public health crises — said Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.\n\nWithout intervention, Birx said, as many 2.2 million could have died.\n\nPresented to the president over the weekend, the data explains why Trump backed down from an earlier notion of “reopening” the country by Easter, or potentially opening parts of the nation that were less hard hit, officials said. Trump announced Sunday he would extend social distancing guidelines through April 30.\n\nAmericans abroad urged to come home\n\nMarch 31: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is making his advice to U.S. citizens still overseas during the coronavirus crisis simple: \"Americans who wish to return home from abroad should so immediately and make arrangements to accomplish that,\" he stressed during a Tuesday briefing.\n\nWhile Pompeo said his repatriation task force remains committed to bringing all Americans home, he said the window to do so is closing.\n\n\"We do not know how long the commercial flights in your countries may continue to operate,\" he said as airlines have already slashed international service. \"We can't guarantee the U.S. government's ability to arrange charter flights indefinitely where commercial options no longer exist.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he urged Americans to register with their nearest embassy or consulate or do so online via STEP, the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.\n\nAt-home coronavirus tests halted despite progress\n\nMarch 31: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration abruptly shut down sales of at-home coronavirus test kits earlier this month but some companies say they haven’t given up.\n\nThe scarcity of tests in general, coupled with consumers' desire to take control, makes the idea both intriguing and controversial.\n\nCritics say home tests may be unreliable, might delay necessary treatment and could soak up scarce resources. Proponents say at-home test kits could save money and resources – and in the near future could play a critical role in tracking COVID-19.\n\nThe FDA leaped into action on March 20 when several startup companies started selling or preparing to sell at-home kits.\n\nIn strong language, the agency called at-home test kits “fraudulent.”\n\nFeds launch inquiry of 4 lawmakers who sold off stock\n\nMarch 30: Federal authorities are reviewing the stock sales of four lawmakers just before the market slide triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.\n\nFinancial disclosure statements indicated that Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C.; Jim Inhofe, R-Okla.; Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.; and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; their spouses or advisers sold large chunks of stock around the time lawmakers received behind-the-scenes briefings about the severity of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 2,900 lives in the USA.\n\nThe senators denied any wrongdoing, and Burr asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review his transactions involving up to $1.6 million. The federal inquiry, which was in its early stages, was first reported by CNN.\n\nGov. Ducey issues stay-at-home order\n\nMarch 30:Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide \"stay-at-home\" order to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, preventing Arizonans from leaving their residences except for food, medicine and other \"essential activities.\"\n\nThe directive, which also allows for outdoor exercise, will take effect at the close of business Tuesday and apply through at least April 30.\n\n\"Already, things have shut down to a large degree,\" the Republican leader said at an afternoon press briefing, with Department of Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ at his side. \"They're going to shut down even further.\"\n\nDucey indicated he did not consider the mandate a \"shelter-in-place\" order, however, saying that phrase is reserved for nuclear attacks or active shooter situations.\n\n\"Our goal here is to protect the lives of those we love most and to ensure the health care system has the capacity to provide them with the care and comfort they deserve,\" he said. \"We want people to stay at home.\"\n\nArizona schools closed for the rest of the school year\n\nMarch 30: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended the closure of all Arizona schools through the end of this school year.\n\nIn a joint statement Monday with Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman, Ducey wrote that the decision was made to align with guidance from the federal government.\n\n\"These efforts are crucial, and we recognize that schools are making every effort possible to continue providing instruction during closures,\" they wrote in the statement.\n\nOn Friday, Ducey signed legislation to allow students to finish the school year from home.\n\nThe plan mandates that schools offer classes in an alternative format, presumably online, so students could finish out the school year from home. It also includes provisions to ensure seniors in high school graduate.\n\nGov. Ducey holds 2 p.m. press conference\n\nSummer Olympics to kick off in July 2021\n\nMarch 30: Less than a week after announcing that the Summer Games in Japan would be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers have decided on a new start date of July 23, 2021, according to an International Olympic Committee spokesman. The closing ceremony will be held on Aug. 8. The Tokyo Olympics had previously been set to start almost exactly one year earlier, running from July 24 through Aug. 9.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases now surpass 1K, with 20 deaths\n\nMarch 30: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now number more than 1,000, with 20 known deaths, new numbers posted by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Monday show.\n\nThe total identified cases in Arizona is 1,157, according to the latest state figures, with every one of the state's 15 counties now recording at least one case.\n\nThat's an increase of confirmed 238 cases, or 26%, since Sunday.\n\nArizona's new coronavirus cases increase to 912; deaths rise to 16\n\nMarch 29: The number of identified new coronavirus cases in Arizona rose to 912 on Sunday — a roughly 17% increase from the day before, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThe number of reported deaths related to COVID-19 also increased by one to a total of 16 on Sunday.\n\nMore than 2,000 coronavirus patients have died in U.S.\n\nMarch 28: Just one day after the U.S. surpassed 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the nation witnessed another grim figure: More than 2,000 COVID-19 patients have died.\n\nTesting continues to expand across the nation, and the U.S. is seeing daily spikes in the number of reported cases. Nearly 500 coronavirus-related deaths were reported Saturday, up from 1,544 confirmed deaths 24 hours earlier, according to Johns Hopkins University's data dashboard.\n\nThe death toll was 2,010 Saturday shortly after 6 p.m. ET. That number is expected to rise steadily in the coming days and weeks, and health officials say the number of cases is likely higher due to lack of testing. Nearly 18,000 new cases were reported on both Wednesday and Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nMore than 120,000 cases have been reported in the U.S.\n\nCases have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. New York has reported the most deaths, followed by Washington, New York and Louisiana, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nFDA authorizes 5-minute coronavirus test the size of a toaster\n\nMarch 28: CHICAGO – A five-minute, point-of-care coronavirus test could be coming to urgent care clinics next week, and experts say it could be \"game-changing.\"\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued Emergency Use Authorization to Illinois-based medical device maker Abbott Labs on Friday for a coronavirus test that delivers positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes, the company said.\n\nThe company expects the tests to be available next week and expects to ramp up manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day.\n\nDays before closing, Caesars Entertainment said 3,200 workers would lose jobs\n\nLAS VEGAS – Four days before closing nine hotel-casinos along the Las Vegas Strip to slow the spread of COVID-19, Caesars Entertainment notified state officials that 3,200 workers would lose their jobs, according to documents obtained by the Reno-Gazette Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn a March 14 letter to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, the company announced the cuts would happen the following day.\n\n\"Given the unknown certainty surrounding COVID-19,\" wrote Servando Lara, Caesars' director of labor relations, \"we are unable to make a determination as to whether the layoff will be temporary or permanent.\"\n\nOne day after the letter arrived, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered that all non-essential businesses across the state shut down to arrest the spread of COVID-19.\n\nArizona COVID-19 deaths up to 15; reported cases rise to 773\n\nMarch 28: Arizona's death toll related to the new coronavirus rose to 15, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Saturday morning.\n\nThe number of reported cases around the state also rose to 773.\n\nAs of Friday, there were 13 deaths and 665 reported cases around the state. Cases grew from Friday to Saturday by roughly 16%.\n\nOn Saturday, Pima County announced an additional coronavirus-related death, bringing the county total to five.\n\nThe man was a hospice patient between the age of 18 and 40, the county said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the Pima County death was one of the two additional deaths announced by the state Saturday morning.\n\nMaricopa County reported a growth of 53 cases, with 96 of the 452 cases in the county requiring hospitalization.\n\nMember of Alhambra school community infected\n\nMarch 28: Alhambra Elementary School District announced Friday that someone who attended the school's non-sponsored trip to Magic Mountain has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe news was shared via an email to parents from Richard Stinnett, the school's principal. The email did not reveal whether the infected person was a student or other party.\n\nStinnett relayed in the email that the trip took place from March 6-8, more than two weeks removed since the person in question received their positive test. School has not been in session since the trip, Stinnett wrote.\n\nStill, the email communicated that the infected person is recovering at home while quarantined and that no other cases have been linked to this case.\n\nDisney World, Disneyland to stay closed indefinitely\n\nMarch 27: Citing an \"increasingly complex crisis,\" Disneyland and Disney World are going to stay closed \"until further notice\" due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Walt Disney Company said Friday.\n\nThe company's decision dashes hopes that the fabled theme parks would reopen by next month, as had been previously announced. Earlier this week, Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood announced they were extending their closures through April 19.\n\nFor Disney, the concern was about making sure park-goers and employees aren't exposed to the virus.\n\n\"While there is still much uncertainty with respect to the impacts of COVID-19, the safety and well-being of our guests and employees remains the Walt Disney Company’s top priority,\" the company said in an email statement. It said the decision was \"in line with direction provided by health experts and government officials.\"\n\nTrump signs $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus intended to halt economic meltdown\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion bipartisan stimulus package Friday that is intended to address the threat of economic disaster posed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump signed the measure – the largest stimulus in U.S. history – in the Oval Office hours after it was approved by the House of Representatives, an unusually rapid approval that underscored dire warnings of a recession as companies began to lay off workers and U.S. consumers hunkered down in their homes to avoid spreading the virus.\n\n\"I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,\" Trump said at the signing.\n\nWhile the president’s signature ended the legislative effort on Capitol Hill, it marked a beginning to the government’s work managing the crisis. Now the Trump administration must rapidly pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy in the form of direct payments, loans and grants to hard-hit industries such as the airlines.\n\nThe stimulus package will provide $1,200 checks to many Americans – and more for families – while making available hundreds of billions of dollars for companies to maintain payroll through the crisis. It significantly expands the nation’s unemployment safety net and it directs a huge infusion of cash to hospitals and other medical facilities on the front line of fighting the pandemic.\n\nMarkets rallied in recent days on the news that Republicans and Democrats had reached a deal on the stimulus, recovering some of the staggering losses of the past several weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained down Friday in midday trading.\n\nHouse approves historic coronavirus package, sending $2 trillion bill to Trump’s desk\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – The House voted to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package – the largest emergency aid bill in history – that will offer $1,200 checks to Americans, extensive unemployment benefits for those out of work and financial relief to businesses and the health care industry hard-hit by the worsening crisis.\n\nThe House’s vote allows the bill to head to President Donald Trump’s desk for final approval. Trump has signaled he will sign the bill.\n\nThe vote comes one day after the U.S. reached two grim milestones, becoming the country with the most coronavirus cases in the world and reporting a record 3.28 million workers who applied for unemployment benefits in one week – the highest number in history since the Department of Labor started tracking data in 1967. The massive package aims to offer a financial lifeline to Americans and businesses that are hurting while also offering reassurance to the markets, which have been battered by fears that shutdowns related to the pandemic could throw the economy into a deep recession.\n\nUS neglected its medical stockpile, whistleblowers say\n\nMarch 27: A secretive cache of medical supplies to save Americans from deadly disasters for years lacked the funding to prepare for a pandemic as widespread as the coronavirus, former managers of the stockpile told USA TODAY.\n\nOverseen by a cadre of scientists, disease specialists and others at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Strategic National Stockpile houses roughly $8 billion in inventory for rapid deployment to anywhere in the nation in under 12 hours.\n\nBut its inadequate supply of ventilators, respiratory masks and other personal protective equipment will leave critical shortages for U.S. hospitals scrambling to respond to the mounting coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe stockpile had just 16,600 of the breathing machines and an estimated 12 million N95 masks at the start of the pandemic – not enough for the country, USA TODAY reports.\n\nThe latest: US COVID-19 count\n\nUS passes Italy, China as nation with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\nMarch 26: The U.S. surged past China and Italy to become the planet's most infected nation Thursday, a stark milestone in the coronavirus era - and a reminder of its deadly, culture-changing effects on American life.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University dashboard showed the U.S. with 82,404 COVID-19 infections as of 6 p.m., ET, moving past Italy (80,589) and China (81,782). More than 1,100 people have died in the U.S.\n\nPart of the reason for the nation's top ranking is cause and effect: The U.S. has drastically ramped up its testing protocols in order to identify infected people and those who may be carriers of the virus. As testing has increased, so has the number of confirmed cases.\n\nWatch: Trump speaks on coronavirus\n\nMarch 26: On a day when jobless claims smashed a record and U.S. deaths surged past 1,100 as the coronavirus tightened its grip on America, the prospect of a stimulus package soon becoming reality helped propel a third consecutive stock market rally Thursday.\n\nThe Labor Department, in announcing the unemployment claims numbers for last week, said what Americans already knew – that layoffs hit the hospitality and food service industries particularly hard. Other industries that struggled included health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries, Labor said.\n\nCongress was trying to supply a ray of hope. The House is scheduled to take up a Senate-passed, $2 trillion emergency aid proposal Friday. Swift passage was expected – after an initial hangup, the package flew through the Senate on Wednesday night by a vote of 96-0. President Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to sign the measure.\n\nDow posts best 3-day gain since 1931\n\nMarch 26: U.S. stocks notched their first three-day rally in six weeks Thursday on hopes that Congress will quickly approve a coronavirus rescue package for the economy while the outbreak in China shows signs that it has been largely contained.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1,351.62 points, or 6.4%, to close at 22,552.17. The blue-chip average has advanced 21.3% over the past three days, its biggest three-day gain since 1931. Those gains helped push the Dow back into bull market territory after ending its 11-year historic run this month.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 added 6.2% to finish at 2,630.07. It has gained 17.6% over the past three days, its best percentage gain since 1933.\n\nThe gains came even as data revealed a record number of Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week after a wave of layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases top 500, with 8 known deaths\n\nMarch 26: Confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, topped 500 on Thursday, with eight known deaths, state numbers show.\n\nIdentified cases now total 508 across the state. Maricopa County has just shy of 300 cases.\n\nThe level of community spread, as listed on the state health department’s website, went from moderate to “widespread.” Community spread means the patient had no history of traveling to regions of the world affected by new coronavirus, and also had no known contact with anyone infected by it.\n\nHere's the difference between shelter-in-place and quarantine, and what police can enforce\n\nMarch 26: On March 19, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all 40 million people in the state to shelter in place as health officials battle the new coronavirus. Two days later, Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker ordered his state's 12.7 million residents to also shelter in place.\n\nSince then, millions of people across at least 20 states have been given orders to shelter in place, restricting them from leaving their homes except to go to work if they can't work from home, get food or see a doctor.\n\nBut Arizona, with a population of seven million, isn't one of them.\n\nCongress on track to add $600 per week to jobless checks\n\nMarch 26:The U.S. Senate approved an additional $600 a week in jobless benefits for laid-off workers on Wednesday as the number of people applying for help nationwide hit an all-time weekly record of 3.28 million because of the economic carnage of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizona also set a new one-day record this week for the number of jobless claims filed.\n\nBenefits currently are capped at $240 a week in Arizona, the second-lowest amount in the nation. The change would increase the figure to $840 per week for people laid off because of the outbreak.\n\nJobless claims surge to 3.3M\n\nMarch 26: Layoffs are skyrocketing as the coronavirus upends the U.S. economy.\n\nThe number of Americans filing initial applications for unemployment benefits jumped nearly twelvefold to a record 3.28 million last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, offering the most vivid evidence yet of the outbreak's widespread damage to the economy.\n\nThe total was well above the 1.5 million claims economists had forecast, according to the median estimate of those surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nIllnesses from coronavirus could peak in April with hospitalizations topping out in May, health officials say\n\nMarch 25: Arizona's governor and top health official on Wednesday shared mixed updates on the state's new coronavirus response, reporting a sizable increase in testing but warning of continued medical supply shortages as the virus spreads.\n\nIf infections continue at their current pace, illnesses would peak in April and hospitalizations would peak in May, state Health Director Dr. Cara Christ said at a Wednesday press briefing.\n\n\"Arizona is still in the opening stages of its COVID-19 outbreak, and the number of cases within the state will increase significantly,\" Christ said.\n\nArizona could be short 13,000 beds in treating coronavirus patients\n\nMarch 25: The new coronavirus pandemic could leave Arizona short 13,000 hospital beds for sick patients, a top health official said Wednesday.\n\nThe state's modeling has shown if there's a big wave of illness here — what state officials emphasize is a worst-case scenario — it would hit in mid- to late April, with a high rate of hospitalizations in May, Dr. Cara Christ, the Arizona Department of Health Services director, told reporters during a news briefing with Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\n\"We must continue to increase our bed capacity. With a potential surge of COVID-19 patients, we expect it to be above and beyond our current capacity of beds,\" she said.\n\nSenate passes historic $2 trillion stimulus package\n\nMarch 25: The Senate approved its largest emergency aid package in modern history that will offer $2 trillion to help Americans, hospitals and businesses weather the effects of the coronavirus. The vote late Wednesday night was 96-0.\n\nThe bill will now go to the House for approval before it’s sent to President Donald Trump for his signature.\n\nHouse Majority Leader, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced that the House will vote on the $2 trillion bill Friday, and that they will convene at 9 a.m.\n\n\"We expect the bill to pass by voice vote,\" he said.\n\nAmong the provisions offered in the measure are one-time $1,200 checks to individuals, $367 billion in loans and grants to small businesses, over $130 billion for hospitals and community health centers and financial help to airlines and other industries hit hard by the virus.\n\nU.S. death toll surges past 1,000\n\nMarch 25: The U.S. death toll was at 1,031 late Wednesday afternoon after eclipsing 600 on Tuesday. Globally, more than 21,000 people have been killed by the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.\n\nGov. Ducey to hold press conference at 2 p.m. Wednesday\n\nMost Americans to get $1,200 checks\n\nMarch 25: People earning less than $75,000 per year will get $1,200 checks under the stimulus agreement. Married couples earning less than $150,000 will get $2,400 and children will be worth another $500 each under the deal. The final language is still being crafted, but the package includes $367 billion for small businesses, $500 billion for loans to larger industries, $100 billion for hospitals and the health care system and $600 more per week in unemployment benefits for those out of work.\n\nSenate Minority leader Chuck Schumer said the goal is to ensure that every worker who is laid off or furloughed can pay their bills.\n\n\"And because so many of them will be furloughed rather than fired, if they have benefits, they can continue, and – extremely important – they can stay with the company or small business,\" he said.\n\nIdentified cases in Arizona now top 400, with 6 known deaths\n\nMarch 25: Coronavirus cases in Arizona continue to rise, with 401 identified cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, reported by the state Wednesday.\n\nMohave County reported its first identified case, which means the county will start restricting businesses. Maricopa County reported it now has two cases in people under age 18.\n\nIdentified cases have increased by 23% since Tuesday morning's numbers update from the state. The percentage increase was lower Wednesday than it was on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, there were at least 326 identified cases and five known deaths reported by the state in its morning numbers update. The state's database now reflects the sixth death, which was announced by Coconino County late Tuesday.\n\nThree known deaths have occurred in Maricopa County, according to county data, as well as one in Pima County and one in Coconino County. It is unclear in which county one of the deaths happened. Coconino County's first known death related to COVID-19 was announced on Tuesday.\n\nNew symptom of COVID-19?\n\nMarch 24: A loss of a sense of smell or taste may be a symptom of COVID-19, medical groups representing ear, nose and throat specialists have warned.\n\nCiting a growing number of cases around the globe, the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery and ENT UK each issued warnings about patients who tested positive for the new coronavirus with the only symptom being a lost or altered sense of smell or taste.\n\n\"Anecdotal evidence is rapidly accumulating from sites around the world that anosmia and dysgeusia are significant symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery wrote in a statement.\n\nAnosmia is the loss of smell while dysgeusia is an altered sense of taste.\n\nTrump sets Easter as possible date to lift restrictions\n\nMarch 24: President Trump said Tuesday that he would like to have the government restrictions on travel and social gatherings eased by Easter, which comes on Sunday, April 12.\n\n“We’re going to be opening relatively soon,” Trump said during a Fox News town hall Tuesday. “I'd love to have it open by Easter ... It's such an important day for other reasons but I'll make an important date for this too. I would love to have the country, opened up and just raring to go by Easter.”\n\nAsked if it’s possible for the country to return to normal by Easter, Trump said, “I think it’s absolutely possible.

The broader S&P 500 index, which professional investors watch more closely, is a single percentage point away from falling into its own bear market, which would end the longest bull market in Wall Street history.\n\nThe decline has been one of the swiftest sell-offs of this magnitude.

This commute, which for some takes the better part of an hour each way, can be stressful. The typical American commuter spends about 54 hours a year waiting in traffic, spending over $1,000 in wasted fuel and lost time, according to a recent report. And with tens of thousands of traffic fatalities in America each year, daily commutes can be dangerous.\n\nWhile traffic problems can occur anywhere, there are certain major American cities where gridlock, accidents, long commutes, and high gas prices make driving especially frustrating.\n\n24/7 Wall St. created an index composed of several driving-related measures from the U.S. Census Bureau, the National Insurance Crime Bureau, Texas A&M’s Transportation Institute, and more, to identify the worst metropolitan statistical areas for drivers. The components of the index – which include average commute time, regional gas prices, drunk driving death rates, overall driving fatality rates, time and money lost due to congestion, and auto theft rates – were selected to capture an area’s safety, convenience, and cost of driving.\n\nThe 50 worst cities to drive in are spread out among 16 states, with 31 located in the South, 18 in the West, and just one in the Midwest. California has by far the most cities on this list, at 11, followed by Texas with seven. Alabama and Florida are tied with five cities apiece.\n\nIs the car owner's manual history?:2021 Ford F-150 ditches traditional paper copy\n\nCars and their collectors:Some of the most outrageous car collections in the world\n\nIn addition to paying for gas and insurance, drivers also have to handle repairs and routine maintenance. The roads these cars drive on also need routine maintenance, yet many major roads, highways, and bridges have fallen into disrepair across the country. This declining infrastructure can damage cars and even pose a threat to the safety of drivers and their passengers.\n\n50.

Total traffic fatalities and traffic fatalities involving drunk drivers per 100,000 are from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) for 2018. Mean travel time to work and the percentage of the working-age population with a commute of 60 minutes or longer came from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2019 1-year estimates. The rate of car thefts per 100,000 people is from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) Hot Spots report for the year 2018. The average price of gasoline from second quarter of 2017 to second quarter of 2018 is from the Council for Community and Economic Research’s (C2ER) cost of living index for metropolitan statistical areas. Hours lost due to congestion per car came from the Texas A&M 2019 Urban Mobility Report, which features data from 2017.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Beyond the moral and economic reasons to do so, it turns out there’s a significant environmental one, too. When food winds up in landfills it produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is far more potent than the poster child of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, which primarily comes from fossil fuel use.\n\nIn fact, if food waste were a country, it would be the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China and the United States. Few people realize when they shove some grapes into the bottom drawer of their refrigerator and forget about them, they are contributing to climate change.\n\nWe throw out way too much edible food\n\nThrowing out food at home is only part of the problem. As the Natural Resources Defense Council noted in a report last year, “We leave entire fields unharvested, reject produce solely for cosmetic reasons, throw out anything past or even close to its ‘use by’ date, inundate restaurant patrons with massive portions, and let absurd amounts of food rot in the back of our fridges.”\n\nA recent report by the Boston Consulting Group put the dollar figure of wasted food worldwide at $1.2 trillion a year.\n\nWhen we toss food, we’re not just wasting money; we’re also squandering the energy used to grow crops and raise cattle, as well as the energy required to ship, refrigerate and package food.\n\nIt’s time for people, restaurants, supermarkets and farms to consider this cost to the environment when they over-order or carelessly discard edible food. The federal government has recognized the need to address this problem; in 2015 the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency set a goal of cutting food waste in half by 2030. It’s doable, and we all have a role to play.\n\nMore:Poor roads cost consumers at the pump and boost greenhouse emissions\n\nGlobal warming alarmists shouldn't exploit hurricanes\n\nKroger, America's largest supermarket chain, bids farewell to the plastic shopping bag\n\nIn May, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue hosted a food waste roundtable in Washington. “Our nation’s agricultural abundance should be used to nourish those in need, not fill the trash,” Perdue said. “So many people work on food waste issues in their own spheres, but it’s time to change the culture and adopt a holistic approach to get everyone working together and sharing ideas.”\n\nOverseas, some governments are taking more aggressive actions to stem food waste. France, for example, bans grocery stores from tossing edible food. South Korea prohibits food waste from landfills, and requires people to separate food waste from their regular trash.\n\nWhile those mandates might prove politically unpalatable in this country, some states are taking more modest steps, such as restricting how much food waste can be sent to landfills, and we should encourage those laudable efforts. But real progress will come when people and businesses step up to solve this problem. And many already are doing so.\n\nThere are smaller steps we can take together\n\nFood Waste Reduction Alliance — a collaborative effort of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the Food Marketing Institute and the National Restaurant Association — is working to standardize the confusing panoply of labels that consumers use as cues to determine if food is still safe to eat.\n\nThere are also organizations like Food Cowboy, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine and Meal Connect, which bring technology to food donations — allowing farms, grocery stores and restaurants to donate their excess food to food banks. Some supermarket chains are also taking steps to sync unused food to groups feeding the needy. Trader Joe’s has Donations Coordinators at its stores, who work to bring unsold food to nonprofit organizations.\n\nThen there’s “ugly food” — produce that looks weird or misshapen but is identical in taste and quality to properly proportioned fruits and vegetables. Companies like The Misfits sell imperfect-looking produce at a discount. As the company says, “Crooked cucumbers, misshapen tomatoes or not-so-red Red Peppers are just as delicious and nutritious as ‘the other guys’ – and less expensive!”\n\nIf we could take these solutions and scale them, the food we’d save could feed millions of hungry people, conserve resources, and make a big dent in one of the biggest sources of climate change.\n\nIt won’t take a rocket scientist to solve this dumb problem.

And now he and his country will bear the consequences,\" Biden said in remarks at the White House.\n\nThe U.S. and western allies will block the assets of four of Russia's largest banks – in addition to U.S. sanctions on two financial institutions earlier this week – and impose sanctions on Russian elites and new export controls. The latest measures also targeted Belarus' defense and security industries along with 24 Belarusian individuals and entities for the country's role in the attack on Ukraine.\n\nBiden said the new economic measures would \"limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen to be part of the global economy.\"\n\nThe president also announced the U.S. would deploy additional forces to Germany to help bolster the NATO alliance along the eastern flank.

We stand up for freedom.”\n\nBut the president stopped short of blocking Russian financial institutions' access to SWIFT, the global financial system which ties together banks across the world. Biden insisted the latest measures \"exceed SWIFT\" and suggested it was a move that European allies were hesitant to make.\n\nThe president said additional Russian oligarchs and their families would face new sanctions but he declined to say why he has yet to sanction Putin personally, only adding that \"it's on the table.\"\n\nBiden also issued a chilling warning that he believes Putin \"has much larger ambitions\" that extend beyond Ukraine's borders.\n\nTranscript of Biden's speech:President Joe Biden addresses Russia's 'brutal assault' on Ukraine\n\n\"He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union,\" Biden said. \"His ambitions are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.\"\n\nRussia's military operation has the goal of overtaking the Ukrainian government and installing a Kremlin-backed one, according to a senior U.S. military official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nHere's what to know about the attack on Ukraine:\n\nWHEN DID THE INVASION START?

However, Ukraine's military also said it was resisting the advance on multiple fronts.\n\nThe apparent development comes as thousands of civilians spent the night in bomb shelters, typically underground subway stations and Zelenskyy urged his citizens to do all they can to resist Russia's assault. Zelenskyy has vowed to remain in Kyiv with his family and he appealed to Russia for a ceasefire.\n\nSome 137 Ukrainians, a mixture of soldiers and civilians, died Thursday.

In his words: “They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven.”\n\nIn addition, he said 316 others have been wounded since Russian launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Each of the Ukrainians who have died will be posthumously awarded the title “hero of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said.\n\n“This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilized world,” he said. “Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall.\"\n\n- Associated Press\n\nUkraine president orders general military mobilization amid invasion\n\nZelenskyy ordered a “general mobilization” of the Ukraine population Thursday to support military efforts as Russia attacks Ukraine.\n\nA decree signed by the president orders conscripts and military reservists to mobilize within 90 days to assist the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy ordered the mobilization “in connection with the military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and in order to ensure the state’s defense, maintain combat, and mobilization of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” the decree reads.\n\nThe move comes as Ukraine has banned all males between the ages of 18 to 60 from leaving the country, according to Ukraine’s State Border Service, CNN reported.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhite House 'outraged' over reports Chernobyl workers being held hostage\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki condemned Thursday what she said are “credible reports” that Russian soldiers are holding hostage staff at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant facility in Ukraine.\n\nThe facility, scene of the worst nuclear disaster in history, was taken over by Russians during their invasion of Ukraine, the Associated Press reported.\n\n“We're outraged by credit credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,” Psaki said. “This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking – which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facility – is obviously incredibly alarming and greatly concerning. We condemn it and we request their release.”\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Minister raised concerns on Twitter about Chernobyl, which is located about 80 miles north of the Ukraine capital of Kyiv.\n\n“In 1986, the world saw the biggest technological disaster in Chornobyl,” he said. Russia’s attack on Ukraine may cause another ecological disaster moving its military forces to Chornobyl.

The troops include an armored brigade combat team. It will be sent to German to reassure allies.\n\nThe U.S. already has about 90,000 troops in Europe and has deployed more to the continent as tensions simmered in the weeks before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Putin chose this war.”\n\nBiden said Russia’s attack on Ukraine is unfolding as officials predicted and that Russia \"rejected every good faith effort the United States and our allies.\"\n\nBiden said members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and others have joined a global coaliton to amplify a united response.\n\nBiden said G-7 leaders agreed to limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen.

He added that Finland and Sweden, which are not NATO members, would also attend Friday's meeting.\n\n\"We don't have all the answers today but there will be a new reality,\" he said. \"It will be a new Europe after the invasion we saw today.\"\n\nHis remarks came after Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland triggered Article 4 of NATO's founding treaty, which allows members to \"bring any issue of concern, especially related to security of a member country, to the table for discussion with the North Atlantic Council.\"\n\nThe alliance has invoked Article 4 several times since its creation in 1949.\n\nNATO issued a new statement Thursday saying Moscow's actions \"pose a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security, and they will have geostrategic consequences.\"\n\n\"We are deploying additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the Alliance, as well as additional maritime assets,\" the statement said. \" We have increased the readiness of our forces to respond to all contingencies.\"\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nWhat time did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nIn a televised address that came around 10 p.m. Eastern time, which is 5 a.m. in Ukraine and 6 a.m. in Moscow, Putin told his country that Russia would conduct a military operation in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian president said the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. And he claimed that Russia doesn’t intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to “demilitarize” it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.\n\nPutin warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to “consequences you have never seen.”\n\nMore:As Russian forces advance on Ukraine, US, allies escalate diplomatic efforts\n\nLithuania orders state of emergency\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda on Thursday signed a decree declaring a state of emergency in the Baltic country in response to Russia’s military attack on Ukraine.

He is the author of four books on European issues, most recently \"Berlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall and the Birth of the New Berlin.\" The opinions in this article are those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) A major Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, to be released Monday, is expected to warn that humans are wrecking the planet so profoundly that we may run out of ways to survive the crisis. The report speaks of a \"rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\"\n\nThis might make it tempting to rush to nuclear energy as a quick, low-carbon fix.\n\nBut its faults are numerous, not least that there is still no answer to the 80-year-old question: Where to store the burgeoning tons of highly radioactive spent fuel?\n\nPropositions abound: from catapulting it into space, ditching it between tectonic plates, or burying it deep underground on remote islands.\n\nBut try as they have, scientists can't find a safe, long-term, cost-effective way to dispose of nuclear waste.\n\nEven as new countries like Poland, Egypt, Bangladesh, and Indonesia line up to start nuclear programs -- on the face of it, a low-carbon energy source that could cut emissions -- every nation in the world with nuclear power struggles with the same dilemma.\n\nThus far, the determined hunt for a secure nuclear graveyard has been unsuccessful -- and there's no fix in sight. While the search goes on, ever more of the highly toxic refuse -- a lethal by-product of the plutonium and uranium used in nuclear energy and weaponry production -- piles up on top of the 370,000 tons of fission residue that languishes in stockpiles worldwide. Experts say that could jump by 1.1 million tons in a century.\n\nGermany is shutting down its last nuclear power plant at the end of this year. France, on the other hand, just announced a massive build-out of its already prodigious nuclear fleet. The US is betting on nuclear to help hit climate goals.\n\nLike most nations with nuclear power, they store the toxic spent fuel in steel cannisters at temporary locations, usually at nuclear plant facilities and military stations -- often incurring the wrath of local residents who want nothing to do with the hazardous material that remains radioactive for a million years.\n\nIndeed, proponents and adversaries of nuclear power agree these interim solutions are untenable: we can't just dump this toxic mess on subsequent generations, and then they on others. Moreover, spent fuel, though no longer usable for energy production, remains radioactive and thus poses health, security, and proliferation risks.\n\nAt the moment, the Finns are putting deep geological disposal on the table as a solution -- currently the least objectionable of the options under discussion. But the Nordics' claim to have finally cracked this headache from hell is riddled with uncertainties.\n\nThis summer, on a tiny, sparsely populated island in the Baltic Sea, the first of hundreds of tightly sealed volcanic-clay-and-copper-clad drums of spent nuclear fuel will be lowered into a 500-meter deep granite vault and, eventually, cemented shut -- not for a million but, presumably, for about 100,000 years.\n\nYet this geological tomb is only another, ultimately temporary, fix. As nuclear waste expert Andrew Blowers, author of \"The Legacy of Nuclear Power\" and a former member of the UK's Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, says , \"Currently no options have been able to demonstrate that waste will remain isolated from the environment over the tens to hundreds of thousands of years.\"\n\nCopper and cement will eventually corrode and decay, while nuclear waste remains radioactive and highly toxic for millennia. Some experts though say the risk of leaks, and water contamination, is higher than Finnish authorities acknowledge.\n\nMoreover, earthquakes or other dramatic shifts in geological conditions could set the poisonous elements free. And then there's the cost: Finland will spend €3.5 billion ($3.9 billion) on the facility, which will in the course of the next 100 years house 6,500 tons -- of their own -- spent fuel.\n\nOther countries, such as the US, Britain, and Sweden say they will also, one day, bury their nuclear refuse in similar vaults. But even where the unique geological conditions exist, the same obstacle always arises: opposition from locals. Nobody but nobody wants radioactive waste anywhere near their families.\n\nThis is why another option, tectonic burial, looks appealing -- until one looks more closely. The idea is to send nuclear waste plummeting into the earth's core, basically hitching a ride on a geological plate on the ocean floor that is in the process of diving beneath an adjacent plate. The further the downward plate submerges beneath the earth's skin, the further away the nuclear waste is carried from our natural world.\n\nBut geologists pour scorn on the notion: the movement of tectonic plates is much too slow, the volume of nuclear refuse too great, and then there's the threat of subterranean volcanos or quakes that could send the mess spewing back into the ocean.\n\nHurtling nuclear waste in the other direction, namely into space, is also a nonstarter. There, the risk of rocket failure, the issue of space debris, and the wildly prohibitive cost stop this ploy dead in its tracks.\n\nThe exorbitant cost of the ongoing search -- and then of the \"solution\" itself -- illustrate why we don't want ever more of this menacing debris. Thus far, the US has spent $13 billion of taxpayer money in its unsuccessful effort to rid the country of its 90,000 tons of radioactive waste.\n\nIn Finland, at least, the nuclear industry picks up the bill. At the Finns' rate, disposing of all of the world's current nuclear waste could total €135 billion ($153 billion) and another €6 billion ($6.8 billion) a year for the estimated 10,500 more metric tons produced annually.\n\nYet, since no long-term secure repository is in sight, says Blowers, \"on-site storage of spent fuel is likely to remain for several generations, at least until mid to end of next century. As the volume grows, they will have to cope with ever more complex, difficult management issues.\"\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.

It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.\n\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated – repeated – efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber and this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well. But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united, and that’s what we did. We stayed united.\n\nWe prepared extensively and carefully.\n\nWe spent months building coalitions of other freedom-loving nations in Europe and the Americas, from the Americas to Asia and African continents to confront Putin.\n\nLike many of you, I spent countless hours unifying our European allies.

Putin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been.\n\nPolitics:Here's how to watch President Biden's first State of the Union address\n\nTogether, along with our allies, we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We’re cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.\n\nWe’re choking Russia’s access, we’re choking Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\n\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. I mean it.\n\nThe United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs.\n\nWe are joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.\n\nAnd tonight I’m announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. He has no idea what’s coming.\n\nThe Ruble has already lost 30% of its value. The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is the one to blame.\n\nTogether with our allies, we’re providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. We’re giving more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, and we’ll continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.\n\nBut let me be clear. Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in a conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\n\nFor that purpose, we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.\n\nAnd as I’ve made crystal clear, the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power, every single inch.\n\nAnd we’re clear-eyed. Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.\n\nAnd a pound of Ukrainian people, a proud, proud people, pound for pound ready to fight with every inch of energy they have. They’ve known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised I would be. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.\n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russian economy. And that we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.\n\nTonight, I can announce the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.\n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, united with our allies.\n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home, but I know news about what’s happening can seem alarming to all Americans.\n\nBut I want you to know we’re going to be okay. We’re going to be okay.\n\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\n\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.\n\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe, a more unified West. We see unity among the people who are gathering in cities, in large crowds around the world, even in Russia, to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.\n\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracies, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.\n\nThis is the real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forged a deep bond that connects our two nations, we stand with you. We stand with you.\n\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he’ll never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.\n\nHe’ll never extinguish their love of freedom, and he will never – never – weaken the resolve of the free world.\n\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing and so much more.\n\nI understand. Like many of you did, my Dad had to leave his home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to find work. So, like many of you, I grew up in a family when, if the price of food went up, it was felt throughout the family. It had an impact.\n\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as president was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.\n\nMore:President Biden signs $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill with $1,400 stimulus checks into law\n\nBecause people were hurting, we needed to act, and we did. Few pieces of legislation have done more at a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.\n\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief to tens of millions of Americans. It helped put food on the table. Remember those long lines of cars waiting for hours just to get a box of food put in their trunk.\n\nIt cut the cost of health care insurance and, as my Dad used to say, it gave people just a little bit of breathing room.\n\nUnlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people — and left no one behind.\n\nAnd it worked. It worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs.

But that trickle-down theory led to a weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits and a widening gap between the top and everyone else in nearly a century.\n\nLook, Vice President Harris and I ran for office, and I realize we have fundamental disagreements on this, but ran for office with a new economic vision for America.\n\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because we know when the middle class grows, when the middle class grows, the poor have a way up and the wealthy do very well.\n\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges and airports on Earth, and now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. We won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix it.\n\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and I thank my Republican friends, who joined to invest and rebuild America. The single biggest investment in history.\n\nIt was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. We’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We’re now talking about an infrastructure decade.\n\nLook, it’s going to transform America, to put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world – particularly China.\n\nMore:What does the progressive response to President Biden's State of the Union address mean?\n\nI’ve told (China President) Xi Jinping, it’s never been a good bet to bet against the American people. We’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, waterways all across America.\n\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of climate change and promote environmental justice. We’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace the poisonous lead pipes so every child, every American, has clean water to drink at home and at school. We’re going to provide affordable high-speed internet for every American, rural, suburban, urban and tribal communities. Four thousand projects have already been announced. Many of you have announced them in your districts.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\n\nWhen we use taxpayers’ dollars to rebuild America – we’re going to do it by buying American: buy American products, support American jobs.\n\nThe federal government spends about $600 billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. There’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every administration, Democrat or Republican, says they’ll do it, but we’re actually doing it.\n\nWe’ll buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails is made in America from beginning to end. All of it. All of it.\n\nBut folks, to compete for the jobs of the future, we also need a level playing field with China and other competitors.\n\nThat’s why it’s so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\n\nWe used to invest almost 2% of our GDP in research and development. We don’t now. China is.\n\nLet me give you one example why it’s so important to pass.\n\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land.\n\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of Dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built.\n\nThat’s where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor “mega site.”\n\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. Ten-thousand new jobs. In those factories, the average job about $135,000 a year.\n\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and everyday lives, from smartphones, technology, the internet, technology that has yet to be invented.\n\nBut that’s just the beginning. Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight... Pat came to see me, and he told me they are ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion. That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history.\n\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. So let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it, and we’ll really take off in a big way. And folks, Intel is not alone. There’s something happening in America. Just look around and you’ll see an amazing story. The rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.\" The revitalization of American manufacturing. Companies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have gone overseas.\n\nThat’s what’s happening. Ford is investing $11 billion in electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. GM is making the largest investment in its history – $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nAll told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were created in America last year alone. Powered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.\n\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, 'It’s time to bury the label ‘Rust Belt.’ It’s time to see what used to be called the Rust Belt become the home of significant resurgence of manufacturing.\n\nAnd with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth, higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills. Inflation is robbing them of the gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel.\n\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. Look, our economy roared back faster than almost anyone predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough people because of the pandemic to keep up production in their factories. You didn’t have people making those beams that went into buildings because they were out. The factory was closed.\n\nThe pandemic also disrupted the global supply chain. Factories close. When that happens it takes longer to make goods and get them to the warehouses, to the stores, and prices go up.\n\nLook at cars last year. One-third of all the inflation was because of automobile sales. There weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. And guess what, prices of automobiles went way up, especially used vehicles as well. And so we have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\n\nI think I have a better idea to fight inflation: lower your costs, not your wages. That means make more cars and semiconductors in America, more infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.\n\nLook, economists call this “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”\n\nI call it building a better America. My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.\n\nSeventeen Nobel laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and I believe most Americans support the plan.\n\nAnd here’s the plan:\n\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. We pay more for the same drug produced by the same company in America than any other country in the world. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy, the handsome young man standing up there, Joshua Davis.\n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every single day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make. That’s what it costs the pharmaceutical company.\n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times that amount. I spoke with Joshua’s mom.\n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God’s name you’re going to be able to pay for it.\n\nWhat it does to your family, what it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect yourself to be. I really mean it, think about that. That’s what I think about.\n\nJoshua is here tonight, but yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy, by the way.\n\nFor Joshua, and 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.\n\nAnd drug companies will do very, very well, their profit margin. And while we’re at it, I know we have great disagreements on this floor with this, let’s let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. They already set the price for VA drugs.\n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families with Affordable Care Act plans to save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make these savings permanent.\n\nSecond, let’s cut energy costs for families – an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\n\nLet’s provide investments, tax credits to weatherize your home and your businesses to be energy efficient and get a tax credit for it; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving another $80 a month that you’re not going to have to pay at the pump.\n\nThe third thing we can do to change the standard of living for hardworking folks is cut the cost of child care, cut the cost of childcare. Folks, if you live in a major city in America you pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. I was a single dad for five years raising two kids. I had a lot of help though. I had a mom, a dad, a brother and a sister that really helped.\n\nBut middle-class and working folks shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income to care for their young children.\n\nMy plan will cut the cost of childcare in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work generating economic growth.\n\nBut my plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds. All these will lower costs for families.\n\nAnd under my plan, nobody, let me say this again, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Not a single penny.\n\nI may be wrong, but my guess is if we took a secret ballot in this floor, that we’d all agree that the present tax system ain’t fair. We have to fix it.\n\nI’m not looking to punish anybody. But let’s make corporations and wealthy Americans start paying their fair share. Look, last year, last year, like Chris Coons and Tom Carper and my distinguished congresswoman, we come from the land of corporate America. There are more corporations incorporated in (Delaware) than every other state in America combined, and I still won 36 years in a row.\n\nThe point is, even they understand you should pay just a fair share. Last year, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies earned $40 billion in profit and paid zero in federal taxes. Now look, it’s not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.\n\nAnd that’s why in the G7 and other meetings overseas we’re able to put together, I was able to be somewhat helpful, 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.\n\nIt’ll raise billions of dollars. That’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher and a firefighter.\n\nSo that’s my plan, but we’ll go in more detail later. We will grow the economy and lower costs for families. So what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. We all know we’ve got to make changes.\n\nAnd while you’re at it, confirm my nominees for the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\n\nMy plan will not only lower costs and give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\n\nThe previous administration not only ballooned the deficit with those tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs, the job of those to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. Remember we had those debates about whether or not those watchdogs should be able to see every day how much money was being spent or was going to the right place.\n\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs are back.\n\nWe’re going to go after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans. And tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will soon name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\n\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half of what it was before I took office.\n\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. Lowering your costs also meant demanding more competition. I’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation. It drives up profits.\n\nWhen corporations have to compete, their profits go up, but your prices go up when they don’t have to compete. Small businesses and family farmers and ranchers, I need not tell some of my Republican friends from those states. Guess what? You’ve got four basic meat packing facilities. That’s it. You play with them or you don’t get to play at all. And you pay a hell of a lot more. A hell of a lot more because there’s only four.\n\nSee what’s happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, about half a dozen or less of foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits.\n\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on those companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch.\n\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect, and they will looked at closely\n\nWe’re also going cut costs to keep the economy going strong and giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on skills not just their degrees.\n\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\n\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.\n\nLook, let’s pass the PRO Act. When a majority of workers want to form a union — they shouldn’t be able to be stopped.\n\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.\n\nFor more than two years, COVID has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.\n\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated and exhausted. That doesn’t even count close to a million people who sit at a dining room table or a kitchen table and look at an empty chair because they lost somebody.\n\nBut I also know this, because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools that we have been provided by this Congress, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.\n\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, where severe cases are down to a level not seen since July of last year.\n\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new mask guideline.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now go mask free. And based on projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks.\n\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 no longer need control our lives.\n\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19.” But tonight I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. We’ll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this virus mutates and spreads, we have to stay on guard.\n\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely in my view\n\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection.\n\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see their vaccines authorized for their children.\n\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines if and when they do.\n\nWe are also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.\n\nI’ve ordered more pills than anyone in the world has. Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 million pills this month and more than double that next month.\n\nAnd now we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\n\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\n\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. On testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available, and you can order them for free to your doorstep.\n\nIf you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order another group of tests. Go to covidtests.gov starting next week, and you can get more tests.\n\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of maybe months or years.\n\nAnd if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, pills ready if needed. I can’t promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\n\nMore:https://www.usatoday.com/news/coronavirus/\n\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.\n\nIt’s time for America to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again with people. People working from home can feel safe and begin to return to their offices.\n\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\n\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. With 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and move forward safely.\n\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests and masks.\n\nOf course, continuing this costs money. So it will not surprise you, I’ll be back to see y’all.\n\nI’m going to soon send a request to Congress. The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again. We may need them again, so I expect Congress, and I hope you’ll pass that quickly.\n\nFourth, we’ll continue vaccinating the world. We’ve sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any nation on Earth.\n\nWe won’t stop. You can’t build a wall high enough to keep out a vaccine. The vaccine can stop the spread of these diseases.\n\nWe’ve lost so much in COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, much loss of life.\n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. So stop looking at COVID as a partisan dividing line. See it for what it is: A God-awful disease. Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who we really are: fellow Americans.\n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. It’s a long time coming, but we can change how to move forward — on COVID-19 and other issues that we must face together.\n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\n\nMore:Biden's travels, funeral for NYPD officer, Janet Jackson doc: 5 things to know Friday\n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22 years old.\n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets that they later chose to patrol as police officers.\n\nI spoke with their families, and I told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifices, and we’ll carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nLike some of you that have been around for a while, I’ve worked with you on these issues for a long time. I know what works: Investigating crime prevention and community policing, cops who’ll walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\n\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. Let’s come together and protect our communities, restore trust and hold law enforcement accountable.\n\nThat’s why the Justice Department has required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\n\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in more proven strategies. Proven strategies like community violence interruption — trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people some hope.\n\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. It’s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them with resources and training they need to protect our communities.\n\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\nAnd we’ll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home,. No serial numbers. Can’t be traced.\n\nI ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? Why? Why?\n\nFolks, ban assault weapons with high-capacity magazines that hold up to 100 rounds. You think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests?\n\nLook, repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. The only one. Imagine had we done that with the tobacco manufacturers.\n\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.\n\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And, look, it’s under assault.\n\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote – we’ve been there before - but to subvert the entire election.\n\nWe can’t let this happen.\n\nTonight. I call on the Senate to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans know who’s funding our elections.\n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer: an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nAnd we all know, no matter what your ideology, one of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a president has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAs I did four days ago, I’ve nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of our nation’s top legal minds who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.\n\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. From a family of public school educators and police officers. She’s a consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support including the the Fraternal Order of\n\nPolice and former judges supported by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nFolks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system.\n\nAnd as you might gas, I think we can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.\n\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\n\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster and those who aren’t legitimately here can be sent back.”\n\nMore:A 'brutal crosscurrent': Why Biden's immigration policies are making everyone mad\n\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\n\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and many of yours.\n\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\n\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.\n\nIt’s not only the right thing to do, it’s the economically smart thing to do.\n\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nLet’s get it done once and for all.\n\nFolks, advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women.\n\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade — standing precedent for half a century —is under attack as never before.\n\nMore:With Roe v. Wade in peril in Supreme Court, abortion rights activists ask: Where are the men?\n\nIf you want to go forward, not backwards, we must protect access to health care., preserve a woman’s right to choose, and continue to advance maternal health care for all Americans.\n\nAnd folks, for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families, it’s simply wrong.\n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I’ll always have your back as your president, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\n\nFolks, as I’ve just demonstrated, while it often appears that we do not agree, we do agree on a lot more things than we acknowledge. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\n\nAnd we’ll be strengthening the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\n\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the nation. Four big things we can do together in my view.\n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\n\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\n\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. Stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\n\nAnd if you’re suffering from addiction, you should know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.\n\nSecond, let’s take on mental health, especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\n\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. They have the money. We can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\n\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\n\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here tonight with us, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.\n\nFolks, it’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\n\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care if we treat it that way in our insurance.\n\nThe third piece of that agenda is support our veterans. Veterans are the backbone and the spine of this country. They’re the best of us.\n\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for those and their families when they come home.\n\nMy administration provided assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\n\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\n\nOne being stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits,” Many of you have been there. I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 times. These burn pits that incinerate waste – the waste of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and so much more.\n\nAnd they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors. Never the same.\n\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness.\n\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\n\nI know.\n\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.\n\nI don’t know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near, that his hooch was near in Iraq and earlier than that in Kosovo was the cause of his brain cancer and the disease of so many of our troops.\n\nBut I am committed to finding out everything we can.\n\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\n\nThe widow of Sgt. First Class Heath Robinson.\n\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\n\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\n\nDanielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. And he loved building Legos with their daughter.\n\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body.\n\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end.\n\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting. And neither did she.\n\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.\n\nTonight, Danielle — we are going to do better.\n\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to disease, already helping more veterans get benefits.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we're expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\n\nI’m also calling on Congress to pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and the comprehensive health care they deserve.\n\nAnd fourth and last, let’s end cancer as we know it.\n\nThis is personal. This is personal to me and Jill, and to Kamala, and so many of you who have lost someone you love: husband, wife, son, daughter, mom, dad.\n\nCancer is the number two cause of death in America – second only to heart disease.\n\nLast month, I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.\n\nMore:Can Biden's 'Cancer Moonshot' succeed? It's possible, experts say, but it will take more than words\n\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years and I think we can do better than that. Turn cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.\n\nMore support for patients and their families.\n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund what I call ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. Patterned after DARPA in the Defense Department.

The US has also continued sharing downgraded intelligence with the Ukrainians, including about Russian military moves, in an attempt to help Ukraine on the battlefield, two of the sources told CNN.\n\nBut intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\n\"From a purely military/tactical standpoint, Russia has the manpower and firepower to take Kyiv. No question,\" said an American source familiar with the intelligence. \"And no matter how much resistance the Ukrainians put up.\"\n\nRoughly a quarter of Russia's amassed troops have yet to enter Ukraine, a senior defense official told reporters on Monday -- a potential \"second wave,\" according to two sources familiar with the intelligence -- and defense officials say Putin could yet order a far less restrained bombing campaign, including airstrikes, long-range missiles and artillery.\n\n\"They have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv, and one of the things that could result is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt in both the size and the scale of their targeting of Kyiv,\" a senior defense official told reporters on Monday.\n\nAdministration officials warned lawmakers in classified briefings Monday that a \"second wave\" of Russian troops will likely consolidate the country's positions within Ukraine and by sheer numbers be able to overcome the Ukrainian resistance, according to two people familiar with the briefings.\n\n\"That part was disheartening,\" one lawmaker told CNN.\n\nThe officials also said Russia was likely going to lay siege to Kyiv and predicted ugly scenes of urban warfare, one of the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, officials tracking the campaign say, the ugly truth remains that Ukraine is massively outgunned and outmanned -- even as Russia has made what military strategists say are a number of obvious blunders.\n\nAlready, Russia appears to be ramping up its campaign in the east and the south. In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Russian forces have launched rocket attacks on at least one residential neighborhood that have killed civilians, according to Ukrainian officials and multiple social media videos geolocated by CNN. Meanwhile, in the small southern city of Mykolaiv, located on an inlet that would be a useful access point for Russians to bring in troops and supplies, the fighting has been among the most intense in Ukraine in recent days.\n\nConcerns about Putin's state of mind\n\nPerhaps most ominously, western officials are also warily watching Putin, under pressure from crushing economic penalties that have tanked the ruble and caused the Russian stock market to close. They fear those sanctions, combined with the lack of progress in Kyiv, may cause the unpredictable Russian leader to lash out even more.\n\nJUST WATCHED French presidential sources: Putin struck Macron 'different' at recent meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH French presidential sources: Putin struck Macron 'different' at recent meeting 03:51\n\nSenior US lawmakers familiar with the intelligence, western officials and former senior US officials with deep experience in Russia have begun to openly raise questions about the Russian leader's mental stability.\n\n\"Putin has been completely isolated, partly because of Covid,\" said the American source familiar with the intelligence. \"He's now basically just by himself, completely cut off from most of his advisers, isolated geographically ... the only people talking to him are sycophants who are just feeding his resentment.\" The source added that the intelligence suggested Putin has not even been listening to his oligarchs -- traditionally the people who have had a key influence on his decision making.\n\nQuestions about Putin's mental state arose during the classified briefings to lawmakers, but they were not clearly answered by the administration officials, the sources familiar with the briefings said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who attended the Senate briefing, confirmed that Putin's mental state came up, but he declined to elaborate on what had been shared. He said, however, that regardless of the briefing, he personally is worried about Putin's mental state.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted Friday that \"it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin,\" hinting that his assessment was based on intelligence briefings. \"He has always been a killer, but his problem now is different & significant. It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Putin ordered Russia's nuclear forces into \"special combat readiness,\" a heightened alert status that the Biden administration has characterized as part of a pattern of unprovoked escalation and \"manufactured threats.\"\n\nHolding back?\n\nFive days into its multipronged assault on Ukraine, Russia has suffered repeated logistical failures that defense officials and independent military analysts say are largely of its own making. Russian mechanized forces that have been the tip of the spear have often outpaced their own sustainment units carrying fuel and other supplies, leaving the support units open to ambush and stranding forward-advancing forces without fuel in the tank.\n\n\"Whether they outran [sustainment capabilities] or whether they just didn't plan properly for it, or whether they just simply didn't execute their plan for it, I don't know,\" said the senior defense official. But, \"on day 4, they're running out of gas and they've having logistics problems. Our assessment was that they did not believe they would be having those kinds of problems that early on.\"\n\nMeanwhile, western officials have cheered on a better-than-anticipated showing by Ukrainian forces, in particular how effective they have been using western-provided Stinger shoulder-fired missiles and anti-aircraft artillery to take down an unknown number of Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.\n\n\"The Russians don't have complete control of the airspace of the entire country,\" said the senior western intelligence official. \"In the areas in which the Russian military operations are the most intense on the ground, those are the areas where the Russians have the most control over the airspace in terms of air to air.\"\n\nBut Western officials still aren't entirely sure why Russia has held back some forces outside of Ukraine's borders, or why Russia has not yet carried out the kind of electronic warfare against Ukraine the west had been anticipating -- like massive hacking campaigns and attacks on critical infrastructure.\n\nOne official said the US believes Russia has been holding back on severing communications on the ground -- a tactic the west had expected early but has yet to happen -- because the Russian military forces need that infrastructure to communicate amongst themselves.\n\nAs for the troops left on the border, it's possible that Russia has planned the attack in waves in an effort to exhaust the Ukrainians with the first wave and then demolish them with a second wave of fresh troops, according to two sources familiar with the intelligence. It's also possible, according to one of those sources, that Russia has simply moved cautiously after facing a tougher fight than expected.\n\nAt this point, officials said, it's impossible to put a timeline on how long Ukrainian forces will be able to hold the Russians at the gates of Kyiv.\n\n\"I can't put a number [on how long Kyiv lasts],\" the senior western intelligence official said. \"I can't tell you it's going to be hours or days.\n\n\"While the Ukrainians are putting on a stiff defense, and a much better one than I think the Russians anticipated, there will be a time where they will run out of ammunition. There will come a time where they run out of fuel and they can't move,\" this person said. \"We are mindful of that and they are mindful of that.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting Monday.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis", "Natasha Bertrand", "Barbara Starr"], "publish_date": "2022/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/17/fact-check-electric-cars-emit-less-better-environment/3671468001/", "title": "Fact check: Electric cars emit less, are better for environment", "text": "The claim: Driving an electric vehicle won't save the planet\n\nA Facebook post claims that electric car batteries weigh approximately 1,000 pounds and require more than 500,000 pounds in raw materials to make.\n\n\"Driving an electric-car won't save the planet,\" the meme states.\n\nAlthough it's true that electric car batteries weigh about 1,000 pounds and creating one requires digging up, moving and processing tons of raw materials, evaluating the batteries' impact on the environment is more complex than the Facebook post suggests.\n\nMore:Fact check: Paper bags and other decoy nests do not deter wasps\n\nElectric cars have fewer emissions\n\nThe positive effects electric cars have on the environment, researchers and advocates argue, outweigh any negative impacts from sourcing lithium, which is used in electric car batteries.\n\nWhen talking about vehicle emissions, there are two types: direct and life cycle. Direct emissions are emitted through a car's tailpipe and contribute to smog — fog combined with smoke or a pollutant.\n\nLife cycle emissions are related to fuel and vehicle production, distribution, use and recycling or disposal. The U.S. Department of Energy says calculating this type of emission is complex but that electric cars produce fewer life cycle emissions than traditional vehicles because they don't rely on gas.\n\nGetting gas to the fuel tank of a traditional car requires extracting petroleum from the Earth, refining it to gas and transporting it to gas stations for consumers to purchase.\n\nCalculating emissions for electric cars depends on a region's energy sources, according to Zhenhong Lin, a researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. In northern China, where coal dominates electricity generation, electric cars were found to emit slightly more greenhouse gases than traditional cars. But in other parts of China, they emit less.\n\nThis is common in other areas across the world, too. The DOE has an interactive map users can explore to find information on emissions in their area.\n\n\"It is expected that China will significantly improve efficiency of their coal plants and increase the share of non-fossil power capacity (such as solar or wind power) in the future, as part of their actions to meet their climate change goal,\" Lin said.\n\nDaniel B. Work, a professor at Vanderbilt University, said the source of electricity for electric vehicles remains a concern but emissions \"continue to drop as the electricity generation mix shifts towards sources with lower emissions.\"\n\nMore:Fact check: Origin stories for popular phrases are nothing more than urban legends\n\nElectric vehicles also contribute less to climate change and smog than traditional cars because they produce fewer direct emissions, according to the U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.\n\nPollutants from cars that use gas \"directly or indirectly harm human health and the environment,\" Lin said.\n\n\"This benefit (of electric vehicles) is important because vehicles move around with the population, including vulnerable ones such as elderly, children and pregnant women,\" Lin said.\n\nShifting pollutants away from tailpipe emissions to a central location, like a power plant, makes the pollution easier to manage, Lin said.\n\nA National Renewable Energy Laboratory report in 2016 found that the U.S. transportation sector consumed more than 13 million barrels of petroleum a day in 2014.\n\n\"Widespread use of alternative fuels and advanced vehicles, including plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), can reduce our national dependence on petroleum and decrease the emissions that impact our air quality and public health,\" the report says.\n\nIt starts with lithium\n\nThe Facebook posts mentions a mammoth amount of resources needed for electric car batteries. It's referring to the sourcing of lithium.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are used every day by millions of people across the globe in most portable electronics, like phones and laptops.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey found in 2017 that electric cars accounted for 60% of the global lithium-ion battery market. An electric car battery isn't just one giant battery. It consists of a heap of smaller batteries that make up the whole thing.\n\nLithium can be highly reactive and is most frequently found in salts and other compounds. It is typically mined and can be sourced from brine in salt flats.\n\nDuring extraction, lithium can create deadly pollution, as seen in 2016 when it leaked into a river, killing fish and poisoning yaks in China. The dead animals sparked protests by locals.\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, Australia produces the most lithium. The country in 2019 mined 42,000 tons, followed by Chile, which produced 18,000 tons. The agency estimates that nearly 80 million tons of lithium exist on the planet.\n\nSince most electronics rely on it for batteries, the need for lithium will only expand as the world demand rises nearly 9% annually.\n\nThe DOE acknowledges that the industry still has steps to take to reduce the cost of the batteries and extend the life of them, including through recycling. Forbes reported that lithium-ion batteries are recycle-friendly and can be made into even more batteries.\n\nA scientific report published in the journal Nature found that given the significant impact lithium-ion batteries have on the environment and their growing popularity, \"recycling is not only necessary, but also urgent.\"\n\nRel:Scads of new electric, hybrid vehicles on way\n\nThe researchers stated if the batteries aren't recycled correctly or reused, their good for the environment is wasted.\n\nThey said they successfully tested closed-loop recycling with electric car batteries, a type of recycling in which the item is turned into more of the same thing, like recycling paper that eventually is produced into more paper. Researchers found that recycling car batteries on a large scale was \"very promising.\"\n\nAs electric vehicles become more popular, the battery-recycling market could expand. Research from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that lithium-ion car batteries may last up to 15 years in moderate climates.\n\nThe user who posted the claim did not reply to a USA TODAY request for comment.\n\nOur ruling: Missing context\n\nThe post is misleading and leaves out important context about how electric cars are built. It fails to consider that life cycle emissions for an electric vehicle are typically lower than those of traditional cars. As electric cars become more popular, experts believe they'll become greener, as will energy sources.

Frohlich and Liz Blossom\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nDespite long-standing warnings of a climate emergency as well as efforts by some nations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the worldwide use of fossil fuels – and with it global greenhouse gas emissions – grew last year.\n\nA number of potential disaster scenarios caused by climate change remain well documented. And yet, increasing demand for coal, oil, and natural gas drove the increase in GHG emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nTo determine the countries emitting the most CO2, 24/7 Wall St. ranked countries based on territorial emissions – millions of metric tons of carbon emitted from fossil fuels and cement production within a country's borders – in 2017 published by the Global Carbon Project 2018. This report and our analysis focuses only on fossil fuel-generated CO2 emissions, the single most important greenhouse gas and by far the largest contributor to anthropogenic warming.\n\nClimate refugee crises:They're happening right now. Here's how you can help\n\nCement, in particular, and natural resources extraction and processing in general, contribute massively to CO2 emissions. A recent report found that the majority of carbon emissions are created by such processes, even before any fuel is burned.\n\nResource extraction has more than tripled since 1970 and continues to accelerate, even though the population has only doubled in that time, according to the United Nations’ Global Resources Outlook 2019. Perhaps it is no surprise that the countries emitting the most CO2 are also often among the countries that control the world’s oil.\n\n25. Malaysia\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 254.6 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 8.1 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 241.9%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 34.3 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 31.6 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $26,824\n\nMalaysia has experienced tremendous economic growth in the last four decades, moving rapidly from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy. This expansion has meant more factories, automobiles, and power plants, all of which enormously escalated energy demands.\n\nThat demand has pushed Malaysia's CO2 emissions to 254.58 million metric tons, or 8.1 metric tons per person in 2017, a 241.9% rise over 25 years.\n\nAt the end of 2017, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak set a target of a 45% reduction from 2005 emissions levels by 2030, and for the country to be carbon neutral by 2050. Emissions, however, continue to rise as Malaysia finds itself unable to make the larger efforts needed to wean itself off fossil fuels, particularly cheap – but dirty – coal.\n\n24. Taiwan\n\n• C2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 271.5 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 11.5 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 89.4%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): Not available\n\n• Population (2017): 23.5 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): Not available\n\nMost of the countries emitting the most CO2 are also among the top emitters on a per capita basis, and Taiwan is no exception. The 271.53 million metric tons of CO2 from fossil fuels, or about 11.5 metric tons per person, are each in the highest 25 for countries worldwide.\n\nTaiwan is attempting to move away from nuclear power, a zero emission source of energy but one with many other issues – environmental and otherwise. In doing so, however, the nation has increased its dependency on coal, failing to move forward with alternative energy technology.\n\n23. Spain\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 281.4 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 6.0 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 12.4%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 37.2 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 46.6 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $34,269\n\nThough it has a much larger GDP than Taiwan and twice the population, Spain's CO2 output is only slightly higher. CO2 emissions from Spain have fallen since their peak in 2005, but they are up by 12.4% compared to 1992. Spain's CO2 emissions ranked ninth in 2017 out of the 51 European and Central Asian countries examined.\n\nThe country's recently-elected Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is determined to make Spain a leader in GHG emissions reductions within the European Union and has proposed a plan that would end the burning of fossil fuels by 2050.\n\n22. Kazakhstan\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 292.6 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 16.2 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 25.6%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 71.4 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 18.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $24,079\n\nKazakhstan's carbon dioxide output is immense, particularly relative to its population, with a per capita emission rate of 16.2 metric tons in 2017. Carbon emissions from the country's energy sector amount to 85% of its annual GHG emissions, but the country has been slow to act on the need to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and put alternative energy sources in place. Instead, it is focused on updating its coal plants and creating more natural gas plant capacity, carrying its reliance on fossil fuels into the future.\n\n21. Poland\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 326.6 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 8.6 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -10.2%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 65.1 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 38.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $27,344\n\nThough Poland reduced its carbon output by 10.2% between 1992 and 2017, the country's CO2 emissions are the 21st largest in the world and sixth largest in Europe.\n\nPoland has not shown a great deal of enthusiasm for climate measures. A law that took effect in 2016 may be discouraging the development of wind energy and. In climate negotiations, Poland has put forth a set of priorities above climate policy, including reducing poverty and hunger and increasing energy security. Still, because of its heavy historical dependence on coal, there are clear paths to carbon reduction in Poland as coal is phased out.\n\n20. Thailand\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 330.84 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 4.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 206.1%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 106.5 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 69.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $16,279\n\nThailand's GDP quadrupled and its CO2 emissions tripled between 1992 and 2017. Thailand's energy production from coal expanded by 31.6% between 2006 and 2016 – even as it made a major shift to natural gas.\n\nThailand has announced in the last few years aggressive goals in reducing its carbon output. Most recently, the country said it will reduce its GHG emissions by 20% by 2030 through increased alternative energy production and improved mass transit.\n\n19. Italy\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 355.45 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 5.9 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -19.1%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 35.2 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 60.5 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $35,343\n\nItaly's carbon dioxide emissions peaked in 2004 at 495.5 million metric tons, and then declined to 348.5 million metric tons in 2014. While Italy's CO2 emissions ticked up in 2017, they were down 19.1% from 1992.\n\nThe country reduced its GHG emissions by significantly increasing renewable sources of energy. Between 2006 and 2016, Italy's energy generation from renewable sources rose 17.0% annually from 3.4 million to 15.5 million tons of oil equivalent.\n\n18. France\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 356.3 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 5.3 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -14.9%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 81.2 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 67.1 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $38,808\n\nFrance and Spain have similar levels of per capita emissions, though France has a higher GDP per capita. Because of France's reliance on nuclear power over the past 40 years, it has produced relatively low, and declining, CO2 emissions. Close to 80% of electricity produced in France comes from nuclear power, the highest such share of any country in the world.\n\nIn recent years, France has also reduced its carbon footprint with a strong move toward renewable energy. According to British Petroleum's (BP) June 2018 Statistics Review of World Energy, energy generation in France from renewable sources rose by 19.9% a year between 2006 and 2016.\n\n17. United Kingdom\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 384.7 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 5.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -35.2%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 59.0 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 66.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $39,884\n\nWhile the United Kingdom ranks among the top emitters of carbon, it has significantly reduced its carbon emissions – by about 35% between 1992 and 2017. Only a few countries in the world can claim any reduction at all, and most of them not nearly the reduction that the U.K. has managed.\n\nThe biggest reason for the U.K.'s success in reducing its carbon output is the country's phasing out of coal-fired power in favor of natural gas and renewables. Other factors include improved energy efficiency from both the residential sector and industry.\n\n16. Australia\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 413.1 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 16.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 45.0%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 125.6 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 24.6 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $44,643\n\nWith less than half the population of Great Britain, Australia also had less than half the carbon emissions of the U.K. in 1992. By 2017, the relative carbon output shifted dramatically, with Australia emitting more than the U.K. as Britain reduced its use of fossil fuels.\n\nOver the last decade, Australia's emissions from energy production have leveled off, but emissions from industrial and transportation sources have increased significantly. Though Australia has added to its renewable energy resources, it is still planning a new coal-fired power plant and may have a difficult time meeting its Paris Agreement obligations.\n\n15. Turkey\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 447.9 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 5.5 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 181.6%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 78.9 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 80.7 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $25,135\n\nTurkey greatly increased its CO2 emissions over the 25 years through 2017, from 159.1 million metric tons to 447.9 million metric tons – an increase of 181.6%. This is only partially explained by the significant increase in population – a nearly 45% population growth between 1992 and 2017. Economic growth in Turkey has also contributed to growing CO2 emissions, with the economy tripling in size over the last two decades.\n\nThe country, however, is heavily reliant on coal for energy. Its lack of a clear target or cohesive plan for greenhouse gas reduction is one roadblock to its entry into the EU.\n\n14. South Africa\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 456.3 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 8.0 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 51.6%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 63.2 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 56.7 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $12,294\n\nSouth Africa has had a similar percentage population growth as Turkey but with a much smaller increase in CO2 emissions, partly due to a slowing economy. Like Turkey, it is heavily reliant on coal for its energy, but last August new President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a plan to close 35 of the country's 42 coal plants by 2050 and shift to natural gas and renewable energy. Even considering South Africa's social problems, particularly poverty and inequality, Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a consortium of research organizations tracking worldwide progress on climate action, has criticized the plan as \"highly insufficient\" for meeting the country's Paris Agreement goals.\n\n13. Brazil\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 476.1 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 2.3 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 118.0%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 477.1 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 209.3 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $14,137\n\nBrazil's greenhouse gas emission sources are very different from other high emission countries. In 2015, the country produced 61.8% of its electricity from hydroelectric sources, which while down from 92.4% in 1992, was still among the highest such shares of any country in the world. While hydroelectric sources contribute less to CO2 emissions than other sources, Brazil's CO2 emissions still rose by 118% over the 25 years through 2017. The country also has a massive output of methane – a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2.\n\nThe country's large spikes in total GHG emissions are the result of the agricultural sector and the loss of forested land, which functions as a \"carbon sink,\" absorbing CO2. While polls show that most Brazilians are concerned about climate change, the current administration appears to be deferential to agriculture interests and uninclined to curb deforestation. Deforestation of the Amazon climbed by 29% in 2016, resulting in nearly 2 million acres lost.\n\n12. Indonesia\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 486.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 1.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 139.0%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 223.3 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 264.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $11,189\n\nIndonesia looks a lot like Brazil and South Africa in its level of CO2 emissions, but its population is nearly the size of both countries' populations combined. All three countries have relatively low GDP per capita. But while Indonesia has the lowest GDP per capita of the three nations, its economy grew twice as fast between 1992 and 2017. This can provide some explanation for its greater increase in emissions during that time period than the other two countries.\n\nIndonesia's economy is likely to become even more carbon intensive with its growing middle class, automobile use, and energy demands, and with the government's focus on more coal-fired power plants instead of renewables.\n\n11. Mexico\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 490.3 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 3.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 46.7%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 116.7 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 129.2 million\n\n• DP per capita (2017): $17,331\n\nMexico emits about the same amount of carbon as Indonesia but with half the population. Until recently, Mexico had set aggressive climate change goals and had been on a path toward carbon reduction and cleaner energy. Today, the country's politics are moving it in a direction more in line with that of Indonesia, with renewable energy planning replaced with a comprehensive upgrading of aging fossil fuel plants and a heavy reliance on coal.\n\n10. Canada\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 572.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 15.6 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 22.2%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 106.8 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 36.7 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $44,018\n\nOut of the 25 top CO2 emitters, Canada has close to the highest per capita carbon emission rate at 15.6 metric tons. Largely to blame for this ignominious status is its huge landmass and dispersed population as well as the country's extreme temperatures – Canadians live energy-intensive lives. While some progress has been made in the development of renewable energy resources – which have nearly quadrupled since 2007 to the equivalent of 10 million tons of oil – efforts to curb CO2 have been undermined by huge subsidies to the coal and oil and gas industries, amounting to $3.3 billion annually, according to Environmental Defence, a Canadian environmental advocacy organization.\n\nThough the government insists Canada is on track to meet its Paris Agreement goal of reducing carbon emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030, projections show the country is behind.\n\n9. South Korea\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 616.1 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 12.0 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 118.3%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 32.6 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 51.5 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $35,938\n\nSouth Korea is responsible for 1.7% of the global carbon output, though South Koreans make up only 0.7% of the global population. With its fast-growing economy, GDP more than tripled and CO2 emissions more than doubled between 1992 and 2017, with more cars on the road and a growing demand for energy for residential use.\n\nKorea has pledged to reduce its GHG output by 37% by 2030, but at the same time, it has built only a tiny amount of alternative energy infrastructure and is planning to construct 20 new coal plants in the next three years.\n\n8. Saudi Arabia\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 635.0 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 19.3 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 122.8%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 62.9 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 32.9 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $48,986\n\nBetween 1992 and 2017, the population and economy of Saudi Arabia nearly doubled. With this phenomenal growth came phenomenal CO2 emissions growth of 122.8% over thE 25 year period.\n\nAs the world's largest oil producer, it is not surprising that virtually all of the country's energy comes from oil and gas, with a miniscule amount of 0.1% in 2017 from renewables. While Saudi Arabia was seen by many in the early 1990s as taking an obstructionist position toward international climate negotiations and skepticism toward climate science, it signed the Paris climate agreement, with the caveat that its economy must not suffer an \"abnormal burden.\"\n\n7. Iran\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 672.3 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 8.3 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 196.2%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 121.3 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 81.2 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $18,983\n\nLike Saudi Arabia, Iran's population growth was fast, at nearly 40%, and in its GDP more than doubled from 1992 to 2017. This growth was accompanied by a similar increase in CO2 emissions. The similarities end here. Iran's GDP per capita is less than half that of Saudi Arabia, and it has been struggling under economic sanctions for many years. Also, unlike its neighbor across the Persian Gulf, Iran was an early signer of the Paris Agreement and has made pursuing a green economy a priority. It has pledged to slash emissions and reform its energy sector, having received promises from the EU for help with technology.\n\nClimate change has had a strong impact on Iran, which has faced numerous ecological problems tied to the climate emergency – from shrinking lakes and rivers to floods and droughts. Lake Urmia, the largest in the Middle East, may be completely dry in six to nine years.\n\n6. Germany\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 799.4 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 9.7 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -17.3%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 55.7 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 82.7 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $45,446\n\nGermany is showing progress in carbon reduction, having lowered its output by over 17% between 1992 and 2016. The country also has the most aggressive plan for further reductions than any other EU nation. While many climate scientists argue for the continuation, and even expansion, of nuclear power because of its zero emissions, Germany is phasing out its nuclear plants. While CO2 emissions from most countries on this list have increased substantially between 1992 and 2017, Germany's CO2 emissions declined by 17.3% over that period.\n\nThe country, however, is still heavily dependent on coal – and most of its plants burn lignite, the dirtiest coal. In 2015, Germany generated 44.3% of its electricity from coal sources.\n\n5. Japan\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 1,205.1 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 9.5 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 2.4%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 39.0 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 126.8 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $39,011\n\nJapan's CO2 emissions peaked in the three years following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, reaching 1,314 million metric tons of CO2 in 2013. Emissions have since been reduced to pre-2011 levels as the country has increased its use of renewables – now about 5% of its energy mix. Still, Japan is heavily reliant on oil and is criticized for its promotion of coal and technology to reduce CO2 emissions from coal.\n\n4. Russian Federation\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 1,692.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 11.7 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -15.1%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 545.8 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 144.5 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $24,790\n\nCoal remains one of the world's largest sources of energy production. Approximately 40% of electricity produced worldwide came from coal sources in 2015. Russia is somewhat of an exception, relying heavily over the past 25 years on natural gas for electricity production – gas was the source of roughly half of the country's electricity production in both 1992 and 2015. The nation's coal production, however, has also surged over the same period. Russia is the sixth largest coal-producing nation in the world, and coal production has risen by 70% since the late 1990s to 373 million metric tons in 2015. According to the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project's Carbon Majors Database, the growth has been driven largely by the coal industry's expansion into Southwest Siberia, where the Kuznetsk coal basin is located.\n\nRussia's population is 2.8% smaller than it was 25 years ago, one of only two countries on this list to report a population decline since 1992. This could partially account for the 15.1% reduction in overall CO2 emissions from Russia.\n\n3. India\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 2,466.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 1.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 253.0%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 636.4 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 1.34 billion\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $6,514\n\nAs is generally the case in the countries emitting the most CO2, a small group of companies accounts for a huge portion of emissions in India. Notably, state-owned Coal India alone emitted the equivalent of just over 1 billion metric tons of CO2 in 2015, or 2.4% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions. This has placed the company among the world's five corporations emitting the most CO2, according to the Carbon Majors Database.\n\nWhile many of the world's large national CO2 emitters have in recent decades reduced their reliance on coal as a source of electricity, India's coal usage has risen – from 68% of electricity production in 1992 to 75% in 2015.\n\n2. USA\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 5,269.5 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 16.2 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 1.8%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 499.8 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 325.1 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $54,471\n\nThe United States was the world's largest national CO2 emitter until 2006, when China surpassed U.S. emissions that year of 6,019 million metric tons of CO2. And while U.S. emissions have declined since, China's emissions have steadily increased.\n\nU.S. electricity production from coal sources has dropped in recent decades, from over half in 1992 to about a third of electricity production in 2015. At the same time, however, the United States has become the world's largest producer of crude oil and significantly ramped up natural gas production and usage – though natural gas use results in relatively less CO2 emissions, the methane output during its production and destructive extraction techniques are by no means more environmentally friendly. Over the 25-year period through 2015, U.S. electricity production from natural gas sources grew from 13.1% to 31.9% of total electricity generated. In 2012, the latest data year, nearly 500 million metric tons of methane, a far more harmful GHG, was emitted by the United States, the fourth highest amount of countries on this list.\n\n1. China\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 9,838.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 7.1 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 270.3%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 1,752.3 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 1.39 billion\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $15,309\n\nWith the world's largest population and for decades one of the fastest growing economies, China is far and away the world's top CO2 emitter. Close to 10,000 million metric tons of CO2 from burning fossil fuel were emitted by the superpower in 2017. On a per capita basis, China's CO2 emissions of 7.1 metric tons per person trail that of most countries on this list but still rank in the top 50 worldwide.\n\nDriving China's CO2 emissions is the nation's massive coal production. China's generation of electricity from coal has dropped slightly from 75% in 1992 to 70% in 2015. Still, overall coal production has tripled since 2000 to nearly 4,000 million metric tons – approximately half of all global coal production.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Thursday, March 10, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\nA Russian airstrike devastated a maternity and children's hospital complex in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, burying women and children under debris and injuring more than a dozen, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe Mariupol City Council posted video on social media of the battered buildings.\n\n\"The destruction is enormous,\" the council said in a statement. \"The building of the medical institution where the children were treated recently was completely destroyed. Information about the affected children is being clarified.\"\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said people were trapped in the wreckage after the strike. He once again urged the West to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine.\n\n\"Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?\" Zelenskyy said in a Twitter post. \"Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday reiterated that the U.S. and its allies won't establish a no-fly zone because it could drag the alliance further into the war.\n\nThe West has hit Russia with heavy economic sanctions, and on Wednesday the Kremlin threatened retaliation, also possibly in the form of sanctions, for the \"economic war\" it accused the U.S. of waging.\n\nRussia has repeatedly tried to rationalize its attack on Ukraine and has asserted that the U.S. is creating chemical and biological weapons in the country. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki issued a troubling warning Wednesday evening that in the aftermath of the claims, \"we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.\"\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►The price of gas across much of Europe has risen above 2 euros per liter — the equivalent of about $8.33 per gallon.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said leaders would want to consult with the Biden administration first.\n\nHouse approval of the measure came the day after Biden said he would sign an order banning imports of all Russian energy products in the latest effort to ratchet up sanctions over the invasion. Biden said he made the decision in consultation with European allies but added they may not be in a position to join the U.S. in banning Russian energy imports.

Other funds went to help U.S. federal agencies enforce sanctions against Russia and protect against cyber threats.\n\nThe amount surpassed the $10 billion President Joe Biden requested from Congress, but the spending package still has to pass the Senate.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had to concede another $15.6 billion that was supposed to go toward combating the COVID pandemic in order to rush the aid through for Ukraine. Both Democrats and Republicans will achieve wins in the $1.5 trillion package if it goes through the Senate.\n\nWhite House warns Russia may use chemical weapons in Ukraine\n\nThe White House issued a troubling warning Wednesday evening that Russia might attempt to use chemical weapons in its siege of Ukraine.\n\nThe warning came from White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki after an array of claims made by the Kremlin to justify its invasion of Ukraine, including the long debunked assertion that the U.S. was creating chemical and biological weapons in the country. Without evidence, China similarly echoed the claim.\n\nPsaki, in a Twitter thread, responded in detail to the claims and warned it was part of a \"pattern\" by Russia to accuse the West \"of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.\"\n\n\"Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,\" Psaki said.\n\nRussia's accusations echo the country's disinformation tactics used in Syria after chemical weapons were used to kill more than 1,400, including children, according to Andrew Weber, a former Pentagon official who spent decades working for the U.S. government to counter such weapons and helped in the effort to destroy Syrian chemical weapons stockpiles.\n\nWeber, in an interview with Mother Jones, said it was possible that Putin might use nuclear weapons in the conflict. But more possible, Weber said, would be that Putin \"would use chemical or biological weapons.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department similarly said the allegations were part of a propaganda effort by the Kremlin by \"inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions,\" spokesman Ned Price said, adding the U.S. does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.\n\nFact check: False claim of US biolabs in Ukraine tied to Russian disinformation campaign\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nVP Kamala Harris in Poland after US rejects fighter jet plan for Ukraine\n\nVice President Kamala Harris’ trip to staunch ally Poland is now a clean-up mission. A day after the United States declined Poland's surprise proposal to provide Soviet-built MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. to give to Ukraine, Harris will meet with the country’s top leaders in Warsaw, where she will need to try to smooth over the controversy.\n\nHarris arrived in Warsaw Wednesday, hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Polish leaders that the United States does not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian Air Force, according to Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby.\n\nHarris will meet with Ukrainians who have fled to Poland and talk to service members in the U.S. and Polish militaries. She will also confer with allies on what more can be done to put pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n-Maureen Groppe, Josh Meyer and Rebecca Morin\n\nAttack on Chernihiv may constitute war crime, Amnesty International says\n\nAcross much of Ukraine on Wednesday, efforts to rescue civilians from grim conditions were once again underway. In the Ukraine capital of Kyiv, air raid sirens blared as officials bolstered defenses in key cities where Russian troops have laid siege, trapping civilians inside with little or no food, water or medicine.\n\nIn the southern city of Mariupol, the artillery attack that devastated a hospital complex was just the latest tragedy. Days of shelling have largely cut residents of off from the outside world and forced them to scavenge for food and water.\n\nIn the northern city of Chernihiv, a Russian airstrike that reportedly killed 47 civilians last week may constitute a war crime, Amnesty International said Wednesday following an investigation into the attack.\n\n\"This was a merciless, indiscriminate attack on people as they went about their daily business in their homes, streets and shops,” said Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Director.\n\nMayor Vladyslav Atroshenko said two-thirds of the almost 300,000 residents are without heat and hot water. He said 60 civilians have died and 400 were wounded – but that the city is holding strong.\n\nNo-fly zone remains a non-starter for US, NATO\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken once again rejected a no-fly zone Wednesday when asked during a joint press conference with the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss. Both Blinken and Truss said even limited involvement of the U.S. or NATO would only escalate the war.\n\nPutting “American servicemembers in Ukraine, on Ukrainian territory, or soil, or American pilots into Ukrainian airspace – whether on a full or on a limited basis – would almost certainly lead to direct conflict between the United States, between NATO and Russia,” Blinken said. “And that would expand the conflict, it would prolong it, it would make it much more deadlier than it already is.”\n\nTruss noted that the U.K. had agreed to supply Ukraine with additional defensive weapons. She said that was the best way to help Ukraine counter Russia’s attacks, not creating a no-fly zone.\n\n\"What we're looking at is making sure that the Ukrainians are able to defend their own country with the best possible selection of anti-tank weapons and anti-air defense systems,\" Truss said.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nWill Russia's rich bail on Putin's war?\n\nVacated Mediterranean villas, marooned superyachts in search of accepting ports and billions in assets seized or devalued are just some of the headaches Russia's kleptocratic elite now face over President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The so-called Russian oligarchs who surround the Kremlin – a small cadre of several dozen men who have made their riches thanks to connections to Putin's government – are seen by U.S. and European officials as key to curbing the Russian invasion of Ukraine and potentially building a post-Putin Russia.\n\n\"Part of why I think it's so important to go after the Russian oligarchs and the rest of the elite is that suddenly a bunch of oligarchs had to get on private jets, flee Monaco and the south of France and other places they have their homes and head back to Moscow,\" said Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

Senior officials say they are confident that cryptocurrencies can't serve as an effective workaround for sanctions the U.S. and its allies have imposed on Russian elites and financial intuitions, especially the Russian Central Bank.\n\nRussian banks and citizens have been rushing to transfer their assets into cryptocurrency as the ruble tumbles in value under severe Western sanctions meant to curtail the Kremlin's war machine.\n\nKremlin says US 'economic war' could bring retaliation\n\nThe U.S. is waging a \"de facto economic war\" and Russia could react with retaliatory actions, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. Peskov was commenting on the U.S. ban on Russian energy imports and a comment on the war by Victoria Nuland, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, that the U.S. \"must ensure that this Ukraine gambit is a strategic failure for Putin.\"\n\nThe U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and a scores of other nations have also introduced sanctions against Russian legal entities and private individuals.\n\n\"The U.S., undoubtedly, declared an economic war against Russia and they are waging this war,\" Peskov said. He said Russia will do \"what in the best way corresponds to our interests\" but gave no details on the possible retaliatory sanctions.\n\nChernobyl loses power; Ukraine says radioactive leak possible\n\nThe Chernobyl Nuclear Plant, occupied by Russian troops for several days, has been disconnected from the power grid and is a threat to leak radioactive substances, Ukraine's Ukrenergo National Power Company said. Repairs are impossible because of enemy fire and the military presence, the utility said.\n\nThe state-run nuclear company Energoatom said radioactive substances could be released from the plant because it cannot properly cool spent nuclear fuel. The International Atomic Energy Agency, however, said the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water are \"sufficient for effective heat removal\" without access to electricity\n\nThe plant, the site of one of the world's worst nuclear disasters in 1986, has not produced power in several years. Decommissioning has not been completed, however, and authorities say there are about 20,000 spent fuel assemblies at Chernobyl that cannot be kept cool amid a power outage.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED AT CHERNOBYL? What to know about nuclear disaster\n\nMcDonald’s, Starbucks, Coke and GE suspend business in Russia\n\nMcDonald’s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and General Electric – ubiquitous global brands and symbols of U.S. corporate might – all announced Tuesday they were temporarily suspending their business in Russia in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,” McDonald’s President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an open letter to employees. The Chicago-based burger giant said it will temporarily close 850 stores but continue paying its 62,000 employees in Russia.\n\nMcDonald’s is likely to take the biggest financial hit. Unlike Starbucks and other fast food companies, like KFC and Pizza Hut, whose Russian locations are owned by franchisees, McDonald’s owns 84% of its Russian stores.\n\nStarbucks on Tuesday said it would temporarily close 130 Russian stores owned and operated by a franchisee, after earlier saying it would be donating profits from those stores to humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine.

Click here to follow the latest updates and news from Monday, Feb. 28, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\n***\n\nWhile Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s nuclear weapons on high alert, more support poured in for Ukraine in its ongoing effort to fend off Russian forces, which on Sunday reached the second-largest Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.\n\nThe European Union announced unprecedented new actions against Russia, outlining plans to close its airspace to Russian airlines, fund a weapons purchase to assist Ukraine and ban some pro-Kremlin media outlets, while the Associated Press reported the United States approved the delivery of anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine.\n\nWestern powers in support of Ukraine could soon be joined by Switzerland, an oftentimes neutral country that on Monday is set to review potential sanctions and asset freezes against Russia, said President Ignazio Cassis via Reuters. Cassis said it was “very probable” the country would follow suit, the outlet reported.\n\nThe office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday said a delegation would meet with Russian officials for talks near the Belarus border. The discussion was expected to happen Monday morning local time, according to Ukraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin via CNN.\n\nAlso Monday, both the 193-member U.N. General Assembly and the smaller, 15-member Security Council plan to hold emergency meetings on Russia’s invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin’s order to make his nuclear weapons more ready for launch – made Sunday in response to “aggressive statements” by leading NATO powers and economic sanctions by the West – represents an unnecessary and dangerous move, according to the Pentagon.\n\nA senior Defense Department official said Russia is under no threat from the United States and its NATO allies. The Pentagon is confident it can protect the U.S. and its allies, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is heading towards a fifth day of fighting. According to the Associated Press, Russian troops entered Kharkiv on Sunday, where videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across the city and a vehicle burning on the street. Residents were urged to stay inside.\n\nThe troops in Kharkiv arrived after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine, targeting airfields and fuel facilities. Two large explosions rocked an area south of the capital just before 1 a.m. local time. Zelenskyy’s office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport and the other blast hit an oil depot about 25 miles south of the capital, according to the mayor of Vasylkiv via the AP. Russian forces also blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, according to the Ukrainian president's office.\n\nUkrainian officials said Sunday the civilian death toll has reached 352.\n\nA few things to catch you up on:\n\nTHE NEWS COMES TO YOU: Get the latest updates on the situation in Ukraine.

It was unclear exactly what share of Russia’s estimated $640 billion hard currency coffers will be paralyzed by the move, but European officials said that at least half of it will be affected.\n\nThe move will dramatically raise pressure on the ruble by undermining the financial authorities’ ability to conduct hard currency interventions to prevent the ruble from sinking further and triggering high inflation. The ruble has sharply dived in early Monday trading.\n\nThe Central Bank also ordered a slew of measures to help the banks cope with the crisis by infusing more cash into the system and easing restrictions for banking operations. At the same time, it temporarily barred non-residents from selling the government obligations to help ease the pressure on ruble from panicky foreign investors eager to cash out.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:The enigma of Vladimir Putin: What do we really know about Russia's leader?\n\nDalai Lama pleas for peace in Ukraine\n\nThe Dalai Lama on Monday pleaded for peace and \"mutual understanding,\" and said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"War is outdated – non-violence is the only way. We need to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity by considering other human beings as brothers and sisters,\" the spiritual leader said on his website. \"This is how we will build a more peaceful world.\"\n\nThe Nobel peace prize winner also said any problems and disagreements are best resolved through dialogue. \"Genuine peace comes about through mutual understanding and respect for each other's well-being,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he hopes peace is swiftly restored.\n\n\"We must not lose hope,\" he said. \"The 20th century was a century of war and bloodshed. The 21st century must be a century of dialogue.\"\n\n-- Terry Collins\n\nTwo United Nations sessions scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N.’s two major bodies -- the 193-nation General Assembly and the more powerful 15-member Security Council -- will hold separate meetings Monday on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a reflection of widespread international demands for an immediate cease-fire and escalating concern for the plight of millions of Ukrainians caught up in the war.\n\nThe Security Council gave a green light Sunday for the first emergency session of the General Assembly in decades. It will give all U.N. members an opportunity to speak about the war Monday and vote on a resolution later in the week that U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said would “hold Russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the U.N. Charter.”\n\nFrench Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere announced that the Security Council will hold a meeting Monday afternoon on the humanitarian impact of Russia’s invasion, a session sought by French President Emmanuel Macron to ensure the delivery of aid to growing numbers of those in need in Ukraine.\n\nBoth meetings follow Russia’s veto Friday of a Security Council resolution demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. The vote was 11-1, with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nMore:Ukraine athletes defend country, demand sanctions for Russia\n\nU.S. Embassy in Ukraine: departing the country may take up to 30 hours\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ukraine is now urging U.S citizens in Ukraine to try leaving using private transportation options as leaving could in some cases take more than 30 hours.\n\nThe embassy said Sunday “conditions may deteriorate” in various parts of the country without any warning due to the escalating Russian invasion.\n\n“Careful consideration should be made to routes and the risks of travel because Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations have been destroyed. Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some,” the embassy said on its website.\n\nFurthermore, embassy officials say that border crossings into neighboring Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova are overwhelmed.\n\n“Some are experiencing extremely long wait times (well over 30 hours in some cases),” the embassy said. “We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross.”\n\nEmbassy officials also offered a series of tips including bringing enough food, water and warm clothing. They also urge citizens to carry hard copies of important documents as the U.S. government will not be able to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nMore:Satellite images show damaged airport in Hostomel following strikes\n\nRussian ruble sinks in early trading\n\nThe ruble sank nearly 26% against the U.S. dollar early Monday after Western nations moved to block Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system.\n\nThe ruble was trading at a record low 105.27 per dollar, down from about 84 per dollar late Friday.\n\nOver the weekend, Japan joined the moves by the U.S. and other western nations to impose more sanctions against Russia.\n\nRestrictions on the Russian central bank target its access to more than $600 billion in reserves the Kremlin has at its disposal. They hinder Russia’s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value.\n\nSanctions announced earlier had taken the Russian currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:What sanctions does Russia face? Here's a list by country\n\nUS official: Belarus may join Ukraine invasion\n\nA senior U.S. intelligence official says Belarus is expected to send troops into Ukraine as soon as Monday to fight alongside Russian forces that invaded Ukraine last week.\n\nBelarus has been providing support for Russia’s war effort but so far has not taken a direct part in the conflict.\n\nThe American official has direct knowledge of current U.S. intelligence assessments and says the decision by Belarus’ leader on whether to bring Belarus further into the war depends on talks between Russia and Ukraine happening in the coming days. The official spoke anonymously to discuss the sensitive information.\n\nRussian forces have encountered strong resistance from Ukraine defenders, and U.S. officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult, and slower, than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:There may be risk, but the U.S. will likely keep arming Ukraine even if Russia takes Kyiv\n\nRussia rendering Facebook unusable in some places\n\nRussia has apparently rendered Facebook largely unusable across leading Russian telecommunications providers amid rising friction between Moscow and the social media platform.\n\nThe London-based internet monitor NetBlocks reports that Facebook’s network of content-distribution servers in Russia was so badly restricted Sunday that “content no longer loads, or loads extremely slowly making the platforms unusable.”\n\nRussian telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor on Friday announced plans to “partially restrict” access to Facebook. That same day, Facebook’s head of security policy had said the company was barring Russian state media from running ads or otherwise profiting on its platform anywhere in the world.\n\nFacebook says it has also refused a request by the Kremlin not to run fact checks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the platform for users inside Russia.\n\nNetBlocks reported earlier that access to Twitter was similarly restricted Saturday. That was a day after Twitter said it was temporarily halting ads in both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe Twitter and Facebook restrictions can be circumvented inside Russia using VPN software, just as users do in mainland China.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nCanada will investigate Russian flight violating airspace ban\n\nCanada said it will launch an investigation into a Russian-based Aeroflot flight that entered Canadian airspace on Sunday and violated a ban on all Russian flights due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We are aware that Aeroflot flight 111 violated the prohibition put in place earlier today on Russian flights using Canadian airspace,\" Transport Canada said in a series of tweets. \"We are launching a review of the conduct of Aeroflot and the independent air navigation service provider, NAVCAN, leading up to this violation.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action and other measures to prevent future violations,\" the agency added.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Omar Alghabra, Canada's transport minister, that the country's airspace was closed to all Russian aircraft operators.\n\n\"We will hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked attacks against Ukraine,” Alghabra tweeted.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nBiden to hold a call with U.S. allies to discuss Ukraine, Russia\n\nPresident Joe Biden is scheduled to hold a call with U.S. allies on Monday morning to discuss the latest situation in Ukraine and their coordinated response, the White House said late Sunday.\n\nThe call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. ET. The call comes after Biden ordered the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from its stockpile to Ukraine on Friday.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Saturday that this third authorization for weapons shipments to Ukraine in less than a year was \"unprecedented.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nUkraine radioactive site in Kyiv struck by missiles, UN nuclear watchdog\n\nThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog says missiles have struck a radioactive waste disposal site in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. So far there are no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Ukrainian authorities informed his office about the overnight strike. Grossi said his agency expects to get the results of on-site radioactive monitoring soon.\n\nThe report comes a day after an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was damaged.\n\nSuch facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Grossi says the two incidents highlight a “very real risk.” Grossi said if the sites are damaged there could be “potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nJapanese billionaire to donate over $8 million to Ukraine\n\nJapanese billionaire Hiroshi “Mickey” Mikitani said he will donate over $8 million to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy.”\n\nMikitani, founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten Group Inc., said Sunday in a letter to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the donation of ¥1 billion (roughly $8.7 million) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence,” the Japan Times reported.\n\nMikitani said he met with Zelenskyy during a visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in 2019.\n\n“My thoughts are with you and Ukraine people,” Mikitani wrote in his letter. “I believe that the trampling of a peaceful and democratic Ukraine by unjustified force is a challenge to democracy.\n\n“I sincerely hope that Russia and Ukraine can resolve this issue peacefully and that Ukraine people can have peace again as soon as possible,” Mikitani added.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nRussia-Ukraine talks set for Monday\n\nThe office of Ukraine’s president confirmed that a delegation is set to meet with Russian officials as Moscow’s troops continue to target Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said on the Telegram messaging app that the two sides would meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border.\n\nABC and CNN, each citing Ukrainian officials, reported the talks would take place Monday, which matches a report from Russian state-owned news agency TASS that said the discussions would take place in the morning.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks. Ukrainian officials initially rejected the move, saying any talks should take place elsewhere than Belarus, where Russia has placed a large contingent of troops.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, expressed hope for prospective peace talks.\n\n\"We'll look forward to what comes out of those discussions,\" Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n– Associated Press, Jay Cannon and David Jackson\n\nBorrell: EU countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine\n\nEuropean Union countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine at the Kyiv government’s request to help it counter the Russian air and land assault, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Sunday, according to the AFP news service.\n\n\"We're going to provide even fighting jets. We're not talking about just ammunition. We are providing more important arms to go to a war,\" Borrell said at a news conference.\n\nThe military transfer appeared imminent, according to Alexandre Krauss, a senior advisor to the EU Parliament.\n\n“Flying in #Ukraine skies within the hour,” Krauss tweeted at 3:38 p.m. ET, citing Borrell’s announcement.\n\nAccording to Borrell, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had asked the EU for the planes.\n\nCiting a person familiar with the talks, the Wall Street Journal reported that “discussions are still ongoing” and that any planes would be supplied directly by EU member states and not funded through an arrangement announced earlier for the EU to finance weapons deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, announced earlier in the day, that EU members were “stepping up our support for Ukraine. For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack. We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin.”\n\nThe announcement came as satellite imagery showed a massive convoy of Russian military vehicles – with some estimates of 3.25 miles long – moving toward Kyiv and about 40 miles away.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy in Kyiv: $54 million in humanitarian assistance on the way\n\nThe U.S. is giving nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance for those affected by the Russian invasion, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv announced Sunday.\n\nThe funding, which comes as thousands of Ukrainians flee Russian invaders, was announced with \"the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians in mind,\" the embassy said in a statement. It includes nearly $26 million from the Department of State and $28 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries and U.N. officials believe up to 4 million people could leave if fighting continues.\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS to send anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine, AP reports\n\nThe U.S. for the first time has approved the direct delivery of Stinger missiles to Ukraine as part of a package approved by the White House on Friday, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe exact timing of delivery is not known, but officials say the U.S. is currently working on the logistics of the shipment. The officials agreed to discuss the development only if not quoted by name.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS:There may be risk, but the US will likely keep arming Ukraine even if Russia takes Kyiv\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of Germany’s announcement that it will send 500 Stinger missiles and other weapons and supplies to Ukraine.\n\nThe high-speed Stingers are very accurate and are used to shoot down helicopters and other aircraft. Ukrainian officials have been asking for more of the powerful weapons.\n\nEstonia has also been providing Ukraine with Stingers since January, and had to get U.S. permission in order to do that.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNeutral Switzerland 'probable' to hit Russia with financial sanctions, president says\n\nAfter days of fence-sitting, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said on Sunday it was \"very probable\" that neutral Switzerland would follow the European Union’s lead and sanction Russia and freeze Russian assets in the country.\n\nReuters reported that Cassis, who was interviewed on French-language Swiss public television, said the nation's seven-member Federal Council would meet Monday and review recommendations by finance and economy officials.\n\n\"It is very probable that the government will decide to do so tomorrow, but I cannot anticipate decisions not yet taken,\" Cassis said, via Reuters.\n\nSwitzerland, a global financial hub and commodities trading center – has so far resisted calls for it to levy sanctions and possibly freeze Russian assets, especially after the EU and U.S. announced sanctions.\n\n“The civilized, democratic world has to stand up to the biggest threat to European security and stability since the Second World War,” Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for EU external affairs, said on Friday. “It affects not only Ukraine. It affects Europe. Switzerland is part of Europe. So we expect our partner, our neighbor, our ally to follow suit in standing up for defending the principles on which our communities and countries are based.”\n\nThe oft-neutral country's potential move comes as a surprise to some.\n\n\"Switzerland to sanction Russia! Holy crap. A country that was neutral against the literal Nazis. Neutral no more!\" tweeted Paul Massaro, a counter-corruption advisor to the U.S. Congress.\n\nIt was not known immediately how many wealthy Russian elites, especially oligarchs close to Putin, have stashed money in Swiss banks, known for their strong privacy firewalls. But various leaks of banking documents over the years suggest they have a sizable amount invested in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2018, Swiss banks reportedly frozen $1 billion in the accounts of one oligarch alone – Russian metals tycoon Viktor Vekselberg – over fears that they could be fined for doing business with him after Washington levied sanctions against the businessman, the Moscow Times reported at the time.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy urges Americans in Russia to consider leaving 'immediately'\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow said Sunday that American citizens “should consider departing Russia immediately” because of the dramatic drop-off in airline service in and out of the country.\n\n“An increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines,” a security alert posted to the embassy’s website states. “U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available.”\n\nThe guidance comes after the EU's move to close its airspace to Russian airlines. Russian airline Aeroflot says it cancelled all flights to Europe.\n\nThe State Department had already advised Americans not to travel to Russia because of its aggression against Ukraine, as well as the potential harassment of U.S. citizens in the country and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUN emergency session scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has voted for the 193-member General Assembly to hold an emergency session on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Monday.\n\nThe vote on Sunday to authorize an emergency meeting was 11 in favor, Russia opposed, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. That was the exact same vote on a resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. But in that case, Russia used its veto and the resolution was defeated.\n\nUkrainian U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya asked for the General Assembly meeting to be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution, initiated by the U.S. and adopted in November 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the Soviet Union during the Korean War.\n\nThat resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUkraine civilian death toll hits 352, officials say\n\nThe civilian death toll from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has risen to 352, including 14 children, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal affairs said Sunday. The ministry said 1,684 people had been injured.\n\nThe United Nations had announced the civilian death toll had reached 240 by Saturday, but stressed that the actual figure was potentially \"considerably higher.”\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS urges Americans in Ukraine to find best exit routes\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine issued a new advisory Sunday, telling Americans to choose departure routes very carefully if they are trying to flee.\n\n“Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations has been destroyed,” the embassy said in a notice. “Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some.”\n\nMost border crossings into Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova “are severely backed up,” with extremely long wait times – in some cases, more than 30 hours, the embassy said.\n\n“We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross,” the note says. “Note that conditions at each border can change very quickly and wait times can increase at any time without warning.”\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUPS, FedEx halt services in Russia\n\nShipping giants FedEx and UPS have suspended services to Russia amid the country’s military assault on Ukraine.\n\nUPS said it had halted all international shipments to addresses in Russia as of Feb. 25. FedEx said it was “closely monitoring the situation” and had suspended inbound service to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nBoth companies had already stopped service to Ukraine, after Russian troops invaded the neighboring country. Russian troops have now advanced well into Ukrainian territory, reaching its second largest city and encircling the capital, Kyiv.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMcMaster: Putin got ‘more than he bargained for’\n\nFormer national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday that Ukrainians are doing a “tremendous job” defending the country against Russian military attacks.\n\n“I think Putin got a lot more than he bargained for. He's in a very difficult position. And I think anything we can do, obviously, financially, going after his international criminal enterprise with sanctions and so forth is important. But the support for Ukraine's ability to defend themselves is also important,” McMaster told Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe retired lieutenant general also said the seizure of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “not in the cards for the immediate future,” but acknowledged the next 72 hours are going to be “really critical.”\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nKyiv mayor: 'We are encircled'\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv's mayor is both filled with pride over his citizens' spirit and anxious about how long they can hold out.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.\n\n“We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,” he finally said. “Right now we are encircled.\"\n\nWhen Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.\n\nThe mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child.\n\nA Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside could be considered a saboteur.\n\n“We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,\" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian “saboteurs” were killed Saturday night.\n\nIn the last few days, long queues of people — both men and women — were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the capital, after authorities decided to distribute weapons freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists.\n\n“To be honest, we don't have 100% control,” said Klitschko. “We built this territorial defense in a short amount of time — but these are patriotic people.\"\n\n“Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,” he added.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nEU closing airspace to Russia\n\nThe top official in the European Union said the bloc will take unprecedented new steps after Russian President Vladimir Putin raised tensions with talk of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe EU will close its airspace to Russian airlines, including \"the private jets of oligarchs,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.\n\n\"For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” she added.\n\nThe EU will also ban pro-Kremlin media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, she said.\n\nThe European Commission's plans followed the announcement earlier in the day that Germany was committing 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and would keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on. The shift underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine was rewriting Europe’s post-World War II security and defense policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.\n\nThe EU’s plan to fund weapons purchases was unprecedented and would use millions of euros to help buy air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first aid kits.\n\n– Katie Wadington and AP\n\nOn nuclear deterrence:What is DEFCON? What's nuclear deterrence?

Mark Warner: Putin’s invasion a major ‘miscalculation'\n\nSen. Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Putin “totally underestimated” the resolve of the Ukrainians and the support building worldwide for the Ukrainian people, describing the Russian invasion so far as a major “miscalculation.”\n\n“Remarkably what he's also been able to do his unify the vast majority of us in the Senate, Democrats, Republicans alike,” Warner said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And he’s going to pay a high price.”\n\nWarner said Putin over the past few years became “more and more isolated.”\n\n“When you are an authoritarian leader, and you’re only hearing from people that want to say to the boss, hey, you're right. I think that leads to miscalculation. I think that is what has happened in the case of this invasion in Ukraine.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUS ambassador: No US 'boots on the ground' in Ukraine\n\nAs she made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made clear that the U.S. response to the invasion of Ukraine will not include American troops or air personnel.\n\n\"The president has made clear that we're not going to put boots on the ground,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nThomas-Greenfield said that mandate includes no patrols of any \"no-fly zone\" in the region.\n\nThe U.S. will provide whatever assistance it can to Ukraine, working with NATO partners, she said, but: \"We're not going to put American troops in danger. So that means we're not going to put American troops in the air as well. But we will work with the Ukrainians to give them the ability to defend themselves.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRussian troops stalled outside Kyiv\n\nThe main force of Russian assault aimed at Kyiv remained stalled Sunday about 18 miles from the city’s center, hindered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and Russia’s own problems providing fuel and supplies for its troops, according to a senior Defense Department official.\n\nThere are indications of some fighting inside Kyiv and that Russian troops in Ukrainian military uniforms have appeared there, said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nThe officials described Ukrainian resistance as stiff and creative around Kyiv and Kharkiv. Meantime, fuel shortages and logistics problems for Russian troops are most acute near Kharkiv.\n\nThe war is a major operation for Russia’s military, a complex mission that it does not have recent experience mounting, the official said. It’s unclear if the shortages in materials represent a failure in planning or execution. However, the official said Russian officers are expected to learn and adapt to its logistical problems.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, there are troubling indications that Russia is encircling the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, and could be planning to besiege it, the official said. There are increasing rocket attacks there, imprecise weapons that can kill civilians and damage infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Russian President Vladimir Putin has committed two-thirds of the combat forces he deployed against Ukraine is now inside the country, the official said.\n\nRussia has launched more 320 ballistic missiles into Ukraine during the four-day war. There are some indications that several ballistic missiles have failed to launch.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nU.S.: Putin ‘can be assured’ of tougher sanctions\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said Sunday the U.S. will continue to apply stiffer economic sanctions against Russia as Putin escalates fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"We are continuing to assess what we can do moving forward,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" \"And the Russians can be assured that we will continue to put more and more sanctions as they continue to press more on the Ukrainian government.”\n\nU.S. and Western allies have cut some Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system but stopped short of a complete removal.\n\n“They will feel the pain,” she said, adding there are also actions the U.N. can take.\n\n“We can isolate them. We can isolate them in the United Nations. We can isolate them in U.N. specialized agencies. They are feeling that isolation.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nNATO leader: Russia must make 'serious compromises' in peace talks\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said if peace talks are to succeed, Russia must be willing to make \"serious compromises\" and \"respect the sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nStoltenberg told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Putin's decision to put his nuclear forces on high alert is not a good sign.\n\nIt \"just adds to the very aggressive rhetoric\" of Russia, the NATO leader said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine ambassador: Russia committing ‘war crimes’\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to the United States accused Russia of committing war crimes in its attack on her country.\n\nAmbassador Oksana Markarova said Sunday that Russian troops are using heavy missiles and heavy artillery to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure, as well as hospitals and kindergartens. Many children have been killed, and one entire family was shot in their car, she said.\n\n“Nothing is off limits to them,” Markarova said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “What we see is a full-fledged war, with war crimes on the ground.”’\n\nAsked whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is safe, Markarova offered no information on his whereabouts but added, “He is as safe as our country.”\n\nShe spoke shortly after Zelenskyy’s office confirmed that a delegation will meet with Russian officials. Marakova said Ukraine is ready “for any peace talks that would stop the war and get them out from our country.” But the Ukrainians will not surrender, she said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nCotton: West must stop ‘pussyfooting around’ on sanctions\n\nSen. Tom Cotton on Sunday called on the Biden administration and American businesses to provide “no support whatsoever” to Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“We can do more than prayers and hashtags and lining up building storage,” he said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “It's time for the president and some of our European partners to quit pussyfooting around.”\n\nCotton appealed to the Biden administration to increase its sanctions on Russian banks, arguing that while the administration says it has sanctioned 80% of Russian banks, Russian President Vladimir Putin “controls 100% of banks.”\n\nThe Arkansas Republican also blamed Western nations for underestimating Putin’s ambition.\n\nDespite a strong condemnation of Putin, Cotton stopped short of condemning former President Donald Trump, who has called Putin “smart” and his plan both “savvy” and “genius.” Cotton repeatedly said he does not speak for other politicians.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\n‘This is a different Putin’: Rice says Putin ‘erratic’\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice said Russian President Vladimir Putin recent behavior is a departure from her past encounters with the “cold and calculating” leader.\n\n“This is a different Putin,” Rice, who served under former President George W. Bush, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" “He seems erratic… He has descended into something I have not seen before.”\n\nWhile Rice said the prospect of peace talks was promising, she urged Ukraine to follow the advice of former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n“Trust but verify,” she said. “It’s always a good thing if there is a chance (at peace),” she said.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nMore:A song of defiance: Ukraine's national anthem being heard all over the world\n\nPsaki: Putin 'manufacturing threats' to justify attack on Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to put nuclear deterrent forces on high alert is another example of the Russian leader “manufacturing threats” to justify aggression against Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday.\n\n“We’ve seen him do this time and time again,” Psaki said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “At no time has Russia been under threat from NATO.”\n\n“This is all a pattern from President Putin,” Psaki said, “and we’re all going to stand up” to him.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nCondoleeza Rice: Putin faces unexpected reality in Ukraine\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice said Russian President Vladimir Putin may have “bitten off more than he can chew” perhaps forcing early peace talks.\n\nRice, speaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" said Putin likely believed that he could \"waltz\" into Ukraine.\n\n“But the reality has been quite different.”\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nRomney casts the war as a battle of 'good and evil'\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, cast Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion as a battle of \"good and evil,\" and called for more sanctions on the \"evil regime\" of Vladimir Putin.\n\nSpeaking on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Romney also said he hopes Putin will use potential peace talks with Ukraine as an opportunity to back off.\n\n\"He made a huge error,\" Romney said of Putin. \"This is not going well for him.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMore:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\n‘A thug and despot’: Putin to feel pain of new financial sanctions\n\nRemoving Russia from a global banking network as part of a new round of sanctions “will make a big difference” in isolating the Kremlin, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies Saturday cut Russia from the key financial messaging network known as SWIFT, in an escalation of its sanctioning campaign.\n\nKlobuchar called Putin “a thug and a despot,” who misjudged the world’s reaction to Russia aggression.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\n'Unacceptable': Thomas-Greenfield says Putin escalating conflict in Ukraine\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday that Vladimir Putin’s decision to put nuclear deterrent forces on high alert indicates the Russian president is “continuing to escalate” the war in Ukraine in a way that is “unacceptable.”\n\nSpeaking on CBS’ \"Face the Nation,\" Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. is using “every possible lever” to stop Russia’s invasion of its neighbor and that the U.N. Security Council will meet later Sunday.\n\n“I’m not surprised at this information because Putin has tried every means possible to actually put fear in the world in terms of his actions. It just means that we need to ramp up up our actions at the U.N.”\n\nWhen asked whether there’s a threat of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, Thomas-Greenfield responded: “Certainly nothing is off the table with this guy.”\n\n– Sean Rossman\n\nPutin orders nuclear deterrent forces on high alert\n\nRussia President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces Sunday to be on high alert, a dramatic escalation of tensions with the West that brought immediate condemnation from the U.S. as Russia continues its full-scale assault on Ukraine.\n\nPutin, announcing the move on Russian state television, called it a response to “aggressive statements” and tough financial sections from NATO countries. The extraordinary step raises the threat of nuclear warfare entering the conflict in Ukraine, a scenario the White House has previously said it has not assessed.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, condemned the action as “unacceptable\" in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nPutin directed the Russian defense minister and the chief of the military’s General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a “special regime of combat duty” during a meeting with top officials.\n\n“Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,” Putin said in televised comments.\n\nAt the onset of the conflict with Ukraine, Putin warned that any nation that would “hinder us” will face\" such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,” although he did not elaborate what he meant.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n-- Joey Garrison, Associated Press\n\nKyiv eerily quiet after explosions\n\nThe capital, Kyiv, was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault.\n\n“The past night was tough – more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn’t consider as admissible targets.”\n\nVideos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The images showed Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. In one image, Ukrainian troops were seen firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby.\n\nThe images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine’s bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy asks UN top court to halt Russian invasion, says Moscow 'manipulating the notion of genocide'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of manipulating the notion of genocide to justify invading its neighbor and urged the International Court of Justice to hold trials.\n\nLocated in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICJ is the main judicial arm of the United Nations.\n\n\"Russia must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression. We request an urgent decision ordering Russia to cease military activity now and expect trials to start next week,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe ICJ rules on disputes between states, including responsibility for breaches of international law. It is not linked to the International Criminal Court, also based in The Hague, which holds individuals accountable for atrocities.\n\n– Caren Bohan and Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy is a lion of a leader | Opinion\n\n“I need ammunition, not a ride.” Those are the words proclaimed by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the midst of terrible death and destruction and the most egregious threat to Europe since World War II, Ukrainians are teaching the rest of the world a lesson about freedom, resolve and love of country.\n\nWhen offered an escape from Kyiv, allegedly by the United States, the 44-year-old Ukrainian president immediately rejected the notion and demonstrated selfless leadership and a portrait of courage generally reserved for Hollywood.\n\nMany leaders would have abandoned ship, putting their own personal safety above that of their countrymen. Zelenskyy, on the other hand, is taking a stand for freedom, boldly demonstrating that freedom is worth fighting for; that a government of, by and for the people is worth defending.\n\n– August Pfluger (Read more of August Pfluger's column.)\n\nNHL star Alex Ovechkin called over over stance on war\n\nHockey Hall of Famer Dominik Hasek has called for the NHL to \"immediately suspend contracts for all Russian players\" amidst Russia's deadly invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe 57-year-old Czech also had some choice words for Washington Capitals' Russian-born star Alex Ovechkin, a supporter of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHasek, who played in the NHL for 16-seasons and is widely considered one of the best goaltenders of all time, called Ovechkin an \"alibist,\" a \"liar\" and a \"chicken (expletive)\" after Ovechkin failed to publicly denounce Putin and his country's aggression.\n\n– Cydney Henderson\n\nUkraine rejects location for talks with Russia\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country is ready for peace talks with Russia but not in Belarus.\n\nSpeaking in a video message Sunday, Zelenskyy suggested meeting in Warsaw, Poland; Bratislava, Slovakia; Istanbul; Budapest, Hungary; or Baku, Azerbaijan. He said other locations are also possible but made clear that Ukraine doesn’t accept Russia’s selection of Belarus, which Russia has used as a staging ground for its invasion.\n\nThe Kremlin said Sunday a Russian delegation had arrived in Homel, Belarus, for talks with Ukrainian officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the delegation includes military officials and diplomats.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRussia's cutting off port access\n\nRussia was working Sunday to limit strategic strategic ports along the Ukraine’s coastline stretching from the border with Romania in the west to the border with Russia in the east. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said Russian forces had blocked the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea.\n\nRussia’s military also put increasing pressure on strategic ports in the south of Ukraine, blocking the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea.\n\nCutting Ukraine’s access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country’s economy.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRussia targets Ukraine airfields in next phase\n\nRussia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine targeting airfields and fuel facilities in what appeared to be the next phase of an invasion that has been slowed by fierce resistance. The U.S. and EU responded with weapons and ammunition for the outnumbered Ukrainians and powerful sanctions intended to further isolate Moscow.\n\nHuge explosions lit up the sky early Sunday south of the capital, Kyiv, where people hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale assault by Russian forces.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nWhere are Russian military forces? Tracking the Ukraine invasion\n\n'You cannot defeat a whole nation'\n\nOn Sunday morning, Ukranian writer Illarion Pavliuk plans to set out on a dangerous journey to help his countrymen as explosions rock Kyiv, and outgunned Ukrainian forces continue to maintain control of their capital.\n\nPavliuk is not a solider, but he does have a military background. In 2015, he was an intelligence volunteer in the war in Eastern Ukraine. And yet, this is what Ukraine has become – a country where internationally acclaimed artists are forced to kiss their children goodnight before they go off to defend their homeland from the occupying force. \"We will never give up and we are going to win this war. You cannot defeat the whole nation. And Ukrainians are absolutely united as a nation now.\"\n\nHis words are haunting and powerful, with his children in the background.\n\n\"What can I tell you about this war? It is difficult to say a couple of words,\" he says. \"I would never ever imagine my four children dropping their toys and running to sit in the thickest doorway in the house because of cruise missiles above our city; ballistic missiles.\n\n\"And I would never imagine this and I will never forgive Russia.\"\n\n– Carli Pierson, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/27"}]}

Satellite imagery showed a massive ash cloud and shockwaves spreading from the eruption. Ash was falling from the sky in the Tonga capital, Nuku'alofa, Saturday evening and phone connections were down.\n\nThe eruption caused a severe tsunami on Tongatapu, where the capital is located, with waves flowing onto coastal roads and flooding properties on Saturday.\n\nSo far, New Zealand authorities have not received any reports of deaths or injuries in Tonga related to the eruption, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nJUST WATCHED Expert explains what's happening in 'jaw-dropping' eruption video Replay More Videos ...

Multiple smaller tsunamis were reported in numerous other locations, according to public broadcaster NHK.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, all tsunami advisories had been lifted, the meteorological agency said. Weather agency officials ruled out the possibility of further tsunamis across the country, but said there might be some tidal fluctuations.\n\nJapan's coast guard was out assessing damage, but so far none had been reported, NHK said, noting it was still dark and more waves were expected.

A tsunami advisory for Hawaii was canceled by the agency Saturday morning\n\nAdam Weintraub, a spokesperson for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, told CNN there were \"no reports of major damage so far,\" though the effects had been felt across multiple islands. Officials were still assessing the damage.\n\nThe impacts were the equivalent of a \"high King Tide,\" Weintraub said earlier, telling CNN there had been flooding in parking lots and harbor areas he characterized as \"nuisance flooding.\"\n\nSpeaking by telephone, Snider said, \"We don't have a really good forecast because this event is based on a volcano rather than an earthquake.\"\n\nNonetheless, the National Weather Service in Seattle urged caution along the US Pacific Coast on Saturday. \"Move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas in these areas,\" NWS Seattle tweeted.\n\nThe city of Laguna Beach, California, closed all beaches, boardwalks, harbors and piers until further notice in response to the tsunami advisory early Saturday morning, telling residents, \"please stay out of the water and away from the shore.\"\n\nSanta Cruz, California, also experienced some \"minor flooding\" at the harbor, city manager Elizabeth Smith told CNN.\n\nHigh tide comes into a harbor in Santa Cruz, California, seen in this still image from a video obtained by CNN. The water quickly drained out, Brad Anderson -- the person that provided the video -- said.\n\nThe waves came right at high tide, Fire Chief Rob Young said. The initial wave occurred at approximately 7:40 a.m. local time, he said, bringing with it a 1 to 2-foot wave right at the peak of high tide. The largest wave came in at about 8:49 a.m. local time, prompting a surge of about 7 feet at the harbor. A subsequent surge just after 10 a.m. was \"diminished.\"\n\n\"When it comes, it comes quickly,\" he said. \"Not just a 1-foot wave, but it comes in a surge because it draws all the water out first, and then it comes in.\"\n\nThere was some damage in the harbor and to some docks, he said. There was also \"light flooding\" on the beaches and up to the city's first surface street, Young said.\n\nAll beaches and the harbor will be closed until at least noon local time, Smith said, and people were evacuated from nearby stores and the area near the harbor, though no one has been evacuated from their homes. A surf contest has been postponed and is expected to resume later Saturday.\n\nNew Zealand on alert\n\nA tsunami advisory was also issued for coastal areas on the north and east coast of New Zealand's North Island and the Chatham Islands, where \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore\" were expected, according to New Zealand's National Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNew Zealand's official weather service said its weather stations across the country had observed \"a pressure surge\" on Saturday evening from the eruption.\n\nA satellite image taken by Himawari-8, a Japanese weather satellite, and released by the agency, shows an undersea volcano eruption at the Pacific nation of Tonga Saturday, January 15, 2022.\n\nScientist Emily Lane, of New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, told the New Zealand Science Media Centre it was a \"very significant\" eruption.\n\n\"The shock wave from it is clearly visible in satellite imagery and there are reports of the eruption being heard at least as far away as New Zealand,\" she said. \"The tsunami from the eruption has reached over 2,500 kilometers being recorded on gauges over all of Aotearoa.\"\n\nTsunamis generated by volcanoes are much less common than tsunamis from underwater earthquakes, Lane said.\n\nA smaller eruption in late 2014 and early 2015 built up the crater of the volcano to above the surface of the water, Lane added, but it's not yet clear exactly how Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai erupted on this occasion. \"When we see what is left of the island after this eruption is over we can start to put together the pieces of what happened,\" she said.\n\n1.14.2022: (correction on date) Large volcanic eruption near Tonga (Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano) today as seen from outer space.

Women and children were screaming and crying.\"\n\nAsh and grit fell to earth in towns and cities across the region, including Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city after Jakarta, with a population of about 3 million. It also fell farther afield in Yogyakarta, where motorists switched on headlights in daylight. Workers attempted to cover the famed ninth century Buddhist temple complex of Borobudur with plastic sheeting to protect it.\n\nA 60-year-old woman and an 80-year-old man were killed in the village of Pandansari, about 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the mountain, when the roofs of their homes collapsed under the weight of the ash and volcanic debris, the disaster agency said. A 70-year-old man died after being hit by a collapsed wall while waiting to be evacuated from the same village, where the volcanic ash reached 20 centimeters (8 inches) deep in some places.\n\nThe large international airport in Surabaya and airports in the cities of Malang, Yogyakarta, Solo, Bandung, Semarang and Cilacap were closed due to reduced visibility and the dangers posed to aircraft engines by ash, Transport Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan said. Virgin Australia said it canceled its Friday flights from Australia to several locations due to the eruption, including the resort islands of Bali in Indonesia and Phuket in Thailand.\n\nThe disaster agency said tremors were still wracking the volcano but that scientists didn't expect another major eruption. It said residents of all villages within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of Kelud — more than 100,000 people — had been evacuated to temporary shelters, but that some were returning to their homes to begin cleaning up.\n\nThe 1,731-meter (5,680-foot) -high mountain in eastern Java — Indonesia's most densely populated island and home to more than half of the country's 240 million people — had been rumbling for several weeks and was under close observation. The mountain is about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of Jakarta, the capital.\n\nAs night fell, the volcano continued to rumble, spewing ash high into the air, though smaller amounts than earlier.\n\n\"It seems Kelud isn't finished yet,\" said Retno Dwiningtyas, a mother of three who was sitting in a government shelter watching television reports of her village showing crumpled roofs, farms and broken chairs blanketed with thick gray ash. \"We are afraid for our cattle, our farm.\"\n\nMuhammad Hendrasto, head of Indonesia's volcano monitoring agency, said the mountain erupted violently about 90 minutes after authorities raised its alert status to the highest level. The disaster agency said it had spewed millions of cubic meters of debris into the atmosphere.\n\nKediri, a normally bustling town about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the mountain, was largely deserted as residents stayed indoors to avoid the choking ash.\n\n\"The smell of sulfur and ash hung so thickly in the air that breathing was painful,\" said Kediri resident Insaf Wibowo.\n\nSome residents were shoveling the ash and grit into sacks to use in the construction of buildings or to fertilize crops. One collector said that middlemen had already told him they would pay up to $56 for a small truck filled with the debris.\n\nKelud is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The archipelagic nation is prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" — a series of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and Southeast Asia.\n\nDue to the fertile volcanic soil and the shortage of space on Java, hundreds of thousands of people live close to active volcanoes. They are used to the rumblings, but their proximity to the peaks presents difficulties for authorities.\n\nKelud's last major eruption was in 1990, when it spewed out searing fumes and lava that killed more than 30 people and injured hundreds. In 1919, a powerful explosion that reportedly could be heard hundreds of kilometers (miles) away killed at least 5,160 people.\n\nEarlier this month, Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra province erupted as authorities were allowing thousands of villagers who had been evacuated to return to its slopes, killing 16 people.

But the National Weather Service said there were \"no significant concerns about inundation.\"\n\nWest Coast officials warn residents to stay away from beaches\n\nThe National Weather Service offices in California said beaches may see impacts for several hours, starting Saturday morning.\n\nThe first waves arrived before 9 a.m. on the southern Oregon coast at over one foot tall, the NWS Portland said, reminding people that the highest waves will likely come later. California's central coast saw waves of up to 2.5 feet.\n\nThe largest waves have been observed in Port San Luis, Arena Cove and Crescent City, as of late Saturday afternoon, the NWS said. Port San Luis has seen waves as high as 4.3 feet while Arena Cove and Crescent City have seen 3.7-foot waves.\n\nResponding to Twitter users sharing plans to swim during the tsunami advisory, the San Francisco Fire Department urged residents to not put themselves or rescue teams at risk.\n\nSeismologist Lucy Jones also warned people in affected areas to stay away from beaches, adding that moving water has \"huge momentum\" that can do damage in port areas. But she said if people are more than three feet above sea level, the waves likely will not affect them.\n\n\"Tsunamis are not one wave,\" she said on Twitter. \"It's more like sloshing and that sloshing can continue for a day. Just because the first wave has passed, it is not time to go see the beach.\"\n\nSatellite images show eruption in Tonga\n\nThe eruption occurred roughly 5,000 miles away from most locations on the West Coast, near the Pacific nation of Tonga. There, tsunami waves sent people rushing to higher ground and impacts from the eruption continue to disrupt communication with the nation.\n\nSocial media videos from Tonga showed large waves crashing ashore and streaming around houses and buildings.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries, though communications with Tonga remained cut off hours after the eruption. Police and military evacuated Tonga's King Tupou VI from his palace near the shore, the Islands Business news site reported.\n\nIn the nearby island nations of Fiji and Samoa, authorities also issued warnings and told people to avoid the coastline due to strong currents and waves.\n\nSatellite images showed the huge eruption as a 3 mile-wide plume of ash and gas rose like a mushroom to about 12 miles above the water. Scientists noticed large explosions, thunder and lightning near the volcano after it began erupting Friday.\n\nWaves slam ashore in Hawaii\n\nWaves from a foot to 2.7 feet slammed ashore in Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported. The center said there was no reported damage and only minor flooding.\n\nThe waves are just under the criteria of three feet for a more serious tsunami warning, Snider said. He said the area should expect waves and strong currents for many hours, and some marinas and harbors may see flooding.\n\n\"The important thing here is the first wave may not be the largest,\" he said. \"We could see this play out for several hours.

While advisories were issued, there was confusion at the time because the event wasn't triggered by an earthquake, which tsunami forecasting models don't take into account.\n\nAnd last week a 7.4 magnitude earthquake in Japan sparked tsunami alerts across the country. The Japanese tsunami system worked very well, issuing alerts within minutes of the earthquake.\n\nBut how would have the US Tsunami Warning System handled a similar situation?\n\nAccording to a recent report , experts are skeptical that the United States would have been able to issue alerts at similar speeds.\n\nThe report, written by an advisory panel of tsunami experts, says the US warning system is in dire need of an overhaul, struggling with outdated technology, delayed forecasts and disjointed communication.\n\nIt warns the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Science Advisory Board (NOAA SAB) that there is an \"urgent need for action\" as it is only a matter of time until another tsunami poses a threat to the coastal US.\n\n\"The problems we observed and commented on result in a great deal of confusion among local officials, the public, and the media when a tsunami occurs,\" Rocky Lopes, co-chair of the Tsunami Science & Technology Advisory Panel (TSTAP), and a co-author of the report, told CNN.\n\nPeople watch waters rise from beaches in Santa Cruz, California, amid a tsunami advisory following the Tonga volcanic eruption.\n\nTsunamis are extremely large waves that occur as a result of a sharp displacement in the ocean. They are most commonly caused by earthquakes but can also be triggered by volcanic eruptions and landslides. These towering waves can cause widespread damage to coastal communities and, most importantly, result in high death tolls.\n\nAreas along the Pacific Ocean such as California, Alaska and Hawaii are particularly at risk of tsunamis. That's because earthquakes and volcanic activity are heightened around the Pacific Ocean basin, nicknamed the \"Ring of Fire.\"\n\n\"It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of residents and employees as well as millions of visitors are within tsunami-prone areas along the coastal regions of the U.S. each year,\" Dr. Nate Wood, supervisory research geographer for the United States Geological Survey, said in the report.\n\nGiven Tonga's recent volcanic eruption, and the ensuing tsunami waves that reached the West Coast of the United States, urgent updates are needed to protect a growing US coastal population, according to the advisory panel.\n\nTwo different offices can mean two different messages\n\nThe report's most urgent recommendations include improvements to the NOAA's Tsunami Warning System and its two Tsunami Warning Centers. There are \"gaps and inconsistencies throughout the tsunami warning and forecast process,\" the report warns.\n\nProblems include delayed communication of warnings, outdated technology and lack of coordination between the two centers, which often lead to conflicting messages to the public.\n\nThe National Tsunami Warning Center, located in Palmer, Alaska, covers the Lower 48 states and Alaska and Canada, while The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, located in Honolulu, serves the Hawaiian Islands as well as the US Pacific Islands, Caribbean territories and British Virgin Islands.\n\nDue to differing locations and needs, the two centers have individually diversified their technology and methods, causing discrepancies and preventing a seamless backup if one of the two centers were to malfunction, according to the report.\n\nThe website used to consolidate all of the tsunami bulletins from both warning centers, tsunami.gov, also presented many concerns for TSTAP.\n\n\"Tsunami.gov is a consolidated website that presents information in real time from both tsunami warning centers. Unless you really understand where the information is coming from and drill down into all the data, it is hard to know which center is issuing which bulletin and which applies to where,\" Lopes told CNN.\n\nThe lack of organization and consolidation makes the website difficult for the public and local officials to understand. That has led to problems in recent months.\n\n\"For example, when the Tonga volcanic eruption happened on January 15th, some media reported that the US West Coast was under a tsunami warning, and it was not a warning. It is called a tsunami advisory, which is a lower level alert that doesn't require, for example, evacuations,\" Lopes said.\n\nTiming is key\n\nAlthough initial reports come quickly from the two warning centers, a full forecast detailing where and when the tsunamis may occur can take up to three hours, according to the report.\n\nThe advisory panel notes that after an 8.2 magnitude earthquake hit Alaska on July 28, 2021, West Coast states were \"under evaluation\" for three hours after the event. This would have left one hour -- before the tsunami had reached land -- for officials to make announcements regarding evacuations if they had been needed.\n\nThe advisory panel emphasized the need for the tsunami warning centers to issue earlier estimates of impacts. It said that delayed messaging \"leaves decision makers lost and unable to make important life safety decisions in the time frame necessary to issue a successful evacuation if needed.\"\n\nNew technology, including data from satellites, could potentially help the warning centers to make more accurate and timely forecasts, according to the advisory panel.\n\nAnd the tsunami experts highlight the lack of a \"standardized system for real time monitoring of the activity, tsunami potential, and tsunami risk\" for sources other than earthquakes.\n\nJUST WATCHED Expert explains what's happening in 'jaw-dropping' eruption video.

That report will detail what they are doing in response to our recommendations and that will be posted on the NOAA SAB website,\" Lopes said.\n\nHe said that if there are actual changes to the systems, there will also be a public notification statement on the NWS website.\n\nThe time is now to prepare for tsunamis\n\nSunday is the start of Tsunami Awareness Week, which encourages people who live in high risk areas to prepare for potential events.\n\nState, federal and local offices urge coastal communities to recognize the risk they are under and become as \"tsunami ready\" as possible.\n\nTsunami Advisories remain in effect for Alaska, Hawaii, and the West Coast.

The fire, which remains 0% contained as of Monday morning, has charred more than 15,000 acres in central California's Mariposa County, officials said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the region, which frees additional resources to battle the fire. About 2,500 personnel are working to help extinguish the blaze, which has been burning since Friday and has destroyed at least 10 structures and damaged five others. The wildfire comes as much of the US has been experiencing sweltering heat and worsening drought conditions fueled by climate change\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nRussian missile strikes hit the southern Ukrainian port of Odesa , just one day after Ukraine and Russia agreed on a deal that would allow the resumption of vital grain exports from the region. \"Russia agreed to some deal on grain export, but immediately after this attacked it -- showing they want to continue to threaten the world's food security,\" Ukrainian member of parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko told CNN. The deal promised to unblock ports on the Black Sea to allow the safe passage of grain and oilseeds -- some of Ukraine's most important exports . Russia has been blocking maritime access to those ports, meaning that millions of tons of Ukrainian grain have not reached the many countries that rely on the food source. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia's missile attack \"casts serious doubt\" on the grain deal. The US is now working with Ukraine on a \" Plan B \" to get grain exports out of the country.\n\nJUST WATCHED Video shows Russian missile hitting Odesa harbor Replay More Videos ...

This comes as the US is reporting more than 2,800 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 44 states, DC and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC. Two of the cases have been identified in children . Globally, more than 16,500 cases have been reported so far in 74 countries. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, as \"an extraordinary event\" that constitutes a public health risk to other countries through the international spread of disease. Although monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, it spreads through skin-to-skin contact. In this outbreak, the virus has mostly been spreading among men who are in close contact with other men.\n\n4.

Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted unanimously on Saturday in support of giving babies and other kids as young as 6 months a Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the plan, clearing the way for the vaccinations to be administered this week.\n\nParents may be reluctant to actually get them when they become available, an April survey found. Just 18% of parents of children under 5 said they would vaccinate their child against Covid-19 as soon as a vaccine became available, according to an April Kaiser Family Foundation Vaccine Monitor survey\n\nNearly 40% of those surveyed said they would \"wait and see\" before vaccinating their young children, 11% said they would get the vaccine for their kids only if required, and 27% said they would \"definitely not\" get the Covid-19 vaccination for their child.\n\nEven parents who are eager to vaccinate likely have questions. How confident should they feel about the FDA's decision? When will vaccines be available to young kids, and how will families access them? Which vaccine is better, Pfizer or Moderna? If my child already has had Covid-19, should they still be vaccinated? And what if my kid turns 5 soon -- should I hold off?\n\nI spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of \" Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health \" and the mother of two children under 5.\n\nThe following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nCNN: How are you feeling about the FDA's decision?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: I'm thrilled and so relieved. It's been a year and a half since adults first started getting the Covid-19 vaccine. There are about 17 million children not yet eligible for vaccination, and FDA's authorization was a major hurdle to have crossed. Now that the CDC has also recommended both vaccines, I'm really looking forward to getting my young kids -- ages 2 and almost 5 -- the same exceptional protection that my husband and I have.\n\nThe FDA and its external advisers went through a rigorous process and conducted independent analyses of data submitted by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. They found that three doses of the Pfizer vaccine and two doses of the Moderna vaccine were safe and produced a strong immune response, on par with the antibody response seen in young adults. They also found that both vaccines reduced symptomatic infection in this younger age group.\n\nI'm reassured by the thorough, careful and deliberate process this regulatory agency took, and, when the CDC gives the go-ahead, as I expect they will, I'll be calling my pediatrician to get both of my kids vaccinated.\n\nCNN: When do you think vaccines will become available to kids under age 5, and how should parents and caregivers access them?\n\nWen: Pending the CDC decision, which came Saturday, states had already been able to order vaccines, which means some doctors' offices, community health centers, health departments and pharmacies may have them in stock and ready to give by next week.\n\nThe first place that I'd encourage eager parents to consult is their pediatrician's office. Parents are used to getting kids vaccinated there, and the pediatrician will know when and if they plan on giving the Covid-19 vaccine. If they don't plan to carry the vaccine, they would be able to recommend other trusted locations in the community.\n\nYou could also contact your local pharmacies, though note that many pharmacies may not be equipped to provide shots to young kids. Your local city or county health department and state health department also might have resources, as will children's hospitals in your area.\n\nCNN: How will parents choose between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for their kids?\n\nWen: Both vaccines are safe, and both are effective. Both vaccines induce strong antibody levels, which correlate with protection against severe disease in older age groups. Preliminary results indicate that the three-dose Pfizer vaccine is more effective at preventing symptomatic infection -- though these are early studies -- and both vaccines induce strong antibody levels, which correlate with protection against severe disease in older age groups.\n\nI think there will be a variety of parental preferences here. There are some parents who are eager to get their kids vaccinated as quickly as possible. In that case, the two-dose Moderna vaccine may be preferable, because the second dose is given four weeks after the first, and two weeks after that, their child will be considered fully vaccinated. If a child starts the series next week, they could be fully vaccinated by mid-August and in time for the next school year.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSome other parents might want their children to have the highest level of protection possible, even if it takes longer. Or, they might feel more reassured from Pfizer because it has been given for months to 5-11 year olds. The Pfizer three-dose vaccine definitely takes more time. The first two doses are given three weeks apart, then the third is given two months after the second. So it would take until at least mid-September for a child to be fully vaccinated with Pfizer, even if they get the first dose next week. The dosage of the Pfizer vaccine is also lower than Moderna's, which some parents might also prefer, though there does not appear to be a difference in degree of possible side effects -- such as fever, fatigue and irritability -- associated with the different doses.\n\nStill other parents may just want to give their kids whatever they have access to first. I think all of these are reasonable decisions, as the CDC recommends both vaccines equally.\n\nCNN: What about kids who have already had Covid-19? Should they still be vaccinated?\n\nWen: Yes. Vaccination after recovery from infection provides more durable and longer-lasting protection than recovery alone. I hope the CDC addresses at their meeting the question of how long kids should wait to get vaccinated after they recover from the coronavirus. The CDC has made it clear that those children who have had Covid-19 should still be vaccinated.\n\nCNN: Should children turning 5 soon wait to get the higher dose or get vaccinated now?\n\nWen: No, they shouldn't wait. The CDC is following the guidance they used previously for the 5- to 11-year-old group, which is to say that the 11-year old -- and in this case, the 4-year old -- should not wait. Start the vaccination process now, and then when the child turns 5, they can get the higher dose.\n\nCNN: What if parents are unsure about the vaccine and want to wait and see?\n\nWen: I believe that all parents want the best for their children. My best advice is to talk to your pediatrician, whom you trust with other aspects of guidance for your children's health. Personally, I feel very reassured by the thorough and careful process taken by our federal regulatory agencies and can't wait to give my kids a safe vaccine that helps to protect them from the coronavirus.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/15/sexual-supplements-can-dangerous-especially-when-combined-cocaine/73982616/", "title": "Dangers of 'herbal Viagra': What every man should know", "text": "Liz Szabo\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBasketball player Lamar Odom's collapse this week – after allegedly using cocaine and sexual supplements – has raised questions about the supplements and their safety and whether they could increase the dangers posed by illegal drugs. Odom is now on life support at a Nevada hospital.\n\nUSA TODAY's Liz Szabo talked to medical experts about these products.\n\nQ. What is in a sexual performance supplement?\n\nA. Although these supplements are often called \"herbal Viagra\" – suggesting that they contain a safer or more natural form of the little blue pill – many contain the active ingredient in real Viagra, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nOdom apparently took supplements called Reload 72-hour Strong and Libimax, according a spokesman for the legal Nevada brothel where he collapsed, who spoke to the Associated Press.\n\nLamar Odom's sex enhancement supplements may have been spiked\n\nTests by the FDA in 2013 found sildenafil, Viagra's active ingredient, in Reload. In 2009, the manufacturer of LibiMax recalled the product after tests found that it contained tadalafil, another drug for erectile dysfunction.\n\nProblems aren't limited to LibiMax and Reload. The FDA has found that 300 sexual supplements contain unidentified ingredients.\n\n\"Not only do these products contain undisclosed drug ingredients,\" the FDA says on its website, \"but they also sometimes may include combinations of undisclosed ingredients or excessively high doses, both potentially dangerous situations.\"\n\nSome herbal sexual supplements also contain saw palmetto, ginseng and horny goat weed, used for centuries in China to treat low libido and erectile dysfunction. Others contain yohimbine,made from the bark of a type of evergreen tree, said Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nTaking a sexual supplement \"is like playing Russian roulette,\" said Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"You don't know what you're getting any time you open a bottle of 'herbal Viagra.'\"\n\nQ. Why would supplement makers put an expensive drug like Viagra, which can sell for $5 to $10 a pill, into an herbal supplement?\n\nA. Although Viagra is expensive in the USA, it's dirt cheap in China, which makes many of these supplements, Cohen said. Chinese companies sell sexual supplements for a fraction of the cost of Viagra, but can still make a profit. Unlike Viagra, however, which comes in a standard dose, supplements may not have a standard dose of medication. So men could get much less of the active ingredient they're looking for -- or much more.\n\nQ. How risky are these supplements?\n\nA. According to the FDA, the hidden ingredients in these supplements can pose life-threatening risks.\n\nThat's because the active ingredients in erectile dysfunction drugs can interact with prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin, used to treat chest pain and other heart problems, according to the FDA. That's a big risk, given that the older men who seek out erectile dysfunction drugs are often the same ones who take nitroglycerin, including men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or heart disease.\n\nBoth Viagra-like drugs and nitroglycerin lower blood pressure, Glatter said. Taken together, the combination can cause heart rhythm problems, heart attacks and strokes.\n\nIn its 2013 warning about Reload, the FDA said: \"Consumers should stop using this product immediately and throw it away. Consumers who have experienced any negative side effects should consult a health care professional as soon as possible.\"\n\nEven prescription erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra, which are regulated much more tightly than herbal supplements, can cause heart attacks, Glatter said.\n\nSexual supplements that contain Viagra-like drugs are especially risky if men take large doses, Glatter said. Odom reportedly took 10 of the pills.\n\nConsumers should be skeptical about claims that appear too good to be true, said Craig Hopp, program director of extramural research the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, part of the National Institutes of Health. Some herbal sexual supplements promise results in 30 minutes, for example. While pharmaceuticals can work that quickly, Hopp said that plants don't. Supplements that claim to work as quickly as drugs are probably laced with drugs.\n\nQ. Do sexual supplements work?\n\nA. No supplements have ever been shown to be effective for erectile dysfunction, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\nUnlike prescription drugs, which must prove they're safe and effective before being approved by the FDA, supplement makers don't have to prove that their products work before selling them, said Charles Bell, programs director for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports magazine. Because supplements aren't tested through a rigorous scientific process, consumers have no way to know if they really work.\n\nQ. Are supplements riskier than prescription or over-the-counter erectile dysfunction drugs?\n\nA. Unlike prescription and over-the-counter drugs, supplement makers aren't required to post warnings about such side effects or drug interactions on their product labels, Bell said. Many men may not realize the risks.\n\nSexual supplements can sometimes be much stronger than regular Viagra, Glatter said. \"You take more and more pills thinking it's safe,\" Glatter said. \"People think, 'It's natural, so it must be safe.'\"\n\nA study in The New England Journal of Medicine this week found that at least 23,000 Americans go to the emergency room – including 2,000 who are hospitalized – after taking dietary supplements. Many of the most common symptoms are heart palpitations.\n\nSide effects from dietary supplements send 23,000 people a year to ER\n\nQ. Do sexual supplements add to the risks of cocaine or other illegal drugs?\n\nA. Absolutely, Glatter said.\n\nCocaine alone is dangerous and can cause a heart attack, Glatter said. Cocaine, a stimulant, raises blood pressure and makes the heart beat faster. But it decreases the blood supply to the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen.\n\nCocaine is also particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol, said Glatter, who noted that some people combine the two in order to soften the experience of coming down off cocaine.\n\nCombining cocaine and Viagra can cause a life-threatening, excruciatingly painful condition called an aortic dissection, or tear in the wall of the body's main artery, Glatter said. This causes blood to bleed into the blood vessel wall – instead of flowing out to the body – which deprives the brain and extremities of oxygen. That, in turn, can cause a stroke. People with this condition can also lose a leg.\n\nThe results of Odom's toxicology tests have not yet been released.\n\n\"God knows what this guy took,\" Glatter said.\n\nAdding the club drug ecstasy, which is often taken to boost a sexual experience, only increases the risks from Viagra-like drugs, Glatter said. Combining ecstasy with alcohol and Viagra can cause serotonin syndrome, causing confusion, seizures and a high body temperature. That, in turn, also can lead to stroke.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/health/proposed-menthol-ban/index.html", "title": "Ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars could save hundreds ...", "text": "(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce a proposed rule this week to ban menthol from cigarettes, as well as to ban flavored cigars. It's a step that public health officials say is essential to protect public health.\n\n\"I'm really excited about the possibility. At our foundation, we've cared about issues of smoking and preventable deaths for so long,\" said Dr. Richard Besser , a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now serves as the president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a public health advocacy organization.\n\n\"To see an issue that disproportionately affects African American smokers, disproportionately affects women, LGBT people who smoke, lower-income individuals. To say that these lives count just as much as any other life and a preventable death, that gives me real, real hope.\"\n\nMenthol by the numbers\n\nMenthol is an equity issue that the FDA has been considering for more than a decade.\n\nAbout 18.6 million people smoke menthols in the US. That's about 36% of all smokers, according to the FDA, and a disproportionate number are people of color.\n\nAbout 30% of White smokers choose menthols, but they are by far the cigarette of choice for nearly 85% of smokers who are Black. About 40% of women smoke menthols, compared with 31% of men, according to the FDA.\n\nLGBTQ people are also significantly more likely to smoke menthols. A 2013 study that looked at data from the CDC's 2009-10 National Adult Tobacco survey found that 36% of LGBTQ smokers chose menthols, compared with 29.3% of straight smokers.\n\nSmoking rates in the US reached an all-time low in 2018, according to the CDC , but smoking is still the No. 1 cause of preventable death, disease and disability in the country. In general, cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the US, including more than 41,000 deaths from secondhand smoke.\n\nCutting out menthol in cigarettes and cigars could have a significant effect on the number of smokers, the FDA said. By one estimate, it could even prevent 650,000 premature deaths over the next 40 years.\n\nAnother study projects that an elimination of menthol as a cigarette flavor would lead 923,000 people to quit smoking, including 230,000 African Americans, in the first year and a half.\n\nThe long road to banning menthol\n\nMenthol is the last special flavor allowed in cigarettes in the US.\n\nIt's a chemical compound found naturally in peppermint that can also be made in a lab. This minty flavor creates a cooling sensation on the throat and softens the harshness of the tobacco taste. It's a quality that, studies show, makes smoking more addictive and more palatable to children and new smokers.\n\n\"Like a menthol cough drop does when you have a sore throat, it soothes,\" said Erika Sward , assistant VP of national advocacy for the American Lung Association.\n\nIn part to keep kids from smoking, Congress banned flavored cigarettes with its 2009 Tobacco Control Act , with the exception of menthol. The same act gave the FDA the authority to regulate the tobacco industry to protect public health.\n\nThat regulation allows the FDA to enact product standards to limit the toxicity, appeal and addictiveness of tobacco. The law also requires the FDA to conduct and fund research on menthol and gives the agency the authority to ban it if appropriate.\n\nIn the more than a decade that the FDA has been looking into the issue, there have been several slow steps toward a ban.\n\n\"This is long-awaited. The evidence has been there for years,\" said Robin Koval, CEO and president of the Truth Initiative , an organization dedicated to geting young people to reject smoking, vaping and nicotine.\n\nIn 2011, the FDA's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee issued a report based on its review of evidence on menthol and cigarettes. It concluded that a ban would benefit public health but said that there were gaps in its understanding and further research is needed.\n\nIn 2018, when the FDA issued another ANPRM on menthol, it was flooded with even more comments: About 520,000 people weighed in on the topic.\n\nYet still, nothing happened.\n\nalleged that the FDA unreasonably delayed issuing a final response. The Public Health Law Center and other groups filed a citizens petition requesting that the agency prohibit menthol in cigarettes. And in 2020, a lawsuitalleged that the FDA unreasonably delayed issuing a final response.\n\n\"Ultimately, the American Medical Association joined the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council and others to sue the FDA, essentially saying, 'you've ignored the citizens petition for too long,' \" Sward said. \"The judge sided with them and and gave FDA the deadline of last April to essentially to say what they were going to do.\"\n\nIn April 2021, the FDA said it would pursue rulemaking to prohibit menthol in cigarettes, as well as all flavors of cigars.\n\n\"Our decision is based on clear science and evidence established the addictiveness and harms of these products,\" Kathy Crosby, director of the Office of Health Communication and Education at the FDA Center for Tobacco Products, said in February during an FDA webinar\n\nLast week, the proposal passed one regulatory hurdle with the US Office of Management and Budget. This executive-branch agency is responsible for making sure the FDA follows the rules in creating a policy. It's also where a policy can get watered down when industry, retailers, public health associations and government agencies lobby the organization on what the rule should say.\n\n\"The strongest the rule ever, with very rare exception, is when the FDA finally sends it on to the White House to OMB for review,\" Sward said. She said lobbying groups and other interested parties have held dozens of meetings with the OMB on the topic.\n\nWhat the final menthol rule will look like is anyone's guess, but public health officials hope it will be a strong ban like the FDA initially proposed.\n\nA switch to flavored cigars\n\nAfter the 2009 Tobacco Control Act banned flavored cigarettes, many smokers who preferred flavors -- especially children -- may have shifted to flavored cigars, including menthol.\n\nThe FDA said that the use of flavored cigars \"increased dramatically\" and that public health goals may have been \"undermined\" by the availability of these products.\n\nFlavored cigars and cigarillos are especially popular among children, particularly Black and Hispanic kids, who are twice as likely to smoke them as their White classmates.\n\nThe FDA noted that one survey found that nearly 74% of teens 12 to 17 said they smoked cigars because they came in flavors that they enjoyed.\n\nIn 2020, more young people said they tried a cigar every day than tried a cigarette.\n\n\"We've seen in the past, limitations are placed on one product but not on another. The business quickly gravitates, it's so important for these rules to happen together,\" the Truth Initiative's Koval said.\n\nA 'healthier' cigarette?\n\nMenthol cigarettes were initially sold on the premise that they were smoother and even healthier than regular tobacco, but no type of cigarette smoking can be healthy.\n\nMenthol also seems to raise the odds that a casual smoker would become a more regular one. A 2009 study found that menthol cigarettes were more addictive than tobacco-flavored ones, and a 2015 study found that the flavor may make smokers want to smoke more.\n\nFor Black smokers and other people of color, part of the appeal may also lie in the marketing. The tobacco industry aggressively targeted these communities, the CDC notes, placing large signs for menthol products in predominantly Black neighborhoods and ads in Black newspapers.\n\nThe same is true for the LGBTQ community, which was targeted with product giveaways and ads in LGBTQ publications at least as early as the 1990s. Major tobacco companies have also been prominent supporters of Pride parades and other community events.\n\nSupport, opposition from rights groups\n\nSome activists, like the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Mothers of the Movement , have warned that a ban on menthol products could cause more violent encounters with police as they enforce the rule.\n\nAnti-smoking advocates have found that Sharpton and some other civil rights organizations have received money from cigarette makers for decades. Sharpton acknowledged to the New York Times in 2019 that Reynolds American has been a longtime donor to his National Action Network but said, \"this is not about money.\"\n\nOther groups, like the NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus, are in favor of a ban.\n\nThe FDA is careful to say that its enforcement of a ban would only \"address manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, importers and retailers. The FDA cannot and will not enforce against individual consumer possession or use of menthol cigarettes or any tobacco product.\"\n\nWhat could happen next\n\nAn FDA ban on menthol and flavored cigars wouldn't go into effect right away.\n\nThe next step would be a comment period, and the agency would take time to review the comments before a rule becomes finalized. The FDA said it can't speculate on when that might happen.\n\n\"That is supposed to be about a year, and we hope the FDA will keep to that timetable. They've missed a lot of other timetables,\" Koval said.\n\nPublic health experts believe that tobacco companies would also try to stop a ban.\n\n\"We fully expect the tobacco industry, as they have done in the past, to try to delay further with lawsuits,\" Koval said. \"There is still a long road ahead, but this is a very important first step.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf the rule stands, public health experts say, the decision could go a long way toward protecting American's health.\n\n\"Menthol has been a way in for the tobacco industry to hook young people on tobacco and target Black Americans. It's been intentional. It's been intentional and worked, highly effective,\" Besser said. \"So to take that off the table and say 'no menthol,' menthol is just another flavor. And it's a flavor that is really dangerous because it makes it easier for first-time smokers to smoke and harder for people to quit. And so getting that out of there will be a wonderful thing.\"", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/11/health/psilocybin-brain-changes-life-itself-wellness-scn/index.html", "title": "Psychedelic mushroom benefits are popping up all over - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Shrooms, Alice, tweezes, mushies, hongos, pizza toppings, magic mushrooms -- everyday lingo for psychedelic mushrooms seems to grow with each generation. Yet leading mycologist Paul Stamets believes it's time for fans of psilocybin mushrooms to leave such childish slang behind.\n\n\"Let's be adults about this. These are no longer 'shrooms.' These are no longer party drugs for young people,\" Stamets told CNN. \"Psilocybin mushrooms are nonaddictive, life-changing substances.\"\n\nBased on this research, the US Food and Drug Administration has described psilocybin as a breakthrough medicine , \"which is phenomenal,\" Stamets said.\n\nPsilocybin, which the intestines convert into psilocin, a chemical with psychoactive properties, is also showing promise in combating cluster headaches obsessive-compulsive disorder and various forms of substance abuse.\n\n\"The data are strong from depression to PTSD to cluster headaches, which is one of the most painful conditions I'm aware of,\" said neurologist Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic in the Center for Brain Health at Florida Atlantic University.\n\n\"I'm excited about the future of psychedelics because of the relatively good safety profile and because these agents can now be studied in rigorous double-blinded clinical trials,\" Isaacson said. \"Then we can move from anecdotal reports of 'I tripped on this and felt better' to 'Try this and you will be statistically, significantly better.'\"\n\nYour brain on mushrooms\n\nClassic psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD enter the brain via the same receptors as serotonin, the body's \"feel good\" hormone. Serotonin helps control body functions such as sleep, sexual desire and psychological states such as satisfaction, happiness and optimism.\n\nPeople with depression or anxiety often have low levels of serotonin, as do people with post-traumatic stress disorder, cluster headaches, anorexia, smoking addiction and substance abuse. Treatment typically involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which boost levels of serotonin available to brain cells. Yet it can take weeks for improvement to occur, experts say, if the drugs even work at all.\n\nWith psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD, however, scientists can see changes in brain neuron connectivity in the lab \"within 30 minutes,\" said pharmacologist Brian Roth, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n\"One of the most interesting things we've learned about the classic psychedelics is that they have a dramatic effect on the way brain systems synchronize, or move and groove together,\" said Matthew Johnson, a professor in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\n\"When someone's on psilocybin, we see an overall increase in connectivity between areas of the brain that don't normally communicate well,\" Johnson said. \"You also see the opposite of that -- local networks in the brain that normally interact with each other quite a bit suddenly communicate less.\"\n\nIt creates a \"very, very disorganized brain,\" ultimately breaking down normal boundaries between the auditory, visual, executive and sense-of-self sections of the mind -- thus creating a state of \"altered consciousness,\" said David Nutt, director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Unit in the Division of Brain Sciences at Imperial College London.\n\nAnd it's that disorganization that is ultimately therapeutic, according to Nutt: \"Depressed people are continually self-critical, and they keep ruminating, going over and over the same negative, anxious or fearful thoughts.\n\n\"Psychedelics disrupt that, which is why people can suddenly see a way out of their depression during the trip,\" he added. \"Critical thoughts are easier to control, and thinking is more flexible. That's why the drug is an effective treatment for depression.\"\n\nThe growth of brain cells\n\nThere's more. Researchers say psychedelic drugs actually help neurons in the brain sprout new dendrites, which look like branches on a tree, to increase communication between cells.\n\n\"These drugs can increase neuronal outgrowth, they can increase this branching of neurons, they can increase synapses. That's called neuroplasticity,\" Nutt said.\n\nThat's different from neurogenesis, which is the development of brand new brain cells, typically from stem cells in the body. The growth of dendrites helps build and then solidify new circuits in the brain, allowing us to, for example, lay down more positive pathways as we practice gratitude.\n\n\"Now our current thinking is this neuronal outgrowth probably doesn't contribute to the increased connectivity in the brain, but it almost certainly helps people who have insights into their depression while on psilocybin maintain those insights,\" Nutt said.\n\n\"You shake up the brain, you see things in a more positive way, and then you lay down those positive circuits with the neuroplasticity,\" he added. \"It's a double whammy.\"\n\nInterestingly, SSRIs also increase neuroplasticity, a fact that science has known for some time. But in a 2022 double-blind phase 2 randomized controlled trial comparing psilocybin to escitalopram, a traditional SSRI, Nutt found the latter didn't spark the same magic.\n\n\"The SSRI did not increase brain connectivity, and it actually did not improve well-being as much as psilocybin,\" Nutt said. \"Now for the first time you've got the brain science lining up with what patients say after a trip: 'I feel more connected. I can think more freely. I can escape from negative thoughts, and I don't get trapped in them.' \"\n\nTaking a psychedelic doesn't work for everyone, Johnson stressed, \"but when it works really well it's like, 'Oh my god, it's a cure for PTSD or for depression.' If people really have changed the way their brain is automatically hardwired to respond to triggers for anxiety, depression, smoking -- that's a real thing.\"\n\nHow long do results last? In studies where patients were given just one dose of a psychedelic \"a couple of people were better eight years later, but for the majority of those with chronic depression it creeps back after four or five months,\" Nutt said.\n\n\"What we do with those people is unknown,\" he added. \"One possibility is to give another dose of the psychedelic -- we don't know if that would work or not, but it might. Or we could put them on an SSRI as soon as they've got their mood improved and see if that can hold the depression at bay.\n\n\"There are all sorts of ways we could try to address that question,\" Nutt said, \"but we just don't know the answer yet.\"\n\nWhat about microdosing?\n\nThe mycelium, or root-like structure, of Lion's mane mushroom is part of the \"Stamets Stack.\"\n\nStamets, who over the last 40 years has discovered four new species of psychedelic mushrooms and written seven books on the topic, said he believes microdosing is a solution. That's the practice of taking tiny amounts of a psilocybin mushroom several times a week to maintain brain health and a creative perspective on life.\n\nA typical microdose is 0.1 to 0.3 grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms, as compared to the 25-milligram pill of psilocybin that creates the full-blown psychedelic experience.\n\nStamets practices microdosing, and has focused on a process called \"stacking,\" in which a microdose of mushrooms is taken with additional substances believed to boost the fungi's benefits. His famous \"Stamets Stack\" includes niacin, or vitamin B3, and the mycelium, or rootlike structure, of an unusual mushroom called Lion's mane.\n\nSurveys of microdosers obtained on his website have shown significantly positive benefits from the practice of taking small doses.\n\n\"These are self-reported citizen scientists projects and we have now around 14,000 people in our app where you register yourself and report your microdose,\" Stamets told an audience at the 2022 Life Itself conference, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.\n\n\"I'm going to say something provocative, but I believe it to my core: Psilocybin makes nicer people,\" Stamets told the audience. \"Psilocybin will make us more intelligent, and better citizens.\"\n\nScientific studies so far have failed to find any benefits from microdosing, leaving many researchers skeptical. \"People like being on it, but that doesn't validate the claims of microdosing,\" Johnson said. \"People like being on a little bit of cocaine, too.\"\n\nExperimental psychologist Harriet de Wit, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at the University of Chicago, was excited to study microdosing because it solves a key problem of scientific research in the field -- it's hard to blind people to what they are taking if they begin to trip. Microdosing solves that problem because people don't feel an effect from the tiny dose.\n\nDe Wit specializes in determining whether a drug's impact is due to the drug or what scientists call the \"placebo effect,\" a positive expectation that can cause improvement without the drug.\n\nShe published a study in early 2022 that mimicked real-world microdosing of LSD, except neither the participants nor researchers knew what was in the pills the subjects took.\n\n\"We measured all kinds of different behavioral and psychological responses, and the only thing we saw is that LSD at very low doses produced some stimulant-like effects at first, which then faded,\" de Wit said.\n\nThe placebo effect is powerful, she added, which might explain why the few additional studies done on it have also failed to find any positive results.\n\n\"I suspect microdosing may have an effect on mood, and over time it might build up resilience or improve well-being,\" Nutt said. \"But I don't think it will rapidly fragment depression like macrodosing and going on a trip.\"\n\nA need for caution\n\nObviously, not all hallucinogenic experiences are positive, so nearly every study on psychedelic drugs has included therapists trained to intercede if a trip turns bad and maximize the outcome if the trip is good.\n\n\"This is about allowing someone access into deeper access into their own mental processes, with hopefully greater insight. While others might disagree, it does seem very clear that you need therapy to maximize the benefits,\" Johnson said.\n\nThere are also side effects from psychedelics that go beyond a bad trip. LSD, mescaline and DMT, which is the active ingredient in ayahuasca tea, can increase blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Ayahuasca tea can also induce vomiting. LSD can cause tremors, numbness and weakness, while the use of mescaline can lead to uncoordinated movements. People hunting for psychedelic mushrooms can easily mistake a toxic species for one with psilocybin, \"leading to unintentional, fatal poisoning.\"\n\nAnother issue: Not everyone is a candidate for psychedelic treatment. It won't work on people currently on SSRIs -- the receptors in their brains are already flooded with serotonin. People diagnosed with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, or who have a family history of psychosis are always screened out of clinical trials, said Frederick Barrett, associate director of the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins.\n\n\"If you have a vulnerability to psychosis, it could be that exposing you to a psychedelic could unmask that psychosis or could lead to a psychotic event,\" Barnes said.\n\nThen there are the thousands of people with mental health concerns who will never agree to undergo a psychedelic trip. For those people, scientists such as Roth are attempting to find an alternative approach. He and his team recently identified the mechanisms by which psychedelics bond to the brain's serotonin receptors and are using the knowledge to identify new compounds.\n\n\"Our hope is that we can use this information to ultimately make drugs that mimic the benefits of psychedelic drugs without the psychedelic experience,\" Roth said.\n\n\"What if we could give people who are depressed or suffer from PTSD or anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder a medication, and they could wake up the next day and be fine without any side effects? That would be transformative.\"", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/health/sids-potential-cause-wellness/index.html", "title": "Study identifies potential biomarker for SIDS, but these are very ...", "text": "(CNN) Australian researchers say they've identified one potential biomarker for sudden infant death syndrome, known as SIDS, but experts caution that it's just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nAbout 3,400 babies die from SIDS in the US each year. There is no immediate or obvious cause of death, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Experts don't know which babies are at risk for SIDS or what causes it.\n\nFor their study, published May 6 in the journal eBioMedicine , the researchers measured levels of an enzyme called butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in blood samples from 67 newborns who died of SIDS and other unknown causes between 2016 and 2020. They compared these levels with those in the blood of 655 babies in a control group and found that the children who died of SIDS had significantly lower BChE levels than living children or those who died of other causes.\n\nSIDS usually happens when a child is sleeping. Experts have speculated that it's associated with problems in the part of an infant's brain that controls breathing and waking. BChE is an enzyme of the cholinergic system, part of the autonomic system, which controls functions like blood pressure and breathing. The study authors say more research is needed to determine whether BChE tests might be able to identify and prevent future SIDS cases.\n\nSmoking during pregnancy is one of the risk factors for SIDS, along with things like family history and premature birth. The researchers noted that animal studies have shown a tie between secondhand smoke and lower BChE. However, many other changes in the first six months of life are also likely to affect these enzymes and the nervous system in general.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Katherine Dillinger", "Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/15/systemic-racism-what-does-mean/5343549002/", "title": "Systemic racism: What does it mean and how can you help dismantle it", "text": "Civil rights leaders and advocates are demanding an end to systemic racism, a reference to the systems in place that create and maintain racial inequality in nearly every facet of life for people of color.\n\nOver the summer, thousands took to the streets in the wake of George Floyd's death to demand an end to police brutality and racism. At the same time, the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionally affected African Americans in communities across the country, continues to spread.\n\n\"This is not about one incident,\" said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. \"This is about the systemic and pervasive nature of racism in this nation that must be addressed.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about systemic racism.\n\nRacism, white privilege:How to talk to your family, friends about it\n\nWhat do we tell our children?:How to talk about George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor with kids\n\nWhat is systemic racism?\n\nJohnson defined systemic racism, also called structural racism or institutional racism, as \"systems and structures that have procedures or processes that disadvantages African Americans.\"\n\nGlenn Harris, president of Race Forward and publisher of Colorlines, defined it as \"the complex interaction of culture, policy and institutions that holds in place the outcomes we see in our lives.\"\n\n\"Systemic racism is naming the process of white supremacy,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris said systemic racism creates disparities in many \"success indicators\" including wealth, the criminal justice system, employment, housing, health care, politics and education. He said that although the concept dates back to work done by scholar and civil rights pioneer W. E. B. Du Bois, the concept was first named during the civil rights movement of the 1960s and was further refined in the 1980s.\n\nGeorge Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?'\n\nHow does systemic racism affect people of color?\n\nStructural racism prevents or makes it more challenging for people of color to participate in society and in the economy. While structural racism manifests itself in what appears to be separate institutions, Harris emphasized that factors like housing insecurity, the racial wealth gap, education and policing are intimately connected.\n\nHarris used the example of housing, explaining that today, a disproportionate number of people of color are homeless or lack housing security in part due to the legacy of redlining. Black people make up nearly half of the homeless population, despite making up only 13% of the population, according to a Department of Housing and Urban Development report presented to Congress in January.\n\nRedlining refers to the system used by banks and the real estate industry in the 20th century to determine which neighborhoods would get loans to buy homes, and neighborhoods where people of color lived — outlined in red ink — were deemed the riskiest to invest in.\n\n\"Redlining basically meant it was fundamentally impossible for Black and brown people to get loans,\" Harris said. \"It was an active way of enforcing segregation.\"\n\n12 charts:These graphs show how racial disparities persist across wealth, health, education and beyond\n\nThis practice prevented Black families from amassing and maintaining wealth in the same way that white families could, resulting in the growth of the racial wealth gap and housing insecurity which persists today, Harris said. The net worth of a typical white family ($171,000) is nearly 10 times greater than that of a Black family ($17,150), according to the Federal Reserve's 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances.\n\nRedlining was banned in 1968, but the areas deemed \"hazardous\" by the federal Home Owners’ Loan Corp. from 1935 to 1939 are still much more likely than other areas to be home to lower-income, minority residents, a 2018 study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found.\n\nSurvey:Percentage grows among Americans who say black people experience a 'great deal' of discrimination\n\nHarris said the areas that were redlined also didn't have the tax base to support robust public schools, health care systems or transportation, leading to issues of public safety and thus overpolicing.\n\n\"The system is set up in that way structurally to drive a continuous outcome of disinvestment and therefore disproportionate outcomes,\" Harris said. \"And at its worst, these most heinous outcomes of over-policing that result ultimately in the loss of life.\"\n\nHarris noted that this is just one example and this type of analysis could be applied to issues of voting rights,employment, health disparities as well.\n\nHow can systemic racism be addressed?\n\nBoth Johnson and Harris say that not enough progress has been made in the fight against systemic racism.\n\nJohnson outlined three steps people can take to address systemic racism. We must \"acknowledge that racism actually exists,\" get involved with organizations that are fighting it, and finally elect leaders and policy makers who won't reinforce or support structurally racist policies.\n\n\"Racism is not a partisan issue, and we need to stop making it a partisan issue,\" Johnson said. \"It's a question of morality.\"\n\nHow you can help:100 ways you can take action against racism right now\n\nHarris said individuals doing personal work to understand systemic racism is \"necessary, yet it's so not sufficient.\" He urged those wanting to enact change to join those protesting in the streets and to demand fundamental change from institutions in their own lives.\n\n\"It requires us to move beyond reform,\" he said. \"Articulate clearly that the current system is not working.\"\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/16/cost-college-top-universities-pay-off-most-stanford-princeton/1742297001/", "title": "The top 50 US colleges that pay off the most 2019", "text": "Abigail Hess\n\nCNBC\n\nEach year, high school students across the U.S. march through campuses on guided tours, pore over course catalogs, and frantically check mailboxes and inboxes for letters granting them admission to the next phase of life: college.\n\nMost are facing significant financial questions. Research consistently demonstrates that college graduates earn more than their peers without degrees. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Americans with a bachelor’s degree have median weekly earnings of $1,173, compared with just $712 a week for those who have a high school diploma. Still, experts urge high school students to think carefully before taking on significant amounts of debt to finance a college degree.\n\nDon't overpack:7 things college freshmen don't need – and 10 they do\n\nUgly is in:Crocs have taken over teen footwear\n\nCollege costs can be difficult to estimate, and even for college applicants with the foresight to research things like debt balances at graduation and average alumni salaries, outcomes can be challenging to quantify. Sticker prices published by universities do not include grants, scholarships or loans. Financial aid awards can change from year to year. Housing, travel, books and other personal expenses can add up quickly.\n\nAnd less than half, 41%, of first-time, full-time college students earn their bachelor’s degree in four years. Many of them end up paying for more than four years of college, driving up the cost of attendance significantly.\n\nCNBC Make It set out to capture the information students would need to balance these considerations. The result is our first list of the U.S. colleges that pay off the most, a ranking that spotlights 50 schools that provide students the highest average salaries for their tuition dollars.\n\nWe started by identifying the true net cost of each college for the typical American student — including tuition, fees, books, supplies and other expenses — after subtracting scholarships and grants. Using data from Tuition Tracker, a tool created by education-focused nonprofit news organization The Hechinger Report, we looked at the net cost for students from families making between $48,001 and $75,000, an income range established by the Department of Education. We chose to focus on this bracket because it includes the median U.S. household income, $61,372.\n\nWells Fargo:Earnings top estimates on strong consumer checking\n\nTesla:Employees say they took shortcuts to meet aggressive production goals\n\nThe Hechinger Report calculates net cost by subtracting federal, state, local and institutional grants and scholarships from the sticker price for first-time, full-time (and, at public universities, in-state) undergraduates based on data provided by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThen, using data from PayScale’s College Salary Report, we divided net cost by graduates’ expected annual earnings, which was calculated based on the median salary of graduates with less than five years of experience as well as those with 10 or more years of experience. The ranking gives greater weight to workers’ earnings in the years immediately after college, when individuals are the most impacted by college costs and student debt. (You can read our full methodology here.)\n\nWe excluded tuition-free institutions from the list, including military schools like West Point and U.S. Naval Academy, because the cost of post-college military service introduces an additional factor that’s challenging to measure against other schools.\n\nStanford University takes first place on the list. According to The Hechinger Report, the net cost for a student from a family that earns between $48,001 and $75,000 is $4,061 per year. Stanford graduates with more than 10 years of experience report average salaries of $143,100.\n\nAccording to PayScale, 51% of Stanford students major in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) field, a factor that contributes to high average salaries among graduates. And Stanford is known for providing robust financial aid. The average scholarship and grant total for students from families making less than $65,000 a year is $74,095 per year. Students from families making between $65,000 and $95,000 receive $65,050 on average in scholarships and grant aid.\n\nWhile Princeton, Harvard and Yale get top marks, a wide range of schools from across the U.S. are represented here. State schools like the University of Washington-Seattle, small liberal arts colleges like Pomona College and STEM-focused schools like MIT also appear on this list, indicating that you don’t have to attend the Ivy League to get a great return on your college investment.\n\nHere is CNBC Make It’s 2019 list of the top 50 U.S. colleges that pay off the most:\n\nThe top 25 private universities\n\n1.

Consider pursuing a degree in a high-paying field. Earning a degree in a STEM field can help students at any college prepare themselves for in-demand high-paying jobs. Students can keep costs low by keeping on pace with their requirements and graduating on time. Additional semesters of college can be expensive and in some cases, scholarship and grant aid does not apply for semesters beyond the standard four years.\n\nBut the most significant step students can take to ensure their college degree pays off is, simply, to complete their college degree. Just 60% of college students complete their bachelor’s in six years and many drop out altogether, and one of the worst outcomes for students is taking on loans for a degree they do not complete. The economic benefits of earning a bachelor’s degree are still significant, and if students study hard and play their cards right, college can pay off big time.\n\n©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

He did so several weeks after discovering the affair, the publication said.\n\nThe two billionaires have been friends for many years, with Brin providing about $500,000 of funding for Tesla in 2008, when the company was struggling financially, the Journal said.\n\nMusk reportedly dropped to one knee in front of Brin at a party earlier this year to ask for forgiveness over the affair, it added.\n\nMusk, Brin and Shanahan did not immediately respond to CNN Business when reached for comment.

Musk had sought to buy the company but backed out earlier this month, accusing the social media company of failing to turn over vital information relating to the number of bots on its platform — a claim Twitter denies.\n\nIn May, Musk denied allegations that he sexually harassed a SpaceX flight attendant in 2016. In June, one of Musk's children petitioned a California court to recognize her new name and gender, saying she no longer wishes to be related to her famous and wealthy father \"in any way, shape or form.\" And last month, Insider reported Musk welcomed twins last year with an executive at one of his companies, Neuralink.\n\nMusk said Monday a tweet that \"the character assassination attacks have reached a new level this year.\"\n\n— Clare Duffy contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/business/nightcap-elon-musk-affair-economy-recession/index.html", "title": "The messy world of Elon Musk | CNN Business", "text": "This story is part of CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York (CNN Business) Just when we think Elon Musk might keep his head down to focus on running his many companies, fighting a high-stakes legal battle with Twitter, or spending time with any of his 10 children, a fresh scandal breaks to feed the drama tornado that is the world's richest person.\n\nICYMI: That celebrity gossip rag the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had a brief affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google's co-founder, Sergey Brin — who also happened to be Musk's pal and once gave him half a million dollars when Tesla was on ropes.\n\nAccording to the Journal, that brief affair prompted Brin to file for divorce.\n\nMusk called the report \"total bs\" in a tweet on Monday, adding, \"I work crazy hours, so there just isn't much time for shenanigans.\" (Though, I gotta say, Elon, the existence of twins you reportedly fathered with a woman who works for you at Neuralink might suggest there is time for shenanigans.)\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nWe really couldn't care less about whom Musk decides to sleep with, but there's a reason the WSJ (and the people behind this newsletter) think it's important to put a critical spotlight on the globe's most powerful and wealthy humans.\n\nAs the CEO of Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, Musk is the guy behind the wheel when it comes to the future of all-electric and self-driving cars. As the head of SpaceX he's launching real human beings into space and hopes to one day colonize Mars. Neuralink wants to develop an implantable computer chip for the human brain.\n\nYou don't get to have ambitions on that scale without encountering some scrutiny of your character. So far, that scrutiny has raised a lot of questions about Musk's conduct, even beyond his daily outbursts on Twitter and occasional quixotic corporate raiding.\n\nMusk has been accused of exposing himself to a flight attendant at SpaceX, which he denied.\n\nOne of his children has openly disavowed him.\n\nA former Tesla employee is suing the company, arguing that it fosters a climate of sexual harassment.\n\nTesla reportedly paid a firm to monitor employees' Facebook interactions when some workers wanted to form a union.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nCEOs of publicly traded companies are public figures, and the way they conduct their personal affairs offers insight into the way they run their companies.\n\nAccording to WSJ, when Brin learned of Musk's alleged betrayal, the Google co-founder told his advisers to sell all of his financial investments in Musk's companies. It's unclear how much those investments amounted to or whether the sales were actually made. But that is exactly the kind of personal-meets-professional collision that should make shareholders uneasy.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: $350 MILLION\n\nT-Mobile will pay $350 million to settle multiple class-action suits stemming from a data breach affecting tens of millions of people. In a proposed settlement announced Friday, T-Mobile also agreed to spend an extra $150 million on cybersecurity.\n\nThat $350 million is a lot of dough, but it'll be split among the lawyers and the nearly 77 million customers whose personal data was hacked. That'll probably translate to a few bucks per person. But in this economy, that's something.\n\nRECESSION VIBES\n\nIn the not-too-distant future there are going to be countless books written about the economy of the era I'm tentatively dubbing the Stupid 20s.\n\nChapter 1: Covid.\n\nChapter 2: Supply chains.\n\nChapter 3: Inflation.\n\nChapter 4: Recession (?)\n\n...\n\nChapter 38: It's 2027 And We Can All Take a Deep Breath Now. All Hail President Beyoncé.\n\nAnyway, point is, stuff's real weird right now — economically, politically, culturally. But you signed up for a business newsletter, so we're going to gloss over those latter two subjects and focus on our Decidedly Weird Economy.\n\nHere's the deal: Even the world's foremost economists are scratching their heads right now. Why are consumers spending so much money but saying they're pessimistic? How can the labor market be so strong while output is dropping? Are we in a recession, or headed for one, and honestly how are we even defining \"recession\" these days?\n\n\"If you're not a little confused about the economy, you're not paying attention,\" tweeted Jason Furman, a former White House economic adviser.\n\nIn short: No one knows what's going on, primarily because the pandemic took a wrecking ball not only to the economy itself but to the models that economists have spent decades developing to try to measure and report on, well, everything.\n\nIn the absence of certainty, speculation is running wild. That has some experts worried we'll actually end up talking ourselves into a recession.\n\nHear me out: There's a pretty sound theory that the more we talk about the R-word, the more likely it is we'll end up in one. It's kinda like skiing down a mountain — the more you worry about running into a tree the more likely you are to bonk into one.\n\nEven a casual reader of news — or Twitter or Instagram or TikTok — is, consciously or not, soaking up concerns about inflation and a looming recession. When that unease takes root, it changes the way we spend. If we believe rampant inflation is here to stay, we'll lock in purchases sooner than later, which translates to higher demand and therefore higher prices ... and so on. If we believe a recession is inevitable, then it hardly matters whether it's technically a recession or not. When the vibe is off, the vibe is off.\n\nThe White House is already trying to get ahead of potential bad news on the economic front this week, when the Commerce Department releases its initial report on second-quarter growth. In a blog post last week, officials sought to reinforce the idea that the definition of a recession isn't as clear cut as you might think.\n\n\"While some maintain that two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP constitute a recession, that is neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle,\" the White House wrote. \"Instead, both official determinations of recessions and economists' assessment of economic activity are based on a holistic look at the data — including the labor market, consumer and business spending, industrial production, and incomes.\"\n\nTranslation: Even if the second-quarter data shows another contraction, that doesn't automatically make it a recession. This is more than just a politically convenient fact for the Biden administration. In the United States, there's an obscure cadre of eight economists who are in charge of declaring when we're in a recession. And as my colleague Nicole Goodkind wrote recently , that group of eight known as the Business Cycle Dating Committee — which sounds like the worst matchmaking app of all time — abides by a relatively vague definition that allows for wiggle room: A recession, they write, \"involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\"\n\nIt's the economist's version of the Justice Potter Stewart's famed \"I know it when I see it\" test.", "authors": ["Analysis Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/957446/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-25-july-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 25 July 2022 | The Week UK", "text": "Sunak and Truss asylum plans ‘cruel’\n\nBoth of the Tory leadership candidates have been accused of “cruelty and immorality” for promising more Rwanda-style deals to remove asylum seekers from the UK.

The company has said that less than 5% of its daily active users are spam accounts.\n\n\"My offer was based on Twitter's SEC filings being accurate,\" Musk tweeted. \"Yesterday, Twitter's CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%. This deal cannot move forward until he does.\"\n\nMusk doubled down later in the day, publishing a Twitter poll to his more than 93 million followers with the prompt: \"Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?\"\n\nHe also tagged the SEC's verified Twitter handle in a subsequent tweet . He appeared to invite the regulator, with whom he has clashed in the past , to look into the matter by asking, \"anyone home?\"\n\nThe latest tweets from Musk appeared to cast more doubt on the $44 billion deal. Musk on Friday declared it was \"temporarily on hold\" but that he's \"still committed to acquisition.\" That pivot from Musk fueled speculation that the world's richest man may be using the debate over bots to secure a better price for Twitter, either as a negotiating tactic or out of necessity\n\nTwitter's shares were down 1.7% in premarket trading Tuesday. The stock has erased all its gains in the weeks since Musk disclosed his stake the company and is now trading at $36.80 per share — well below Musk's offer price of $54.20 per share.\n\n\"Twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Musk exchanged a series of tweets with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal about the spam account issue.\n\nTwitter TWTR suspends \"over half a million spam accounts every day,\" Agrawal wrote . He also reiterated the 5% statistic, saying that estimate is based on \"multiple human reviews ... of thousands of accounts\" sampled at random. Twitter has previously acknowledged that while it believes its estimates to be \"reasonable,\" the measurements were not independently verified and the actual number of fake or spam accounts could be higher.\n\nAgrawal's initial 13 tweets were met with a reply from Musk that was reflective of the unusual and extremely online nature of the deal: a poop emoji\n\nMusk followed up with a somewhat more thoughtful question. \"So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money?\" Musk asked \"This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,\" he added.\n\nMusk has repeatedly spoken out against bots and spam accounts on Twitter, once describing cryptocurrency spam bots as the platform's \"single most annoying problem.\" Anyone familiar with the replies to Musk's tweets knows they are full of such scams, many of which attempt to leverage Musk's name.\n\n\"The bot issue at the end of the day ... feels more to us like the \"dog ate the homework\" excuse to bail on the Twitter deal or talk down a lower price,\" Dan Ives and John Katsingris, analysts at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nIn his Twitter thread, Agrawal said most spam campaigns on Twitter use a combination of humans and automation, rather than being primarily led by bots. Parsing through legitimate and fake accounts can be complicated, he said.\n\n\"The hard challenge is that many accounts which look fake superficially — are actually real people,\" he said . \"And some of the spam accounts which are actually the most dangerous — and cause the most harm to our users — can look totally legitimate on the surface.\"\n\nAgrawal said Twitter had been in touch with Musk on the spam issue.\n\n\"We shared an overview of the estimation process with Elon a week ago and look forward to continuing the conversation with him, and all of you,\" he added.", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar", "Allison Morrow", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/tech/elon-musk-twitter-spam/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk threatens to walk away from Twitter deal - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Elon Musk issued his most direct threat yet to walk away from his purchase of Twitter (TWTR) on Monday, openly accusing the social media company of breaching the merger agreement by not providing the data he has requested on spam and fake accounts.\n\nIn a letter to Twitter's head of legal, policy and trust, Vijaya Gadde, Musk alleged that Twitter is \"actively resisting and thwarting his information rights\" as outlined by the deal.\n\n\"This is a clear material breach of Twitter's obligations under the merger agreement and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,\" an attorney representing Musk wrote to the company.\n\nMusk has demanded that Twitter turn over information about its testing methodologies to support its claims that bots and fake accounts constitute less than 5% of the platform's active user base, a figure the company has consistently stated for years in boilerplate public disclosures.

People yawn. That yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive,\" Bezos, 57, said in a statement. \"When you look at our financial results, what you’re actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention. Right now I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition.”\n\nWho is Andy Jassy?:What to know about the next CEO of Amazon\n\nHelp, I can't afford this house: More first-time homebuyers get aid with down payments from family and friends\n\nLooking for a second chance:Ex-offenders struggle to find jobs amid pandemic\n\nLike Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Bezos is closely associated with his company's brand.\n\nSince founding Amazon as an online bookseller nearly 30 years ago, he has expanded into selling just about anything you can buy. On his watch, the company grew into a $1.7 trillion retail monolith that employs more than 1.2 million workers.\n\n“Amazon is big simply because it has given customers what they want. To grow it had to take share from other giants of retail, some of which were once seen as unassailable,” Neil Saunders, managing director of consultancy GlobalData Retail, said in a statement.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing boom\n\nAmong Amazon's biggest success stories is its cloud computing business, which launched in 2006 led by Jassy, who has long been viewed as Bezos' heir apparent. Jassy's ascension was made possible in August when the company announced that another possible successor, Jeff Wilke, would soon retire.\n\nAmazon Web Services grew out of its move to rent infrastructure online to other tech companies wanting to sell products on Amazon.com. Today it's Amazon's most profitable division.\n\nAmazon lays claim to about 45% of the global public cloud services market. Microsoft has 18%, Alibaba 9.1%, and Google 5.3%, according to Gartner Research. Amazon Web Services is now a $51 billion annual business for Amazon, the company said Tuesday.\n\n“I don’t think any of us had the audacity to predict it would grow as fast as it did,\" Jassy told Marketwatch in December 2019.\n\nIs Jeff Bezos world's richest person? Reports say Elon Musk dethroned Jeff Bezos as the world's richest person\n\nBezos the billionaire:Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is now worth more than $200 billion. Protesters built him a guillotine.\n\nIf anything, the COVID pandemic has intensified business reliance on cloud computing, Jassy recently told CNBC.\n\n“I mean if you look at the history of the cloud, I have a feeling that the pandemic will have accelerated cloud adoption in the enterprise by a few years,” Jassy said.\n\n​In a letter to employees, Bezos said that as executive chairman he would focus on new products and early initiatives. Amazon's new leader has his \"full confidence,\" Bezos said.\n\nBezos is not the first major internet figure to step aside. In 2019, Larry Page and Sergey Brin left their executive roles at Google’s parent company Alphabet.\n\nLike Bill Gates, who began his shift away from Microsoft in 2000 but stayed on as chairman until 2014, Bezos is likely to remain an influential figure at Amazon.\n\nThough Bezos stepped away from the day-to-day workings in recent years, dabbling in other ventures from a private space company Blue Origin to The Washington Post, he became more involved again last spring during the pandemic.\n\n\"Jeff will be the executive chair on the board. He will be involved in many large ... important decisions: acquisitions, things like strategy and going into grocery and other things. Jeff has always been involved in that and that is where he will keep his time focused on his new role,\" Amazon's chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky told investors.\n\nTim Hubbard, assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, said the transition may free up Bezos to focus on his other passions.\n\n\"In one way, I think it might be freeing for him to have the space to personally innovate again, without having to manage the rest of the company,\" Hubbard said in a statement. \"Given the recent successes at Amazon, especially during the pandemic, it’s going to be hard to disrupt their momentum.\"\n\nFrom exploring space to The Washington Post\n\nAfter buying The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013, Bezos gave the newspaper the financial wherewithal to achieve a turnaround by investing in newsgathering, technological upgrades and a digital subscription strategy.\n\nThe role also brought him unwanted scrutiny. During President Donald Trump's administration, the president accused Bezos of using The Post as a tool to achieve political outcomes that bettered the newspaper.\n\nIn 2019, Bezos said lawyers for supermarket tabloid National Enquirer owner American Media Inc. tried to blackmail him into getting The Post to drop its investigation into the company's ties to Trump.\n\nAt the time, he famously called his ownership of The Post a “complexifier” for him but said he was proud to stand up to what he called bullies.\n\n“It’s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,” he wrote at the time.\n\nBezos divorce from MacKenzie Scott\n\nBezos’s private life captured headlines in 2019 when he and his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, announced they were ending their 25-year marriage, shortly before the National Enquirer published a story that said he was having an affair with a former TV anchor.\n\nBezos went on to accuse the Enquirer’s publisher of threatening to print explicit pictures of him if he didn’t stop looking into how the tabloid got ahold of private messages he and his girlfriend had exchanged. The National Enquirer denied his accusations.\n\nBezos and Scott completed their divorce by August of that year, dividing shares in the company that they launched a couple of years after they were married. Bezos remained Amazon’s biggest shareholder, with a 12% stake worth roughly $110 billion at the time. Scott retained 4% of the e-commerce giant’s shares, worth more than $37 billion. She announced earlier that year that she intended to give away at least half her fortune.\n\nContributing: Nathan Bomey and Charisse Jones", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/tech/tiktok-depp-heard-trial/index.html", "title": "Johnny Depp, Amber Heard trial Tiktok posts are making accidental ...", "text": "(CNN) TikTok posts about actor Johnny Depp's defamation trial against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, have turned a stay-at-home mom based in Scotland into an accidental influencer. Or, perhaps more aptly, a DeppTok influencer.\n\nSophie Doggett, whose TikTok was previously populated by videos on everyday things such as herself or her pets, posted to her TikTok account on April 25 a clip of Heard's lawyer asking a question of a witness and then immediately objecting to the response. It is one of many moments in the trial that has been seized upon by people like Doggett, as clips of testimony and references to the case have pervaded TikTok in a way that no trial has before. That's partly because the proceeding, set to resume Monday, is being livestreamed during the age of TikTok, and also because of the high-profile celebrities the case involves.\n\nDoggett, who paired the clip to playful music, said she gained 30,000 followers seemingly overnight from the post which has, to date, been viewed more than 5 million times. Asked about her follower count before the viral post, she says it was 6,668, a number she recites by heart. In the three weeks since the post, she's collected more than 25,000 additional followers. Her account is now dedicated to Depp-related posts, some of which pertain to the trial, others to past Depp films or interviews. The top three posts pinned to Doggett's account have more than 14 million collective views.\n\nIf there's any question of where her loyalty lies, it is with Depp, something that's conveyed through the photo associated with her TikTok account — white text against a black background that reads \"Justice for Johnny Depp.\"\n\nInside the courtroom, jurors are tasked with determining whether Depp was falsely and maliciously accused of domestic abuse by Heard, which he claims cost him an estimated $50 million in damages associated with lost acting jobs. The case stems from a 2018 opinion piece published in The Washington Post wherein Heard described herself as \"a public figure representing domestic abuse.\" Although Depp is not named in the piece, Heard refers to the year 2016, a year in which she filed for a divorce and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp, claiming she'd been abused.\n\nTikTok creators are leveraging hashtags like #JusticeforJohnnyDepp to show support for the actor while using others to mock actress Amber Heard.\n\nDepp denied the allegations then, as he does now, and the two reached a divorce settlement that year, issuing a joint statement at the time. During his testimony, Depp alleged he was physically and verbally abused by Heard and denied accusations that he was physically violent toward her. Heard has countersued Depp for $100 million, claiming statements his team made were damaging to her career\n\nOnline, however, everyone from everyday users like Doggett — who said she is now able to monetize her posts through TikTok's creator fund due to the attention — to legal analysts, lifestyle influencers, activists of varying pursuits, and comedians are taking it upon themselves to dissect and analyze every minute detail of the trial, down to conspiracy theories about the way in which Heard dabbed her nose with a tissue.\n\nEmily D. Baker, a former LA deputy district attorney turned online creator, streams live legal commentary of the trial proceedings on her YouTube page, which has more than 330,000 subscribers. Her viewers increasingly request for her to respond to theories or footage they have seen on TikTok, she says.\n\n\"When you have cameras streaming in the courtroom, people are going to clock every strange behavior. And they have,\" said Baker.\n\nMany are in the comment sections on YouTube channels to cheer Depp or jeer Heard — typically in that order. Others have set up their own video broadcasts to provide ongoing commentary of the trial in real-time or devoted Instagram accounts to posting updates on the case. Perhaps most striking — because of the way in which the platform operates and how users take to it — is TikTok.\n\nLike Doggett, two other TikTok users CNN Business spoke with recounted similar stories of going from hundreds or thousands of followers to tens of thousands of followers in a matter of days due to Depp-related posts.\n\nOne TikTok user, who is based in the UK, said she posted a video on April 27 celebrating Depp for freeing his lawyer's snagged charger cord with a comment, \"the little things.\" \"I wasn't expecting anyone to reach out, or like it, or share it even,\" she said, noting that she'd originally created her account to post about films. But it has since garnered more than 10 million views. She's continued posting about the trial and she says her account has gone from fewer than 300 followers to more than 50,000.\n\nMaria Pugsley, also based in the UK, similarly told CNN Business that followers to her account grew from fewer than 10,000 to more than 37,000. Previously, she said her use of TikTok included \"jumping on the trends, really and having a bit of a laugh — it never really took off to be honest.\"\n\nBut users have taken to her commentary on the trial, in which she favors Depp and has spoken about male victims of abuse. \"In the beginning I went in very unbiased — all of my opinions are based on the courtroom,\" she said, adding: \"I am always open to having my opinion changed.\"\n\nA high-profile trial, dissected on TikTok\n\nTikTok's algorithm has been repeatedly reported upon as scary-good in its manner of feeding users more and more posts pertaining to their interests. One has to look no further than the hashtags on TikTok to gauge that sentiment there sways favorable toward the 58-year-old Depp, undoubtedly the bigger celebrity with a much longer history cultivating a fanbase compared to 36-year-old Heard. Doggett noted that she hadn't personally come across posts on TikTok in support of Heard: \"Maybe a couple people [in comments sections] saying 'Team Amber.' They get destroyed in the comments.\"\n\nOne hashtag, #JusticeForJohnnyDepp, has garnered more than 11 billion views globally, while just the actor's name has more than 19 billion, and #JohnnyDeppisInnocent has garnered more than 3 billion. Users are applying filters to their faces to personify Depp, combining clips of testimonies with past footage from Depp's film archives. By contrast, #JusticeForAmberHeard has 41 million views. Heard's name has garnered more than 9 billion views and #AmberTurd has 1.6 billion (a hashtag fueled by trial testimony concerning fecal matter.) Meanwhile, the #AmberHeardIsALiar had drawn more than 2 billion views when CNN Business reviewed it Friday afternoon, but the hashtag no longer appeared viewable in the app as of Friday evening.\n\n\"What you're seeing is fan base versus fan base,\" Juda Engelmayer, a public relations professional who has worked with high-profile figures, such as disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein who was convicted for sex crimes, and is currently working with the fake heiress Anna Sorokin. \"It was surprising to me that the social media throngs and supporters are almost entirely backing him.\"\n\nThe passionate social media posts surrounding the case are, at times, rooted in other factors. Some see outsized support for Depp, and the dismissal of Heard's allegations, as another example of internalized misogyny. Others, including men's rights activists, have lifted up Depp in online forums as a rare well-known man who alleges he experienced domestic abuse at the hands of a woman, thereby bringing light to the issue.\n\nAccording to Daniel Klug, a systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon University's Institute for Software Research who has researched TikTok's algorithm, \"TikTok creates a sort of mediated reality for the user.\"\n\n\"Over a time period, you see a lot of short videos ... depending on what kind of content you see, let's say a lot of content about the trial, that creates a certain perception of the reality of the trial for you on TikTok,\" he said, noting that posts tends to fall into two categories: those that capture testimonies from Heard, Depp, or others on the stand \"describing very personal and intimate and weird details of their relationship,\" or content related to Depp or the trial that is \"remixed or reinterpreted by other users.\"\n\nCallum Hood, head of research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate which recently investigated abuse directed at several high-profile women, including Heard, on Instagram similarly noted that the nature of TikTok is such that \"you get very, very slim segments of the trial presented and usually with a very heavy skew.\"\n\n\"This applies as much to [content posted about] Ukraine as clips of the Amber Heard, Johnny Depp trial,\" said Hood, noting that \"content on TikTok, more so than any other platform, is free of context ... We tend to know less about the account that's posting it, less about when it was posted, less about where the material is from, about the motivations of the person posting it ... I've got a lot of sympathy for the users because it is genuinely very hard, with the information available to you in the app, to understand the context and to make an assessment of how true or false it is.\"\n\nCenter for Countering Digital Hate's report noted that discussions of Depp and Heard's legal battles on social media \"often contain abuse towards Heard, as well as the promotion of conspiracy theories around the rate of women's false allegations of domestic abuse.\"\n\nTrial-related content on TikTok varies from those who are analyzing and conspiracy theorizing to attempts to poke fun, which can quickly become distasteful. One popular variation of posts is based on satirical reenactments using audio from Heard's testimony, in which she said, \"I was walking out of the bedroom, [he] slapped me across the face and I turned to look at him and I said, 'Johnny, you hit me. You just hit me.'\" One widely-shared post, featured a cat role playing the former couple. It wears a blond wig when playing the part of Heard and a paper mustache and bandana when playing the part of Depp. While the original post is no longer viewable, it had been \"dueted\" by other accounts — a TikTok feature that enables users to post a video side-by-side one from another user in order to react to it — which can still be found on the platform.\n\nFor its part, TikTok said it removes content that violates its policies, which include \"threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual.\" There may be some leeway in the case of Heard and Depp, as its community guidelines note that \"critical comments of public figures may be allowed; however, serious abusive behavior against public figures is prohibited.\"\n\n\"I believe I was mass reported over political differences\"\n\nThere are also questions about whether and how others on the platform may be able to silence certain voices or opinions.\n\nOne TikTok user named Ashley, who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy reasons, posted about how she felt some men's rights activists were using the trial as an excuse to discredit allegations by women of abuse.\n\n\"Can you imagine the leeway every narcissistic woman-hating man is going to have now?\" she said in the post. Ashley told CNN Business that the post was quickly \"dueted\" and she received threats in the comments, then her account was banned.\n\nIn a message on April 26, Ashley — who is based in Pittsburgh and had 7,000 followers — asked TikTok to restore her account, \"I believe I was mass reported over political differences,\" she wrote, adding that she had screenshots of threatening messages she had received. Asked about her account by CNN Business last week, TikTok said it would investigate it.

The jury returned no verdict on three of the charges concerning defrauding investors, and Judge Edward Davila, who is presiding over the case, is expected to declare a mistrial on those charges.\n\nWhat is 'flurona' and how serious is it?\n\nThe charges Holmes was found guilty of include one count of conspiracy to defraud investors, as well as three wire fraud counts tied to specific investors. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count.\n\nHolmes departed the courthouse hand-in-hand with her partner, Billy Evans, her mother and her father. She was met with a sea of cameras and reporters but did not comment in response to questions shouted from reporters.\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Attorney Stephanie Hinds applauded the verdict.\n\n\"The jurors in this 15-week trial navigated a complex case amid a pandemic and scheduling obstacles,\" she said, in a statement that was read aloud by a spokesperson outside the courthouse. \"The guilty verdicts in this case reflect Ms. Holmes' culpability in this large-scale investor fraud, and she must now face sentencing for her crimes.\"\n\nNotably, the jury of eight men and four women determined that Holmes was guilty on counts pertaining to investors, but none of the counts that pertained to defrauding patients. Over the course of its 11-week case, the government called just three patient witnesses to the stand, two of whom were individually tied to wire fraud counts.\n\nThe jury deliberated for over 50 hours before returning a verdict on eight of the 11 charges. Earlier Monday, the jury returned a note indicating they could not reach a unanimous verdict on three of the counts. In response, Judge Davila issued what is known as an Allen charge, instructing them to continue deliberating to try to reach a verdict.\n\nHowever, hours later, the jury returned another note that indicated it remained unable to reach a verdict on those counts. The counts pertained to three of the investor wire fraud charges.\n\nThe verdict comes after a trial that spanned over three months at a federal courthouse in San Jose. More than 30 witnesses testified during the trial, culminating with Holmes, who took the stand for seven days in her own defense.\n\nHolmes' case marked a rare criminal fraud trial of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Jurors were tasked with determining whether Holmes was a well-meaning founder who made mistakes as she built her startup, as her defense posited, or whether she intentionally deceived investors and patients in order to help herself and her company succeed, as federal prosecutors alleged.\n\nElizabeth Holmes is kissed on her head by her father in federal court in San Jose, California, on January 3, 2022.\n\nWhile Holmes was the one on trial, the outcome of her case could serve as a cautionary tale for others in Silicon Valley.\n\n\"This is a verdict that should matter not just to Silicon Valley but to the people who celebrate it, invest in it and use its products,\" said Margaret O'Mara, a historian of the tech industry and professor at the University of Washington. \"She was made possible by a Valley business culture that celebrated and encouraged very young, marginally experienced people.\"\n\nGeorge Demos, a former Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor and adjunct law professor at the UC Davis School of Law, called the verdict \"a significant win for the government and sends a powerful signal to Silicon Valley that fraud cannot masquerade as innovation.\"\n\nWhile much of Silicon Valley has tried to distance itself from Theranos for a variety of reasons, including that the startup was a medical device manufacturer, the power and control Holmes wielded over Theranos had all the trappings of a tech company, O'Mara said.\n\n\"She was not just the CEO,\" O'Mara said, \"she was a very powerful CEO in the Silicon Valley model.\"\n\nThe rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes\n\nHolmes, now 37, started Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 and soon thereafter dropped out of Stanford to pursue it full-time. After a decade under the radar, Holmes began courting the press with claims that Theranos had invented technology that could accurately and reliably test for a range of conditions using just a few drops of blood taken from a finger prick. The unveiling coincided with the company's announcement in 2013 of a major retail partnership with Walgreens.\n\nTheranos raised $945 million from an impressive list of investors, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, Walmart's Walton family and the billionaire family of former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.\n\nAt its peak, Theranos was valued at $9 billion, making Holmes a paper billionaire. She was lauded on magazine covers, frequently wearing a signature black turtleneck that invited comparisons to the late Apple CEO. (She has not worn that look in the courtroom.)\n\nElizabeth Holmes during an interview in September 2015.\n\nO'Mara said Holmes was particularly beloved by the media as an intrepid entrepreneur working on a product that aimed to make the world better -- and a rare female founder at that.\n\nBut the dominoes started to fall after a Wall Street Journal investigation in 2015 found the company had only ever performed roughly a dozen of the hundreds of tests it offered using its proprietary blood testing device, and with questionable accuracy. Instead, Theranos was relying on third-party manufactured devices from traditional blood testing companies.\n\nIn 2016, Theranos voided two years of blood test results. In 2018, Holmes and Theranos settled \" massive fraud\" charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not admit to or deny any of the allegations as part of the deal. Theranos dissolved soon after\n\nThe scene inside and outside the courtroom\n\nFirst indicted in 2018, Holmes' trial was delayed by the pandemic and the birth of her child. But public interest in Holmes has remained strong since then, with documentaries, podcasts, an upcoming TV miniseries and a planned feature film.\n\nThat fascination was apparent outside the courtroom. Members of the public and the press gathered as early as 2 a.m. local time on major days of the trial to get one of the 34 courtroom seats available. A ticketed overflow room sat another roughly 45 people. There was otherwise no way to view the events because audio and video recordings were prohibited.\n\nThe trial drew apparent friends of Holmes, some of whom showed up on the day of opening statements dressed in a look that resembled the former CEO at Theranos' peak -- clad in black attire with blonde hair pulled back at the nape of their necks. It also attracted an artist who set up a performance art display outside the courthouse, selling a very limited number of blonde wigs, black turtlenecks and \"blood energy\" drinks. She said she wanted to see \"what it was like experiencing her energy.\"\n\nDuring jury selection, the father of Holmes' partner showed up early to snag a seat inside the courtroom. He assumed a nickname and claimed to be a concerned citizen, but on the first day of the trial he walked into the courtroom alongside Holmes. After his identity was revealed publicly, he wasn't seen again at the trial.\n\nTheranos founder and former CEO Elizabeth Holmes arrives for her trial at the Robert F. Peckham Federal Building on December 07, 2021 in San Jose, California.\n\nFor her part, Holmes -- wearing a work dress and jacket or skirt suit in greys, blues or greens with a green or blue mask -- arrived each court day walking hand-in-hand with either her mother, Noel, or her partner, Billy Evans, or both. When Holmes took the stand, the group of friends and family sitting in reserved seating swelled. Her father was seen in the courtroom during closing arguments.\n\nAs the trial went on, three jurors were dismissed. One juror was reported by another for playing Sudoku during the proceedings. Another was excused after disclosing she was experiencing anxiety stemming from the prospect of sending Holmes to prison, and cited her Buddhist beliefs. The alternate juror tapped to replace her expressed some concern about sentencing Holmes because she is very young. She remained on the jury tasked with determining Holmes' fate.\n\nThe government's 11-week case against Holmes\n\nIn its closing arguments, the prosecution alleged that, faced with a business running out of money, Holmes \"chose fraud\" rather than \"failure.\"\n\nDuring the trial, federal prosecutors called 29 witnesses to testify, including former Theranos employees, retail executives and a former US Defense Secretary. Through these witnesses, the government attempted to show the layers of the alleged fraud, including how Theranos concealed its use of third-party manufactured machines to test patient blood, overstated its financials, misrepresented its work with pharmaceutical companies and the military, and used the media to perpetuate the untruths.\n\nIn his final remarks, prosecutor John Bostic said Holmes was \"especially fond of using\" half-truths, which he described as something that is \"arguably technically correct, but still leaves the listener with an unmistakable incorrect understanding about what the truth is.\"\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos Inc., left center, departs from federal court with, from left, husband Billy Evans, parents Noel Holmes and Christian Holmes IV in San Jose, California, U.S., on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022.\n\nAs an example of that, he pointed to journalist Roger Parloff's recordings of interviews with Holmes done in conjunction with a 2014 Fortune Magazine cover story that were played in court during the reporter's time on the stand. Holmes is heard rationalizing why some patients had their blood taken through venipuncture rather than solely its marketed fingerstick blood draws. \"At no point during that conversation did she tell Mr. Parloff that the reason ... was that the company's own technology could not do the range of tests that she was offering,\" said Bostic.\n\n\"It does not matter whether Ms. Holmes had the intent to make the lie true or to avoid being found out. The problem is in making the misrepresentations on the day it's made,\" he added.\n\nBostic also said Holmes \"borrowed the credibility\" of others, through her startup's high-profile retail partnerships, her magazine cover pieces and her board stocked with powerful names, including former Defense Secretaries and two former Secretaries of State.\n\n\"By attaching herself to these individuals and organizations,\" he continued, \"she bolstered Theranos' own credibility, and by exaggerating those contexts, she caused others to believe that Theranos must have the legitimacy of those other entities.\"\n\nElizabeth Holmes listens as the clerk is reading the verdict and her family is clutching each other's hands in federal court in San Jose, California, on January 3, 2022.\n\nHolmes testifies for 7 days in her own defense\n\nThe defense called three witnesses, concluding with Holmes. Known for her charm and charisma while CEO, Holmes' testimony ranged from speaking emphatically about her belief in the company's technology to pointing the finger at others -- notably, her ex-boyfriend and former Theranos COO Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani.\n\nWhile the origin story of Theranos is well-known, Holmes shed more light on her decision to drop out of Stanford. She testified she had been raped as a student and was having trouble attending classes. She said she left school to throw herself into building what became Theranos, seeking business advice from Balwani, 20 years her senior, whom she had met after graduating from high school and whom she viewed as a successful tech executive.\n\nHolmes testified she and Balwani had a decade-long abusive relationship. She said Balwani tried to control nearly every aspect of her life as he sought to help her become successful. Balwani, through court filings, has denied the abuse allegations. (Balwani faces the same charges as Holmes and is set to be tried early this year. He has pleaded not guilty.)\n\nHolmes also testified that Balwani, whom she lived with, served as her most important adviser during her time at Theranos. She testified that he didn't control what she said to investors, board members, retail partners, and the media during her time at the helm of Theranos. But his influence on her life loomed large.\n\n\"He impacted everything about who I was, and I don't fully understand that,\" Holmes testified.\n\nHolmes' defense team did not call an expert to testify about the possible implications of the alleged abuse on her role as CEO, despite having indicated it may do so. In his closing arguments, prosecutor Jeffrey Schenk told jurors they did not need to decide whether the abuse happened to reach a verdict.\n\n\"The case is about false statements made to investors and false statements made to patients,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether she ever led patients to believe Theranos could offer accurate and reliable blood tests while knowing it could not, Holmes testified: \"Of course not.\"", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}]}

Since the pandemic, she has been building her career as a photographer on the platform and attracted hundreds of thousands of followers in the process. But recently, her relationship with Instagram started to change.\n\nOn Monday, Bruening shared a post on the platform calling to \"Make Instagram Instagram again.\" She told CNN Business that she was scrolling the app and felt frustrated by the lack of content she was seeing from accounts she followed in the wake of recent updates prioritizing recommended posts and videos from its Reels product.\n\n\"I was seeing a post from my friend underneath three Reels and a recommended post that was six days old,\" she said. As she put it in her post: \"Stop trying to be TikTok I just want to see cute photos of my friends.\"\n\nHer post blew up. By Tuesday morning, it had more than 1.7 million likes, thanks in part to shares by two of the most influential figures on the platform: Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. The famous half-sisters are among the most-followed accounts on Instagr am, with 360 million and 326 million followers, respectively, and their opinions carry big weight in the world of social media. A February 2018 tweet from Jenner criticizing a Snapchat redesign was credited with wiping out $1.3 billion from the company's value in a week.\n\nThe attention to Bruening's post reflects the growing backlash against recent updates to the Instagram platform, which boast more than 1 billion users. To beat back the competitive threat of TikTok — whose discovery algorithm is viewed as its great competitive advantage — Instagram has started showing users a much greater proportion of recommended content from accounts that they don't follow versus posts from their friends. It has also prioritized video content over the photos it is known for. The platform has been testing showing full-screen posts, much like TikTok, as well.\n\nThe issue has arguably been brewing for years. Since 2020, the company has been experimenting with showing users more \"suggested posts\" in their feeds. Recommended content and ads now make up a significant portion of the Instagram feed, which often pigeonholes users into certain content categories (such as recipes or relationship advice) in a way that sometimes seems to disregard whether they actually follow such accounts.\n\nThe latest dust-up around Instagram comes at a fragile time for parent company Meta. The company is grappling with an aging and stagnating user base on its flagship Facebook platform, and Instagram is largely seen as the best bet of its family of apps to maintain and grow the crucial younger audience. But Meta, like many older players in the social media world, is facing steep competition from TikTok and is fighting to gain traction in its attempts to copy it. While Instagram users are somewhat more likely to open the app daily, TikTok users spend an average of about 45 more minutes per day on the app than people do on Instagram, according to a report from research firm Sensor Tower for the second quarter of 2022. In a February call with Wall Street analysts, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Instagram Reels \"face a competitor in TikTok that is a lot bigger, so it will take a while to ... catch up there.\"\n\nAt the same time, Meta is relying on profits from Instagram and its other apps to help fund its investment in building a future version of the internet it calls the \"metaverse.\" And the company, which is set to report second quarter earnings on Wednesday, may see a slowdown in spending on ads, its core business, amid rising inflation and recession fears.\n\nMeta's stock fell nearly 3% Tuesday after the growing backlash from the Kardashians and others.\n\n\"The problem for Meta is that nothing is good right now,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte. \"Instagram is meant to be the Meta asset to exploit, to address the younger market, so it's natural to me that they're using Instagram as the way to respond to the competitive threat of TikTok.\"\n\nMeta has run this playbook before. In 2016, months before Snapchat's parent company made its Wall Street debut, Instagram copied one of the messaging app's signature features, Stories. Instagram, soon reached more users with its version of the feature than Snapchat did. But its efforts to copy TikTok with Reels have arguably proven to be more difficult.\n\nMany have pointed out that videos on Reels are often just old TikTok videos — sometimes shared weeks after they first went viral on TikTok, and occasionally with the TikTok logo still attached. In some cases, users will share a still photo set to music as a Reel in an effort to rank higher on the platform. Instagram, for its part, has been trying to incentivize users to make original Reels, with creator fund programs and by featuring them prominently in-feed. The company is now also testing sharing all videos shorter than 15 minutes as Reels.\n\nTo be sure, Instagram is not the only platform prioritizing video and recommended content as it seeks to keep up with TikTok, which last year surpassed 1 billion monthly active users. Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have all also taken steps in that direction.\n\n\"The viewpoint is that this is like mobile, meaning it's an evolutionary change in consumption on the internet,\" Forte said. \"What choice does Facebook have? It would be nearly impossible to buy TikTok, which was the old playbook, so now they have to try to innovate.\"\n\nFor creators like Breuning who built their livelihoods on Instagram, the changes feel especially painful, given its origin as a photo app that catered to artists and photographers.\n\n\"It feels wrong to switch the algorithm on creators that have made a living and contributed to the community, forcing them to change their entire content direction and lifestyle to serve a new algorithm,\" Bruening wrote in a change.org petition calling on Instagram to \"Stop trying to be TikTok!\" It has garnered more than 150,000 signatures in four days.\n\nInstagram did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. However, Instagram head Adam Mosseri addressed the criticism in a video post on the platform Tuesday.\n\n\"We're experimenting with a number of different changes to the app and so we're hearing a lot of concerns from all of you,\" he said, acknowledging complaints about the shift to video and the increase in recommended content. \"We're going to continue to support photos, they're part of our heritage. ... That said, I need to be honest: I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time.\"\n\nMosseri continued: \"If you look at what people share on Instagram, that's shifting more and more to videos over time. If you look at what people like and consume and view on Instagram, that's also shifting more and more to video over time, even if we're not changing anything. So we're going to have to lean into that shift while continuing to support photos.\"\n\nMosseri also warned that the full screen video feature test is \"not yet good\" and has only rolled out to a small percentage of users. And he pointed to the option Instagram launched earlier this year for users to toggle the platform to a chronological feed of posts from only accounts they follow.\n\nBut that explanation wasn't enough to silence the criticisms. Some users sounded off in the comments about feeling like they had no choice but to start making more videos if they wanted the platform's algorithm to surface their content. Others suggested that if the platform became too much like TikTok, they'd be inclined to simply pick one of the apps to use rather than both.\n\n\"People do VIDEOS because we have no reach on our photos!!\" fashion creator Alina Tanasa (@fabmusealina) said in a comment on Mosseri's video. \"As a content creator I need and want each and with photos you cut all the reach and you promote only videos. So it's not us, it's you that are changing everything and are afraid of TikTok.\"\n\nMakeup influencer James Charles, who has nearly 23 million Instagram followers, added in a comment: \"I understand that every business has to evolve, compete, and please investors, but Instagram is losing the competition and has lost its identity along the way. ... We're upset because we CARE about this app and the communities we've been able to create/join on here, but I'm genuinely worried that if something doesn't change, there will be no community left.\"\n\nIf there's a silver lining for Instagram, however, it's that there are few other photo-first apps out there, making it easier to criticize Instagram than leave it, especially for those who have built a life and a livelihood on it.\n\n\"Me personally,\" Breuning said, \"I love Instagram and I don't plan on leaving Instagram anytime soon.\"", "authors": ["Clare Duffy", "Jennifer Korn", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/tech/instagram-walks-back-updates?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google", "title": "Instagram walks back updates after criticism from Kardashian family ...", "text": "(CNN) Instagram on Thursday said it will walk back some of its recent feature changes after facing mounting backlash from users, including members of the Kardashian family.\n\nIn recent days, Instagram has come under fire from users who are frustrated that the photo-sharing app is becoming too much like rival TikTok. Some users have complained that Instagram is now showing a much greater proportion of recommended content from accounts that they don't follow versus posts from their friends. Instagram has also been testing full-screen posts, similar to how posts appear on TikTok.\n\n\"Based on our findings and community feedback, we're pausing the full-screen test on Instagram so we can explore other options, and we're temporarily decreasing the number of recommendations you see in your feed so we can improve the quality of your experience,\" a spokesperson for Meta, Instagram's parent company, said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"We recognize that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and while we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right,\" the statement added.\n\nInstagram's head Adam Mosseri first announced the pullback earlier Thursday in an interview with tech news outlet Platformer.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/business/bereal-social-media-app-cec/index.html", "title": "BeReal: This social app bans edited photos to encourage users to ...", "text": "There's a newer photo-sharing app -- and it's not like other social media platforms.\n\nThe app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.\n\nWe joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.\n\nSo, what's BeReal?\n\nBeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users -- at least 65% -- have signed up this calendar year.\n\nAs its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they're doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.\n\nIt has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that's what people will see.\n\nThe result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.\n\nThe BeReal app launched in late 2020 and is rapidly growing in popularity among young people.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it's time to \"BeReal.\" That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you're doing, no matter how mundane.\n\nThere's no set time -- the notification comes at random times of the day -- adding to the app's mystique.\n\n\"Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,\" the company said in a statement. \"It's a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it's not random.\"\n\nThat means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you're up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo -- a selfie and one showing what's in front of you. (BeReal doesn't permit videos yet.)\n\nThe result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things -- lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.\n\nWith only one post a day, there's no clutter of friends' pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends' posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.\n\nGeorgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.\n\n\"What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. ... solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,\" says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.\n\nTelerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.\n\n\"I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,\" he says. \"I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.\"\n\nBen Telerski and Alexandra Henn in an image from his BeReal app. The app takes a dual photo showing the user's selfie and what's in front of them.\n\nWhat happens if you don't post within the two minutes?\n\nWhen you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what's in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.\n\nThe app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you're ready.\n\nBeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.\n\nWhy are people using it?\n\nBeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.\n\nTelerski believes the app is popular because it's an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.\n\nBeReal won't make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram. BeReal\n\n\"I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,\" he says.\n\nMorgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend's suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people's lives.\n\n\"It's the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren't as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,\" she says. \"It's something different.\"\n\nIn a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create \"an alternative to addictive social networks\" that focus on amassing influence, it says.\n\n\"BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,\" the company says. \"BeReal won't make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.\"\n\nAre BeReal posts really so authentic?\n\nThe app doesn't give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.\n\nBut some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.\n\n\"There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,\" Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.\n\n\"It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,\" he says. \"BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.\"\n\nThe young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.\n\nNott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal -- and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.\n\nTelerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.\n\n\"For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,\" he says.\n\n\"Think about what social media was originally intended for -- real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.\"", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/tech/tiktok-depp-heard-trial/index.html", "title": "Johnny Depp, Amber Heard trial Tiktok posts are making accidental ...", "text": "(CNN) TikTok posts about actor Johnny Depp's defamation trial against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, have turned a stay-at-home mom based in Scotland into an accidental influencer. Or, perhaps more aptly, a DeppTok influencer.\n\nSophie Doggett, whose TikTok was previously populated by videos on everyday things such as herself or her pets, posted to her TikTok account on April 25 a clip of Heard's lawyer asking a question of a witness and then immediately objecting to the response. It is one of many moments in the trial that has been seized upon by people like Doggett, as clips of testimony and references to the case have pervaded TikTok in a way that no trial has before. That's partly because the proceeding, set to resume Monday, is being livestreamed during the age of TikTok, and also because of the high-profile celebrities the case involves.\n\nDoggett, who paired the clip to playful music, said she gained 30,000 followers seemingly overnight from the post which has, to date, been viewed more than 5 million times. Asked about her follower count before the viral post, she says it was 6,668, a number she recites by heart. In the three weeks since the post, she's collected more than 25,000 additional followers. Her account is now dedicated to Depp-related posts, some of which pertain to the trial, others to past Depp films or interviews. The top three posts pinned to Doggett's account have more than 14 million collective views.\n\nIf there's any question of where her loyalty lies, it is with Depp, something that's conveyed through the photo associated with her TikTok account — white text against a black background that reads \"Justice for Johnny Depp.\"\n\nInside the courtroom, jurors are tasked with determining whether Depp was falsely and maliciously accused of domestic abuse by Heard, which he claims cost him an estimated $50 million in damages associated with lost acting jobs. The case stems from a 2018 opinion piece published in The Washington Post wherein Heard described herself as \"a public figure representing domestic abuse.\" Although Depp is not named in the piece, Heard refers to the year 2016, a year in which she filed for a divorce and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp, claiming she'd been abused.\n\nTikTok creators are leveraging hashtags like #JusticeforJohnnyDepp to show support for the actor while using others to mock actress Amber Heard.\n\nDepp denied the allegations then, as he does now, and the two reached a divorce settlement that year, issuing a joint statement at the time. During his testimony, Depp alleged he was physically and verbally abused by Heard and denied accusations that he was physically violent toward her. Heard has countersued Depp for $100 million, claiming statements his team made were damaging to her career\n\nOnline, however, everyone from everyday users like Doggett — who said she is now able to monetize her posts through TikTok's creator fund due to the attention — to legal analysts, lifestyle influencers, activists of varying pursuits, and comedians are taking it upon themselves to dissect and analyze every minute detail of the trial, down to conspiracy theories about the way in which Heard dabbed her nose with a tissue.\n\nEmily D. Baker, a former LA deputy district attorney turned online creator, streams live legal commentary of the trial proceedings on her YouTube page, which has more than 330,000 subscribers. Her viewers increasingly request for her to respond to theories or footage they have seen on TikTok, she says.\n\n\"When you have cameras streaming in the courtroom, people are going to clock every strange behavior. And they have,\" said Baker.\n\nMany are in the comment sections on YouTube channels to cheer Depp or jeer Heard — typically in that order. Others have set up their own video broadcasts to provide ongoing commentary of the trial in real-time or devoted Instagram accounts to posting updates on the case. Perhaps most striking — because of the way in which the platform operates and how users take to it — is TikTok.\n\nLike Doggett, two other TikTok users CNN Business spoke with recounted similar stories of going from hundreds or thousands of followers to tens of thousands of followers in a matter of days due to Depp-related posts.\n\nOne TikTok user, who is based in the UK, said she posted a video on April 27 celebrating Depp for freeing his lawyer's snagged charger cord with a comment, \"the little things.\" \"I wasn't expecting anyone to reach out, or like it, or share it even,\" she said, noting that she'd originally created her account to post about films. But it has since garnered more than 10 million views. She's continued posting about the trial and she says her account has gone from fewer than 300 followers to more than 50,000.\n\nMaria Pugsley, also based in the UK, similarly told CNN Business that followers to her account grew from fewer than 10,000 to more than 37,000. Previously, she said her use of TikTok included \"jumping on the trends, really and having a bit of a laugh — it never really took off to be honest.\"\n\nBut users have taken to her commentary on the trial, in which she favors Depp and has spoken about male victims of abuse. \"In the beginning I went in very unbiased — all of my opinions are based on the courtroom,\" she said, adding: \"I am always open to having my opinion changed.\"\n\nA high-profile trial, dissected on TikTok\n\nTikTok's algorithm has been repeatedly reported upon as scary-good in its manner of feeding users more and more posts pertaining to their interests. One has to look no further than the hashtags on TikTok to gauge that sentiment there sways favorable toward the 58-year-old Depp, undoubtedly the bigger celebrity with a much longer history cultivating a fanbase compared to 36-year-old Heard. Doggett noted that she hadn't personally come across posts on TikTok in support of Heard: \"Maybe a couple people [in comments sections] saying 'Team Amber.' They get destroyed in the comments.\"\n\nOne hashtag, #JusticeForJohnnyDepp, has garnered more than 11 billion views globally, while just the actor's name has more than 19 billion, and #JohnnyDeppisInnocent has garnered more than 3 billion. Users are applying filters to their faces to personify Depp, combining clips of testimonies with past footage from Depp's film archives. By contrast, #JusticeForAmberHeard has 41 million views. Heard's name has garnered more than 9 billion views and #AmberTurd has 1.6 billion (a hashtag fueled by trial testimony concerning fecal matter.) Meanwhile, the #AmberHeardIsALiar had drawn more than 2 billion views when CNN Business reviewed it Friday afternoon, but the hashtag no longer appeared viewable in the app as of Friday evening.\n\n\"What you're seeing is fan base versus fan base,\" Juda Engelmayer, a public relations professional who has worked with high-profile figures, such as disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein who was convicted for sex crimes, and is currently working with the fake heiress Anna Sorokin. \"It was surprising to me that the social media throngs and supporters are almost entirely backing him.\"\n\nThe passionate social media posts surrounding the case are, at times, rooted in other factors. Some see outsized support for Depp, and the dismissal of Heard's allegations, as another example of internalized misogyny. Others, including men's rights activists, have lifted up Depp in online forums as a rare well-known man who alleges he experienced domestic abuse at the hands of a woman, thereby bringing light to the issue.\n\nAccording to Daniel Klug, a systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon University's Institute for Software Research who has researched TikTok's algorithm, \"TikTok creates a sort of mediated reality for the user.\"\n\n\"Over a time period, you see a lot of short videos ... depending on what kind of content you see, let's say a lot of content about the trial, that creates a certain perception of the reality of the trial for you on TikTok,\" he said, noting that posts tends to fall into two categories: those that capture testimonies from Heard, Depp, or others on the stand \"describing very personal and intimate and weird details of their relationship,\" or content related to Depp or the trial that is \"remixed or reinterpreted by other users.\"\n\nCallum Hood, head of research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate which recently investigated abuse directed at several high-profile women, including Heard, on Instagram similarly noted that the nature of TikTok is such that \"you get very, very slim segments of the trial presented and usually with a very heavy skew.\"\n\n\"This applies as much to [content posted about] Ukraine as clips of the Amber Heard, Johnny Depp trial,\" said Hood, noting that \"content on TikTok, more so than any other platform, is free of context ... We tend to know less about the account that's posting it, less about when it was posted, less about where the material is from, about the motivations of the person posting it ... I've got a lot of sympathy for the users because it is genuinely very hard, with the information available to you in the app, to understand the context and to make an assessment of how true or false it is.\"\n\nCenter for Countering Digital Hate's report noted that discussions of Depp and Heard's legal battles on social media \"often contain abuse towards Heard, as well as the promotion of conspiracy theories around the rate of women's false allegations of domestic abuse.\"\n\nTrial-related content on TikTok varies from those who are analyzing and conspiracy theorizing to attempts to poke fun, which can quickly become distasteful. One popular variation of posts is based on satirical reenactments using audio from Heard's testimony, in which she said, \"I was walking out of the bedroom, [he] slapped me across the face and I turned to look at him and I said, 'Johnny, you hit me. You just hit me.'\" One widely-shared post, featured a cat role playing the former couple. It wears a blond wig when playing the part of Heard and a paper mustache and bandana when playing the part of Depp. While the original post is no longer viewable, it had been \"dueted\" by other accounts — a TikTok feature that enables users to post a video side-by-side one from another user in order to react to it — which can still be found on the platform.\n\nFor its part, TikTok said it removes content that violates its policies, which include \"threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual.\" There may be some leeway in the case of Heard and Depp, as its community guidelines note that \"critical comments of public figures may be allowed; however, serious abusive behavior against public figures is prohibited.\"\n\n\"I believe I was mass reported over political differences\"\n\nThere are also questions about whether and how others on the platform may be able to silence certain voices or opinions.\n\nOne TikTok user named Ashley, who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy reasons, posted about how she felt some men's rights activists were using the trial as an excuse to discredit allegations by women of abuse.\n\n\"Can you imagine the leeway every narcissistic woman-hating man is going to have now?\" she said in the post. Ashley told CNN Business that the post was quickly \"dueted\" and she received threats in the comments, then her account was banned.\n\nIn a message on April 26, Ashley — who is based in Pittsburgh and had 7,000 followers — asked TikTok to restore her account, \"I believe I was mass reported over political differences,\" she wrote, adding that she had screenshots of threatening messages she had received. Asked about her account by CNN Business last week, TikTok said it would investigate it. Following that, the company restored her account but did not provide any details on why.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/tech/social-media-lawsuits-teen-suicide/index.html", "title": "Their teenage children died by suicide. Now these families want to ...", "text": "(CNN) Christopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching \"Doctor Who\" and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. \"His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,\" his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family's home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, \"he couldn't stop looking at his phone,\" she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend -- \"God's speed\" -- and posted an update on his Facebook page: \"Who turned out the light?\" CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n\"When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,\" Donna Dawley said. \"He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.\"\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN)\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers' decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys' lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to \"never-ending\" scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users' decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to \"incomplete brain development.\"\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ's mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook's algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company's research on its impact on children out of context and painted a \"false picture of the company.\")\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to \"hold the companies accountable\" after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. \"How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive? Who would ever do that?\"\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN)\n\nHaugen's disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to \"hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they're conducting on our children for profit.\"\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys' lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n\"Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,\" Bergman said. \"The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.\"\n\nHe added: \"When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.\"\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN)\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can't comment on active litigation but \"our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.\"\n\n\"We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,\" Derkits said. \"Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.\"\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen's testimony -- coupled with concerns around kids' increased time spent online during the pandemic -- has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn't come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n\"If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,\" she told CNN Business. Snapchat's age requirement for signing up is 13. \"It's too addictive for kids.\"\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n\"After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,\" Mitchell said. \"We don't know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.\"\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat.\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn't limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, \"which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,\" the suit alleged.\n\n\"Throughout the period of Selena's use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,\" the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n\"If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that's a regrettable incident,\" said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. \"But if a tour guide says, 'Let me show you around the city or I'll show you the top sites,' and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm's way. That's exactly what these platforms do.\"\n\n\"It's not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it's by design,\" he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n\"The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it's difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody's life or doing serious damage to somebody that's self-inflicted,\" he said. \"But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.\"\n\nHe said Haugen's \"damning\" testimony before Congress and the \"seemingly troubling\" data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be suicidal: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

For more tips and warning signs, click here.\n\n\"There's a lot of information we didn't have before,\" Tobias said. \"When a company, entity or an individual knows they're exposing someone else to a risk of harm, then tort law and product liability law is sometimes willing to impose liability.\"\n\nWhile he said it's \"unclear\" if the lawsuits will indeed be successful, the \"arguments being made by plaintiffs and their lawyers in some of these cases are something the companies have to take seriously.\"\n\nIndividual lawsuits have been filed against social media companies in the past, but the companies typically have a broad legal liability shield for content posted on their platforms. However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it \"might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.\"\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they've been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform's algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms' existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n\"Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,\" the letter said. \"We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.\"\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they're talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a \"long fight\" ahead as he plans to \"file a lot of cases\" against social media companies. \"The only thing that's certain is the level of opposition that we're going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,\" he said. \"They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.\"\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. \"I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,\" she said.\n\n\"[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We're all losing right now. But if we can get them to change the algorithm for one child -- if one child is saved -- then it's been worth it.\"", "authors": ["Story Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Cnn Business Video John General", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/tech/elon-musk-twitter-sale-agreement/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk to buy Twitter in $44 billion deal - CNN", "text": "New York (CNN) Twitter said Monday it has agreed to sell itself to Elon Musk in a roughly $44 billion deal that has the potential to expand the billionaire's business empire and put the world's richest man in charge of one of the world's most influential social networks.\n\nThe deal, which will take the company private, caps off a whirlwind period in which the Tesla and SpaceX CEO became one of Twitter's largest shareholders, was offered and turned down a seat on its board and bid to buy the company — all in less than a month.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, shareholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter stock they own, matching Musk's original offer and marking a 38% premium over the stock price the day before Musk revealed his stake in the company.\n\n\"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" Musk said in a statement Monday. \"Twitter has tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\"\n\nThe deal, which was unanimously approved by Twitter's board, is expected to close this year. It comes after Musk revealed last week he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to acquire the company, an apparent turning point that forced Twitter's board to seriously consider the deal. The board met Sunday to evaluate Musk's offer.\n\n\"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing,\" Twitter independent board chair Bret Taylor said in a statement, calling the deal \" the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.\"\n\nTwitter stock was up nearly 6% following the announcement of the deal, hovering around $51.84, just shy of the offer price. The deal is pending approval from shareholders and regulators.\n\nIn an internal message to employees obtained by CNN, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said he would hold an all-hands meeting with Taylor on Monday afternoon to answer questions about the deal. \"I know this is a significant change and you're likely processing what this means for you and Twitter's future,\" he said.\n\nWhat Musk means for Twitter\n\nMusk is both a high-profile Twitter user and a controversial one. He has more than 83 million followers on the platform, which he has used over the years for everything from sharing memes and discussing his companies to insulting politicians, spreading misleading claims about Covid-19 and making offensive remarks about the transgender community.\n\nMusk has repeatedly stressed in recent days that his goal is to bolster free speech on the platform and work to \"unlock\" Twitter's \"extraordinary potential.\"\n\nIn his statement Monday, Musk said he wants to \"make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.\" Separately, he said in a tweet Monday that he hopes \"even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\"\n\nStill, some industry experts worry that Musk's desire for free speech on Twitter could mean rolling back some of the platform's work to curb hate speech, misinformation, harassment and other harmful content. Others questioned whether Musk might restore former President Donald Trump's account, which was removed early last year for violating Twitter policies against inciting violence following the Capitol Riot. Such a move could have significant ramifications for the upcoming 2024 US presidential election.\n\nWhile Twitter is smaller than some social media rivals, it has an outsized influence in the online and offline worlds because it is used by many politicians, public figures and journalists, and has sometimes acted as a model for other platforms in how to handle harmful content.\n\n\"Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech, or falsehoods that subvert our democracy,\" Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, said in a statement directed at Musk Monday following the deal.\n\nA new and uncertain era for Twitter\n\nIn the days since Musk's initial bid, many following the company wondered whether Twitter would try to find another buyer, especially after the company put in place a poison pill to make it more difficult for Musk to acquire the company without its approval.\n\nBut CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino said Monday that Twitter's board more seriously considering Musk's offer may have come \"from the Board's realization that an alternative bid from a 'white knight' may be difficult to come by, especially following the decline in asset prices from social media companies in recent weeks/months.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether Agrawal — who took over the CEO role from founder Jack Dorsey in November — will remain in the top job following the takeover. Musk previously tweeted a meme comparing Agrawal to former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Musk also said in his offer letter to buy Twitter that he does not \"have confidence in management.\"\n\nThe deal could, however, put an end to nearly a decade of chaos at Twitter as a public company, during which it has cycled through CEOs, grappled with an activist investor and struggled to ignite growth and successfully monetize its influential user base.\n\nAgrawal said in Monday's statement that \"Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,\" He added: \"Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\"\n\nCNN Business tech reporter Clare Duffy can be reached at clare.duffy@cnn.com.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/27/media/reliable-sources-ukraine-tiktok/index.html", "title": "Here's why Russia's invasion of Ukraine is being called the 'TikTok ...", "text": "New York (CNN) Ukrainian Instagram influencers are now warzone witnesses and urban warfare experts are tweeting tips to Ukrainian fighters, CNN's chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on \"Reliable Sources\" Sunday.

He said the social network informed him that the posts weren't a violation of its policies.\n\n\"It wasn't surprising (Facebook) didn't do anything, but it was infuriating,\" said Wagoner, who is encouraged that GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy organization, is taking the social media platforms to task, calling for extensive reform of how it treats its LGBTQ users.\n\nBrowsing books can lead to extremist rabbit hole:Is Amazon recommending books on QAnon and white nationalism?\n\nFacebook winning war on COVID-19 vaccine lies, hoaxes and conspiracies:Twitter and TikTok?

The Pew Center study said about 68% of lesbian, gay or bisexual adults who said they have been harassed online think it occurred because of their sexual orientation.\n\nGLAAD cites a report by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) that for a third straight year, LGBTQ+ respondents reported disproportionately higher rates of harassment – 64% compared with 41% for the overall general population.\n\n\"These platforms have all of the tools at their disposal to stop the abuse, and they choose not to do anything. Each time they choose not to, it harms our community,\" GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis told USA TODAY. \"Social media has moved into the space of being the great culture creator of today, and when you have a community that has been the No. 1 target for harassment, it's time we hold them accountable.\"\n\nAmong the recommendations for the four major platforms:\n\nGreater protection of LGBTQ+ users in community guidelines.\n\nMitigating bias in algorithms and artificial intelligence.\n\nUsing more human moderators to reduce the posts and spread of hate speech, extremist rhetoric and misinformation.\n\nAddressing privacy and outing (including data-privacy & micro-targeting).\n\nMore transparency, and even more LGBTQ hiring in several roles, including leadership and inclusion.\n\nFacebook, YouTube and Twitter said in separate statements to USA TODAY they want to make their platforms safer for all, including the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nFacebook said it believes deeply in the representation and visibility for the LGBTQ+ community that GLAAD champions.\n\nThe big four react\n\n\"At Facebook, we want to make both our platform and our workplace safe and inclusive places for the LGBTQ+ community,\" said Alex Schultz, Facebook's chief marketing officer and vice president of Analytics. \"We invest in AI to remove hate speech, produce online safety guides, develop message request blocking tools on Instagram and voice our support for the Equality Act to protect the vulnerable like trans youth and trans women of color.\"\n\nA YouTube spokesperson said the platform has made \"significant progress in our ability to quickly remove hateful and harassing content against the LGBTQ+ community.\"\n\nA Twitter spokesperson said the company knows the public conversation reaches its full potential only when every community feels safe and comfortable participating. \"We welcome GLAAD's initiative and the opportunity to better understand the experiences and needs of the LGBTQ+ communities on our service,\" the spokesperson said. “We’ve engaged with GLAAD to better understand their requests and are committed to an open dialogue to better inform our work to support LGBTQ safety.\"\n\nTikTok said in a statement to Axios Sunday that the company is \"committed to supporting and uplifting LGBTQ+ voices on and off the platform and we care deeply about fostering a welcoming and supportive experience for everyone.

They started out as places to share what we're eating, where we're going and who we're hanging out with, but now they are all-encompassing,\" Bernholz said. \"Now, kids can't participate in group activities without planning on Facebook, Twitter has vastly changed how we get our news and conduct our business, and Google is a must-have for almost everything we want to know.\"\n\nBernholz said the social media platforms have \"basically made themselves the equivalent of our roads, sewers and utilities\" to get where we want to go, and the report is an opportunity to \"rethink\" digital advocacy.\n\n\"We need to collectively recognize and set boundaries on how these companies should work for us,\" Bernholz said. \"These companies want to make it feel like 'it's just me,' but if we see the harassment and abuse on these platforms as a shared societal problem, we get shared solutions and regulations. And that's what these companies do not want to see.\"\n\nThe trans community bears the brunt of it\n\nEllis and Bernholz said the trans community is the most harassed among the LGBTQ+ group.\n\nWagoner said he's not surprised as his community is heavily targeted despite their very visible participation on the platforms.\n\n\"The users are the commodity. We are the service, the product, so to speak. If there is something that can potentially turn away customers, there's no incentive to change your behavior when the incentive is money,\" Wagoner said. \"Since users don't pay any money to use the platforms, it's no skin off their backs.\"\n\nInitially, GLAAD was going to grade the social media platforms with its first extensive examination, but \"none of them were going to pass,\" Ellis said. Instead, the report serves as a baseline for the companies, which have included many GLAAD members on their trust and safety councils, Ellis said. The report should be considered as \"a blueprint\" for the social media platforms to improve, Ellis said, and GLAAD intends to give out grades in next year's report.\n\nCancel Instagram for kids:It 'preys' on children's fear of missing out, advocates say to Zuckerberg\n\n\"You can't move what you don't measure, and until we put a measurement metric in place, we can hold them accountable,\" Ellis said. \"Let's build a roadmap for success, not just for the LGBTQ community, but for all marginalized communities.\"\n\nJennifer Grygiel, a social media professor at Syracuse University, said it's important for advocacy organizations such as GLAAD to help hold institutions accountable, and they must be ready to be a harsh critic.\n\n\"The bar is low for the social media industry, and that's a problem, and sometimes platforms get credit for doing anything at all, but it doesn't mean it's enough,\" Grygiel said. \"But it would look pretty bad for GLAAD to have red thumbs down for every indicator for all platforms, but that's pretty much where things are at.\"\n\nEllis said GLAAD's social media index is a model similar to what the organization has done to hold Hollywood and the media more accountable regarding LGBTQ inclusivity and representation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/07/29/candace-cameron-bure-apologizes-christian-tiktok/5421356001/", "title": "Candace Cameron Bure: Actress apologizes for Christian TikTok video", "text": "Actress Candace Cameron Bure is apologizing for a religious TikTok video she recently posted to her Instagram, which many have criticized as being “weird” and “seductive.”\n\nThe video, which finds the former “Full House” and “Fuller House” star lip-syncing to the Lana Del Rey tune “Jealous Girl,” shows Bure grabbing a Bible as she mouths some of the song’s lyrics: “You don’t wanna dance with me, dance with me / Honey, I’m in love with you.”\n\nBure said she was inspired to make the video after her daughter, Natasha Bure, posted a similar video on her TikTok; she said she wanted to do a Biblical version that conveyed “nothing can trump the Holy Spirit.” Bure also posted the video to her Instagram page, where it drew criticism from fans.\n\n“I just came home and read a lot of messages that were not happy with my latest Instagram post that was a TikTok video,” Bure said in her Instagram Story on Wednesday. “And I usually don't apologize for these things, but a lot of you thought it was weird, and I'm sorry – that was not my intention. I was using a very specific clip from TikTok and applying it to the power of the Holy Spirit, which is incredible.”\n\nBure said she deleted her Instagram post of the video after realizing her intended message was largely misconstrued.\n\n“And so many of you thought that I was trying to be seductive, which clearly means I'm not a very good actress because I was trying to be strong, not sexy or seductive,” Bure said. “So, I guess that didn't work, but I deleted it.”\n\nBure’s apologetic response is a departure from how the actress typically handles social media criticism. Earlier this year, Bure clapped back at negative comments on a family holiday photo she posted: “If you don’t like something, just move on. There are people and real feelings behind every screen.”\n\nMore:'Shame on you': Candace Cameron Bure calls for 'respect' after 'haters' lambast family photo\n\n“Maybe I was just trying to be too cool or relevant in a Biblical way that didn't work,” Bure said of her TikTok video. “Anyway, most of you didn't like it, clearly, but there was a small percentage of you that appreciated what I did and understood my intention. But anyway, it's gone: now I know what you don't like.”\n\nDespite the overwhelming criticism, some users on TikTok did respond positively to Bure’s video.\n\n“She is the only famous person who I can truly admire,” user Autumn Rhoads wrote. “And it’s all because she gives God the glory.”\n\n“I have no idea why people have an issue with this,” user Tabby Rustamzada wrote.\n\n“I literally screamed Candace Cameron is a Christian, yesss,” user Goofy Goober wrote. “I love that you use your platform to share the word of God.”\n\n“LET EM KNOW DJ,” user helaina wrote, referencing Bure's \"Full House\" and \"Fuller House\" character D.J.

The full context behind the statement shows Biden was in fact referencing prior gaffes from now-former President Donald Trump, not making his own.\n\nThe Instagram account that shared the video did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment. The original TikTok account could not be messaged.\n\nBiden’s full speech shows he was referencing Trump’s words\n\nThe clip comes from Biden’s Oct. 29 campaign speech at a drive-in rally in Tampa, Florida. C-SPAN footage and transcripts of that speech reveal then-candidate Biden was discussing Trump’s past statements.\n\nHere's the full context:\n\n“Donald Trump when he thinks of climate change, he says hoax. Well, guess what? Speaking of hoaxes, remember what he said about these increasing violent hurricanes and the frequency? He actually said, maybe we should detonate a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic. By the way, the same stable genius who said, the biggest problem we had in the Revolutionary War is we didn’t have enough airports. Whoa. Man, I tell you, what. His answer to families in Puerto Rico, struggling through Hurricane Maria was, what would he do? Toss rolls of paper towels at them. He doesn’t have any real answers.”\n\nAfter making the statement about the Revolutionary War, Biden blessed himself and sighed.\n\nBiden is referencing several different Trump statements that drew widespread derision.\n\nJuly 2019: Trump says troops shut down airports during the Revolutionary War\n\nIn 2019, Trump made headlines after he said American troops in the Revolutionary War “took over the airports” during his July 4 speech at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n“Our Army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do, and at Fort McHenry, under the rocket’s red glare it had nothing but victory,\" he said. \"And when dawn came, their star-spangled banner waved defiant.”\n\nThis comment garnered criticism as the Revolutionary War ended in 1783 and planes were not invented until the early 20th century. Powered aircrafts were not used in wars until 1911.\n\nAugust 2019: Report says Trump asked to stop hurricanes with bombs\n\nBiden's comment about using nuclear bombs to fight hurricanes refers to 2019 reports.\n\nAxios reported on Aug. 25, 2019, that Trump had repeatedly asked senior Homeland Security officials if they could drop nuclear bombs into the eyes of incoming hurricanes before they hit the east coast.\n\nExperts agree nuclear weaponry is not a feasible solution for extreme weather.\n\nFact check: Image claiming to show Joe Biden with White House press secretary has been altered twice\n\nIn response to the reports, Trump called the report “ridiculous” and “more FAKE NEWS.”\n\nTrump repeatedly called himself 'stable genius'\n\nThe post misquotes Biden to say “stable Jesus,” when he actually said “stable genius” in reference to Trump’s past remarks about himself.\n\nFact check:Misleading post connects Biden comment that 'country is doomed' with African Americans\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump repeatedly referred to himself as a “stable genius.” The first instance was in January 2018 after Michael Wolff’s book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” raised the question whether he was mentally unfit for office.\n\nOur rating: Missing context\n\nWe rate MISSING CONTEXT the claim that Biden said, “The same stable Jesus said that the biggest problem we had in the revolutionary war, is we didn’t have enough airports,” because without additional information it is misleading. Video and transcripts from Biden’s full speech show he was criticizing comments Trump made in 2019. And Biden did not say “stable Jesus.” He said“stable genius” in reference to a label Trump had repeatedly applied to himself.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.
