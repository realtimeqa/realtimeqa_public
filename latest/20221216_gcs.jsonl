Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe NASA Orion spacecraft, the core of the Artemis I mission, is making a farewell pass by the moon on its historic journey before heading home to Earth.\n\nThe capsule, which has spent the past 15 days traveling into deep space and making an unprecedented trek beyond the moon, fired up its onboard engine for about one minute and 45 seconds Thursday afternoon to jolt itself out of its current orbital path.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft is now expected to take another lap around the moon. The final pass will once again take Orion just over 80 miles (128.7 kilometers) above the lunar surface Monday morning. The flyby will offer views of notable lunar sites, including lava beds that astronauts explored during the Apollo era. From there, the capsule will fire up its engines to set itself on a course back toward Earth.\n\nThe spacecraft is on track to make a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego on December 11. That will mark the end of the historic Artemis I mission, which kicked off when the Orion spacecraft launched atop NASA’s new Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket on November 16. The launch cemented the SLS as the most powerful rocket ever to reach orbit — and the historic milestones did not stop there.\n\nAfter reaching space and separating from the SLS rocket, the Orion capsule made it to a far-flung lunar orbit that allowed it to reach more than 40,000 miles (64,374 kilometers) beyond the far side of the moon. That’s farther than any spacecraft designed to carry humans has ever flown.\n\nThe spacecraft is, however, flying empty for this mission, except for a few mannequins — and Snoopy — that are designed to gather data, along with some mementos.\n\nThe overall goal of Artemis I — the first in a series of increasingly difficult missions aimed at sending humans back to the moon’s surface — is to test the spacecraft to its limits, gleaning valuable insights for NASA.\n\n\n\nWhere Orion goes from here\n\nSo far on its journey, the Orion spacecraft has completed several key milestones and outperformed expectations, but as long as the capsule remains in space, there is always risk, Michael Sarafin, the Artemis I mission manager, told reporters during a news conference this week. He noted that the risk of hitting orbital debris is constantly looming. And the capsule’s reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere will be among the most strenuous and treacherous portions of the flight.\n\n“The biggest test after the launch is the reentry because we want to know that that heat shield works at about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius), almost half as hot as the sun, coming in at 32 times the speed of sound (nearly 40,000 kilometers per hour),” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told reporters Monday.\n\nAfter plunging back into the atmosphere, Orion will then need to deploy parachutes safely and slow its descent before making its targeted splashdown.\n\nNASA will have a fleet of recovery vehicles waiting nearby, including a ship, two helicopters, four inflatable boats, two rafts and an aircraft, Sarafin said during a Wednesday news conference.\n\n“The team that is performing the recovery operations is at sea right now performing just-in-time training,” Sarafin added.\n\nIf the Artemis I mission is successful, NASA will then look to choose a crew to fly on the Artemis II mission, which could take off as soon as 2024. Artemis II will aim to send astronauts on a similar trajectory as Artemis I, flying around the moon but not landing on its surface.\n\nThe Artemis III mission, currently slated for a 2025 launch, is expected to put boots back on the moon, and NASA officials have said it will include the first woman and the first person of color to achieve such a milestone.\n\nRead more: The big numbers that make the Artemis I moon mission a monumental feat\n\n‘Outstanding’ performance\n\nThe spacecraft’s performance during this mission has been “outstanding,” Howard Hu, the Orion program manager, told reporters Monday evening. There were some minor issues, including a brief communications problem, early in the journey. But overall, the spacecraft is outperforming expectations, such as producing about 20% more power than it needs, Hu noted.\n\nSarafin added that the mission is going so well that NASA has updated it to include additional objectives to gather more data about the spacecraft’s capabilities and performance.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/12/11/orion-splashdown-nasa-artemis-i-moon-mission/10878274002/", "title": "Welcome home! Orion splashdown completes NASA's Artemis I ...", "text": "After \"skipping\" through Earth's atmosphere blazing in at 25,000 mph, an uncrewed Orion capsule successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Sunday. Touching down at 12:41 p.m. EST, it marked the exclamation point of NASA's nearly monthlong Artemis I test flight.\n\nIt all started at Kennedy Space Center in Florida with Orion's dramatic and spectacular night-illuminating launch atop NASA's 322-foot Space Launch System rocket on Nov. 16.\n\nSunday's conclusion came after Orion's lunar round trip spanning a total of 25½ days and about 1.4 million miles.\n\nCoincidentally, Orion's splashdown occurred on the 50th anniversary of the touchdown on the moon of NASA's last lunar mission, Apollo 17, according to NASA spokesperson Rob Navias.\n\nNASA associate administrator, Cathy Koerner, said Sunday from Mission Control Center at Johnson Space Center, “There's a lot of energy in the room and it's, it's very familiar, but it's also very different as we step into this next episode in human exploration.”\n\nComing in hot and fast\n\nOrion punched through the atmosphere on a complex trajectory called a \"skip reentry\" experiencing temperatures of about 5,000 degrees in the process. It then skipped back out of the upper reaches of the atmosphere alleviating some of the heat, speed, and G-forces.\n\nIt then plunged back in for the final descent. Traveling at about 300 mph, parachutes deployed to slow the spacecraft's descent to just 20 mph before splashing down and bobbing in the Pacific Ocean to await its retrieval by the landing and recovery team that was stationed nearby.\n\nChosen to avoid rough seas and winds associated with a cold front, the landing site off the coast of California near Guadalupe Island off Baja California was predetermined by Air Force weather specialists prior to the departure of the recovery team.\n\nThe primary recovery vessel the USS Portland, a U.S. Navy amphibious transport ship, and the landing and recovery team – composed of about 95 people from the Navy, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and Lockheed Martin – deployed from San Diego on Wednesday to a holding position in the Pacific.\n\nNASA's team was preparing the capsule to be hauled aboard the recovery ship.\n\nJust before reentry, the Orion crew module separated from the service module. It housed its engines and thrusters responsible for maneuvering the craft through space including its Orbital Maneuvering System engine, a piece of repurposed space shuttle hardware, which had previously flown 19 times.\n\nThe service module is designed to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere over a stretch of the Pacific Ocean routinely used for the safe disposal of junk space hardware. According to a NASA blog post, \"the Artemis I trajectory is designed to ensure any remaining parts do not pose a hazard to land, people, or shipping lanes.\"\n\nOther Orion hardware that was jettisoned during landing, including the forward bay cover and three main parachutes, would be fished from the ocean by members of the recovery team.\n\nSplashdown!: Here's how NASA will recover the Artemis I Orion capsule in the Pacific Ocean\n\nFor subscribers: After 50 years, US takes its first step back to moon with launch of Artemis I\n\nOrion's Artemis I journey\n\nThe Artemis I journey to deep space and back pushed Orion's limits in every way imaginable.\n\nAlong the way, the spacecraft even broke decadeslong records that were held over from NASA's Apollo era. Orion flew farther from Earth, punctured through the Earth's atmosphere faster, and experienced hotter reentry temperatures than any other spacecraft ever designed for human spaceflight.\n\nThe last time a human-rated spacecraft flew anywhere close to Orion's newly set record of 268,563 miles away from our home planet, was in 1970 during NASA's Apollo 13 mission.\n\nOn Nov. 25, Orion fired up its Orbital Maneuvering System engine to complete a maneuver called the distant retrograde insertion burn. It flung the capsule past the moon into an orbit about 40,000 miles away called a distant retrograde orbit meaning that Orion traveled in the opposite direction of the moon's orbit around the Earth.\n\nThe highly stable orbit was chosen to test Orion's capability to support future long-duration deep-space Artemis missions that will boast a crew of four astronauts beginning with Artemis II slated to occur in 2024.\n\nOrion's trek home began Dec. 1, when it departed the distant lunar orbit where it had been for about a week. Then, on Dec. 5, it made a quick pit stop skirting less than 80 miles above the lunar surface to harness the moon's gravitational force and fling itself on a trajectory back to Earth.\n\nZebulon Scoville, NASA flight director, called it \"a tip of the hat and a historical nod to the past,\" as Orion sailed past the landing sites of the Apollo 12 and 14 missions but was too far away to capture any detailed imagery.\n\nMore: See the first photo of Earth from NASA's moon-bound Orion spacecraft\n\nWhat's next for NASA's Artemis?\n\nUnlike the cramped command and service modules of the Apollo era, Orion is designed to host long-duration astronaut missions to the moon and back. NASA hopes to utilize lessons learned during Artemis lunar missions as stepping stones to one day venture even further to Mars.\n\nWith the Artemis I mission complete and Orion safely back on Earth, the path is set for NASA to execute a similar mission in the form of Artemis II. Though the mission profile looks similar to Artemis I, it will include astronauts. Orion will also be outfitted with crew seats and life support systems to test out its capability to support long-duration human missions to the moon.\n\nThen, before 2030, Artemis III – a much more complex endeavor involving NASA's Space Launch System rocket, Orion crew capsule, and SpaceX's Super Heavy Starship vehicle which is currently still in development – will aim to deliver two astronauts, the first woman and the first person of color, to the lunar surface.\n\nThe lucky astronauts who will round out the complement of four have yet to be announced publicly.\n\nNASA's Artemis program is designed to enable an extended human presence on the moon. Eventually, the agency hopes to establish a permanent base there supported by a crewed space station that will orbit the moon called Gateway.\n\nOne day, NASA plans to use the moon as a pit stop on the way to Mars.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2020/08/02/private-boats-swarm-spacex-crew-dragon-capsule-after-successful-splashdown/5568313002/", "title": "After successful splashdown of SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule ...", "text": "After SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley successfully splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico Sunday afternoon, several private boats, including one sporting a Trump campaign flag, surrounded the spacecraft as it bobbed in the water.\n\n\"That was not what we were anticipating. Of course, we wanted to make sure that there was a clearing for them to land and the Coast Guard did an excellent job of ensuring that, and then of course after they landed the boats just came in, and we need to do a better job next time for sure,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine told reporters during a media teleconference Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe historic mission, which was the first time American astronauts had flown to space from American soil since the shuttle program retired in 2011, also marked the first ocean splashdown in 45 years since the Apollo-Soyuz program.\n\nMore:NASA astronauts splash down off coast of Florida to end historic SpaceX mission\n\nMore:NASA inspector targets awards as Orion / Artemis over budget and behind schedule\n\nAs recovery teams went to get Behnken, Hurley and the spacecraft safely onboard SpaceX's Go Navigator recovery ship, private boats swarmed the area, blocking the SpaceX teams.\n\n\"I will tell you it's a beautiful sunny day and a lot of boaters were out there and they were certainly intrigued. I think all of America was very anxious to see the capsule land in the water, but yeah, it's something that we need to do better next time,\" Bridenstine said.\n\nHaving unauthorized boats in the splashdown's zone safety area is not only dangerous for the astronauts and recovery teams but also hazardous to the boaters themselves since spacecraft vent toxic propellants used in space.\n\n\"We invited everybody to join us online and to share in the moment ... but certainly, you know approaching the spacecraft is not among those ways,\" Bridenstine said.\n\nNASA had Coast Guard cutters clear the area during the actual splashdown event but once the spacecraft was in the water, \"the boats just made a beeline,\" Bridenstine said.\n\nSpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said in the future, more Coast Guard assets, as well as SpaceX and NASA assets, will be necessary to ensure there are no trespassers.\n\n\"The crews that we had deployed there, their focus was to make sure Bob and Doug got on the boat and exited the capsule safely. It was not really their job to police the area. We had the Coast Guard out there for that,\" Shotwell said.\n\n\"What's important is that Bob and Doug got safely on the boat. We were able to keep the area clear for landing, and then ask people to move back as they came a little bit too close to the Dragon capsule which they did,\" she continued. \"This was a demonstration mission, this is the time that you go learn about these things, and we'll certainly be better prepared next time.\"\n\nContact Antonia Jaramillo at 321-242-3668 or antoniaj@floridatoday.com.

Crew-4 is slated to take off in the early hours of Wednesday morning — at 3:52 am ET, to be exact — before arriving at the ISS around 8 pm ET that same day.\n\nOn board Crew-4 will be NASA astronauts Kjell Lindgren (who will command the mission), Robert Hines, and Jessica Watkins, and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, who is flying on behalf of the European Space Agency.\n\nThe less than 40-hour turnaround between the conclusion of SpaceX’s all-private mission, called AX-1, and the launch of Crew-4 is unprecedented for the company. NASA’s human spaceflight lead, Kathy Leuders, said during a press conference Tuesday that the safety teams recognized they needed to take things “one step at a time.”\n\n“This is the time where you’ve got to rest and get ready to fly and still be watching the hardware and making sure you’re making the right decision,” Leuders said.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Crew-4.\n\nWhat makes this flight historic?\n\nWatkins will become the first Black woman to complete such a mission.\n\nThough more than a dozen Black Americans — including four Black women — have traveled to space since Guion Bluford became the first to do so in 1983, no Black woman has had the opportunity to live and work in space for an extended period, as the ISS has enabled more than 200 astronauts to do since 2000.\n\n“This is certainly an important milestone, I think, both for our [space] agency and for the country,” Watkins said during a press conference last month. “I think it really is just a tribute to the legacy of the Black women astronauts that have come before me as well as to the exciting future ahead.”\n\nShe has a long history with NASA, having begun her career there as an intern, and she previously held roles at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where she worked with the Curiosity Mars rover. A trained geologist, she’s studied the surface of the red planet.\n\nWatkins’ crew mates refer to her by the nickname “Watty.”\n\nWho else is on this mission?\n\nThis mission’s crew is among the first to include as many women as men. Cristoforetti, who previously traveled to the ISS in 2014, is also the sole woman in ESA’s astronaut corps. But Cristoforetti told reporters last month that the situation was “bound to end very soon.”\n\n“We definitely expect to have some some great female [ESA] colleagues by the end of the year,” she added.\n\nCristoforetti, a veteran of the Italian Air Force who’s earned her fighter pilot wings, joined ESA in 2009.\n\nHines is a 22-year veteran of the US Air Force, and this will mark his first time traveling to space since he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2017.\n\nNASA astronauts Jessica Watkins, left, Kjell Lindgren, second from left, ESA (European Space Agency) astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, second from right, and NASA astronaut Robert Hines, right, are seen as they depart the Launch and Landing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Joel Kowsky/NASA\n\nLindgren, who will command this mission, is certified in emergency medicine, and used to work as a flight surgeon on the ground at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, supporting other astronaut missions. Lindgren was born in Taiwan and spent much of his childhood in England before moving to the United States and attending the US Air Force Academy.\n\nThe four astronauts have spent months training together, and even took time to do some extracurricular bonding. Watkins noted they went on a kayaking trip in Eastern Washington “just to get to spend some time getting to know each other and understanding how we all function … and what makes each of us tick, and I think that’s going to be really crucial.”\n\n“We get along great. It is just such a joy to have these folks on this team,” Lindgren added.\n\nHow are they getting to space?\n\nThe crew will travel to the ISS aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which will mark the seventh crewed mission since entering service in 2020.\n\nThough SpaceX designed the Crew Dragon to be reusable and three capsules are already in service, Crew-4 will fly aboard a brand new spacecraft.\n\nThe astronauts get to select the name for their capsule, and this group chose Crew Dragon “Freedom.”\n\nThe Crew Dragon was developed by SpaceX under a $2.6 billion contract with NASA as part of the “Commercial Crew Program.” The idea behind the program was to move NASA into a customer role — allowing private companies to design, build and test a new spacecraft to serve NASA astronauts while still giving the company ownership over the vehicle.\n\nSince SpaceX controls the vehicle, it has the ability to sell seats to whomever it wishes, hence the all-private mission that the company just concluded and one previous space tourism mission last September.\n\nNASA has deemed the program a massive success, and the space agency is adopting the same contracting method for several vehicles involved in its efforts to explore the moon.\n\nWhat will they do in space?\n\nAfter arriving Wednesday evening, the crew will be greeted by the cohort of astronauts already aboard the ISS — including three NASA astronauts and an ESA astronaut who were part of SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission — and three Russian cosmonauts.\n\nThere’ll be a five-day handover period, during which the Crew-3 astronauts will help the Crew-4 astronauts settle in, before Crew-3 returns home aboard their own SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nThen the Crew-4 astronauts will set to work on all the science experiments and space station maintenance duties they have on their to-do list.\n\n“Experiments will include studies on the aging of immune systems, organic material concrete alternatives, and cardiorespiratory effects during and after long-duration exposure to microgravity,” according to NASA. “These are just some of the more than 200 science experiments and technology demonstrations that will take place during their mission.”\n\nA SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts — including the first Black woman to join the International Space Station crew — successfully docked with the ISS Wednesday evening, kicking off a five-month mission.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/business/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-ussf-44-scn/index.html", "title": "SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, world's most powerful rocket, launches ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nSpaceX’s Falcon Heavy — a towering, three-pronged vehicle that is the most powerful operational rocket in the world — returned to the skies on Tuesday for the first time since mid-2019.\n\nThe rocket launched at 9:41 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, hauling satellites to space for the US military in a secretive mission dubbed USSF-44.\n\nThe Falcon Heavy debuted in 2018 to much fanfare as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk elected to launch his personal Tesla Roadster as a test payload on the launch. The car is still in space, taking an oblong path around the sun that swings out as far as Mars’ orbital path.\n\nSince that first test mission, SpaceX has launched only two other Falcon Heavy missions, both in 2019. One sent a hulking TV and phone service satellite to orbit for Saudi Arabia-based Arabsat, and the other delivered a batch of experimental satellites for the US Department of Defense.\n\nBut the rocket had not launched since 2019, as the vast majority of SpaceX’s missions don’t require the Falcon Heavy’s amped up power. SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, on the other hand, has launched nearly 50 missions so far this year alone.\n\nWith each Falcon Heavy launch, the rocket puts on a dramatic showing back on Earth.\n\nAfter Tuesday’s mission, the company only attempted to recover two of the Falcon Heavy rocket’s first-stage rocket boosters — the tall white sticks that are strapped together to give the rocket its heightened power at liftoff.\n\nAs planned, the center booster was left to plunge into the ocean, where it will remain, because it did not have enough leftover fuel to guide its journey home, according to a news release from the US military’s Space Systems Command.\n\nThe two side boosters, however, made their signature synchronized landing on ground pads near the Florida coastline.\n\nIn the past, SpaceX has attempted to land all three of the rocket’s boosters back on landing pads on land and at sea so that they can be refurbished and reused on future missions. It does this to cut down on mission costs. The company has yet to suceed at retrieving all three, although it’s come dramatically close. The two side boosters made a pinpoint, synchronized landing on ground pads after an April 2019 mission, and the rocket’s center booster touched down on a sea-faring platform. But then, rough waves at sea toppled it over.\n\nAll about this rocket\n\nThough the Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world, there are two massive rockets waiting in the wings to claim that title.\n\nNASA’s Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket, which is currently slated to attempt its inaugural launch later in November to send the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission around the moon, is sitting in the Kennedy Space Center’s towering Vehicle Assembly Building, which lies just a few miles from the launch pad where the Falcon Heavy will take flight.\n\nWhile the Falcon Heavy gives off about five million pounds of thrust, SLS is expected to put off as much as 8.8 million pounds of thrust — 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rockets that powered the mid-20th Century moon landings.\n\nAnd just across the Gulf Coast, at SpaceX’s experimental facilities in South Texas, the company is in the final stages of preparing for the first orbital launch attempt of its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket. Though the test flight is still awaiting final approval from federal regulators, it could take flight before the end of the year.\n\nThe Starship system is expected to out-power both SLS and Falcon Heavy by a wide margin. The forthcoming Super Heavy booster, which is designed to vault the Starship spacecraft into space, is expected to put off about 17 million pounds of thrust alone.\n\nBoth the SLS rocket and SpaceX’s Starship are integral to NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time in half a century.\n\nSpaceX also has its own, ambitious vision for the Starship: ferrying humans and cargo to Mars in the hopes of one day establishing a permanent human settlement there.\n\nAll about this mission\n\nThere is not much publicly available information about the USSF-44 mission. In a news release, the US military’s Space Systems Command said only that the launch will put multiple satellites into orbit on behalf of the Space Systems Command’s Innovation and Prototyping Delta, which is focused on quickly developing space technology as it relates to tracking objects in space as well as a range of other activities.\n\nThe Space System Command declined to provide additional information about the mission when reached by email. It referred questions to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, which also declined comment.\n\nThe US military is one of the primary drivers of the domestic rocket economy, doling out lucrative launch contracts that are coveted by private launch companies including SpaceX and its chief competitor in the area, United Launch Alliance, which is a joint operation between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/11/weekends-biggest-news-world-cup-semifinalists-storms-west-and-heisman-trophy-winner/10876548002/", "title": "Weekend's biggest news: World Cup semifinalists, storms in the ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWorld Cup: Semifinalists announced,\n\nAmerican sports journalist Grant Wahl dies in Qatar\n\nThe final four teams in the 2022 Men’s World Cup have clinched their spots.

A White House spokesman said Sunday that Whelan was \"never a choice posed by the Russians\" to free, and that they were only willing to trade for Griner. Biden is facing backlash by Democratic and Republican lawmakers for agreeing to free Bout while the Russians continue to hold Whelan.\n\nLike this roundup of stories?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAn asteroid from space slammed into the Earth’s surface 66 million years ago, leaving a massive crater underneath the sea and wreaking havoc with the planet.\n\nNo, it’s not that asteroid, the one that doomed the dinosaurs to extinction, but a previously unknown crater 248 miles off the coast of West Africa that was created right around the same time. Further study of the Nadir crater, as it’s called, could shake up what we know about that cataclysmic moment in natural history.\n\nUisdean Nicholson, an assistant professor at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, happened on the crater by accident – he was reviewing seismic survey data for another project on the tectonic split between South America and Africa and found evidence of the crater beneath 400 meters of seabed sediment.\n\n“While interpreting the data, I (came) across this very unusual crater-like feature, unlike anything I had ever seen before,” he said.\n\n“It had all the characteristics of an impact crater.”\n\nTo be absolutely certain the crater was caused by an asteroid strike, he said that it would be necessary to drill into the the crater and test minerals from the crater floor. But it has all the hallmarks scientists would expect: the right ratio of crater width to depth, the height of the rims, and the height of the central uplift – a mound in the center created by rock and sediment forced up by the shock pressure.\n\nThe journal Science Advances published the study on Thursday.\n\n“The discovery of a terrestrial impact crater is always significant, because they are very rare in the geologic record. There are fewer than 200 confirmed impact structures on Earth and quite a few likely candidates that haven’t yet been unequivocally confirmed,” said Mark Boslough, a research professor in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of New Mexico. He was not involved in this research but agreed that it was probably caused by an asteroid.\n\nBoslough said the most significant aspect of this discovery is that it was an example of a submarine impact crater, for which there are only a few known examples.\n\n“The opportunity to study an underwater impact crater of this size would help us understand the process of ocean impacts, which are the most common but least well preserved or understood.”\n\nA diagram, incorporating seismic observations and computer simulations, of how the Nadir Crater formed. Courtesy Republic of Guinea, TGS and Western Geco\n\nCascading consequences\n\nThe crater is 8 kilometers (5 miles) wide, and Nicholson believes it was was likely caused by an asteroid more than 400 meters (1,300 feet) wide hurtling into the Earth’s crust.\n\nWhile much smaller than the city-sized asteroid that caused the 100-mile-wide Chicxulub crater that hit off the coast of Mexico that led to the mass extinction of much of life on the planet, it’s still a pretty sizable space rock.\n\n“The (Nadir) impact would have had severe consequences locally and regionally – across the Atlantic Ocean at least,” Nicholson explained via email.\n\n“There would have been a large earthquake (magnitude 6.5 - 7), so significant ground shaking locally. The air blast would have been heard across the globe, and would have itself caused severe local damage across the region.\n\nIt would have caused an “exceptionally large” tsunami wave up 3,200 feet high (1 kilometer) around the crater, dissipating to around five meters high once it reached South America.\n\nBy comparison, the in-air explosion of a much smaller 50-meter wide asteroid in 1908 in Russia, known as the Tunguska event flattened a forest across an area of 1,000 square kilometers.\n\n“At 400 meters or so, the air blast (that caused the crater off West Africa) would have been orders of magnitude larger.”\n\nInformation from microfossils in nearby exploration wells show that the crater was formed around 66 million years ago – at the end of the Cretaceous period. However, there’s still uncertainty – margin or error of around 1 million years – about its exact age.\n\nNicholson said it was possible that the asteroid strike was linked to the Chicxulub impact, or it could simply be a coincidence – an asteroid of this size would hit Earth every 700,000 years.\n\nIf linked, the asteroid could be the result of a break-up of a parent asteroid near the Earth – with the separate fragments dispersed during an earlier orbit of Earth, or it was possible that it was part of a longer-lived shower of asteroids that hit the Earth over a period of a million years or so.\n\n“Finding out the precise age is really critical to test this – again, only possible by drilling.”\n\nEven if linked, it would have been dwarfed by the Chicxulub impact, but it would have still added to the overall cascading set of consequences, he said.\n\n“Understanding the exact nature of the relationship with Chicxulub (if any) is important to understand what was going on in the inner solar system at that time and raised some interesting new questions,” Nicholson said.\n\n“If there were two impacts at the same time, might there be other craters out there, and what was the cascading effect of multiple collisions?”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/02/investing/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sales-spacex-investment/index.html", "title": "The curious story of Elon Musk's Tesla stock sales and SpaceX's ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWhat’s Elon Musk doing with the billions he’s collected in the past two months from selling shares in Tesla?\n\nIt seems possible, maybe even likely, that he’s put at least some of the money into SpaceX, the other company of which he is CEO and primary shareholder.\n\nMost of the proceeds from his $16.4 billion in Tesla stock sales since November 8 will go to pay an estimated $11 billion federal tax bill, leaving him with more than $5 billion to do whatever he sees fit.\n\nEven if he ends up paying $2 billion in additional income tax to the state of California, where Tesla was based for most of the year when he was granted the options on which he will now owe taxes, Musk will be left with a nest egg of more than $3 billion. And his recent moves of both his own residence and Tesla’s corporate headquarters to Texas, with its zero state income tax, makes it unlikely he’ll have to pay the maximum possible tax to California.\n\nPerhaps more telling: Some footnotes in the filing disclosing details of the sales, along with the timing of the last two equity infusions into SpaceX, raise the possibility that Musk is shifting some of his wealth from publicly-traded Tesla (TSLA) into shares of his privately-held company SpaceX.\n\nThose trades are unique for Musk, the nation’s highest profile CEO. It’s the first time in the 12 years that Tesla has been public that he’s held onto cash from the sale of that company’s shares, rather than selling only enough stock to pay looming tax bills.\n\nHis timing is good, as the sales free up cash at a time when Tesla is doing very well in the market, becoming the sixth company in history to be worth $1 trillion, and lifting Musk himself to the status of the richest person on the planet. And it’s being done at a time when his other high profile company, SpaceX, is out in the market raising hundreds of millions in cash to fund its ambitious goals. Those two facts, along with details disclosed in the various filings, certainly raise the possibility that he’s pumping money into SpaceX.\n\nNeither SpaceX nor Tesla (TSLA) responded to requests for comments about how Musk is using the proceeds of his stock sales.\n\nMost Tesla shares sold to cover taxes\n\nMusk sold 10.3 million of the shares on the same days he exercised options to buy an additional 22.9 million shares of Tesla stock. The sales took place on 11 separate days spread out from November 8 through December 28.\n\nThose options had been due to expire on August 13, 2022, so it made sense for him to use them to buy the shares. But once he did so, the value of the shares, less the modest exercise price, became taxable income.\n\nMusk sold shares immediately after exercising the options, with the SEC filing noting that the transactions were made “solely to satisfy the reporting person’s tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of stock options.”\n\nBut not all of them.\n\nThe most recent sales included the notation that 219,000 shares that were sold on December 28 were “solely” to cover his tax bill. Another 715,000 shares he sold that same day, which netted Musk $776 million, went “partially to satisfy” his tax bill, according to the filing.\n\nThe next day, SpaceX made its own filing with the SEC, disclosing that it had raised $337.4 million in new equity investment from an undisclosed investor.\n\nAnd this isn’t the first time this year that a Musk sale of Tesla shares for purposes other than paying taxes was closely followed by SpaceX reporting a new infusion of equity investment.\n\nFrom November 9 through 11, Musk sold 5.4 million shares, raising $5.8 billion. Those were shares he held in a trust, not shares he had just acquired as part of the exercise of options. And while his tax bill is likely much smaller on the sale of those shares, it’s still substantial - about $1.2 billion in federal long-term capital gains taxes, leaving him with about $4.6 billion.\n\nThere’s no indication in the filings as to why he completed those sales, which mark the first time he has sold shares that he has held for an extended period, rather than those he just acquired through the exercise of options.\n\nIt could be because he wanted to follow the outcome of a Twitter poll in which he asked followers if he should sell 10% of his stake in order to increase his taxable income. But it’s equally possible that the motivation was to provide much needed cash for SpaceX.\n\nOn November 15, a few days after he made that unusual sale of shares from his trust, SpaceX disclosed it had raised $388 million in additional equity investments from an undisclosed investor.\n\nA cash-hungry SpaceX\n\nThat cash infusion arrived at an important time.\n\nIn an email sent to SpaceX staff just before Thanksgiving, Musk reportedly warned that the company was facing a cash crisis due to problems developing the Raptor rocket engines and Starship rockets needed to launch its Starlink satellites in 2022. Starlink is a constellation of satellites designed to provide high speed Internet service from orbit.\n\n“We face a genuine risk of bankruptcy if we can’t achieve a Starship flight rate of at least once every two weeks next year,” according to the email reported by Space Explored and also by CNBC. Musk’s email said that the company needed virtually all employees at work during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend to address the problems.\n\nHe also said the company planned to ramp up production of ground stations needed to connect Starlink customers to the Internet. He said it would be making “several million units per year,” which he said will “consume massive capital.”\n\nIn a tweet that followed reports of the email, Musk said that problem with the Starship rocket and its Raptor engines were “getting fixed.” But in a December 29 tweet he said the first orbital test launch of the Starship rocket was delayed to the end of February due to the need to get approval for the unmanned flight from the FAA.\n\nSpaceX and NASA also did not respond to questions from CNN Business about the email to SpaceX staff.\n\nIf SpaceX can fix the problems with its Starship rocket and Raptor engines and get Starlink up and running as planned, the value of SpaceX, already estimated to be worth more than $100 billion, could soar. The money that Musk and other investors have poured into it could lead to a financial bonanza once the company goes public.\n\nSpaceX raised $1.2 billion in equity investments earlier this year, before these two most recent capital infusions. While the names of whomever purchased those additional shares are not public, the amounts of four separate infusions were disclosed in filings with the SEC.\n\nIt’s not clear how much cash Musk had available to him to invest in SpaceX before he started selling his Tesla shares on November 8.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of his estimated $275 billion net worth comes from the nearly $250 billion value of Tesla shares and options he owns, as well as a chunk of money from his undisclosed stake in SpaceX. If Musk was going to make additional investments in SpaceX, selling Tesla shares was the most likely way for him to do so.\n\nThe reported email to SpaceX staff right before Thanksgiving is not the first time Musk discussed the financial challenges and cash drain involved in getting Starlink’s internet service up and running.\n\n“SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable,” he said in a tweet in February. “Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/business/ticketmaster-taylor-swift-ticket-explanation/index.html", "title": "Ticketmaster cancels public sale for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour due to ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAnyone looking to buy a ticket to Taylor Swift’s new tour may be out of luck.\n\nTicketmaster said on Thursday that “due to extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory to meet that demand,” Friday’s public ticket sales for Swift’s Eras Tour has been canceled.\n\nThe sudden cancellation comes after Ticketmaster said Thursday that more than two million tickets were sold Tuesday for her upcoming tour — the most ever sold for an artist in a single day.

We are our history,” wrote James Baldwin in a world that branded his Blackness as inhuman.\n\nKhaled A. Beydoun Marwan Thoaubi\n\nOn Wednesday, on a field in the middle of the Middle East and on the edge of history, Morocco will embody history for itself as the first African and Arab nation to make it to the World Cup semifinals since the tournament began in 1930. Morocco’s national soccer team will face off against France, defending champion and former colonial power.\n\nFrance is favored to win this match, but more importantly, a globe of people who see themselves in their players in between the boundaries of Africa and beyond the outstretched arms of the formerly colonized world will see a team announcing, fearlessly and faithfully, that we are not your inferiors.\n\nMorocco’s celebrated run of World Cup victories has been, in some ways, vicarious vindication against Belgium and Spain, Portugal and France – the most formidable of its former colonial overlords and present footballing foes. While much of France remains largely trapped within a dark history of its own making, Morocco is remaking its own history, claiming its place in the world and the World Cup.\n\nPlayers named Hakim Ziyech, Achraf Hakimi and Sofiane Boufal reversed the French pipeline of poaching Africa’s footballing talent to pursue World Cup gold. Through steadfast play during five matches, followed by spiritual displays where the bowed heads of these footballers kissed hallowed fields then heads of their head-scarved mothers, the Moroccan team’s courage inspired a march toward history that is only one step away from football immortality, win or lose.\n\nSofiane Boufal of Morocco celebrates with a family member after the team's 1-0 victory in the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 quarter final match between Morocco and Portugal at Al Thumama Stadium on December 10, 2022 in Doha, Qatar. Mike Hewitt/FIFA via Getty Images\n\nAs Morocco prepares for its semifinal match in Qatar, it stares ahead and sees France: an eclectic team revered for its modern football dominance, but for many in Africa and the eyes of the formerly colonized world, an old empire reviled for its history.\n\nMoroccans make up nearly one-fifth of the immigrant population in France, living in the heart of its cities and on the fringes of French society.\n\nSurviving between the lines of hijab bans and xenophobia, Moroccans in France – much like their Algerian and Tunisian counterparts from the Maghreb – are liminals. Or, in in the words of the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said, perpetually “out of place” in a France that deems them eternal outsiders.\n\nMany Marocains Francais are stuck inside an existential play where being Moroccan negates the possibility of being either fully or formally French – a tale so essentially French that is has been immortalized by its iconic authors in novels where nameless Arabs were killed by strangers on Algerian beaches. It’s a country where striker Karim Benzema lamented in 2011, “I am French when I score, and Arab when I don’t.”\n\nZinedine Zidane, the undisputed star of the 1998 French side that won the nation’s first World Cup, stands as a cautionary tale shrouded with French ruffles. After he defeated overwhelming favorite Brazil, Zidane’s chiseled face shone across the Arc de Triumph: the son of Algerian immigrants projected upon one of France’s most recognizable totems.\n\nThe story was so monumental at the time, pushing many in France to champion Zidane and his team as symbols unity for FIFA and France. This fleeting symbolism was tarnished by the racism directed at Zidane, and Black and Arab teammates, by many in France, most notably Jean-Marine Le Pen of the political right who cast them as not a truly “French” team.\n\nFrance’s colonial past found new life with the racism encircling the football team, colored by a mutiny led by its African-born players in 2010 and a second championship run in 2018 spearheaded by Adil Rami and N’golo Kante, Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba – Africans and immigrants, Muslims and members of marginalized communities seen by many as not legitimately French.\n\nWhile the 1998 team’s symbolism of unity faded from memory, the 2018 team – many of whom will be on the field again defending France’s title in Qatar – served as an admission that France needed the children of colonialism to lift World Cup gold.\n\nThe victories of 1998 and 2018, therefore, were also indictments of France’s imperial past, because they moved many to brand the title holders “Africa’s championship team,” which placed the shadow of French colonial history around the brightest moments of its football glory.\n\nWhen Les Bleus faces off against Morocco on Wednesday, many French nationals of Amazigh and Arab origin, of Black skin and African roots, will collectively root against the black and blue history of France when staring at their screens. That’s because French football is in many ways a mirror for a society fractured by colonial pasts and calamitous presents. The Moroccan team is its very antithesis: representing an African nation that lifted itself from 44 years of colonialism from France.\n\nFrance, for all of its colonial plunder and footballing splendor, has long been a team that divides, one so tinged with political fracture that former President Nicolas Sarkozy held a meeting with the French Football Federation in 2008 following a match against Tunisia in Paris to demand no more matches be played on French soil against the national teams of former colonies from north Africa.\n\nMorocco, on the other hand and on the other side of history, has emerged as a team that unites those former colonies and builds bridges to others inspired by their play. And beyond its representational significance, the team has galvanized the entire continent of Africa, the global constellation of Muslims and the disparate network of once colonized peoples ready to take on the world and remake it in its vision. For at least one night, at the World Cup in Qatar, the scars of imperial history will be covered by Moroccan red and green.\n\nLooking forward – for Morocco and the legions of fans rising to its side from nations decimated by French imperialism – compels them to look backward. A football match against France is never just football, particularly for the people of Algeria and the Ivory Coast, Tunisia and Togo. Many in these nations see the color of occupation and violence in Les Bleus, and the postcolonial passages of racism that lord over the Parisian banlieues (ghettoes) overpacked with Algerians and Senegalese, Malians and Moroccans.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

It was coming off of political tension between the two countries and it was a way to say that on the soccer field we’re still friends.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2022/04/01/2022-world-cup-draw-usmnt-england-iran-uefa-group-b/7243392001/", "title": "2022 World Cup draw: USMNT faces England, Iran in Group B", "text": "Getting out of the group is only one of the goals the U.S. men have for the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nA World Cup game against England, a team with as rich a history as any in the game and a team most fans know as well as their own, is an opportunity for the Americans to show the progress they’ve made. Play well against England, and it can open eyes and opportunities for this group of players and the ones who will come after them.\n\n“That’s the goal Gregg (Berhalter) set out to accomplish when he took over” as coach, midfielder Weston McKennie said after Friday’s draw. “That’s something that’s always reiterated when we go into camp, to change the way the world views American soccer. No better place and no better time to be able to do that.\n\n“We definitely have the desire to go out there and show we’re not afraid. We don’t belittle ourselves just because we’re playing against England.”\n\nDrawn into Group B on Friday, the Americans also will play Iran and either Scotland, Ukraine or Wales in the World Cup later this year. They won’t know their first opponent until after the playoff in June, but their first game will be Nov. 21, which is also the first day of the World Cup.\n\nThe U.S. then plays England on Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving. The USMNT concludes group play against Iran on Nov. 29.\n\nWAY-TOO-EARLY PREDICTIONS:Breaking down the draw for Qatar 2022\n\nWhile all three group games are important, it’s no surprise the England game immediately drew the most attention.\n\nEngland is currently No. 5 in the world. It was the runner-up at the last European championship, in 2020. Two years earlier, it reached the semifinals at the World Cup in Russia.\n\nEngland’s Premier League, and those who play in it, are also what even casual American soccer fans know best. Premier League games are as accessible in the United States as NFL games, making players such as Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Jack Grealish as familiar as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Gio Reyna.\n\nFor a U.S. squad that is loaded with talent but still inexperienced on the world stage, England will provide a good measuring stick.\n\n“We want to change how everyone looks at us as players and as a nation and ultimately gain the respect of fans around the world,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “We’re not just there to show up. We want to have an impact, obviously on ourselves and our team, but ultimately on how (U.S.) soccer is viewed.\n\n“You want to gain the respect of some of the best footballing nations in the world.”\n\nThat isn’t a cliché, by the way. Despite much of the U.S. team playing in Europe, including several at some of the biggest clubs, American soccer is still considered by many around the world as a development project. The headline in the Daily Mail after the draw said England had gotten a “dream World Cup draw,” and looked ahead to a possible matchup with France.\n\nIn the quarterfinals.\n\nThis even though the USMNT won the group in 2010, the last time it faced England in the World Cup. The only other World Cup game between the teams was in 1950, when the Americans won 1-0, an upset so shocking some newspapers assumed the scoreline was wrong.\n\n“I know there is a lot of respect for American soccer, but this is an opportunity for us to show what we’re made of,” Berhalter said. “They have a good team, but so do we.”\n\nBecause the World Cup is being played in November and December, in the middle of the European soccer season, players are only being released from the clubs a week before the tournament. That means teams in the first groups, including the USMNT, will have little time together before their first match.\n\nIf someone is injured or even worn down, there won’t be any time to get healthy or regroup. It also could affect team chemistry, though the U.S. players have talked often – and positively – about the tight bonds they’ve developed over the past few years.\n\nThe short time to prepare for the first game puts even more importance on the international windows in June and September, and Berhalter said he’s already told his players they’ll need to be available for both of those camps.\n\n“We’ll never have enough time on the field, which is shame. But that is what it is,” Berhalter said. “We’re going to have to be really effective in these weeks in June and then when we get together in September. Because when we get to Qatar, it’s basically prep for a game and go from there.”\n\nThe one advantage to playing on the first day is that, should the USMNT get out of the group, they would have three or four days of rest before the knockout rounds. The round of 16 begins Dec. 3 with the quarterfinals starting Dec. 9. The semifinals are Dec. 13 and 14.\n\nThe final is Dec. 18.\n\nThe USMNT has only faced Iran twice, including a 2-1 loss at the 1998 World Cup that had significant political overtones. Relations between the two countries have been strained, at best, because of U.S. support for the last shah and its backing of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War, as well as Iran’s takeover of the U.S. Embassy during the revolution and the 14-month hostage crisis that followed.\n\nThe handshakes before the game in France had to be choreographed, and Iran’s players gave U.S. players white roses as a symbol of peace. The victory was Iran’s first ever at the World Cup.\n\n“I’m not sure the tension is what it (was). If we were friends back in ’98, 24 years later, I don’t see it any differently,” Berhalter said. “I don’t see them as rivals, I see them as colleagues and two teams competing for the World Cup and trying to do well for their countries in the World Cup.”\n\nNo matter if it is Scotland, Wales or Ukraine that advances out of the European playoff, it will be the USMNT’s first World Cup game against them. The U.S. men are 2-3-3 all-time against Scotland, their last game a 0-0 tie in 2013. They have played Wales only twice, winning once and playing to a 0-0 tie in 2020. They have not beaten Ukraine in their previous four games, losing three and tying once.\n\n“Overall, it’s going to be a strong group,” Berhalter said. “It’s going to be a well-rounded group, and it’s going to be difficult to advance.”\n\nHere's the full draw:\n\nGroup A\n\nQatar\n\nEcuador\n\nSenegal\n\nNetherlands\n\nGroup B\n\nEngland\n\nIran\n\nUnited States\n\nWales vs. Scotland/Ukraine winner\n\nGroup C\n\nArgentina\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nMexico\n\nPoland\n\nGroup D\n\nFrance\n\nPeru vs. Australia/United Arab Emirates winner\n\nDenmark\n\nTunisia\n\nGroup E\n\nSpain\n\nCosta Rica vs. New Zealand winner\n\nGermany\n\nJapan\n\nGroup F\n\nBelgium\n\nCanada\n\nMorocco\n\nCroatia\n\nGroup G\n\nBrazil\n\nSerbia\n\nSwitzerland\n\nCameroon\n\nGroup H", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2022/12/18/world-cup-final-live-argentina-france-score-lionel-messi-updates/10919271002/", "title": "2022 World Cup final recap: Argentina defeats France in penalty kicks", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter four weeks of soccer.in Qatar, Argentina has been crowned the World Cup champion, beating France on penalty kicks Sunday in what will be remembered as one of the great finals of all time.\n\nLionel Messi is a world champion for the first time, finally capturing the just about the only trophy missing from his cabinet. Messi scored twice in the final and converted his penalty kick, finishing the tournament with seven goals in seven matches.\n\nWORLD CUP AT A GLANCE:Take a look back at the 2022 tournament\n\nFrance's Kylian Mbappe finished as the top scorer with eight goals – including three in the final – but his team fell short in the penalty shootout with the chance to win a second consecutive World Cup.\n\nHere's how everything unfolded on Sunday at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar:\n\nLionel Messi is a World Cup champion. Finally.\n\nIn his last World Cup appearance, Messi won the title that has eluded him throughout his illustrious career as Argentina beat France in a penalty shootout Sunday. Gonzalo Montiel, whose handball in extra time gave France a lifeline, made the final penalty, setting off a wild celebration among the Argentina players and their fans.\n\nMessi waved to the fans as several of his teammates dissolved into tears.\n\nWhile this game will be remembered for Messi's majestic moment, it also will be remembered for Kylian Mbappe's heroics. All but left for dead after a lethargic first 80 minutes, he scored twice in 90 seconds to force extra time and then, after Messi had scored, converted a penalty to force the shootout.\n\n– Nancy Armour\n\nARGENTINA WINS IN PENALTIES!\n\nKingsley Coman and Aurélien Tchouaméni missed for France, while Argentina converted all four kicks to win the country's third World Cup championship. Gonzalo Montiel scored the winner for Argentina.\n\nWorld Cup final heading to penalty kicks\n\nFor the third time in history, the World Cup final will be decided by penalty kicks. Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe each scored in the second period of extra time to send this to penalties, truly one of the matches in World Cup history.\n\nEach team had a big chance in the last minute of extra time.\n\nGOAL FRANCE! Kylian Mbappe penalty makes it 3-3\n\nAfter a handball in the penalty area, France's Kylian Mbappe converted from the penalty spot in the 118th minute, his third goal of the night for the second hat trick in World Cup final history.\n\nGOAL ARGENTINA! Lionel Messi scores on rebound to take 3-2 lead\n\nLionel Messi pounced on a rebound to smash the ball over the line and put Argentina ahead 3-2 in the 108th minute of the World Cup final. It's his second goal of the night and he's back in the lead for Golden Boot.\n\nFrance, Argentina still tied after first period of extra time\n\nNeither team scored in the first 15 minutes of extra time, meaning we're just 15 minutes away from penalty kicks if the scoreline holds. Argentina had two huge chances in the final few minutes but France defender Dayot Upamecano made a game-saving slide tackle to block a shot and Lautaro Martinez was unable to get a shot on frame in a 1-on-1 with keeper Hugo Lloris.\n\nWorld Cup final heading to extra time at 2-2\n\nBoth teams pushed hard for a winner in the final 10 minutes of regulation, but we're heading to extra time in Qatar, with an additional 30 minutes and penalty kicks if necessary to decide the world champion.\n\nFour of the last five World Cup finals have gone to extra time, including Argentina's loss to Germany in 2014.\n\nGOAL FRANCE! Kylian Mbappe ties it up\n\nLess than two minutes after scoring a penalty kick to get France back into the game, Kylian Mbappe hammered home the equalizer. Mbappe is now the tournament's top scorer with seven, pulling his country back after struggling for the first 75 minutes of the game.\n\nWow.\n\nArgentina also blew a 2-0 lead in the quarterfinals against the Netherlands, but went on to win in penalty kicks.\n\nGOAL FRANCE! Kylian Mbappe's penalty makes it 2-1\n\nIt's going to be a breathless final 10 minutes plus stoppage time after Mbappe converted from the spot in the 80th minute.\n\nFrance still can't find a way through\n\nAfter a listless first half, the defending champions still haven't been able to get anything going since the break – while Argentina is taking advantage of the space to create some good chances in the first 20 minutes of the half.\n\nHALFTIME: Argentina leads France 2-0\n\nIt was all Argentina in the first half, heading into the break up 2-0 behind goals from Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria. They're 45 minutes away from their first World Cup championship since 1986, and the first of Messi's storied career.\n\nMessi is the first player to score in all four rounds of the knockout stage – converting penalty kicks in the quarterfinals, semis and final after a goal from open play in the round of 16.\n\nGOAL! 2-0 Argentina as Angel Di Maria scores\n\nA beautiful counter-attack ends with Angel Di Maria finding the back of the net on a sweeping cross from Alexis Mac Allister. Lionel Messi's clever flick from the midfield released his teammates into space behind the French back line.\n\nYou're not going to see a nicer goal than that in a World Cup final.\n\nGOAL! Lionel Messi penalty makes it 1-0 Argentina\n\nArgentina's Angel Di Maria was fouled in the box by France's Ousmane Dembélé, gifting a penalty kick to Lionel Messi – who converted cooly from the spot as Hugo Lloris went the wrong way.\n\nIt's Messi's sixth goal of the tournament, and he's now in the lead for the Golden Boot.\n\nArgentina applying pressure early\n\nThe Argentines have been on the front foot in the first 20 minutes, getting a couple of decent looks at goal and have been caught offsides twice already.\n\nFrance goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was down for a little bit after taking some contact in the penalty area.\n\nFrance recovered from flu\n\nLes Bleus are back to full strength. Well, as full strength as they get at this tournament.\n\nMidfielder Adrien Rabiot and defender Dayot Upamecano, who missed the semifinal with the flu, were back in the starting lineup for France for Sunday's final against Argentina. Raphael Varane is also in the starting XI, two days after missing practice with \"flu-like symptoms.\"\n\nIbrahima Konate and Kingsley Coman, who missed practice the same day as Varane, are also available to play.\n\nOne player who isn't available is Karim Benzema.\n\nThe reigning Ballon d'Or winner is training again with Real Madrid after recovering from the thigh injury that's kept him out of the World Cup, and there were reports the club had cleared him to join France for the final. But Benzema is listed on the start sheet as \"absent.\"\n\nThe only change to Argentina's lineup is Angel Di Maria is back starting and Leandro Paredes is coming off the bench.\n\nThe 34-year-old Di Maria started Argentina's first four games at the World Cup, but came on as a substitute in the quarterfinal game against the Netherlands. He didn't play in Tuesday's semifinal against Croatia.\n\n– Nancy Armour\n\nWhat Argentina, France must do to win World Cup final\n\nThis wasn't the final many expected when the World Cup began almost a month ago, what with France hollowed by injuries and Argentina losing to Saudi Arabia in its opener. Yet here we are, the defending champions and Lionel Messi and Co. emerging as the class of the tournament as both chase history.\n\nSo what are the keys to victory for each team?\n\nArgentina:\n\nBe ruthless\n\nForget what's at stake\n\nCorral Kylian Mbappe\n\nFrance:\n\nStay present\n\nDon’t overlook Argentina’s youngsters\n\nDon’t mess with what’s working\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full World Cup final preview here\n\nIs Qatar's World Cup a prelude to Olympics in the Middle East?\n\nThere will come a day, not long from now, when Qatari officials will make their case that the success of this World Cup has shown Doha to be a worthy host of a Summer Olympics. Possibly as early as 2036. They will tout the dazzling World Cup stadiums, first-class training facilities and the efficient metro system that whisked fans between games. They will show photos of those smiling fans, celebrating their teams as the skyline glitters in the background.\n\nThey will remind the IOC that a Middle Eastern country has never hosted an Olympics, and point to the unfairness of excluding a region with more than 400 million people. It will be a compelling argument and one sure to tempt IOC president Thomas Bach, the great statesman he fancies himself to be.\n\n– Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports\n\n2022 Golden Boot: Messi, Mbappe tied for most World Cup goals\n\nThe World Cup final will decide the winner of the Golden Boot award as the top scorer of the tournament.\n\nArgentina's Lionel Messi and France's Kylian Mbappe have each scored five goals in Qatar, with Messi holding the tiebreaker having three assists to Mbappe's two. Their teammates, Julian Alvarez of Argentina and Olivier Giroud of France are tied for third with four goals each.\n\nPremier League, European clubs brace for fallout from winter World Cup\n\nThe tournament in Qatar has been described by FIFA president Gianni Infantino as the “best World Cup ever.” Europe's biggest soccer clubs, however, might not agree.\n\nStaged in November and December for the first time in its 92-year history, the true impact of a midseason World Cup remains to be seen.\n\n“We are exhausted,\" said Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic, who plays for Chelsea in the English Premier League. \"Many of us will be exhausted when we come back to our clubs.”\n\nThe disruption caused by staging the World Cup during the European season has long been a point of contention. Traditionally held in June and July, the tournament dates had to be moved because of Qatar's soaring temperatures at that time of the year.\n\n– Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/football/france-morocco-semifinal-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "France ends Morocco's Qatar 2022 dream and reaches fourth World ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDefending champion France ended Morocco’s 2022 World Cup dream on Wednesday thanks to a 2-0 victory at the Al Bayt Stadium.\n\nTheo Hernández scored on five minutes with an acrobatic finish, with substitute Randal Kolo Muani tapping home late on as France reached its fourth World Cup final just four years after winning in Russia.\n\nBut Morocco, the first African team to reach the semifinal stage of the World Cup, can go home with its head held high after running France close before Kolo Muani’s decisive strike.\n\nFrance is the first defending World Cup champion to reach the final in two decades.

The research could someday mean an end to long searches for compatible donors or dangerous transfusion reactions.\n\nThe experimental transfusion was done at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, England, as part of a collaborative effort among UK scientists to understand how lab-made blood transfusions could work.\n\nThe scientists took whole blood from donors in a UK database and separated out the stem cells. These are the body’s raw materials – the cells from which all specialized cells, like a red blood cell, can generate.\n\nThe researchers grew red blood cells from those stem cells and transfused them into two healthy volunteers.\n\nThe transfusions involved only a tiny amount of blood: the equivalent of one or two teaspoons. A standard blood transfusion would involve many hundred times that amount.\n\nThis stage of the trial involves two mini transfusions at least four months apart, one with a standard donation of red cells and the other with lab-made cells from the same donor.\n\nThe researchers are closely monitoring the volunteers to determine whether the process was safe. They say there have been with “no untoward side effects” so far.\n\nThey’re also watching how long the lab-grown cells last compared with an infusion of standard red blood cells. Red blood cells typically last about 120 days, but a transfusion from a standard donation contains cells that are a variety of ages because the bone marrow continuously makes these cells.\n\nPrevious tests have shown that manufactured cells function like normal cells and that these lab-made cells are likely to survive longer overall while in circulation. This study will determine for the first time whether that’s true.\n\nFurther trials will be necessary to determine whether there could be a clinical use of this lab-grown product.\n\nThe research could eventually make a difference for people with sickle cell disease, those who develop antibodies against most donor blood types, or those with genetic disorders in which their body can’t make red blood cells or the blood cells they make don’t work well.\n\nRed blood cells are the helper cells that carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues, which use this oxygen to produce energy. The process also generates waste in the form of carbon dioxide that the red blood cells take to the lungs to be exhaled out.\n\nWith sickle cell disease – also called sickle cell anemia – red blood cells take on a folded shape that can clog tiny blood vessels and cause organ damage and pain. People with sickle cell often need multiple transfusions over the course of their lives.\n\n“This world leading research lays the groundwork for the manufacture of red blood cells that can safely be used to transfuse people with disorders like sickle cell,” Dr. Farrukh Shah, a researcher on the study and medical director of transfusion for NHS Blood and Transplant, said in a news release. “The need for normal blood donations to provide the vast majority of blood will remain. But the potential for this work to benefit hard to transfuse patients is very significant.”\n\nDr. Glenn Ramsey, medical director of the blood bank at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and a professor of pathology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said he has had many patients over the years who are extremely difficult to transfuse and would have benefited from a therapy like the one in this study.\n\nOften, if there is not a local blood match, he has to turn to the American Rare Blood Donor Program – and even then won’t always find an appropriate donor. In one case a few Thanksgivings ago, it was so difficult to find a match for one patient that they had to turn to a world database and bring in blood from Canada.\n\n“This doesn’t come up very often, and it’s an extreme example, but this would be the kind of problem that these kinds of cells could try to solve,” said Ramsey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nHe found the work “quite exciting” and its potential enormous.\n\nScientists have been working on this issue for many years, he said.\n\n“Down the road in years to come, this might be a way to replace transfusions as we know it,” Ramsey said. “It’s still a long way from getting to that point, but it certainly starts us down the road to see if this will even be feasible.”\n\nDr. Cheryl Maier, an assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and a medical director at the Emory Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies, said the experiment is a “really exciting advancement.”\n\nShe is particularly interested in the possibilities of lab-made red blood cell for people with sickle cell.\n\n“There hasn’t been a lot of attention on some of these diseases, especially sickle cell, which mostly affects African American patients, and it can be really frustrating and disheartening that there isn’t more attention to it,” said Maier, who wasn’t involved in this study.\n\n“For certain patients, especially patients with sickle cell disease or other patients that need some kind of chronic transfusion therapy, if you gave them incompatible blood, they would have oftentimes a very strong bad transfusion reaction,” she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe research could lay the groundwork for studies of things like platelets, which are often in critically short supply, she said. If scientists find that lab-made red blood cell products last longer, it may also improve the quality of life for people who wouldn’t have to be transfused as regularly.\n\n“Even in 2022, there are patients that we almost can’t find units for, and they get a delay in their treatment because we can’t find matching units for them,” Maier said. “I think it definitely has the ability to revolutionize how we support some patients that are really difficult to support with blood products currently.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/updated-boosters-omicron-imprint/index.html", "title": "Updated Covid-19 boosters offer protection, but new studies suggest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe updated Covid-19 booster shots appear to work about as well against the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants as the original boosters they replaced, according to two new studies from research teams at Harvard and Columbia universities.\n\nThe research suggests that our bodies have been well-trained to fight the original virus, which emerged from Wuhan, China, and that boosters mostly reinforce that response. Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/17/world/perseverance-mars-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "title": "New images show intriguing Perseverance discovery on Mars | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

But for nearly two decades since, scientists have struggled to decipher the remaining 8%. Now, a team of nearly 100 scientists from the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium has unveiled the complete human genome – the first time it’s been sequenced in its entirety, the researchers say.\n\n“Having this complete information will allow us to better understand how we form as an individual organism and how we vary not just between other humans but other species,” Evan Eichler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of Washington and the research leader, said Thursday.\n\nThe new research introduces 400 million letters to the previously sequenced DNA – an entire chromosome’s worth. The full genome will allow scientists to analyze how DNA differs between people and whether these genetic variations play a role in disease.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Science on Thursday, was previously in preprint, allowing other teams to use the sequence in their own studies.\n\nUntil now, it was unclear what these unknown genes coded.\n\n“It turns out that these genes are incredibly important for adaptation,” Eichler said. “They contain immune response genes that help us to adapt and survive infections and plagues and viruses. They contain genes that are … very important in terms of predicting drug response.”\n\nEichler also said that some of the recently uncovered genes are even responsible for making human brains larger than those of other primates, providing insight into what makes humans unique.\n\nThis remaining 8% of the human genome had stumped scientists for years because of its complexities. For one thing, it contained DNA regions with several repetitions, which made it challenging to string the DNA together in the correct order using previous sequencing methods.\n\nThe researchers relied on two DNA sequencing technologies that emerged over the past decade to bring this project to fruition: the Oxford Nanopore DNA sequencing method, which can sequence up to 1 million DNA letters at once but with some mistakes, and the PacBio HiFi DNA sequencing method, which can read 20,000 letters with 99.9% accuracy.\n\nSequencing DNA is like solving a jigsaw puzzle, Eichler said. Scientists must first break the DNA into smaller parts and then use sequencing machines to piece it together in the correct order. Previous sequencing tools could sequence only small sections of DNA at once.\n\nWith a 10,000-piece puzzle, it’s hard to correctly arrange small puzzle pieces when they look alike, much like it is to sequence small sections of repetitive DNA. But with a 500-piece puzzle, it’s much easier to arrange larger pieces – or, in this case, longer segments of DNA.\n\nA second challenge was finding cells that contained only one genome.\n\nStandard human cells contain two sets of DNA, a maternal copy and a paternal copy, but this team used DNA from a group of cells called a complete hydatidiform mole, which contains a duplicate of the paternal set of DNA. A complete hydatidiform mole is a rare complication of a pregnancy caused by the abnormal growth of cells that originate from the placenta. This approach simplifies the genome so that scientists need sequence only one set rather than two sets of DNA.\n\nBecause the research team used a duplicate set of DNA, the scientists were unable to sequence the Y chromosome originally. According to lead study author Adam Phillippy, the team has managed to sequence the Y chromosome using a different set of cells.\n\nA complete set of 24 sequenced chromosomes is available on the University of Santa Cruz genome browser.\n\nDecoding this gapless sequence has a high price. Phillippy, who is also head of the gene informatics section at the National Human Genome Research Institute, said that altogether, the project cost a few million dollars or more. But that’s a fraction of the almost $450 million that it cost the Human Genome Project to achieve its final sequence in 2003. And with new technology, sequencing is only getting cheaper.\n\nFor now, it’s still too costly and time-consuming for everyone to sequence their own genome. But research is underway that uses this genome to identify whether certain genetic differences are linked with specific cancers. Knowing the genetic variations could also allow doctors to better tailor treatments, said Michael Schatz, another researcher on the team and a professor of computer science and biology at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPhillippy said he hopes that within the next 10 years, sequencing individuals’ genomes can become a routine medical test that costs less than $1,000. His team continues to work toward that goal.\n\nCharles Rotimi, scientific director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, said in a statement that this scientific achievement is “moving us closer to individualized medicine for all humanity.” Rotimi was not involved in the research.", "authors": ["Tasnim Ahmed"], "publish_date": "2022/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/health/dead-pigs-restore-cellular-function-scn/index.html", "title": "Research in pigs shakes up what we know about dying | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nResearchers at Yale University say they have been able to restore blood circulation and other cellular functions in pigs a full hour after the animals’ deaths, suggesting that cells don’t die as quickly as scientists had assumed.\n\nWith more research, the cutting-edge technique could someday potentially help preserve human organs for longer, allowing more people to receive transplants.\n\nThe researchers used a system they developed called OrganEx which enables oxygen to be recirculated throughout a dead pig’s body, preserving cells and some organs after a cardiac arrest.\n\n“These cells are functioning hours after they should not be,” said Dr. Nenad Sestan, the Harvey and Kate Cushing Professor of Neuroscience and professor of comparative medicine, genetics and psychiatry at Yale, who led the study.\n\n“And what this tells us is that the demise of cells can be halted. And their functionality restored in multiple vital organs. Even one hour after death,” he told a news briefing.\n\nThe scientific journal Nature published the research on Wednesday.\n\n“This is a truly remarkable and incredibly significant study. It demonstrates that after death, cells in mammalian organs (including humans) such as the brain do not die for many hours. This is well into the post-mortem period,” Dr. Sam Parnia, an associate professor of critical care medicine and director of critical care and resuscitation research at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told the Science Media Centre in London. Parnia wasn’t involved in the research.\n\nThe images on top represent the liver and kidney, bottom. The cells on the left have been subjected to a control perfusion while the images on the right represents the organs subjected to perfusion with the OrganEx system detailed in the new study. They show tissue integrity and that certain cellular functions have been restored. Sestan Laboratory/Yale School of Medicine\n\nThe OrganEx system pumps a fluid called a perfusate, mixed with blood, throughout the dead pigs’ blood vessels. The perfusate contains a synthetic form of the protein hemoglobin and several other compounds and molecules that help protect cells and prevent blood clots. Six hours after treatment with OrganEx, the team found that certain key cellular functions were active in many areas of the pigs’ bodies – including in the heart, liver and kidney, and that some organ function had been restored.\n\nIt builds on research published by the same team in 2019 that used a similar experimental system called BrainEx that delivered artificial blood to pigs’ brains, preventing degradation of important neural functions.\n\nHow could the research be applied to humans?\n\nWhile the research is still at an extremely early stage and very experimental, the researchers said they hoped that their work in pigs could ultimately be applied to humans, primarily in terms of developing ways to extend the window for transplants. The current supply of organs is extremely limited, with millions of people worldwide waiting for transplants.\n\n“I think the technology has a great deal of promise for our ability to preserve organs after they’re removed from a donor,” said coauthor Stephen Latham, director of the Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, at the briefing.\n\n“You could take the organ from a deceased donor, and hook it up to the perfusion technology, and perhaps then be able to transport it long distance over a long period of time to get it to a recipient who needs it.”\n\nThe researchers made clear that they were not in any sense bringing the pigs back to life and more work would need to be done to understand whether the organs were useable for transplants.\n\n“We couldn’t say that this study showed that any of the organs of this pig were … ready for transplant into another animals, we don’t know that they’re all functioning, what we’re looking at is at the cellular and metabolic levels,” explained Latham. “And we’re nowhere near being able to say, ‘Oh, my goodness, we’ve restored life not only to this pig, but to any of the individual organs.’ We can’t say that yet. It’s still very much too early.”\n\nThe research has the potential to lead to new treatment strategies for people who have a heart attack or stroke, said Dr. Robert J. Porte of the University Medical Center Groningen, in The Netherlands, said in an article published alongside the study.\n\n“One could imagine that the OrganEx system (or components thereof) might be used to treat such people in an emergency. Of note, though, more research will first be needed to confirm the safety of the system’s components in specific clinical situations,” said Porte, who wasn’t involved in the research.\n\nHowever, Latham said such a possibility was “quite far away.”\n\n“This idea of hooking up (a) person who had suffered ischemic injury, you know, someone who drowned or had a heart attack, I think is quite far away. The much more promising short term potential use here is with organ preservation for transplant.”\n\nThe researchers used up to 100 pigs as part of the study and the animals were under anesthetic when the heart attack was induced.\n\nThe research also helps scientists better understand the process of death – something that’s relatively understudied, Sestan said.\n\n“Within minutes after the heart stops beating, there is a whole cascade of biochemical events triggered by a lack of blood flow, which is ischemia. And what that leads (to) is that oxygen and nutrients that cells need for surviving, are stopped. And this begins to destroy cells,” Sestan added.\n\n“What we showed … is that this progression toward massive permanent cell failure, that does not happen so quickly that it cannot be averted, or possibly corrected.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/10/world/stone-age-earliest-amputation-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "title": "Cave discovery shakes up notions of the Stone Age | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Dr Tim Maloney/Griffith University\n\nIn a remote cave on Borneo, Indonesia, archaeologists have made a discovery that upends our understanding of the Stone Age: an amputee who lived 31,000 years ago.\n\nThe young individual’s skeleton was missing its lower left leg, which Australian and Indonesian researchers believe was carefully severed just above the ankle by a surprisingly skilled prehistoric surgeon, likely using stone tools.\n\nOnly a century ago, most people who underwent amputation would have died – either from blood loss and shock or from subsequent infection.\n\nNot only was this Stone Age surgery successful, but the amputee lived for another six to nine years, ultimately dying of natural causes before being delicately buried by caregivers, according to research.\n\nTrailblazers\n\nScientists at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom have created synthetic mouse embryos in a lab dish – an exciting advance that ultimately could lead to new fertility treatments.\n\nWithout using sperm or egg, the researchers produced an embryo that developed a beating heart and a brain from the stem cells of mice.\n\nBy observing the embryos at this stage of life in a lab instead of a uterus, the scientists got a better view into the mystifying process to learn why a pregnancy might fail and how to prevent this loss.\n\nThey hope to move from mouse embryos to creating models of natural human pregnancies – many of which fail in the early stages.\n\nFantastic creatures\n\nShrew-like Brasilodon quadrangularis lived 225 million years ago. 2022 Anatomical Society/Wiley\n\nThe earliest mammal known to science, Brasilodon quadrangularis, was a shrew-like creature.

The promise has been that if you endure the awkwardness and invasiveness of having a camera travel the length of your large intestine once every decade after age 45, you have the best chance of catching – and perhaps preventing – colorectal cancer. It’s the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Some 15 million colonoscopies are performed in the US each year.\n\nNow, a landmark study suggests the benefits of colonoscopies for cancer screening may be overestimated.\n\nThe study marks the first time colonoscopies have been compared head-to-head to no cancer screening in a randomized trial. The study found only meager benefits for the group of people invited to get the procedure: an 18% lower risk of getting colorectal cancer, and no significant reduction in the risk of cancer death. It was published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudy researcher Dr. Michael Bretthauer, a gastroenterologist who leads the clinical effectiveness group at the University of Oslo in Norway, said he found the results disappointing.\n\nBut as a researcher, he has to follow the science, “so I think we have to embrace it,” he said. “And we may have oversold the message for the last 10 years or so, and we have to wind it back a little.”\n\nOther experts say that as good as this study was, it has important limitations, and these results shouldn’t deter people from getting colonoscopies.\n\n“I think it’s just hard to know the value of a screening test when the majority of people in the screening didn’t get it done,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLess than half of people invited to get a colonoscopy in the study – just 42% – actually got one.\n\nWhen the study authors restricted the results to the people who actually received colonoscopies – about 12,000 out of the more than 28,000 who were invited to do so – the procedure was found to be more effective. It reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 31% and cut the risk of dying of that cancer by 50%.\n\nBretthauer said the true benefits of colonoscopy probably lie somewhere in the middle. He said he thinks of the results of the full study – including people who did and didn’t get colonoscopies after they were invited – as the minimum amount of benefit colonoscopies provide to a screened population. He thinks of the results from the subset of people who actually got the test as the maximum benefit people could expect from the procedure.\n\nBased on his results, then, he expects that screening colonoscopy probably reduces a person’s chances of colorectal cancer by 18% to 31%, and their risk of death from 0% to as much as 50%.\n\nBut, he said, even 50% is “on the low end of what I think everybody thought it would be.”\n\nOther studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.\n\nThe first randomized trial of colonoscopy\n\nThe NordICC study, which stands for Northern-European Initiative on Colon Cancer, included more 84,000 men and women ages 55 to 64 from Poland, Norway and Sweden. None had gotten a colonoscopy before. The participants were randomly invited to have a screening colonoscopy between June 2009 and June 2014, or they were followed for the study without getting screened.\n\nIn the 10 years after enrollment, the group invited to get colonoscopies had an 18% lower risk of colorectal cancers than the group that wasn’t screened. Overall, the group invited to screening also had a small reduction in their risk of death from colorectal cancer, but that difference was not statistically significant – meaning it could simply be due to chance.\n\nBefore the NordiCC trial, the benefits of colonoscopies had been measured by observational studies that looked back in time to compare how often colorectal cancer is diagnosed in people who received colonoscopies versus those who did not.\n\nThese studies can be subject to bias, however, so scientists look to randomized trials that blindly sort people into two groups: those who are assigned to get an intervention and those who are not. These studies then follow both groups forward in time to see if there are differences. Those studies have been difficult to do for colon cancer, which can be slow-growing and may take years to be diagnosed.\n\nThe researchers say they’re going to continue to follow participants for another five years. It could be that because colon cancers can be slow-growing, more time will help refine their results and may show bigger benefits for colonoscopy screening.\n\nResults need careful interpretation\n\nNormally, those kinds of disappointing results from such a large, strong study would be considered definitive enough to change medical practice.\n\nBut this study has some limitations that experts say need to be sorted out before doctors and patients give up on colonoscopies for cancer screening.\n\n“I don’t think anyone should be canceling their colonoscopy,” said Dr. Jason Dominitz, the national director of gastroenterology for the Veterans Health Administration.\n\n“We know that colon cancer screening works,” said Dominitiz, who also co-authored an editorial that ran alongside the study.\n\nThere are several options for colorectal cancer screening. Those include stool tests that check for blood or cancer cells and a test called sigmoidoscopy, which looks only at the lower part of the colon. Both have been shown to reduce both cancer incidence and colorectal cancer deaths.\n\n“Those other tests work through colonoscopy,” Dominitz said. “They identify people at high risk who would benefit from colonoscopy, then the colonoscopy is done and removes polyps, for example, that prevents the individual from getting colon cancer in the first place, or it identifies colon cancer at a treatable stage.”\n\nPolyps are benign growths that can turn into cancers. They are typically removed when identified during a screening colonoscopy, which can lower a person’s risk of colorectal cancer in the future.\n\nStudies are underway in Spain and the US testing colonoscopy head-to-head against stool tests to see which is most effective.\n\nThe best way to screen for colorectal cancer\n\nDominitz said this randomized controlled trial was a test of advice as much as it was a test of the value of colonoscopy.\n\n“If you ask the population to do something, how much of an impact will it have?” he said.\n\nOverall, the study found that just inviting people to get a colonoscopy didn’t have a large beneficial impact across these countries, partly because so many people didn’t do it.\n\nDominitz thinks the low participation can be partly explained by the study’s setting. Colonoscopies are not as common in the countries involved in the study as they are in the United States. In Norway, he said, official colorectal cancer screening recommendations didn’t come until this past year.\n\n“They don’t see the public service announcements. They don’t hear Katie Couric talking about getting screened for colon cancer. They don’t see the billboards in the airport and whatnot,” he said. “So an invitation to be screened in Europe is, I think, likely to be somewhat different than an invitation to be screened in the US.”\n\nIn the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 adults between the ages of 50 and 75 have never been screened for colorectal cancer.\n\nIf you feel squeamish about getting a colonoscopy, the US Preventive Services Task Force says a variety of methods and regimens work to detect colorectal cancer. It recommends screening with tests that check for blood and/or cancer cells in stool every one to three years, a CT scan of the colon every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years paired with stool tests to check for blood annually, or a colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nIn 2021, the task force lowered the recommended age to start routine screening for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 because the cancer is becoming more common in younger adults.\n\nWhen it comes to colorectal cancer, Dominitz said, tests can only be effective if people are willing to do them.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs proof, he points to early results from a large randomized trial from Sweden that’s testing colonoscopy, FIT testing and no screening at all.\n\nResults collected from more than 278,000 people enrolled between March 2014 and the end of 2020 found that 35% of the group assigned to get a colonoscopy actually got one, compared with 55% who were assigned to the stool test group.\n\nTo date, slightly more cancers have been detected in the group assigned to stool testing than in the group assigned to get a colonoscopy – “so participation with screening really is key!” Dominitz said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/health/spinal-cord-stimulation-study/index.html", "title": "New spinal cord stimulation study puts people with paralysis on their ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMichel Roccati lost the ability to walk after a motorcycle accident in 2017, when he had a complete spinal cord injury. But today, equipped with an electrode device implanted on his spinal cord, Roccati can enjoy the simple things again: standing at a bar for drinks with friends, taking a shower without a chair and even strolling through the town with a walker.\n\n“I am free,” said Roccati, who is from Italy. “I can walk wherever I want to.”\n\nRoccati was one of three men between the ages of 29 and 41 to participate in the STIMO clinical trial, led by Dr. Jocelyne Bloch from Lausanne University Hospital and Grégoire Courtine of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The results of the study were published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nThe participants had 16-electrode devices implanted in the epidural space, an area between the vertebrae and the spinal cord membrane. The electrodes receive currents from a pacemaker implanted under the skin of the abdomen.\n\nAll the patients in the trial had a complete loss of voluntary movement below their injuries. Two also had a complete loss of sensation. But with the devices in place, the researchers could use a tablet computer to initiate unique sequences of electrical pulses, sent to the epidural electrodes via the pacemaker, to activate the participants’ muscles.\n\nOther studies have anecdotally seen movement soon after surgery to implant similar devices, but this is the first study to report that all participants independently could take steps on a treadmill just a day after surgery, the researchers say.\n\n“It’s a very emotional moment, because [patients] realize they can step,” Bloch said.\n\nResearchers have been looking into electrical stimulation to the spinal cord for three decades. This study redesigned technology originally used to alleviate pain to target spinal nerve roots.\n\nPrevious studies out of the University of Louisville have shown that people who were completely paralyzed but still had sensation could walk again with several months of rehabilitation through electrical stimulation to the spinal cord. The STIMO trial found that within a week of their surgeries, all three participants could walk independently with the use of body-weight support from parallel bars and an overhead harness.\n\n“For the first time, we have not only immediate effect – though training is still important – but also individuals with no sensation, no movement whatsoever, have been able to regain full standing and walking independently of the laboratory,” Courtine told CNN.\n\nDr. Nandan Lad, a neurosurgeon at Duke University, said this “very exciting work gives a new treatment option for tens of thousands of patients that have spinal cord injury and don’t really have other options.” Lad is leading a clinical trial in this area of research in the US and was not involved in the new study.\n\nThe Swiss team has been able to observe immediate results through important changes in the structure and implantation of their electrode device. The electrode array used in the STIMO trial, made by Onward Medical, is wider and longer than the array most commonly used in similar studies. According to Bloch, this new electrode array allows access to a broader area of the spinal cord to stimulate both trunk and leg muscles.\n\nThe investigators developed an algorithm to optimally place the electrode array, running tests during the surgery to measure muscle activity after delivering pulses. The precise neurosurgical placement of the electrodes is key to the study’s ability to stimulate the necessary muscle groups in the legs so quickly, Lad said.\n\nThe STIMO trial also introduces a new method for initiating and sustaining movement. To begin stimulation, previous studies have relied on participants’ intent to move and the brain signals that follow. In the new study, a timed sequence of stimulations is generated using motor responses to different jolts of electricity. These pre-established sequences trigger movement and attempt to mimic the natural pattern of muscle activation needed to walk.\n\nSusan Harkema, a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery who led the Louisville studies, said it’s encouraging to know that two types of stimulation can generate movement patterns through human spinal circuitry, indicating that some function is retained, even with complete injuries.\n\n“But I don’t think we have enough evidence yet to know the best way to stimulate for the best outcomes,” Harkema told CNN.\n\nWith the STIMO device, people with complete spinal cord injury can regain voluntary movement in their legs only while receiving stimulation. While the device is off, voluntary movement will not be possible. The electrodes can remain in place for life, but the pacemaker needs to be replaced every nine years.\n\nBut with training, patients can build up greater endurance and do a wider range of activities. After the surgery, the study participants received one or two hours of physical therapy four times a week. With three or four months of consistent training, one participant could stand for two hours at a time. Another could walk 500 meters independently. One participant even climbed stairs again.\n\nThe tablet used in the study comes equipped with specific programs coded for certain types of activity, including standing, walking and swimming.\n\n“The more they train, the more they achieve, so they need the motivation to be able to stand a long time,” Bloch said of the participants’ progress.\n\nCourtine and Bloch now plan to work with Onward Medical to make the device more user-friendly for everyday use, such as integrating the program with cellphones or smartwatches. Next, the team is looking to scale up to a larger clinical trial in the US. They estimate that it will take another three or four years for the technology to become commercially available.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn a press briefing last week, the researchers announced that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved a “breakthrough devices” designation to expedite the process.\n\nThis designation would also ensure coverage through the Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technology program if larger clinical trials are successful.\n\n“I think [this research] should be a call for all of us to understand that there is hope for the treatment of these patients,” said Dr. Nicholas Theodore, director of the Johns Hopkins Neurosurgical Spine Center, who was not involved in the research. “I think the hope right now is going to be through an engineering solution and less so than cellular reparative strategy.”", "authors": ["Tasnim Ahmed"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/05/01/the-40-most-important-events-in-the-history-of-space-exploration/111607258/", "title": "Space odyssey: 40 of the most important events in cosmic exploration", "text": "John Harrington\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic affecting every aspect of everyday life, it's easy to forget about what else is going on in the world and that includes significant historical moments and fun holidays.

Sputnik I\n\n• Date: Oct. 4, 1957\n\nThe Soviet Union began the space race by launching humankind's first artificial satellite. The 23-inch diameter sphere transmitted signals to Earth for 22 days and continued in orbit until burning up on Jan. 4, 1958 . The launch of Sputnik shook up the United States, which feared a technology gap between itself and the Soviet Union and began to revamp the nation's science and engineering education. A year later, NASA was created.\n\n2. First creature in space\n\n• Date: Nov. 3, 1957\n\nA stray husky-spitz mix named Laika was the first living creature to orbit the Earth. She was also the first fatal casualty in the Space Age. According to documents at the National Air and Space Museum, Laika reached orbit alive aboard Sputnik 2 – and orbited the Earth in 103 minutes. But the temperature inside the capsule soared above 90 degrees after the fourth orbit following the loss of the heat shield, and Laika died soon afterward. The capsule continued to orbit for five months.\n\n3. US launches first satellite\n\n• Date: Jan. 31, 1958\n\nThe United States joined the space race when Explorer 1 was launched into orbit on Jan. 31, 1958. The satellite lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida under the direction of legendary German-born scientist Wernher Von Braun. Explorer 1, which was 80 inches long and 6.25 inches in diameter, revolved around Earth in a looping orbit that took it as close as 220 miles of Earth and as far away as 1,563 miles. Explorer orbited the Earth more than 58,000 times before burning up on March 31, 1970.\n\n4. First creatures return from space\n\n• Date: May 28, 1959\n\nLess than two years after Laika perished while orbiting the Earth, two monkeys, Able and Baker, became the first living beings to return to our planet alive. Able, a female rhesus monkey, and Baker, a female squirrel monkey, were sent into space by the United States aboard a Jupiter missile. The flight lasted about 15 minutes and the spacecraft's speed topped 10,000 miles an hour. The monkeys suffered no ill effects from the flight that included a period of weightlessness. The success of the mission encouraged scientists to believe manned space travel was possible. Able died during a medical procedure shortly after the flight but Baker became a celebrity and received as many as 150 letters a day from schoolchildren.\n\n5. Yuri Gagarin\n\n• Date: April 12, 1961\n\nSoviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to fly into space and return to Earth safely, beating the United States by several weeks. Gagarin circled the planet in 108 minutes aboard the Vostok 1 spacecraft that traveled at 17,000 miles an hour. The launch of Sputnik and the triumph of putting a man into space were twin shocks to American pride and ratcheted up the competition in the space race.\n\nThe new space race:Many countries and companies seek resources on the moon and Mars\n\nSpace tech:Inventions we use every day that were actually created for space exploration\n\n6. First US man in space\n\n• Date: May 1, 1961\n\nThe United States had hoped to be the first nation to put a man into space, but the Soviet Union won that race with Gagarin accomplishing that feat. Several weeks later, Alan Shepard flew the Freedom 7 spacecraft on a suborbital 15-minute flight that reached a peak altitude of 116 miles and a top speed of 5,180 miles an hour. Unlike Gagarin, whose capsule was automatically controlled, Shepard was able to take control of his spacecraft for short periods.\n\n7. Kennedy's speech on space exploration\n\n• Date: May 25, 1961\n\nSeveral weeks after Alan Shepard became the first American in space, President John F, Kennedy gave a speech before both houses of Congress, committing the nation to space exploration. Kennedy's clarion call for an ambitious space program included landing Americans on the moon and returning them safely to Earth by the end of the decade as well as other space projects.\n\n8. Glenn orbits Earth\n\n• Date: Feb. 20, 1962\n\nLess than a year after Gagarin became the first man to orbit the Earth, John Glenn became the first American to do so, completing three orbits around the planet aboard the Friendship 7 capsule. Glenn was already a military hero by the time he was chosen to be an astronaut for Project Mercury. After he completed his mission, he went on to a successful political career as senator from Ohio. He made history again at the age of 77 in 1998 by becoming the oldest person to fly into space when he flew on the space shuttle.\n\n9. First woman in space\n\n• Date: June 16, 1963\n\nCosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova is not a household name in the United States, but she is revered in Russia because she was the first woman to fly in space – 20 years before Sally Ride became the first American woman to do so. Tereshkova orbited Earth 48 times in her space capsule, the Vostok 6. That was her only trip into space. She received the highest honors from the Soviet Union and was bestowed the United Nations Gold Medal of Peace. Tereshkova toured the world and became a staunch advocate for Soviet science.\n\n10. First space walk\n\n• Date: March 25, 1965\n\nRussian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov became the first person to walk in space, after leaving the Voskhod spacecraft that carried two passengers. Leonov walked in space for about 10 minutes. His suit expanded minutes after he stepped into space owing to the lack of pressure, and he was unable to fit through the hatch when he tried return to the spacecraft. Leonov had to release a valve to partially depressurize his suit to allow him to get back into the spaceship. Three months later, Ed White would become the first American to walk in space.\n\n11. First pictures of Mars\n\n• Date: June 14, 1965\n\nThe spacecraft Mariner 4 was the first to fly to Mars and the first to transmit pictures of Mars. Mariner 4 spent all of 25 minutes taking 21 photographs of the red planet from distances ranging between 6,200 miles and 10,500 miles above the planet. Those first, blurry images of Mars's craters and barren landscape suggested to some scientists that the planet was similar to our moon and dispelled hope that it had ever held life.\n\n12. Soviets land spacecraft on moon, Venus\n\n• Date: Feb. 3, 1966\n\n1966 would prove to be a significant year for the Soviet space program. In February of that year, the USSR would land an unmanned spacecraft called Luna on the moon that sent back transmissions to Earth. Less than a month later, on March 1, the Soviet Union would succeed in landing a spacecraft on Venus. The Venera 3 impacted Venus, the first spacecraft to land on another planet, but the communications systems failed before any data could be retrieved.\n\n13. US lands spacecraft on moon\n\n• Date: June 2, 1966\n\nThe United States, still playing catch-up in the space race, landed its first spacecraft, the unmanned Surveyor 1, on the moon in June. The mission was considered a success, and the technology needed to achieve landing and operations on the lunar surface succeeded. Surveyor 1 performed engineering functions and took photos. It sent televised images of the spacecraft's footpad and the lunar surface.\n\n14. Soviet spacecraft first to orbit moon\n\n• Date: Sept. 15, 1968\n\nThe Russian spacecraft Zond 5 became the first spacecraft to orbit the moon and return to Earth. Aboard the Zond 5 were turtles, mealworms, seeds, bacteria, and other living things. After the spacecraft landed in the Indian Ocean, all of the biological passengers were safely recovered. The flight was seen as a precursor to manned lunar landing.\n\n15. Apollo 8\n\n• Date: Dec. 21-28, 1968\n\nApollo 8 was among the most famous of America's space missions – the first manned spacecraft to leave Earth's gravity and reach the moon. The mission conducted a number of tests that were crucial to the lunar landing the following year. The crew photographed the lunar surface, both the far side and nearside, as well as Earth. The mission' \"Earthrise\" photo would become among the most famous of the 20th century. The astronauts had six live television transmissions, including the Christmas Eve broadcast in which they read from the book of Genesis, at the time the most-watched TV broadcast ever.\n\n16. Men walk on moon\n\n• Date: July 20,1969\n\nAmerican astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on a celestial entity other than Earth on July 20, 1969, fulfilling President John F. Kennedy's hope of landing humans on the moon before the end of the decade. Armstrong's quote as he stepped on the lunar surface, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" has become immortal. It was one of America's proudest moments, witnessed by hundreds of millions of people on television around the world. Armstrong and Aldrin spent two and a half hours on the surface collecting rocks and soil samples and, among other tasks, measuring by laser the exact distance between the moon and Earth. Armstrong and Aldrin were the first of 12 men, all Americans, who have walked on the moon.\n\n17. First space station\n\n• Date: April 19, 1971\n\nThe first space station, Salyut 1, launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1971, achieved significant progress in humankind's ability to live and work in space. The cylindrical-shaped Salyut 1 was adapted for use with the manned Soyuz spacecraft and was about 65 feet long and 13 feet in diameter at its widest section. Salyut spent 175 days in space before crashing into the Pacific Ocean. The three-man Soviet crew that went aboard Salyut 1 for 23 days later died while returning to Earth when their Soyuz spacecraft accidentally lost its air.\n\n18. US orbits Mars\n\n• Date: Nov. 13, 1971\n\nMariner 9, an unmanned NASA probe, became the first spacecraft to circle another planet after it completed an orbit around Mars. The photographs sent back from the Mariner 9 showed Mars to have varied geology and weather, according to a NASA summary of the mission, including ancient river beds, extinct volcanoes, canyons, weather fronts, ice clouds, and morning fogs.\n\n19. Russians land on Mars\n\n• Date: May 28, 1972\n\nOn May 28, 1972, the Soviet spacecraft Mars 3 made the first soft landing on another planet when it touched down on Mars. Mars 3 had arrived at the red planet the previous December. The landing craft failed after relaying 20 seconds of video data to the orbiter. The orbiter continued to relay data to Soviet scientists until August 1972, measuring surface temperature and atmospheric conditions.\n\n20. Skylab I\n\n• Date: May 14, 1973\n\nThe United States launched its first orbiting laboratory, Skylab I, on May 14, 1973. Skylab proved to be a success, despite technical glitches at the start. Skylab orbited the Earth for six years before it deteriorated and fell into the Indian Ocean and western Australia. Skylab hosted three crews of three astronauts who lived on the station for a total of 168 days in orbit. They conducted experiments in biomedical and life sciences and solar astronomy. Skylab also was important in understanding how humans endure extended time in space.\n\n21. US-Soviet astronauts link up in space\n\n• Date: July 17-19, 1975\n\nCold War adversaries achieved detente in space in 1975, when U.S. astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts came together for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. The Soyuz craft bore cosmonauts Alexei Leonov and Valery Kubasov, while the Apollo carried astronauts Thomas Stafford, Vance Brand, and Donald Slayton. The two spacecraft docked in space for two days. After the vehicles came together, the space travelers shook hands and embraced and exchanged presents, plaques, and flags from their respective nations. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was the first mission in which the two nations began cooperating in space.\n\n22. Viking 1 and 2\n\n• Date: July/September 1976\n\nNASA launched the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft in 1975, and both landed on Mars the following year, becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to land on the red planet. The photos that the two spacecraft returned to Earth deepened the knowledge about the planet's atmosphere and geology, with a greater understanding of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. Viking 1 and 2 conducted biology experiments intended to look for signs of life. These experiments provided no indication of living microorganisms near the landing zones.\n\n23. Voyagers I and 2 send back Jupiter images\n\n• Date: August and September 1977\n\nVoyagers 1 and 2 were launched two weeks apart by NASA in 1977. NASA wanted to take advantage of a unique alignment of planets that happens once every 176 years. Such an alignment could slingshot each spacecraft from one planet to the next, aided by a planet's gravity. Voyager 1 would become the first spacecraft to fly by Jupiter and Saturn. It transmitted its first pictures of Jupiter back to Earth in April 1978, when it was 165 million miles away. Voyager 1 was the first to journey into interstellar space in 2012. Voyager 2 flew past Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Since their launch, the spacecraft have been traveling along different flight paths and at different speeds.\n\n24. Space shuttle takes off\n\n• Date: April 12, 1981\n\nNASA's shuttle Columbia became the first winged spaceship to orbit Earth and return to airport landing. Columbia flew 28 missions and spent more than 300 days in space. Its early missions focused on repairing and deploying satellites and telescopes. Later, NASA shifted Columbia's priorities to science. Tragedy struck the shuttle on Feb. 1, 2003, when the spacecraft and crew were lost after the Columbia burned up during reentry. The disaster shut down the shuttle program for more than two years.\n\n25. First US woman into space\n\n• Date: June 18, 1983\n\nSally Ride became first American woman in space, about 20 years after Soviet cosmonaut Tereshkova became the first woman in space. Ride, who held a doctorate in physics, was selected as one of NASA's first six female astronauts. She entered space aboard the space shuttle Challenger. Ride would make two shuttle flights. Among the tasks she performed in flight were operating the shuttle's robotic arm.\n\n26. Voyager 2 transmits images from Uranus\n\n• Date: Jan. 24, 1986\n\nVoyager 2, launched into orbit with Voyager 1 in 1977, began transmitting images from Uranus in 1986. The massive planet showed some evidence of boiling oceanic water. Voyager 2 also found 10 new moons and two new rings around Uranus. Voyager 2 would become the only spacecraft to study all four of the solar system's outer planets at close range.\n\n27. Voyager 2 transmits images from Neptune\n\n• Date: Aug. 1, 1989\n\nVoyager 2 was built to examine the farthest reaches of the solar system, and this included the planet Neptune. The spacecraft is the only human-made object to have flown to that planet. During its journey, Voyager 2 found five moons and four rings around Neptune. It was discovered that Neptune's largest moon, Triton, was the coldest known planetary body in the solar system. The planet also was more active than previously believed, with winds exceeding 680 miles per hour. Hydrogen was the most common element in the atmosphere.\n\n28. Hubble space telescope\n\n• Date: April 25, 1990\n\nThe Hubble space telescope was the first such device placed in space to orbit the Earth – a great leap forward toward our understanding of the cosmos and revolutionized astronomy. The telescope was developed by NASA along with the European Space Agency. The device, named after Edwin Powell Hubble, was placed into orbit by members of the space shuttle Discovery. The telescope is located high above clouds and beyond light pollution and is able to capture high-resolution images of space. The device enables NASA to better observe space shuttles and space walks.\n\n29. Mapping Venus\n\n• Date: Aug. 10, 1990\n\nNASA's Magellan spacecraft began mapping the surface of Venus using radar equipment. The objective of the mission was to study land formations, plate tectonics, and erosion. The spacecraft was also tasked with modeling the interior of Venus. Magellan's mission revealed that Venus showed no evidence of Earth-like plate tectonics, and that 85% of the planet's surface were of volcanic lava flow, with the remainder mountain formations.\n\n30. Discovery of extrasolar planets\n\n• Date: Oct. 6, 1995\n\nThe scientific community made an important announcement on Oct. 6, 1995: Swiss astronomers Didier Queloz and Michel Mayor found the first so-called exoplanet that was orbiting a star like our sun. The exoplanet – so named because it is outside our solar system – was named 51 Pegasi b, also called \"Dimidium.\" The planet's surface was hot and gaseous, and it is about half the size of Jupiter. Since then, astronomers have found several thousand extrasolar planets.\n\n31. Galileo probe\n\n• Date: Dec. 7, 1995\n\nNASA's Galileo spacecraft was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter six years later. The spacecraft explored Jupiter and its moons for almost four years. The mission found indications of melted saltwater ocean under an ice layer on Jupiter's moon Europa. It also found evidence of liquid saltwater on two other moons. Galileo's mission ended on Sept. 21, 2003, when it descended into Jupiter's atmosphere.\n\n32. Pathfinder arrives on Mars, transmits data\n\n• Date: July 4, 1997\n\nThe Mars Pathfinder, which arrived on Mars on America's birthday in 1997, was significant in that the mission included the first successful rover on Mars. The rover was called Sojourner, named after Sojourner Truth. An interesting aspect of the mission was NASA's use of a different landing technique for the lander. Instead of using rockets to touch down on the surface, NASA employed airbags. The rover examined rounded pebbles and cobbles at the landing site and the shape of rocks suggested these so-called conglomerates were formed as the result of running water from a past when the weather was warmer. Pathfinder also observed water ice clouds in the lower atmosphere in early morning.\n\n33. International Space Station\n\n• Date: Nov. 20, 1998\n\nThe International Space Station, launched in 1998, is a multinational habitable satellite located in the Earth's lower orbit. It is the biggest artificial body in space and at times can be seen with the naked eye. The ISS has played an important role in American and Russian space missions since its launch. Fifteen nations manage and use the ISS, with NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), and the European Space Agency as the major partners who contribute the most funding. The ISS has witnessed many milestones, among them the biggest gathering in space – 13 people – and the longest spacewalk at 8 hours and 56 minutes during a construction mission in 2001 involving astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms. Jeanne Crews, a female engineer at NASA, invented a multi-layered shield that is as light but stronger than aluminum and it is still in use on the ISS.\n\n34. Landing on an asteroid\n\n• Date: Feb. 1, 2001\n\nThe NEAR Shoemaker was the first spacecraft specifically designed to study an asteroid. In this case, the asteroid was Eros, the closest asteroid to Earth. As NEAR descended onto Eros, it sent back dozens of high-resolution pictures. Even though NEAR was not designed to land on an asteroid, NASA decided to do so. It touched down and sent back data, until its final signal on Feb. 28, 2001.\n\n35. First space tourist\n\n• Date: April 28, 2001\n\nDennis Tito, a millionaire businessman from California, became the first paying passenger to travel into outer space, opening up the commercialization possibilities of space flight. Tito dropped a cool $20 million for the privilege. He took off off from Kazakhstan for an eight-day trip aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft and flew to the International Space Station.\n\n36. Cassini spacecraft sends back images of Saturn's rings\n\n• Date: July 1, 2004\n\nThe Cassini mission, a collaborative effort of NASA, the ESA, and the Italian Space Agency, launched on October 1997 and arrived at Saturn about seven years later. Since the spacecraft reached Saturn, Cassini has taken more than 450,000 images of the planet, its famous rings, and its moons. The spacecraft operated for 13 years before plunging into Saturn's atmosphere on Sept. 15, 2017.\n\n37. Mars rover landing\n\n• Date: Aug. 6, 2012\n\nThe rover Curiosity is still operating on Mars. It has sent detailed photographs of the Martian landscape, and scientists believe that the red planet likely had an environment that could have supported life a long time ago. According to NASA, the mission has four goals: Determine whether life ever existed on Mars; analyze the Martian climate; study the geology of the planet; and prepare for human exploration.\n\n38. Musk rocket returns to Earth\n\n• Date: April 8, 2016\n\nWhen he is not pioneering electric car technology, entrepreneur Elon Musk is involved with space travel. In 2016, his 14-year-old SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket made its first landing aboard a drone ship at sea after dropping off cargo to the ISS. It marked the first time Musk's company had been able to achieve a successful ocean landing. Successful landings also means Musk's company can reuse rockets, saving the company money.\n\n39. 7 Earth-size planets found\n\n• Date: Feb. 22, 2017\n\nIn recent years, astronomers have made many exciting discoveries of planets beyond our solar system. On Feb. 22, 2017, NASA announced the discovery of planetary system Trappist-1, which contains seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a red dwarf star. It is about 40 light years from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. Scientists determined that three of the planets in the system were found in the habitable zone, meaning there is a chance they may have liquid water and an atmosphere that can support life.\n\n40. Probing moon and rings\n\n• Date: April 13, 2017\n\nIn the hunt for extraterrestrial life, NASA's Cassini spacecraft mission may have found an interesting possibility beyond the Asteroid Belt. One of Saturn's moons, Enceladus, contains a chemical reaction beneath its icy surface that may suggest it can support life.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

It’s synthesized in a purely chemical process to produce a crystalline form,” said Goodwin, who is the chief medical officer of COMPASS Pathways, the company that manufactures COMP360 and conducted the study.\n\nExperts in the field found the study findings promising.\n\n“They clearly found a dose effect and clinically meaningful improvement in just three weeks,” said Dr. Matthew Johnson, a professor in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. He was not involved in the new study.\n\n“If you were in the 25-milligram group, you were nearly three times as likely to respond than if you were in the 1-milligram group,” said Johnson, who coauthored safety guidelines for psychedelic research in 2008.\n\nThe rapid response to treatment was notable as well.\n\n“The maximum effect (was) seen the day after receiving the treatment. This contrasts with standard antidepressants, which take several weeks to reach maximum effect,” said Dr. Anthony Cleare, a professor of psychopharmacology and affective disorders at King’s College London, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\nHowever, there are a number of issues that need further study before this drug would be available for clinical use, experts said.\n\n“The effects did start to wear off by three months, and we need to know how best to prevent the depression returning,” Cleare said, adding that not enough is yet known about potential side effects.\n\n“While the safety profile seems encouraging overall, great care is obviously needed when using psychoactive substances such as psilocybin. Larger studies are on the way that we hope will help answer these issues,” he said.\n\nBenefits faded\n\nThe clinical trial occurred at 22 sites in the United States, Canada, the UK and seven countries in Europe. The study was designed to test the safety of different dosages of the proprietary version of psilocybin.\n\nThe 233 study participants had treatment-resistant depression, which can only be diagnosed after a person fails to respond to two courses of antidepressants. Of the 9 million people in the US with medically treated depression, 3 million patients are resistant to treatment, studies have estimated. Globally, some 100 million people have treatment-resistant depression, Goodwin said.\n\nPeople with the condition are at a high risk of physical illness, disability, hospitalization and suicide, the study said.\n\nAny study participants on antidepressants were required to wean themselves from those medications prior to the start of the trial. Psychedelic treatment doesn’t work on people who are actively taking antidepressants — the receptors where psychedelics attach in the brain are already flooded with serotonin from their current mood-altering drugs.\n\n“Participants were requested to remain off antidepressant treatment during the first 3 weeks after the trial-drug administration; however, these medications could be started at any time during the trial if deemed clinically necessary by a physician investigator,” the study said.\n\nDepression severity for each person was assessed the day before treatment using a psychological scale widely used by clinicians. Counselors trained to offer psychological support were present during the psychedelic trips, which lasted between six and eight hours. Participants were also given two more therapy sessions in the first week, the study said.\n\nDepression levels were documented the day after the “trip” and another five times over a 12-week period. About 37% of people who took the 25-milligram dose showed improvement. In fact, 29% were considered to be in remission at week three, the study found.\n\nBy week 12, however, the positive impact on depressive symptoms had waned and no longer reached a level of statistical significance, the study found.\n\n“The incidence of sustained response at week 12 was 20% in the 25-mg group, 5% in the 10-mg group, and 10% in the 1-mg group,” wrote psychobiologist Dr. Bertha Madras, director of the laboratory of addiction neurobiology at Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, in an accompanying editorial. She did not participate in the study.\n\n“This is not a spectacular response rate for a psychiatric treatment … and we would only expect this to worsen over a longer follow-up period,” said Dr. Ravi Das, an associate professor of educational psychology research methods and statistics at University College London via email. He who was not involved with the study.\n\nIn addition, “there were an uneven number of severely depressed patients in each group; with significantly fewer severely depressed people in the apparent ‘effective’ (25mg) dose group,” Das said in a statement. “This does not appear to be acknowledged in the paper.”\n\nSafety profile\n\nHeadache, nausea, fatigue and dizziness plagued 77% of the study participants and occurred at all dosage levels, which experts say is a typical response on the day of psilocybin administration.\n\nA small number of people in all three dosage groups experienced suicidal thoughts or injured themselves over the 12-week follow-up period, the study found. Within the first three weeks alone, two people in the 25-milligram group thought about suicide and two intentionally injured themselves. Two people in the 10-milligram group were suicidal, one self-injured and one was hospitalized for severe depression, the study reported.\n\nThose behaviors are “common in treatment-resistant depression studies — most cases occurred more than a week after the COMP360 psilocybin session,” the company said.\n\n“Remember that this is in people who were assessed not to be at significant risk of suicide when they entered the trial. The numbers were fairly small, but this is something that will need to be taken carefully into account in any later-stage trials,” said Kevin McConway, professor emeritus of applied statistics at The Open University, a British public research university.\n\nThe study results are promising, but many questions remain and it’s unknown if this drug would be successful for different types of depression, said McConway, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“They can’t tell us how effective this psilocybin plus therapy treatment is in comparison with other existing drug or non-drug treatments for depression,” said McConway, noting that as a next step for follow-up trials.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}]}

The research comes from the Commonwealth Fund and Yale School of Public Health.\n\nTheir study, published Tuesday, found that without Covid-19 vaccines, the nation would have had 1.5 times more infections, 3.8 times more hospitalizations and 4.1 times more deaths than it did between December 2020 and November 2022.\n\nAs it stands now, Covid-19 has caused at least 99.2 million cases and more than 1.08 million deaths in the US. Just in the past week, there were 2,981 new deaths and 30,253 new hospital admissions, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe study estimates that the vaccinations were also a good financial bet, saving the US $1.15 trillion in medical costs.\n\nIf you factor in the cases of long Covid that vaccines likely prevented, the savings may be much higher, according to Alison Galvani, one of the study authors.\n\n“Given the emergency of highly transmissible variants and immune-evading variants like Omicron, it is a remarkable success and an extraordinary achievement,” said Galvani, founding director of the Yale Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis.\n\n“Moving forward, an accelerating uptake of the new booster will be fundamental to averting future hospitalization and death.”\n\nNearly 658 million Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States. However, uptake of the new boosters – which target the original virus strain as well as the Omicron BA.4/5 subvariants – has been slow since they were authorized this fall. Only about 14% of the eligible population has gotten one, and 1 in 5 people in the US are still completely unvaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nThe Biden administration has been encouraging more Americans to get boosted, especially with holiday gatherings coming up.\n\n“Don’t wait. If you wait, you put yourself at risk,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said Friday at an AARP event. “We’re entering the colder months of the late fall and the early winter. We’re all going to congregate with our families and friends for the holidays. If you are up to date, great. If you are not, get vaccinated now.”\n\nCovid-19 case numbers have been trending upward, as have deaths and hospitalizations, according to the CDC.\n\nAbout 14% of the US population lives in an area that meets the CDC’s criteria for a “high” Covid-19 community level, including New York City, Los Angeles County and Maricopa County, Arizona – a sharp increase from less than 5% last week but far below levels of prior surges.

The vaccinated categories include people who were vaccinated with the primary series and people who had been vaccinated and received at least one non-bivalent booster.\n\nAccording to a CNN analysis of additional CDC data for September, 12,593 people died of Covid. A CDC sample of the deaths found 39% were unvaccinated, and 61% were vaccinated.\n\nThis phenomenon has many people – especially vaccine skeptics, but even stalwart vaccine supporters – confused and wondering if Covid vaccines and boosters are still effective and warranted.\n\nThe short answer is yes – but understanding why requires a crash course in statistics. We enlisted the help of Jeffrey Morris, a professor and the director of the Division of Biostatistics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who helped us define three key reasons more vaccinated than unvaccinated people are dying of Covid.\n\nStatistics, part 1: base rate fallacy\n\nOne of the main reasons we see more vaccinated than unvaccinated people dying of Covid is a basic one. At this point in time, there are simply many more people who are vaccinated.\n\nThink of it like this: If we round the September deaths to 13,000 and use the CDC sampling percentages, approximately 7,800 were vaccinated and approximately 5,200 were unvaccinated. The conclusion might be that you are far more likely to die if you are vaccinated. And, mathematically that would be true based on the raw numbers alone. If you stopped your analysis at this point, you will have committed a statistical error known as a base rate fallacy.\n\nIf instead, you take the extra step of accounting for the total number of fully vaccinated adults 18 and older in the United States (around 203 million) versus the total number of unvaccinated adults (around 55 million), a very different picture emerges.\n\nAmong the vaccinated population, 7,800/203 million died in September, which equals a rate of 38 deaths for every 1 million people. For the unvaccinated population, 5,200/55 million died, which equals a rate of 95 deaths for every 1 million people. That means an adult who is unvaccinated is roughly 2.5 times more likely to die than one who is vaccinated.\n\n“You have to take into account the size of those groups,” explained Morris, who also publishes a blog, COVID-19 Data Science, to “just communicate what the emerging data suggest.”\n\nStatistics, part 2: Simpson’s paradox\n\nThere is another important difference when looking at the vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations in the United States. The vaccinated population skews older and has more health conditions. These are the same groups that are much more likely to have worse outcomes, like hospitalization and death, when infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. For example, CDC data show more than 90% of deaths through mid-November have been in those 65 or older.\n\n“So those things lead to a higher risk of death and also a higher probability of being vaccinated,” Morris said. “That’s the key: if the vaccine uptake of those high-risk groups is high enough, then we can have a majority of the hospitalized or fatal cases be higher in the vaccinated population.”\n\nYou are more likely to die if you are older, and also more likely to be vaccinated if you are older. It does not mean vaccination is more likely to lead to death.\n\nSo if age isn’t taken into account when assessing vaccine efficacy, it can lead to something known as Simpson’s paradox, where a trend can appear to be the opposite of reality.\n\nMorris said those kinds of errors not only result in a serious underestimation of the benefit of vaccines but also to downright wrong conclusions, even flipping the results – in this case, making it appear that vaccines increase the risk of death.\n\nThis happened in August 2021, with a study out of Israel – a highly vaccinated country – showed 60% of those hospitalized with severe Covid were fully vaccinated, causing misinterpretation and raising questions about the continued value of vaccination.\n\nMorris said he has also seen Simpson’s paradox when people look at the rate of Covid deaths before vaccines were rolled out in 2020 versus since then, or comparing countries with higher vaccination rates to countries with lower vaccination rates.\n\n“It’s a lot more subtle, but the pandemic has provided a number of pure examples of it. So the bottom line with all of that is, we can’t accurately assess the effects of vaccines from simple summaries,” Morris said, however “seemingly intuitive” they may appear.\n\nWhat the numbers show\n\nA more telling and accurate comparison is between the death rate per 100,000 among unvaccinated people compared to the death rate of vaccinated people, adjusted for age.\n\nCDC data show that for the week of September 25, people age 12 and older who were unvaccinated had a death rate of 1.32 per 100,000. Those who were vaccinated (but without an updated, bivalent booster) had a death rate of 0.26 per 100,000. And those who were vaccinated and boosted had a death rate of 0.07 per 100,000.\n\nBroken down further by age, the numbers are even starker: The death rate during that week for those in the oldest age group, 80 and above, was 14.16 per 100,000 for the unvaccinated, 3.69 for those who were vaccinated but had not received the bivalent booster, and 0.0 for those who were vaccinated and boosted.\n\nOverall, the CDC estimates that for the whole month of September, among those 12 and older, there was an almost 15 times lower risk of dying from Covid-19 for the vaccinated and boosted compared to the unvaccinated.\n\nUnfortunately, uptake of the booster is low: Only 13.5% of the US population 5 and older is vaccinated and has gotten the new updated (bivalent) booster. Among those 65 and older, that percentage is 34.2%.\n\nIt’s not to say that vaccines are entirely risk free. For example, in people – especially males – between the ages of 5 and 39, there were 224 verified cases of myocarditis or pericarditis, inflammation of the heart and lining, reported to the CDC after vaccination with an mRNA vaccine between December 14, 2020, and May 31, 2022. But that was out of almost 7 million vaccine doses administered.\n\nA study examining those figures found myocarditis/pericarditis occurred within seven days approximately 0.0005% of the time after the first dose, 0.0033% of the time after the second dose of the primary series, and 0.002% after the first booster – but it varied by age and sex, and was much more common among 16- to-17-year-old males after a second shot or a booster.\n\nAccording to a separate analysis of nearly 43 million people in England, the researchers found that for younger men, the Moderna vaccine in particular had the highest rates of post vaccine myocarditis – although this number was still very low, 97 per million people exposed (0.0097%) – leading some to suggest a different vaccine for that age group or a longer interval between vaccine doses.\n\nWaning immunity + new variants = lower efficacy\n\nStatistical optical illusions aside, the fact is, there are more so-called breakthrough cases among the vaccinated. They have always existed. Since December 2020, we have known these vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing severe illness and death, let alone infection. When vaccines were first introduced, their efficacy was estimated to be an astonishing 95% against severe illness and death. They even protected people at a very high rate against infection.\n\nBut the efficacy keeps ticking downward. Part of it is waning immunity: Over the course of several months, antibody levels fade away – that’s just how the body works – even though there is still some protection, thanks to B cells and T cells. Getting boosted – or catching Covid – can help increase antibody levels for a few months at least. Between those two options, it’s far safer and less disruptive to get a booster than to risk illness.\n\nMeanwhile, new variants keep cropping up, and they are increasingly able to evade our immune system. Unlike earlier variants, including the highly transmissible Delta variant, descendants of the Omicron lineage are escape artists.\n\n“The emergence of Omicron at the end of 2021 was a game changer, as Omicron and its subsequent subvariants demonstrated strong immune evasion properties, with mutations in the spike protein and especially the [receptor binding domain] that reduced the neutralizing ability of the vaccine-induced antibodies,” Morris noted. The result is a great reduction in vaccine efficacy against infection, as well as against severe and fatal disease.\n\nThis actually means it’s more important to get boosted, especially if you are in a high-risk category, and as the weather gets colder and we gather indoors to spend time together.\n\nThe newest booster – the bivalent booster – is designed to protect against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and against the more recent Omicron subvariants, although how much and for how long is still unknown.\n\nCovid cases, and deaths have slowed down in recent months, but those numbers are trending up like they’ve done during the holidays in previous pandemic years. For the week of December 7, weekly new cases topped 65,000 and Covid claimed the lives of almost 3,000 people. Both represent an increase of around 50% from the week before, according to CDC data.\n\nAll of this is happening at a time when hospitals are already full of patients sick with the flu and RSV.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nI know we’re all tired of hearing that we need to roll up our sleeves and get yet another Covid-19 booster.\n\nBut remember, many of us get the flu shot every year: We don’t assume we are protected from a flu vaccine a year ago. We get the shot even in seasons when the flu vaccine is much less effective than the Covid vaccine (the latest one appears to be a good match). We don’t call it a booster – it’s just the annual flu vaccine. And we don’t track the rate of so-called breakthrough flu infections; unlike Covid, we don’t routinely test people for flu unless they are demonstrably sick, so we have no way of knowing how many people, vaccinated or not, are infected and asymptomatic or mildly ill.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor some diseases, like measles, a single vaccine or a previous infection provides us with a near lifetime of protection. Even though we hoped for a one-and-done scenario when the Covid vaccines rolled out two years ago, the virus didn’t lend itself to that. Newer vaccines are being studied that could offer far more durable protection.\n\nAnalyzing all of this data without falling into the trap of a base rate fallacy or Simpson’s paradox isn’t easy, as you can see. And it is also clear the overall effectiveness of the vaccines have waned over time and with new variants.\n\nHowever, two years later, a more thorough statistical analysis of vaccine effectiveness shows they are still cause for celebration.", "authors": ["Dr. Sanjay Gupta"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/02/11/lancet-commission-donald-trump-covid-19-health-medicare-for-all/4453762001/", "title": "Roughly 40% of the USA's coronavirus deaths could have been ...", "text": "About 40% of the nation’s coronavirus deaths could have been prevented if the United States’ average death rate matched other industrialized nations, a new Lancet Commission report has found.\n\nWhile the Lancet Commission on Public Policy and Health in the Trump Era faulted former President Donald Trump’s “inept and insufficient” response to COVID-19, its report said roots of the nation’s poor health outcomes are much deeper.\n\nCommission co-chairs Dr. Steffie Woolhandler and Dr. David Himmelstein, professors at the City University of New York's Hunter College and longtime advocates for a single-payer health system such as \"Medicare for All,\" said the report, published Thursday, underscores decades of health, economic and social policies that have accelerated the nation’s disparities.\n\nThe report found U.S. life expectancy began trailing other industrialized nations four decades ago. In 2018, two years before the pandemic, the report said 461,000 fewer Americans would have died if U.S. mortality rates matched other Group of Seven nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\n'Hard truths and important facts':Biden pushes for coronavirus testing reset with $50 billion plan\n\n“The overriding thing that we need to do in our country is to decrease the huge and widening inequalities that have emerged in our nation,” Himmelstein said.\n\nCOVID-19 has disproportionately affected people of color, with the death rates among Blacks increasing 50% compared with whites. Coronavirus deaths for people of color are 1.2 to 3.6 times higher than for whites; the disparities were especially high among middle-aged adults, possibly a sign of crowded living conditions and jobs that did not allow people to safely distance, the report said.\n\nPublic health measures such as mask wearing and physical distancing could have saved lives, Woolhandler said, but Trump failed to create a national response, instead leaving crucial decisions to states.\n\nHis actions \"caused a lot of citizens to fail to take it seriously and interfered with the kind of coordinated response they have been able to use in a lot of countries that are more successful than the U.S. in controlling the epidemic,\" Woolhandler said.\n\nIn addition to response to the pandemic, the report said Trump weakened the Affordable Care Act, and 2.3 million more Americans became uninsured, a figure that does not include those who lost employer-provided coverage during the pandemic.\n\n'The worst possible time':HHS gives cold shoulder to victims of common vaccine injury\n\nThe commission took aim at Republicans and Democrats alike. The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 marked the end of the New Deal and civil rights era in favor of \"neoliberal policies\" that eroded social programs, the report said. The report assailed Democrat Bill Clinton's support for tightening welfare eligibility and signing a federal crime bill that led to \"mass incarceration,\" disproportionately harming Latinos and Black men.\n\nPrivate insurers’ charged “exorbitant overhead and profits” when extending government-subsidized coverage to lower- and middle-income Americans under former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the report said.\n\nThe commission suggested a long list of executive orders and legislative actions to reverse trends negatively affecting the health of Americans. Among the fixes: Adopt a single-payer health system such as Medicare for All, championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders during his run for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination.\n\n“We’re still in a very deep hole. We have 30 million uninsured people. We have tens of millions of more who are underinsured,” Woolhandler said. “The thing that would be best for the health of the population would be Medicare for All.”\n\nThe commission’s wish list goes beyond medical care to include progressives ideals such as the Green New Deal, criminal justice reform, repealing Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and increasing spending on social programs to the levels of six other industrialized nations.\n\nWoolhandler and Himmelstein are co-founders of Physicians for a National Health Program, which advocates for a single-payer health system.\n\nBiden has rejected Medicare for All and instead wants to bolster the Affordable Care Act with more lucrative subsidies for low- and middle-income earners. House Democrats unveiled a bill this week that would boost tax-credit subsidies for Americans who purchase marketplace plans. Biden already signed an executive order to reopen enrollment on HealthCare.gov from Feb. 15 through May 15.\n\nIn 2019, the Urban Institute estimated that adopting a single-payer system such as Medicare for All would increase federal spending by $34 trillion over 10 years. The think tank has not updated the study, but Urban Institute Health Policy Center fellow and economist Linda Blumberg said health care spending increases each year.\n\nTracking COVID-19 vaccine distribution by state:How many people have been vaccinated in the US?\n\nSuch an ambitious overhaul also would likely need to be gradual to minimize disruption to hospitals, doctors and patients. \"If you were going to do it responsibly and you were going to phase it in over a period of time, that actually makes it cost more money,\" Blumberg said.\n\nThe commission said a single-payer system would save $626 billion each year on medical billing and administrative costs. While the report did not say how much Medicare for All would cost, it cited a study that found 20 of 22 models predicted total health spending would be less under a single-payer system.\n\nIn December, the Congressional Budget Office reported that a single-payer plan would increase federal spending from $1.5 to $3 trillion in 2030 over projected levels. However, total public and private health-care spending could range from savings of $700 billion to an increase cost of $300 billion. The more optimistic scenario counts on administrative savings and health providers agreeing to lower payments.\n\n\"A Medicare for All program would substantially increase economic equality,\" Himmelstein said. \"Poor people spend a much larger share of their incomes for their health care even though they get much less for their health care.\"\n\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter at @kalltucker, or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/health/unvaccinated-covid-deaths-growing/index.html", "title": "Growing share of Covid-19 deaths are among vaccinated people ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSince Covid-19 vaccines became widely available, there has been a wide gap in deaths between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. But recent Covid deaths are much more evenly split as highly transmissible variants take hold, vaccine protection wanes and booster uptake stagnates.\n\nBreakthrough infections have become more common in recent months, putting vulnerable populations at increased risk of severe disease or death as more and more transmissible variants continue to spread. This seems to be especially true for seniors in the United States, who were among the first to get their initial vaccine series.\n\nIn the second half of September – the height of the Delta wave – less than a quarter of all Covid-19 deaths were among vaccinated people, federal data shows. But in January and February, amid the Omicron surge, more than 40% of Covid-19 deaths were among vaccinated people.\n\nCovid-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives in the United States since the first shot was administered in December 2020, and the unvaccinated are still far more likely to be hospitalized or die than people who are vaccinated with at least two doses of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nBut evidence continues to build around the critical importance of booster shots.\n\nOf those vaccinated people who died from a breakthrough case of Covid-19 in January and February, less than a third had gotten a booster shot, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The remaining two-thirds had only received their primary series.\n\nOverall, the risk of dying from Covid-19 is still about five times higher for unvaccinated people than it is for those vaccinated with at least their primary series, CDC data shows.\n\nBut there’s a significant disparity by level of vaccination, too: When adjusted for age, people vaccinated with only their initial series faced about three times greater risk of dying than those who also have their booster shot.\n\nThe CDC encourages people to be “up-to-date” on Covid-19 vaccinations – which includes getting boosters at the appropriate time – but still defines a person to be “fully vaccinated” if they’ve received at least their initial vaccination series.\n\nBut this week, a senior Biden administration official was more direct: All adults need a third shot.\n\nVaccination is the best way for individuals to protect themselves against Covid-19, and protection is most effective with at least three shots, the official said.\n\nOthers have emphasized the importance of boosters to save lives, too.\n\n“Almost no one in this country should be dying from Covid” with up-to-date vaccinations and appropriate antiviral treatments, Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said Saturday on CNN Newsroom.\n\n“What we really should be worried about is getting the boosters that we need to stay up to date so with the new variants that we have, we don’t have unnecessary deaths and hospitalizations.”\n\nBoosters benefit high-risk seniors most\n\nIn the first year of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths – more than 80% – were among seniors age 65 and older.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, especially during the Delta surge, the average age of people dying of Covid-19 shifted younger. Less than 60% of those who died in September were 65 or older, according to provisional data from the CDC.\n\nBut 2022 has looked a lot more like 2020 and the first winter surge; so far this year, about three-quarters of all Covid-19 deaths have been among seniors.\n\nStudies have suggested that Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. Data from the CDC published in January found that getting boosted was 90% effective at preventing hospitalizations during a period when Omicron was the dominant variant. In comparison, getting two shots was 57% effective when it had been at least six months past the second shot.\n\nThe vast majority of seniors completed their initial series more than a year ago now. And while booster uptake among seniors is better than other age groups, less than two-thirds of seniors have gotten a booster shot.\n\nThe CDC now recommends a second booster shot for this age group, too, and uptake is even lower.\n\nCNN’s analysis of CDC data from recent months suggests that disparities in risk among vaccinated people who are boosted compared with those who only have their initial series are most prominent among this vulnerable age group.\n\nCovid-19 deaths are preventable\n\nDaily Covid-19 deaths in the US have fallen to a fraction of what they were in January and February amid the Omicron surge, but hundreds are still dying each day.\n\nCases are rising in nearly all states right now, and the White House has warned that another wave in the coming fall and winter could cause 100 million new cases – both raising the potential for more severe disease and tragic loss.\n\nBut experts say we have the tools to ensure infections don’t turn tragic.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGetting more Americans boosted against Covid-19 could make a big difference as the country heads into the fall and winter, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Monday.\n\n“It’s really important that we try to get the half – or a little bit more than a half – of Americans who have only received two doses to get that third dose,” he said. “That may make a difference moving forward here, and it may particularly make a difference now that we’re coming into yet another wave of Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/covid-boosters-deaths-winter/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 boosters could prevent about 90,000 US deaths this winter ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCovid-19 vaccinations could save thousands of lives and billions of dollars this winter.\n\nA new analysis suggests that if more people in the United States get their booster by the end of the year, about 90,000 Covid-19 deaths could be prevented this fall and winter.\n\nBut if booster vaccinations continue at their current pace, the nation could see a peak of more than 1,000 Covid-19 deaths per day this winter, according to the study, published Wednesday by The Commonwealth Fund.\n\nThere are now more than 400 daily Covid-19 deaths, on average, in the United States.\n\n“When you look at the data of the deaths and severe disease among unvaccinated versus vaccinated and boosted, versus vaccinated and doubly boosted, the data are crystal clear of the difference in severity and death among people who are not vaccinated,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday during a webinar hosted by the University of Southern California’s Center for Health Journalism.\n\n“Yet in this rich country of ours, we have 68% of the population is vaccinated and only one half of those have received one booster,” Fauci said. “We rank very poorly in our acceptance of vaccines.

Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Omicron variant will 'find just about everybody,' Fauci says, but ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the Omicron variant spreads like wildfire across the United States, it’s likely just about everybody will be exposed to the strain, but vaccinated people will still fare better, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert said Tuesday.\n\n“Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”\n\nIn contrast, those who are not vaccinated are “going to get the brunt of the severe aspect of this,” he added.\n\nAcross the United States, at least one in five eligible Americans – roughly 65 million people– are not vaccinated against Covid-19. More than 62% of the country has been fully vaccinated, but only 23% are fully vaccinated and boosted, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFauci’s comments came in response to a question about whether the pandemic has entered a new phase. That will come when there’s enough protection in the community and drugs to easily treat severe Covid-19, he said, adding, “We may be on the threshold of that right now.”\n\nAlso Tuesday, US Food and Drug Administration acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said that while most people could catch the virus, the focus now should be on making sure hospitals and essential services function.\n\nWoodcock was responding to a question from Sen. Mike Braun about whether it’s time for the United States to change its Covid-19 strategy. Her statement was not a new assessment of Covid-19, but rather an attempt to make clear the need to prioritize essential services as the Omicron variant surges.\n\n“I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is: Most people are going to get Covid,” Woodcock said Tuesday at a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. “And what we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, you know, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the number of US patients hospitalized with Covid-19 hit a record high, adding strain to health care networks and pushing states toward emergency staffing and other measures as they struggle to cope.\n\nMore than 145,900 people were in US hospitals with Covid-19 as of Tuesday – a number that surpasses the previous peak from mid-January 2021 (142,246), and is almost twice what it was two weeks ago, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe hospitalization record comes amid a surge in cases fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to JHU.\n\nThe country has averaged 1,646 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week – 33% higher than a week ago, according to JHU. The peak average was 3,402 daily on January 13, 2021, JHU data shows.\n\nThe Omicron variant caused 98.3% of new coronavirus cases in the United States last week, according to estimates posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA technician administers a Covid-19 test Monday at a drive-thru location at Churchill Downs, Kentucky. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nLeaders activate new measures to combat surging numbers\n\nHospitals are increasingly juggling staffing issues – not just because of the increased demand, but also because their employees, who are at a high risk of infection, have to isolate and recover after testing positive.\n\nIn Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a limited state of emergency Monday after the number of intensive care unit hospitalizations more than doubled since December 1. The order allows hospitals to expand bed capacity and gives more flexibility in staffing, he said, adding that it also expands the use of telehealth as well as expanding which medical professionals can give vaccines.\n\nIn Texas, at least 2,700 medical staffers are being hired, trained and deployed to assist with the surge, joining more than 1,300 personnel already sent across the state, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement to CNN.\n\nKentucky has mobilized the National Guard to provide support, with 445 members sent to 30 health care facilities, the state announced.\n\n“Omicron continues to burn through the commonwealth, growing at levels we have never seen before. Omicron is significantly more contagious than even the Delta variant,” said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, noting the earlier variant that spurred a surge of cases in the summer and fall.\n\n“If it spreads at the rate we are seeing, it is certainly going to fill up our hospitals,” he said, and Kentucky is “down to 134 adult ICU beds available.”\n\nAnd New Jersey reinstated a public health emergency, Gov. Phil Murphy announced, saying the state needed to “commit every resource available to beating back the wave” caused by Omicron. In the past two weeks alone, the state saw more than 10,000 people requiring hospitalization due to Covid-19, the governor said in a video announcement.\n\nMitigation measures such as mandatory masking are also being revived in some areas.\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney signed a universal indoor mask mandate Monday because of hospitalization increases, with some hospitals “over 100% inpatient bed capacity amid crippling staffing shortages,” he said. Churches and places of worship are exempt, while businesses should provide masks to customers and have signage about indoor mask requirements.\n\n“It’s time for everyone to pitch in and do what works. Wear your mask indoors. Avoid gatherings or expect to get and spread Covid. Get your vaccine and, if eligible, get boosted. That’s how we’ll get through this surge without endangering more lives,” Carney said.\n\nShare of hospitalizations from breakthrough infections is growing, but risks for unvaccinated are higher\n\nThe HHS data on Covid-19 hospitalizations includes both those patients who are hospitalized because of Covid-19 complications and those who may have been admitted for something else but test positive for Covid-19. This has been true throughout the pandemic, though the share of patients who fall into each category may have changed over time.\n\nFully vaccinated people are accounting for a growing share of people hospitalized with Covid-19 – but hospitalizations among people who received a booster shot are still rare, and the gap in risk by vaccination status has been wide.\n\nBetween April and July 2021, before the emergence of the Omicron variant, more than 90% of Covid-19 hospitalizations were among people who were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, according to a study published by the CDC.\n\nBut a sampling of data collected by CNN suggests that figure has dropped to somewhere between 60% and 75% in recent days and months:\n\n• In Pennsylvania, about 75% of Covid-19 hospitalizations between September and early December 2021 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• In New York, about 61% of Covid-19 hospitalizations during the week ending January 2, 2022 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• Beaumont Health, the largest health care system in Michigan, reported on Thursday that 62% of Covid-19 patients in its eight hospitals were unvaccinated.\n\nIn some hospitals, up to 40% of patients with Covid-19 “are coming in not because they’re sick with Covid, but because they’re coming in with something else and have had Covid or the Omicron variant detected,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nBut Covid-19 cases in hospitals strain resources, regardless of whether a patient was hospitalized because of Covid-19, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n\n“If they get (incidentally) diagnosed with Covid in the hospital, they still need to go into infection protocol – personal protective equipment, all of that still needs to be utilized. So it’s a huge drain on the system overall,” Gupta said Tuesday.\n\nWhile fully vaccinated people are accounting for a larger share of Covid-19 hospitalizations, multiple accounts suggest that those who are fully vaccinated and boosted account for a small share.\n\nIn the University of Maryland Medical System, less than 5% of hospitalized patients were fully vaccinated and boosted, President and CEO Dr. Mohan Suntha said Thursday. Beaumont Health reported Thursday that only 8% of Covid-19 patients were fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for data on the share of Covid-19 hospitalizations by vaccination status.\n\nThe agency publishes data on its website regarding the relative risk by vaccination status. Cumulatively, the risk of hospitalization has been eight times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people. But in the last week of November, CDC data showed that hospitalization rates were about 17 times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people.\n\nSchools and industries face Omicron issues\n\nThe debate over safety in schools from Covid-19 continues to play out as only about one in six children ages 5 to 11 is fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC.\n\nAs Los Angeles prepared to return to school on Tuesday, approximately 62,000 students and staff had tested positive for Covid-19 and will have to stay home, data from the Los Angeles Unified School District showed Monday, equating to a 14.99% positivity rate. The positivity rate of Los Angeles County at large, by comparison, has spiked to 22%.\n\nIn Chicago, educators returned to school Tuesday and students are expected to resume in-person learning Wednesday following a nearly weeklong dispute. The Chicago Teachers Union had voted to teach remotely last week, and the school district responded by canceling classes for four days.\n\nThe agreement, announced late Monday, included metrics for when a classroom would need to go remote due to Covid-19 levels.\n\nIn areas where schools have returned to in-person learning after the holiday break, the time needed for those with Covid-19 to recover has impacted some essential services.\n\nOther sectors also are struggling due to high infection rates.\n\nSome municipalities have seen nearly a quarter of their trash collection workforce call in sick in recent weeks due to Covid-19, leading to delays, according to the Solid Waste Association of North America.\n\n“This coincided, unfortunately, with increased trash and recycling volumes associated with the holidays. However, we hope that as volumes decline and sanitation workers return to work, these delays will prove temporary,” executive director and CEO David Biderman said in a statement Monday.\n\nIn travel, US airlines canceled thousands of additional flights over the weekend due to Covid-19 callouts and winter storms, and cruise line Royal Caribbean International announced it has canceled voyages on four ships because of “ongoing Covid-related circumstances around the world.” Last week, Norwegian Cruise Line canceled the voyages of eight ships.\n\nPublic transit systems in major metropolitan areas such as New York City and Washington, DC, have had to scale back service with employees ill from Covid-19.

The sharpest increase was in White women at a rate of 1.69%, and especially in the South among White women 40 to 44, who had the highest rise at an increase of 4.5% annually. Rates also increased among Black women at 0.67% annually.\n\nOverall prevalence of the disease was higher in Black women. The incidence of advanced cervical cancer was 1.55 per 100,000 Black women compared to 0.92 per 100,000 White women, according to the researchers.\n\n“I think the biggest takeaway is that we are seeing this increase, and there are a couple of things,” Francouer said. “One thing is that, you know, as with many health disparities, metastatic cervical cancer disproportionately affects minority populations, Black and Hispanic women. But then when you look at these trends, we’re actually seeing the largest rate of increase in advanced cervical cancer in non-Hispanic White patients.”\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends that cervical cancer screening should begin at the age of 25 and that screenings should take place every five years up to the age of 65.\n\n“Cervical cancer is incredibly preventable with proper screening as well as access to vaccinations for the HPV virus,” said Francoeur. “And so, to me, these findings were very surprising because I would have expected with the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and more and more women getting health insurance to see kind of the opposite findings of more people being able to get screened.”\n\nWhen looking at trends in relation to age, the largest and fastest increases in metastatic cervical cancer were seen in the 30- to 34-year-old age group, she said, adding that people in this group are generally healthy and might forego health insurance if they don’t get it through an employer.\n\nIn the study, Francouer and colleagues noted that “known” disparities in access to screening and health care are associated with higher rates of advanced cervical cancer among Black and Hispanic women. But the findings showed White women were more likely to report no cervical cancer screening in over five years than other racial and ethnic groups, and White teens have the lowest rate of HPV vaccination.\n\n“This highlights how important it is for everyone to have access to routine health care and be able to access recommended screening tests, and how even in young, otherwise healthy women, pap screening is very important and can save lives,” Francoeur said.\n\nShe also highlighted that the data used for the research only went through 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“I suspect that with reduced access to health care during the Covid-19 pandemic, we may even see continued worsening of these trends,” she said. “There’s many studies looking at different cancers and how people are having later presentations in the setting of the Covid-19 pandemic.”\n\nCervical cancer screening saves lives\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends routine HPV vaccination at 11 or 12 years old, although it can be started as early as age nine. If not adequately vaccinated when younger, vaccination is recommended for everyone through the age of 26.\n\n“We know that cervical cancer in today’s day and age, with primary prevention with vaccination and secondary prevention with pap-based or HPV-based testing will essentially eliminate cervical cancer, we have the tools right now to eliminate cervical cancer,” said Dr. Mark Einstein, professor and chair at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Women’s Health at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “But, what this data has shown is that when we’re not following those screening guidelines, or people aren’t getting screened enough, or people aren’t getting vaccinations, that we’re going to actually miss some of these windows of opportunity to pick up these cancers.”\n\nEinstein stressed the importance of vaccination, especially for girls when they become eligible, and screening.\n\nIn order to avoid missed opportunities, Einstein said,”screening and effective management for cervical cancer is something that we need to continue to be very actively seeking.”\n\nDr. Arif Kamal, chief patient officer at the American Cancer Society, also emphasized the importance of these prevention techniques.\n\n“There’s not many cancers for which the stage four prevalence is going up, particularly for a cancer that has both a prevention component to it that’s medical in nature, not lifestyle in nature. In this case you have a vaccine, and that has a routinized, regularly deployed screening,” he said.\n\nKamal pointed to colorectal cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer, all of which are examples of cancers that have early, regularly deployed screening and are not seeing rising levels of stage four prevalence.\n\n“I think it’s really emphasizing two pieces,” he said. “That the uptake for HPV vaccination is still not where we want it to be, one,” he said. “Two, that there remain important barriers to access to special level care.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhile cervical cancer overall is not very common, it does require a level of expertise that is often found at larger cancer centers, in urban areas and may involve higher out-of-pocket costs, Kamal said, and these barriers of care can cause disparities to be magnified.\n\n“There’s just so many components to this where, for one population it’s about lack of HPV vaccination uptake, and for another population, it’s really about chemotherapy resistance, lack of access to specialist care and probably a changed biology,” Kamal said. “What you have here, in one cancer, is all the different types of disparities one could think of, kind of enmeshed into one space.”", "authors": ["Naomi Thomas"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/coronavirus/2021/10/06/covid-vaccines-saved-lives-1-800-ohio-seniors-early-2021/6011828001/", "title": "COVID vaccines saved lives of 1,800 Ohio seniors in early 2021", "text": "Vaccinations against COVID-19 prevented the deaths of 1,800 Ohio seniors and stopped the disease from spreading to thousands more of the state's elderly residents, a new federal study found.\n\nFrom January through May of this year, the study found that vaccinations may have prevented 12,000 cases and 5,300 hospitalizations among Ohio seniors.\n\nOhio has suffered more than 1.4 million COVID-19 infections, 74,283 hospitalizations and 22,490 deaths since the pandemic began in March 2020.

They also had higher risks for lung and heart problems, fatigue, digestive and kidney disorders, diabetes and neurologic problems.\n\nThe findings come as a fresh wave of coronavirus variants, notably Omicron’s BA.5, have become dominant in the United States and Europe, causing cases and hospitalizations to rise once again. BA.5 caused about 54% of cases nationwide last week, doubling its share of Covid-19 transmission over the past two weeks, according to data posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by both vaccines and prior infection, leaving many people vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nDr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, led the research, which was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review. He said he decided to do it after watching reinfections become more and more common among his own patients.\n\n“If you asked me about reinfection maybe a year and a half ago, I would tell you that maybe I have a patient here or there, but it’s really, really rare,” Al-Aly said. That’s not true anymore, though.\n\n“So we asked a simple question that if you got Covid before and now you’re on your second infection, does this really add risk? And the simple answer is that it does.”\n\nTallying the risks of reinfections\n\nAl-Aly and his team compared the health records of more than 250,000 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 one time with records from 38,000 others who had two or more Covid-19 infections documented in their medical records. More than 5.3 million people with no record of a Covid-19 infection were used as the control group.\n\nAmong those with reinfections, 36,000 people had two Covid-19 infections, roughly 2,200 had caught Covid-19 three times, and 246 had been infected four times.\n\nCommon new diagnoses after reinfections included chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, inflammation of the heart muscle or the sac around the heart, heart failure and blood clots. Common lung issues included shortness of breath, low blood oxygen, lung disease, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of a new health problem was highest around the time of a Covid-19 reinfection, but it also persisted for at least six months. The increased risk was present whether or not someone had been vaccinated, and it was graded – meaning it increased with each subsequent infection.\n\nAl-Aly said that’s not what people really think will happen when they get Covid a second or third time.\n\n“There is this idea that if you had Covid before, your immune system is trained to recognize it and is more equipped to fight it, and if you’re getting it again, maybe it doesn’t affect you that much, but that’s not really true,” he said.\n\nAl-Aly said that doesn’t mean there aren’t people who have had Covid and done just fine; there are lots of them. Rather, what his study shows is that each infection brings new risk, and that risk adds up over time, he said.\n\nEven if a person has half the risk of developing lasting health problems during a second infection than they did during their first infection, he said, they still wind up with 50% more risk of problems than someone who didn’t get Covid-19 a second time.\n\nThe study has some important caveats. Al-Aly says it was more common to see reinfections among people who had existing risks because of their age or underlying health. That shows that reinfection may not be random, and it could be that the health risks linked to reinfections aren’t, either.\n\n“It is possible that sicker individuals or people with immune dysfunction are at higher risk of reinfection and adverse health outcomes after reinfection,” Al-Aly said.\n\nHe wasn’t interested in trying to isolate the pure effects of reinfection but wanted to understand how repeated infections are affecting the people who get them.\n\n“The most relevant question to people’s lives is, if you get reinfected, does it add to your risk of acute complications and long Covid, and the answer is a clear yes and yes,” he said.\n\nThe study is observational, which means it can’t determine cause and effect.\n\nAl-Aly says the researchers saw these increased risks even after they weighted the data to account for the effects of age, sex, medication use and the person’s underlying health before they got Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 continues to surprise\n\nExperts who were not involved in the research say it is compelling.\n\n“There is this idea that I think a lot of people have that ‘if I survived my first infection, that I’m really going to be just fine the second time. There really shouldn’t be any problem,’ ” said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\n\n“The popular wisdom, right, is that reinfections are mild, nothing to worry about, nothing to see here,” Griffin said of the study on the podcast “This Week in Virology.” But that’s not really being borne out, he said.\n\nThis is not how it’s supposed to work. Even when viruses shape-shift – as influenza does – our immune system generally retains its memory of how to recognize and fight off some part of them. They may still make us ill, but the idea is that our prior immunity is there to mount some of kind of defense and keep us from serious harm.\n\nWith coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, the hits just keep on coming.\n\n“A year later, you can get reinfected with the same coronavirus the second time. It is not clear that that second infection can be more mild, because coronaviruses intrinsically have the ability to interfere with long-lasting lifetime immunity,” Griffin told CNN.\n\nGriffin says he’s seen Covid-19 reinfections go both ways. Sometimes, the second or third is milder for his patients, but sometimes it’s not.\n\nHow does that compare with other respiratory infections?\n\nEarly in the pandemic, people would get Covid, and three months would go by when they were pretty well protected, he said. But now, those reinfections are happening more frequently, no doubt because of the rapid changes to the virus. He says he’s seen some people infected four times in the past two years.\n\n“We don’t really see much of that with the flu,” Griffin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs for what people should be doing now with regard to this risk, Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says Americans are really done with the pandemic. That doesn’t mean that the pandemic is done with us, though.\n\nOsterholm said he has three close friends who recently went to a restaurant for the first time since the pandemic started. All of them tested positive within 72 hours of that restaurant visit.\n\nIf you’re at higher risk of serious illness or you just want to avoid getting sick, it’s a good time to be wearing an N95 mask in public places, he says.\n\n“People don’t want to hear it, but that’s the reality. We’re seeing this resurgence, and we’re seeing increasing numbers of vaccine failures. Clearly, that’s a major concern,” he said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}]}

Here's why we all need to calm down\n\nNielsen, which tracks more than 900,000 stores in 100 countries, found \"significant spikes in the hoarding of emergency supplies\" in the U.S., China and Italy.\n\nThe repercussions could be severe. The World Health Organization said Wednesday that panic buying and hoarding have contributed to a global shortage of face masks, which puts health care workers at risk.\n\nStore shelves in Taiwan, China and Japan have been emptied of hand sanitizer, toilet paper, bleach and cleaning pads, and the U.S. is seeing similar patterns. At the same time, some sellers have begun to hike prices of desired products to gouge buyers. Amazon, eBay and Walmart have all said they are taking action to stop price gouging.\n\nThe demand is out there. Nielsen's report found sales of medical face masks in San Francisco drugstores are up 541% over a year ago and that sales so far this year have already surpassed those for all of 2019. Sales of medical face masks in Los Angeles drugstores rose 340%, Nielsen says.\n\nSales of household maintenance masks are skyrocketing nationwide, too, up 262% over the previous month.\n\n\"Stocks of hand sanitizers and medical face masks have already dried up in some markets, with no clear indication of when supplies will be replenished,\" Nielsen said.\n\nThe panic buying \"ripple effect\" is going beyond emergency items such as canned goods, flour, sugar and bottled water, to other non-food essentials such as vitamins, fruit snacks and first aid kits, says the report from Nielsen's consumer goods and retail research division.\n\nSales of dried beans rose 10.1%, while frozen fruit sales were up 7% in the week ending Feb. 22, the report says.\n\n\"Fresh food items are expected to face challenges as shoppers steer away from anything that may have travelled long distances, such as fruit and vegetables, or may have been exposed to the airborne virus,\" said Scott McKenzie, global intelligence leader at Nielsen.\n\nCurrent shopping and stockpiling behavior is similar to that seen before snowstorms, he says. \"That said, beyond the traditional focus on milk, bread and eggs, consumers now are even more focused on packaged products without extensive, direct contact, that perhaps were packaged during less severe stages of the outbreak,\" McKenzie said.\n\nNielsen research found that in Vietnam, 45% of consumers surveyed say they have increased what they’re stocking at home and 25% are buying more online.\n\n\"Beyond health preparedness, U.S. consumers aren’t waiting until it’s too late to stock up on shelf-stable essentials, which parallels what we’ve seen in other regions,\" the report says. \"We do expect online shopping to rise as people become increasingly interested in reducing their exposure to others, as the virus appears to be spread via coughs and sneezes.\"\n\nOther products beginning to see sales increases include air cleaners and air purifiers, sales of which rose 3% in the week ending Feb. 22.\n\nThe next possible product shortage?

Rather, they are now confronting a host of other setbacks.\n\nOmicron’s devastating blow\n\nAs the highly contagious variant of the Covid-19 virus continues to sicken workers, it’s creating staffing shortages for critical functions like transportation and logistics, which in turn are affecting delivery of products and restocking of store shelves across the country.\n\nAlbertsons’ CEO Vivek Sankaran acknowledged that products are in tight supply during the company’s earnings call with analysts Tuesday.\n\n“I think as a business, we’ve all learned to manage it. We’ve all learned to make sure that the stores are still very presentable, give the consumers as much choice as we can get,” Sankaran said during the call.\n\nEven so, he added, Omicron has put “a bit of a dent” on efforts to improve supply chain gaps. “We would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks,” Sankaran said.\n\nGrocery stores are operating with less than their normal workforces, according to the National Grocers Association, and many of its members have less than 50% of their normal workforce.\n\nA view of empty shelves at a local Giant supermarket on January 9, 2022 in Alexandria, Virginia. mpi34/MediaPunch/IPX/AP\n\n“While there is plenty of food in the supply chain, we anticipate consumers will continue to experience sporadic disruptions in certain product categories as we have seen over the past year and half due to the continued supply and labor challenges,” said Greg Ferrara, the group’s president and CEO.\n\nIn fact, labor shortages continue to pressure all areas of the food industry, said Phil Lempert, an industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com.\n\n“From farms to food makers to grocery stores, it’s across the board,” said Lempert. “During the pandemic, these operations have had to implement social distancing protocols and they’re not really built for that and it has impacted production.”\n\nAnd as the pandemic continues, many food industry workers are opting not to return to their low-wage jobs at all.\n\nTransportation problems\n\nAn ongoing shortage of truckers continues to slow down the supply chain and the ability of grocery stores to replenish their shelves quickly.\n\nEmpty shelves at a Trader Joe's on Spring Street in New York City on Saturday January 8, 2022. Courtesy Courtney Ellen\n\n“The trucking industry has an aging workforce on top of a shortage,” Lempert said. “It’s really been a problem for the last several years.”\n\nLayered atop widespread domestic transportation issues is the ongoing record-high level of congestion at the nation’s ports. “Both of these challenges are working in tandem to create shortages,” he said\n\nWeather issues\n\nAt Trader Joe’s stores, shoppers over the weekend saw messages attached to empty shelves blaming weather emergencies for delivery delays.\n\nMuch of the Midwest and Northeast has recently been grappling with severe weather and hazardous commuting conditions. Not only are people stocking up on more groceries, that level of high demand coupled with transportation challenges is making it more difficult to transport goods in inclement weather, thus resulting in more shortages, said Lempert.\n\nNot to mention climate change, which is an ongoing serious and longer term threat to food supply. “Fires and droughts are damaging crops such as wheat, corn and soybean in the US and coffee crops in Brazil,” he said. “We can’t ignore it.”\n\nPandemic changed our eating habits\n\nMore and more of us have taken to cooking and eating at home through the pandemic that’s contributing to the grocery supply crunch, too, said Lempert.\n\n“We don’t want to keep eating the same thing and are trying to vary home cooking. As we do that, we’re buying even more food products,” he said. The shortages have also made buying food increasingly more expensive going into 2022.\n\nGrocery stores certainly are aware of the empty shelves, Lempert said, and they are trying to mitigate panic buying, which only worsens it the situation.\n\nOne strategy: Fanning out products. They’re doing this by putting out both limited varieties and limited quantities of each product in an attempt to prevent hoarding and stretch out their supplies between deliveries.\n\n“Pre-pandemic you might have seen five different varieties of milk across the front row and 10 cartons deep. Now it will be five across and maybe two rows deep,” said Lempert.\n\n– CNN’s Nathaniel Meyersohn and Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this story\n\n– An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the year of a Trader Joe’s photo.

Devin Nunes (R-Tulare) has received withering criticism this week for conservative talk show appearances on national TV and local radio in which he said the COVID-19 outbreak would diminish in weeks and questioned local and state government orders asking people to stay home.\n\nThis week, Nunes posted a letter to his constituents on his website in which he seemed to question Fresno’s COVID-19 shelter-in-place decision and described it as “controversial,” pointing out adjacent city Clovis declined to ask people to stay home.\n\n(The next day, the issue became moot when California Gov. Gavin Newsom directed all of California to shelter-in-place in hopes to “flatten the curve” of projected COVID-19 infections in the population.)\n\nThe Times-Delta/Advance-Register fact-checked some of Nunes’ statements. Here’s a look at what we found:\n\nNunes: There is no food shortage and recommended that people stop buying in bulk at the grocery store.\n\nVerdict: True. Because of panic buying by some customers, grocers and other retailers are having a hard time keeping shelves fully stocked, but there have been no reports of shortages of any food items in the nation’s supply chain.\n\nMore:Fact check: Does using ibuprofen when you have coronavirus make symptoms worse?\n\nNunes: China has provided misleading or incorrect information about the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nVerdict: Partly true. Early on during the outbreak in China, world health experts were frustrated with the lack of information and candor from the totalitarian Communist regime. But over the last two months, world health experts say the information coming from China is more reliable and Chinese health officials are providing invaluable information and advice on fighting the outbreak. Since, China has lifted its restriction and life is mostly back to normal.\n\nMore:Welcome to the first social media pandemic. Here are 8 ways you can stop the spread of coronavirus misinformation.\n\nNunes: There is no reliable data that the virus is spreading, seemingly arguing the shelter-in-place orders are an overreaction.\n\nVerdict: Dangerously false. According to several studies by epidemiologists, including a sobering study by the Imperial College London presented to the Trump Administration recently, that if the United States failed to implement shelter in place and other aggressive pandemic fighting moves, more than 2 million Americans could die from COVID-19-related causes.\n\nMore:Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say\n\nNunes: The death toll in Italy can be at least partially blamed by the country’s socialized medical system.\n\nVerdict: Debatable. According to world health data, Italy has more hospital beds and doctors per person than the United States. Medical experts in the United States predict hospitals here will be quickly and critically overburdened with sick patients if aggressive efforts aren’t made to “flatten the curve” of people infected with COVID-19. At the same time Nunes was criticizing Italy's socialized medical system, he praised Japan and South Korea's medical response to the viral outbreak. Both countries have socialized medical systems.\n\nMore:Nunes: 'If you're healthy...go to your local pub;' Newsom, public health experts differ\n\nNunes: Vehemently denied ever encouraging people to go out to bars and pubs, in direct contradiction to medical experts.\n\nVerdict: False. Nunes’ direct quote on Fox News was, “Let’s not hurt the working people in this country. Go to your local pub.”\n\nFor a comprehensive list of COVID-19 fact check, visit https://www.usatoday.com/news/factcheck/\n\nJames Ward, covers entertainment, news, sports and lifestyles for the Visalia Times-Delta/Tulare Advance-Register.

Some were affected by the initial panic buying the pandemic stirred in late March, including running out of non-perishable items like canned food and rice along with cleaning products and toilet paper.\n\nYou may like:Black beauty salons mourn loss of community during COVID-19 but are in no rush to reopen\n\nWhile the demand for supplies has leveled out, owners like Gold have instead noticed an increase in business and a slight change in the faces walking through the front door: new customers, looking for items they can't get at Kroger or folks who are curious to try new foods and recipes now that everyone is spending a bit more time in the kitchen during the quarantine.\n\n\"People are bored at home, and all they can do is eat,\" said Jon Gin Choi, son of the owners of Choi’s Asian Market at 607 Lyndon Lane.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic in late March, the market has seen increased traffic — the \"craziest it's ever been at the store,\" Choi said. He's noticed customers buying foods they'd normally get at restaurants, like Thai curry and Pad Thai, or trying to re-create the famous noodle dish from the Academy Award-winning Korean film \"Parasite.\"\n\n\"I like to see what people buy and try to guess what they're making,\" Choi said. \"It's interesting that people come in, and it seems like they're trying out new Chinese, Korean, Japanese or Korean cultural food recipes.\"\n\nAlthough he's pleased with the increase in business, Choi worries about what the influx of customers might mean for his parents, Korean immigrants in their 60s.\n\n\"I worry because it doesn't seem like people are staying home,\" Choi said. \"Every day there are so many people coming in and out. About 80-90% of them wear masks, but some still stroll around the store, buy only snacks, or come with a big family.\"\n\nTo help keep employees and customers safe, Choi has cut back on the store's hours, but employees work just as much to keep up with the increased demand and higher foot traffic. And while the market hasn't run out of essentials like big chain grocery stores, Choi said the supply chain for items like rice fluctuates.\n\nChoi said the small store also doesn't necessarily have the manpower or resources to keep up with constant sanitizing and can't afford to keep providing masks and hand sanitizer to customers.\n\n'Fed up' or on board?:Here's what restaurant owners think about Beshear's reopening plan\n\n\"Sometimes I wish we could all close everything until it calms down and we have a real solution,\" he said.\n\nBut Choi also knows how important his family's store is to the local community. If it closed, customers would have to drive 20 minutes to south Louisville, where there are more Asian markets, like Ralhla Asian Market at 6916 Southside Drive near Iroquois Park.\n\nWhen customers enter that store, owner Zaw Ralhla almost always knows who they are and what they're looking for. It's a strong, tight-knit community of customers who are mostly immigrants from Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nThey trust that Ralhla is stocked on the ingredients they need to cook from home. He stays connected with them via Facebook, where he posts his vegetable supply weekly.\n\nRalhla, too, has had more customers than usual since the pandemic started. Business is good, but he's worried about his health and that of his family. He's been providing hand sanitizer, gloves and masks to every person coming into the store.\n\n\"It's mandatory,\" Ralhla said. \"If customers don't follow the rules, they are not allowed to shop. I am being very cautious. I am concerned, but at the same time, I know I have to open for my customers because without me, they have to go to other places without masks.\"\n\nLouisville resident Elmer Zavala goes to Supermercado Guanajuato, a Hispanic grocery store at 6201 Preston Highway, to get a taste of home he can't find elsewhere. A Honduran immigrant and local pastor, Zavala buys flour tortillas and refried beans to make baleadas, a traditional Honduran dish, at home.\n\n\"When you come from another place, you're always looking for the food that you grew up with, the products that you long for,\" Zavala said of shopping at the international markets in Louisville.\n\nRead more:How the coronavirus pandemic will change Ramadan for Louisville's Muslim community\n\nAntonio Malagon, a manager at Supermercado Guanajuato's Bardstown Road location, said business has increased at the stores, where they are disinfecting common areas, wearing masks and social distancing.\n\nAt La Tropicana Taqueria and Market at 5215 Preston Highway, a line of people standing six feet apart and wearing masks wait for what's been voted the best tacos in Louisville by The Courier Journal. In the market, customers are separated from employees by plexiglass at the register, which stands next to a case of fresh-baked conchas, sweet empanadas and other pan dulce.\n\nAt Golden Key, the shelves are stocked, and the store is busy most days, Gold said of his Buechel location. Families bored at home and new customers are coming in to shop, but they won't find his famous supply of Kasha, an Eastern European buckwheat, used to make porridge. Since the pandemic started, he hasn't been able to buy new shipments from Russia. And if you ask, he'll point to his prized deli case, which is usually full but \"nothing now.\"\n\nIn Europe, family-owned grocery stores are everywhere, Gold said.\n\n\"There are a few big stores like Kroger,\" Gold said. \"But stores like mine are popular, where the seller knows your family and what you eat. Where you can send your kids to pick up groceries, and put it on a tab.

Because we don’t yet know how severe the impacts will be and how long they will last, and amid supply chain problems that could further compound grocery shopping struggles this weekend, have at least three days’ worth of food and water for everyone in your home, says Joann Sands, a clinical assistant professor in the School of Nursing at the University of Buffalo, who trains students in disaster and emergency preparedness.\n\nChoose groceries that have a long shelf life, don’t require cooking and are not too salty or spicy, because those foods mean you’ll likely drink more water, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends.\n\nHere’s what you should make sure to stock up on in your home.\n\nHigh-protein and non-perishable foods\n\nThose include foods like energy bars and protein and fruit bars that don’t need to be refrigerated or frozen, Sands said.\n\nDry cereal, granola, peanut butter, dried fruit and non-perishable pasteurized milk are also good to have as you hunker down.\n\nCanned goods\n\nRemember that the power may be out as the storm whips through your region, so have with you ready-to-eat canned meats, fruits, vegetables and canned juices as well as a manual can opener, according to Ready.gov.\n\nCanned dietetic foods, juices and soups may be especially helpful for elderly or ill people, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nIf a can is swollen, dented or corroded, do not eat from it.\n\nComfort food\n\nThough not essential, experts recommend you have comfort and stress foods on hand as you weather the storm.\n\nWater\n\nStore at least three days’ worth of water supply for each person in your household and for each pet, the CDC recommends. FEMA recommends storing at least one gallon of water for each person in your household for each day.\n\nUnopened, commercially bottled water is the safest and most reliable water supply, the agency says. If it’s store-bought water, make sure you check the expiration date.\n\nPlastic bags and containers\n\nMake sure you also have plastic bags on hand, as you can wrap perishable foods – like cookies – in there, and place them in sealed containers, according to FEMA.\n\nPaper plates, cups and disposable utensils\n\nIf you’re out of electricity and water, having paper plates and utensils can help you prepare and eat your meals safely, the CDC says.\n\nThink of babies – and pets\n\nWhen preparing, don’t forget about babies and pets in the house.\n\nMake sure you have enough supply of baby formula, as well as anything else an infant may need, like diapers, said Sands.\n\nBe sure to also have several days’ worth of supplies for pets, like medications and non-perishable foods.\n\n(And maybe some treats, as storms can be stressful for them as well.)\n\nHygiene products\n\nCheck that you have the hygiene products you need – including feminine supplies, toilet paper, wet wipes, paper towels and hand sanitizer.\n\nHave an emergency kit\n\nIt’s always good to have a disaster kit at the ready that’s in a portable container near your home’s exit.\n\nThose should include: non-perishable foods and a three-day supply of water, a battery-powered radio and flashlight, extra batteries, a first-aid kit with a manual, sanitation items, matches in a waterproof container, a whistle to signal for help if you need to, clothing, blankets and sleeping bags, identification cards, credit cards and cash, paper and pencil, items to cover baby and pet needs and any special items like medications, contact lenses, glasses, hearing aids and activities for younger children.\n\nBecause of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, you should also include things like face masks.\n\nKnow this about items in the fridge:\n\nIt’s important that you don’t panic-buy and try and fill your fridge, Sands said.\n\n“How are you going to be able to store this food if you don’t have power?” Sands said, adding that stocking up on extra groceries can not only lead to wasted food but could hurt others that may not be able to find what they’re looking for.\n\nIf your power goes out, keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as you can, to avoid letting the cool air out.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nThe shouts of locked-down residents demanding basic necessities, the cries of babies separated from their parents in quarantine, the pleas of a son repeatedly rejected by hospitals to treat his critically ill father, and the sobs of an exhausted local official who admits there is “no good policy” coming from higher authorities for her to explain to residents.\n\nThese voices, charged with raw frustration, agony and desperation, are among the montage of audio recordings featured in “Voices of April,” a video documenting the harsh impact of Shanghai’s nearly month-long lockdown.\n\nThe city-wide lockdown, among the strictest the country has seen, has plunged the once-bustling international financial hub into a virtual ghost town, causing shortage of food, daily necessities and even medical access for many of its 25 million residents confined to their homes.\n\n“A month into the outbreak in Shanghai, I saw many people speaking out online, but most of them disappeared after a short while,” the maker of the video posted on WeChat Friday. “However, some things should not have happened, and they should not be forgotten.”\n\nThe personal plights, told in residents’ own voices and overlay with black-and-white aerial footage of the city’s silent skyline and empty streets, touched the hearts of millions of Chinese internet users as the video spread like wildfire across social media platforms on Friday evening.\n\nBut for the Chinese government, the six-minute clip – and the chaos and suffering it exposes – is too powerful a reminder of the human cost of its zero-Covid policy, which authorities insist are “putting the people and their lives first.”\n\nCensors quickly stepped in, taking down the film as well as any references to it from China’s internet. On microblogging site Weibo, even the word “April” was temporarily restricted from search results.\n\nThe censorship sparked an outcry. Many were infuriated at the attempt by authorities to wipe out what they see as an objective documentation of the darker reality of the lockdown – one that can rarely be found in state media.\n\nAn online backlash ensued, with users joining a social media relay in defiance, sharing the video in whatever way they can come up with to evade censors. Some posted the video upside down, others embedded it in cartoon clips, and some circulated it through QR codes and cloud services. Censors struggled to keep up – no sooner would they block one version of the video did another resurface, and the mouse and cat game continued into the small hours of Saturday.\n\nSome even shared a clip of the song “Do You Hear the People Sing,” a protest anthem from the 2012 movie Les Misérables.\n\nThe outpouring of anger reminded many of the public outcry two years ago following the death of Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor who was punished by police for sounding the alarm of the coronavirus and died of Covid-19.\n\n“They are still trying to gag our mouths and plug our ears,” a user wrote in the comment section of Li’s Weibo page shortly after midnight on Saturday.\n\nThe online protest is the latest sign of growing discontent toward the harsh Covid containment measures among Shanghai residents, as well as people in other parts of China who have watched the crisis unfold in horror on social media.\n\nBut instead of relaxing lockdown measures, Shanghai authorities have tightened resolve to bring cases down to zero outside designated quarantine sites.\n\nIn the city’s Pudong district, epidemic prevention authorities ordered “hard quarantine” to be installed in communities under the strictest level of lockdown – namely those which reported Covid cases over the past week – before Sunday, according to an official directive circulating online. On Saturday, Chinese social media was flooded with photos of workers in white hazmat suits installing green fences outside apartment buildings in Shanghai.\n\nThe tough new tactics have drawn more anger. “This kind of measures completely disregards fire safety. If a fire breaks out, rescue won’t arrive on time, the consequences will be unimaginable. Who will be responsible for it then?” a Weibo user commented.\n\nThe dysfunction and chaos of the Shanghai lockdown has put residents in other cities on alert.\n\nIn Beijing, residents rushed to buy groceries on Sunday evening amid a fresh coronavirus outbreak that officials described as “urgent and grim.” The Chinese capital recorded 19 new local cases on Sunday, bringing the total in the city since Friday to 60.\n\nChaoyang, one of the city’s largest districts, announced it would launch three rounds of mass testing of those who work and live in the district. Many fear that more stringent restrictions, such as a lockdown, could soon be implemented if more infections were detected.\n\nPhotos and videos shared online show long lines and empty shelves at Beijing supermarkets and “sold out” signs on grocery-delivery apps. On Weibo and Wechat, articles providing advice on what kind of food items and daily necessities to stock up on in case of a lockdown went viral.\n\nThe panic buying took place despite Beijing officials reassured residents at a news conference earlier in the day that “the city’s market supply for daily necessities is sufficient and trading is normal.”\n\n“At Beijing’s fruit stores and supermarkets, everyone is panic buying. The section selling instant noodles is completely empty,” a resident said on Weibo Monday. “The psychological shadow Shanghai has brought us may not go away for quite some time.”", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/10/20/fact-check-bidens-america-grocery-store-image-taken-2018/8521707002/", "title": "Fact check: 'Bidens America' grocery store image was taken in 2018", "text": "The claim: Images show grocery shelves taken during Biden and Trump presidencies\n\nGrocery stores across the nation are facing challenges stocking limited quantities of products due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and a shortage of employees along with shipping congestion at the Port of Los Angeles.\n\nAs supply chain issues are expected to worsen and grocers place limits on the purchase of certain items, some people have taken to Twitter to criticize President Joe Biden with the hashtag #BareShelvesBiden.\n\nMeanwhile, some social media users have used an outdated image captured outside of the U.S., asserting that the scenes depict current situations at grocery stores.\n\nAn Oct. 12 Facebook post with more than 78,000 shares juxtaposes two photos: One of empty grocery store shelves presented as “Bidens America” and one of fully stocked shelves labeled \"Trumps America.\"\n\nBut the images included in the post are unrelated to the global supply chain crisis.\n\nFact check: California trucking regulations aren't to blame for cargo backlog\n\nThe Facebook user who shared the post did not return a request for comment.\n\nPhotos are misleading\n\nWhile certain products remain scarce at grocery stores, the photo of “Trumps America” was actually captured in 2012, and the image of “Bidens America” is from 2018, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe top image shows fully stocked grocery shelves at a Coles Supermarket at Westfield Southland Shopping Centre in Melbourne, Australia, according to the photo’s caption.

And yet millions of American families will feel the economic consequences.\n\nThat’s because the world economy and financial markets are interconnected. As Covid demonstrated, events on one side of the planet can set off shockwaves on the other side.\n\nIn this case, an invasion of Ukraine by Russia will likely drive up the already-high cost of living in the United States, rattle investment portfolios and perhaps even slow down the economic recovery.\n\n“The average American household is going to bear the burden of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,” said RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas.\n\nMore pain at the pump\n\nOil prices have jumped to levels unseen since 2014, in part because this conflict could derail Russian energy supply.\n\nRussia is an energy superpower, producing 9.7 million barrels per day last year, according to Rystad Energy. That is second only to the United States and amounts to more oil than Iraq and Canada produced — combined.\n\nSupply is already failing to keep up with demand and investors are on high alert for any further supply shortfalls that could occur through in a variety of ways, including damaged infrastructure in a war, sanctions on Russia or Moscow moving to weaponize exports.\n\nJPMorgan warned that oil prices could “easily” jump to $120 a barrel due to the crisis. In the unlikely event that Russian oil exports are halved, crude would surge to $150 a barrel, JPMorgan said.\n\nA dramatic spike in oil prices could be offset at least in part by consuming nations releasing emergency stockpiles and OPEC ramping up production.\n\nStill, another pop in oil prices would lift prices at the pump, which lag behind moves in crude prices. The national average price for a gallon of gas already stands at a seven-year high of $3.54 a gallon, according to AAA.\n\nHistoric inflation\n\nInflation is the biggest problem facing the US economy. And Russia’s invasion could make it even worse.\n\nOil currently stands at about $100 a barrel, but if it hits $110, the year-over-year inflation rate would climb above 10%, according to an analysis by RSM shared with CNN. That’s up from the current 7.5%.\n\nAmerican inflation hasn’t climbed to 10% since 1981.\n\nNot only would prices at the pump rise, but higher oil and natural gas prices would drive up home heating and electricity costs.\n\nHigher energy prices would make it more expensive to fly and keep transportation and input costs elevated for businesses already grappling with surging expenses. Businesses would most likely pass along at least some of these higher costs to consumers in the form of price spikes.\n\nBeyond energy, other commodities could experience price volatility. Russia is a major producer of metals, including aluminum and palladium. Russia is also the biggest exporter of wheat, while Ukraine is a significant exporter of both wheat and corn.\n\n“All of this would occur at a time when commodity supplies are more stressed than they have been in a generation,” David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, wrote in a report last week.\n\nOf course, inflationary pressures would likely be even greater for Europeans.\n\nMarket turbulence\n\nInvestors famously detest uncertainty. The Dow tumbled 700 points the morning after the invasion as investors confront the possibility of an oil shock, higher inflation and a confusing sanctions regime.\n\nA prolonged market downturn would wipe out wealth built up by families in the stock market and in retirement accounts. Market instability could also dent confidence among consumers and businesses alike.\n\nStocks do have a history of rebounding from geopolitical scares, although there is a relatively small sample size. And it’s impossible to say how markets would respond in the current environment.\n\nSlower economic growth\n\nThe RSM analysis also found that a jump to $110 oil would dent US GDP by one percentage point.\n\nThat is not as dramatic as the impact to inflation, but it’s still significant given that the US economy has not fully recovered all the jobs lost during Covid.\n\nHigher borrowing costs\n\nIf inflation spikes above 10%, the Federal Reserve would come under pressure to step up its fight to get prices under control.\n\nThat could mean a faster pace of interest rate hikes to cool off inflation.\n\nThe coming interest rate increases from the Fed will increase borrowing costs for consumers on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards. Mortgage rates have already spiked to pre-Covid levels in recent weeks, presenting a new challenge to wannabe home buyers.\n\nThe Fed could choose to shrug off intensifying inflation as just a temporary phenomenon driven by the Russia-Ukraine situation. However, that strategy did not work out well last year, with the Fed eventually abandoning its “transitory” description of Covid-related inflation.\n\nAt a minimum, the Russia-Ukraine situation will further complicate the Fed’s already difficult task of taming inflation without sparking a recession.\n\nCyberattacks and more\n\nAs the Ukraine conflict escalates the US is also braced for Russian cyberattacks.\n\nThe hacking of the Colonial Pipeline last year showed just how disruptive a cyberattack can be in the real world. The cyber-intrusion shut down one of the most important pipelines in America, sparking panic buying that left many gas stations in the Southeast empty.\n\nA successful cyberattack on America’s financial system — a top worry of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell — could be even more disruptive.\n\nA cyberattack is just one example of how the Russia-Ukraine situation could spill over into daily life.\n\n“Wars evolve in unpredictable ways,” JPMorgan’s Kelly said. “No one should assume that they can see all the impacts of a war at its outset.”", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/03/16/coronavirus-louisville-groceries-packed-restaurants-restricted/5057802002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Louisville: Groceries packed as restaurants restricted", "text": "Groceries continued to fly off Louisville store shelves on Monday, aided in part by Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's order suspending in-person dining at restaurants and bars.\n\nBy midmorning, every parking spot at the Clifton Kroger was filled, forcing a handful of impatient shoppers to leave their cars on the sidewalk at the lot’s edge.\n\nAt groceries across the Louisville region this weekend, shoppers nearly wiped out stocks of fresh meat, frozen vegetables, bottled water and, of course, toilet paper.\n\nCoronavirus fears have forced groceries to cut back their hours to keep up with restocking and cleaning. Kroger is limiting its hours to 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Walmart is limiting its hours to 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nSporting a dust mask, to which she had stapled a Clorox wipe, Patria Fielding said she had come in hopes of finding hand sanitizer.\n\nClorox advises users of its wipes to avoid contact with eyes or clothing. The wipes are not designed for personal cleansing, according to the company’s website.\n\n“We can get the wipes, but the sanitizer we’re having trouble getting,” Fielding told The Courier Journal. “And both people in my household are in that high age group, so we’re being extra, extra careful.”\n\nLive updates:Get the latest information on the coronavirus in Kentucky\n\nDanielle Ruffin's visit to the Clifton Kroger at 2200 Brownsboro Road was her second visit to one of the chain's stores on the day. Her first attempt at finding her favorite frozen vegetable that morning had proved unsuccessful.\n\n“People don’t eat okra,” said Ruffin, adding that the hoarding of frozen goods by some people was “crazy.” “Why are you buying up my okra? I’m not happy about that.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Kroger sought to reassure shoppers that the grocery store would continue to restock what have become some of its fastest selling goods of late: bottled water, hand sanitizer, hand soap, cold and flu medicine, household cleaning products, paper goods, boxed dinners, soups and other at-home meal products.\n\n“Relative to others in the market we have limited supply chain exposure in China as most of the product we source is domestic,” Kroger spokeswoman Erin Grant said.\n\nThe chain is hiring more workers to keep up with the rush.\n\n“Especially in times of uncertainty, we believe everyone deserves to have access to affordable, fresh food,” said Grant, adding that the stores regularly manage through severe weather events, meaning that “preparedness is in our DNA.”\n\nCoronavirus tracker:How many cases are in Kentucky? Where are they?\n\nAt the St. Matthews Target, 4174 Westport Road, shoppers like Matt Johnson said they had slightly better luck finding toilet paper and other supplies.\n\nStill, Johnson, who was shopping for his 85-year-old grandparents, said he encountered plenty of empty shelves.\n\nInside, attendants at checkout counters could be seen wearing disposable gloves.\n\nMilk and various cold and flu medicines were unavailable, as were Clorox wipes, which shoppers had lined up for that morning when the store opened at 8 a.m., said one worker.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Kentucky Grocers and Convenience Store Association said grocery stores and suppliers were working around the clock to stock shelves.\n\n“We urge consumers to purchase only what they need and not engage in ‘panic buying’ that can lead to disruptions in the supply chain,” said spokesman Steve McClain, adding that he hoped shoppers would “show compassion and kindness to the many employees who are continuing to go to work and do their jobs to serve the people of Kentucky.”\n\nOutside the Louisville Trader Joe’s, 4600 Shelbyville Road, J.D. Capp said he came to pick up supplies in anticipation of having to isolate himself. He complained of “slimmer pickings than normal” for frozen goods but said he found what he needed.\n\nMore:Cynthiana became the state's epicenter for coronavirus, but life goes on\n\nInside, the store had suspended its usual practice of distributing free coffee and samples.

Signs said the store was limiting customers to two packages of fresh chicken and ground beef each.\n\nSome shoppers found the continued lack of supplies, especially paper products, to be frustrating.\n\n“It’s overkill,” Dave Haight said. “I think people are overreacting for sure.”\n\nTodd Scott compared it to the fool’s errand of “snipe hunting.”\n\n“Take a picture of the toilet paper?” said Scott, recalling a friend’s request. “I’m like, yeah right.”\n\nBy the evening, crowds at the Bardstown Road Costco were gone, as were many of the store’s most sought-after items.\n\nA sign propped up outside the store’s entrance informed shoppers what was in and out of stock. Shortly before 7:30 p.m., the out-of-stock column included bleach, baby wipes, fresh chicken, ground beef, hand sanitizer, hydrogen peroxide, paper towels, rice, rubbing alcohol, sanitizing wipes, toilet paper and vinegar.

As businesses closed and some supplies ran short — and millions of Americans lost jobs — people got nervous about a societal breakdown.\n\n\"Then right after that we had the George Floyd death and the demonstrating and rioting that took place, and the 'Defund the police' stuff,\" Whitmire said, referring to Floyd's May 25 killing at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. \"People were wanting something for home defense.\"\n\nShotguns started flying off the shelves first, but the run quickly followed on handguns and rifles, including AR-15 semi-automatic rifles.\n\nWhile they're able to get some firearms in stock, supplies are way down, as manufacturers scramble to keep up with orders. Vendors tell Whitmire short supplies on guns may last for a few months, as manufacturers just can't keep up with demand and some plants have been hit by COVID cases or reduced workforce rules.\n\nGuns are fairly useless without ammunition, and that's the big sticking point now\n\n\"It's extremely hard to come by,\" Whitmire said, adding he's probably been able to get just one case of 9mm ammo from his regular vendor since March. \"Basically, we have to get online and find it where we can. Getting it wholesale is really hard.\"\n\nThe sales surge outpaced others that came after other landmark events, including Barack Obama's election in 2008, Whitmire said.\n\nSeeds, starts and canning jars\n\nKristin Weeks, managing partner and co-owner of Asheville's Fifth Season Gardening Co. location, said the start of the pandemic launched customers into a garden supply buying frenzy.\n\n\"If you look at the beginning of spring, food security was a real thing,\" she said.\n\nUnsure of how the food supply would be impacted by COVID-19, customers nationwide hurriedly put up gardens, leading to wide scale seed shortages.\n\nFortunately, Weeks said, she had stocked her store with enough garden supplies in the fall to get through the season — and also enjoy a 25% sales bump from January to July over the same time last year.\n\nWeeks sold triple the amount of vegetable starts as usual, and resorted to buying from local nurseries after her usual supplier ran dry.\n\nCustomers were snapping up everything green and growing, offering full price for premature veggie starts the store usually grows out for weeks before putting them up for sale.\n\n\"It was cool to see so many people gardening, but there was a panic to it as well that was palpable,\" Weeks said.\n\nThat rush has largely subsided to a steady hum. But Weeks still sees shortages of supplies for a variety of odd reasons.\n\nFor example, New Zealand's exports mostly travel via commercial aircraft, so a decline in flights means fewer orchid supplies like sphagnum moss.\n\nWeeks has also has seen shortages on sourdough starter for her DIY shelves. \"Everyone's baking,\" she explained.\n\nMore:With COVID-19 crisis driving skyrocketing hunger rates, Ash\n\neville chefs rush in to help\n\nPeople are also canning, and Ball jars, the gold standard for preserving, are also in short supply. \"It's harvest time, and there's no freaking Ball jars anywhere,\" Weeks said.\n\nBikes, kayaks and 'anything bear' -- outdoor gear flying off shelves\n\nOn a positive note, the pandemic has us venturing outside more and getting more exercise. On a not-so-positive note, bike racks at Walmarts and Targets are often bare or close to it, and even specialty shops are having trouble keeping bikes stocked.\n\n\"The big thing with this is it hit so abruptly — it was a very quick spike in sales,\" said Sam White, general manager at Liberty Bikes in South Asheville.\n\nInitially in March, with so many people out of work and businesses shuttered, business dipped. Then it went bananas, as folks figured out bike riding offered a perfect outlet, being outdoors and naturally distanced from others most of the time.\n\n\"Then very quickly the boom began,\" White said. \"Entry-level bikes and kids bikes were the first things to take off. They stripped away the kids' bike inventory very quickly.\"\n\nPressure on adult mountain and road bikes quickly followed. So many sales took place, vendors and manufacturers were caught flat-footed.\n\n\"When vendors run out, they’re going on (sales) projections of what happened last year,\" White said. \"So when the inventory went away, the lead time to get a replacement bike was 150 days. All of the sudden warehouses were empty of bikes in late May.\"\n\nWhile Liberty is still getting inventory in, the sales crush affected bikes across all levels and types, and those entry-level and kids' bikes are still tough to find.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of new people on bikes — we call it 'more butts on bikes,'\" White said. \"More people are riding and enjoying the outdoors.\"\n\nAt REI, the outdoor gear business in Biltmore Park, Store Manager Bree Miller said bikes got depleted quickly, but that's also spread to other outdoor gear.\n\n\"Basically, we're out of every boat on the sales floor right now,\" Miller said, referring to kayaks. \"For the manufacturers, sometimes even finding the materials to make additional product is proving to be a challenge.\"\n\nTents flew off the shelves and are hard to find, as are day packs and child-carrying backpacks, she said.\n\nIn an odd twist, bears have certainly not taken the pandemic off. Hikers and campers looking for bear-proof gear or spray may be out of luck.\n\n\"Bear safety is another place – we just don’t have the amount of product we can usually go through,\" Miller said Aug. 20. \"And bear canisters that you can set up away from your campsite, they're hard to get. We just got a case of them on the truck today, but it's only one case. Normally, we'd get six. It's also bear spray. Really, anything bear right now is hard to come by.\"\n\nWhile the supply issues are \"starting to come around,\" Miller said shortage likely will last \"at least probably into October, November and probably into 2021, to be honest.\"\n\nAt Liberty Bikes, White agrees.\n\n\"Inventory is going to be tight through the winter,\" White said. \"We've got a lot of bikes on back order. A lot of customers are putting deposits on bikes that are coming, but they know it's going to be two, three months before they come in. We've got some customers putting deposits on bikes for February and March.\"\n\nPasta and cleaning supplies\n\nIngles CFO Ron Freeman confirmed what we already know: the stock for certain cleaning supplies and paper products has been shaky since the start of the pandemic.\n\nWho could have foreseen the biggest supply problem to plague pandemic buyers would involve Clorox wipes and toilet paper?\n\nBut that's not the only thing the store sees customers stocking up on. \"Pasta has also been in demand, perhaps because it is versatile and easy to prepare,\" Freeman said.\n\nEchoing Weeks, Freeman said jars are also hot right now. \"We have seen a lot of demand for canning supplies and food storage items, indicating a lot of people of growing gardens,\" he said.\n\nMore:Grocery costs take largest leap in nearly half a century; egg prices up 16% in April\n\nBut if customers find empty stores shelves, there are often far more complex issues at hand beyond panic buying, he added.\n\n\"Some shortages are not necessarily demand driven, but occur due to production shortages further back in the supply chain,\" Freeman said.\n\nPet clippers and combs\n\nPandemic pets are a real thing, with shelters reporting a surge in demand for adoptable pets during COVID-19. Perhaps that's why people are now finding some of the supplies they need for their new pets in short supply.\n\nProfessional groomer Rachel Mongno, owner of Barking Mountain Pet Styles, said many of her colleagues have reported shortages in basic grooming equipment, including dog clippers, guide comb sets and core blades.\n\n\"The general consensus I've seen among groomers on social media is that a surplus of owners purchased the basic tools needed for grooming their pets at home during the shutdown,\" she said.\n\nAlso, many groomers purchase equipment at industry trade shows, many of which are cancelled for the year, Mongno said.\n\n\"So, they're also ordering tools, product and equipment online that they were originally planning to purchase in person,\" she said.\n\nThat, in theory, could put pressure on the supply for regular consumers as well.\n\nAppliances of all kinds\n\nAt Haywood Appliance in South Asheville, it started with stand-alone freezers.\n\n\"In the middle of March, they were out of stock and back-ordered, and we really haven't gotten any in since then,\" said Stephan Henderson, a sales associate at Haywood Appliance, which has been in business since 1971. \"Most of the major brands even stopped taking orders.\"\n\nHenderson, who's worked for the large home improvement chains, too, said the shortage quickly spread out to refrigerators and other appliances. Haywood buys directly from big manufacturers such as Whirlpool and LG, and he says it looks like production and delivery of many appliances will lag into next year.\n\nHenderson stressed they have inventory onhand, but the \"lead time\" on resupplying is stretching out now to two months or even longer.

Ryan gives upclose look at the death penalty's ...", "text": "Bernard Schoenburg\n\nbernard.schoenburg@sj-r.com\n\nWhen he was still trying to decide if he should commute the sentences of everyone on Death Row in Illinois, then-Gov. George Ryan went to a favorite place – Manny’s Deli in Chicago.\n\n“In Manny’s, no one puts on airs,” Ryan wrote in his new book, “Until I Could Be Sure: How I Stopped the Death Penalty in Illinois. (F)or the most part, I could grab my tray and go through the cafeteria-style line like anyone else.\n\n“As I munched on my corned beef sandwich, my cell phone rang,” he recalled. “My staff back at the office wanted to connect me to a caller – Nelson Mandela!\n\n“I tried to maintain my composure, but I was shocked. I was sitting in a delicatessen with all kinds of working stiffs in jeans and business people in suits – and I’m on the phone with one of the best known, renowned and respected men in the world.\n\nAnd he called me.”\n\nRyan’s book, co-authored by Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist Maurice Possley, goes on sale Friday. While it mostly delves into the behind-the-scenes of his decision to purge Illinois’ death row, the former governor also acknowledges his own legal troubles.\n\nRyan spent more than 5 1/2 years in federal prison on corruption convictions for actions dating back to his days as secretary of state. He says his work on the death penalty issue was unrelated to his own legal problems. He garnered international attention as governor for questioning a capital punishment system he saw as severely flawed.\n\nRyan recounted briefly meeting Mandela in Johannesburg when Ryan was in South Africa trying to develop business opportunities for Illinois. During that meeting, Mandela, who was ill at the time, praised Ryan for issuing a moratorium on the death penalty.\n\nAt Manny’s, Ryan listened as Mandela – then the former president of South Africa who had challenged his country’s apartheid system and survived 18 years in prison – spoke in a “strong and clear” voice and urged a blanket commutation for all on Illinois’ death row.\n\n“Revenge of this kind – the death penalty – has never made the world a better place,” Mandela told Ryan. “Governor Ryan, the United States has always set the standard for the world as far as justice, except where the death penalty is concerned. You can set a new standard.”\n\nHe got a similar call from Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa.\n\n“Other world leaders, including those from Mexico, Poland, the Vatican, and the European Union, similarly urged me to commute all death sentences in Illinois,” Ryan wrote.\n\nGiving an emotional speech at Northwestern University’s law school three days before the end of his single term as governor in January 2003, Ryan did take everyone off death row – with most of the more than 160 inmates affected switched to life in prison sentences. As reported at the time, the move drew impassioned reactions by those on all sides of the death penalty debate.\n\nBut Ryan, 86, of Kankakee, said in an interview Wednesday that he does not regret the decision – the result of years of examining the fairness of using the ultimate, irreversible sanction. And he says he thinks the death penalty should be ended nationwide.\n\n“I think if you’re going to have a penalty that’s going to kill somebody, you better have it written so it’s perfect,” Ryan said. “And the death penalty is not perfect, and it can never be perfect.”\n\nThe book provides a detailed look inside Ryan’s thoughtful transition from a law-and-order legislator to someone who ultimately decided the death penalty had not been and could not be administered fairly. At one point, the book details Ryan’s discussions with top aides as he agonized over what ultimately would be the one execution that occurred under his watch -- that of Andrew Kokoraleis in March 1999.\n\nKokoraleis had been involved in a series of sadistic killings known as the “Chicago Ripper” murders in Chicago and its suburbs. Ryan got hundreds of letters from anti-death penalty advocates. There was also testimony of murder victim Lorraine Borowski’s mother, calling Kokoraleis a “monster” and asking for execution.\n\n“I agonized and felt unmoored,” Ryan wrote. But he allowed the punishment to be carried out.\n\n“That night was the most emotionally draining night of my life,” Ryan wrote. “And I learned that when you’re responsible for putting a person to death, it sticks with you.”\n\nAs the book recounts, Ryan was in the Illinois House when the state reinstated the death penalty in 1977 with his vote. But by the time he emptied death row in 2003, 12 people had been executed but 13 were found innocent. He also pardoned four people late in his term and said he had no doubt the number of innocent men freed from death row was really 17. He called that “an embarrassment” and “a catastrophic failure.”\n\nIllinois had seen confessions coerced through beatings by police, evidence from jailhouse informants found to be false, and the coming of DNA testing that showed some on death row were innocent. Ryan also pointed out the racial and regional disparities in the way prosecutions were handled, including all-white juries sentencing African-Americans to death.\n\n“You are five times more likely to get a death sentence for first-degree murder in the rural area of Illinois than you are in Cook County,” Ryan had said. “Where is the justice and fairness in that?”\n\nRyan notes in the book that the day he was sworn in as governor – Jan. 11, 1999 – the Chicago Tribune published the first of a five-part series on prosecutorial misconduct. That series identified nearly 400 homicide convictions nationwide over 25 years that had been reversed because prosecutors either failed to disclose evidence of innocence or knowingly used false evidence. One of the authors of that series was Possley.\n\nRyan also wrote that he was “stunned to my core” while watching the news in February 1999 and seeing Anthony Porter, an Illinois death row inmate, walking free following an investigation by a professor and students at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism.\n\nPorter had a low IQ and at one point had been two days away from execution.\n\nRyan contacted the professor, David Protess, and later pardoned Porter. The case, Ryan said, “caused something inside me to shift” on the death penalty.\n\nRyan was under severe scrutiny at the time he announced his decision to empty death row. An investigation that included secretary of state workers taking bribes to issue truck drivers’ licenses resulted in charges against 79 people. Ryan had been secretary of state before being elected governor and in December 2003 after leaving office he was charged with racketeering, mail fraud, and making false statements.\n\nRyan was accused of receiving cash and gifts in return for allowing associates to profit from contracts and other business with the state. He said a jury – including replacement of two jurors who failed to disclose criminal backgrounds—decided in 2006 he had deprived citizens to their right “to my honest services as a public official.”\n\nHe began his prison sentence in November 2007 and says that a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision held that honest services law was restricted to the payment of bribes. While a post-conviction petition on his behalf noted that none of the 83 prosecution witnesses in his cases “testified that I took anything from anybody to perform my official acts,” the court rejected it.\n\n“Since my release on July 3, 2013, I have resumed my life,” he wrote. “I know all too well that when many people hear my name, they think first of my trial, the conviction, and the prison term. Yes, I went to prison. It happened, I got through it and I have moved on.”\n\n“I don’t think I was criminally wrong,” Ryan said Wednesday. “I think there was a lot of miscarriage of justice there. The prosecutor said he wanted to bag two governors – and he got (Rod) Blagojevich and me.”\n\nRyan didn’t seek a second term. In 2002, Democrat Blagojevich ran as a reformer and was elected. He ended up being convicted on federal corruption charges and being sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was to be released in 2024 but was freed in February when President Donald Trump commuted his sentence.\n\nAsked if he agreed with Trump’s action helping Blagojevich, Ryan said, “Sure I did.” He said he thinks the length of Blagojevich’s sentence was “terrible.”\n\nRyan said he is in good health. While in prison, he lost his wife of 63 years, Lura Lynn, in 2011. But he was allowed to visit her for a critical two hours. His new book is dedicated to her, and “my solid family.” It was “love at first sight” when he met Lura Lynn in high school, he wrote, and their “marriage made in heaven” produced six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.\n\nTwo of their children live in Springfield.\n\nRyan said that in recent years, he was fortunate to meet a widow, Alice “Kitty” Kelly, and they had “a great relationship for six years that made my life a joy.” Though she died in June 2019, he said, “I inherited her family and they inherited me. … I am now blessed with an even bigger loving family that keeps me busy.”\n\nConcerning the death penalty – Blagojevich kept the moratorium in place. And on March 9, 2011, Gov. Pat Quinn signed legislation ending the practice in Illinois.\n\nThe 278-page book, published by Rowman & Littlefield, has a list price of $32 hardcover, and $30 eBook.\n\nContact Bernard Schoenburg: Bernard.schoenburg@sj-r.com, 788-1540, twitter.com/bschoenburg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/us/death-penalty-2022-report/index.html", "title": "The death penalty in the US remains in decline during 'the year of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe use and imposition of the death penalty in America saw a continued decline in 2022 as polls showed public support for capital punishment stayed near historic lows, according to a year-end report by the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nWhile several factors have contributed to what the non-profit describes as the death penalty’s waning nature, the trend was illustrated perhaps most starkly this week when outgoing Democratic Gov. Kate Brown commuted the death sentences of all 17 inmates on Oregon’s death row, calling capital punishment “dysfunctional and immoral.”\n\nMeanwhile, some of the six states that in 2022 put people to death – along with others that tried to carry out such sentences – ran into trouble, DPIC found, leading the organization to dub it “the year of the botched execution.”\n\nIndeed, five executions and two attempted ones this year – in Alabama, Arizona and Texas – significantly deviated from or illustrated problems with prescribed protocols, the group’s executive director told CNN. Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma also executed death row inmates this year.\n\n“As the death penalty declines, the states that want to carry it out are engaging in more and more extreme conduct,” said Robert Dunham, whose group says it’s neither for nor against capital punishment but often is critical of how it’s administered.\n\n“There is an appearance that the states that want to carry out executions are desperate and are willing to do extreme things that most of the country considers unacceptable.”\n\nStates also again this year struggled to obtain drugs for lethal injections as drug companies continued to withhold them so they aren’t used to put people to death, the report states, noting examples in places including Idaho and Ohio.\n\nOverall, public support for the death penalty remains similar to recent years, states the report released Friday, citing polling from Gallup that shows 55% of Americans say they are in favor of the death penalty for convicted murderers. That figure has held steady in recent years, per Gallup: 2022 was the sixth consecutive year support for capital punishment was between 54% and 56% – and below the 60% to 80% readings recorded between 1976 and 2016.\n\nTwenty-seven states still have the death penalty, with their officials often saying its use provides justice to victims of capital murder and their relatives. When Oklahoma officials this year scheduled 25 executions through 2024, Attorney General John O’Connor said families of the victims had “waited decades for justice” and called the executions the “next step in the journey that the murderers forced upon them.”\n\nStill, given falloff in its use and public support, Dunham said, “I think the long-term prognosis for capital punishment in the US is that it remains on a downward trajectory.”\n\nThe sun sets in January behind Holman Prison, home to Alabama's death row. Jay Reeves/AP\n\nExecutions and new death sentences remain low\n\n2022 was the eighth consecutive year in which US jurisdictions carried out fewer than 30 executions and imposed fewer than 50 new death sentences, Dunham told CNN, as federal executions remain temporarily halted. That keeps use of the punishment “near historic lows,” he said, even after the Covid-19 pandemic heavily impacted court proceedings in 2020 and 2021.\n\n“We are clearly seeing a durable trend,” he said.\n\nOverall, 18 executions were carried out this year, per the report, the fewest since 1991 (excepting 2020 and 2021). That tally is down 82% from the peak in 1999, when 98 executions were carried out, and brings the five-year average to 18.6 executions per year – the lowest in three decades.\n\nThose executions, too, have been carried out in increasingly limited geographic areas, the report notes. Oklahoma and Texas accounted for more than half this year’s executions, DPIC says, stemming in all from about a dozen county jurisdictions.\n\nAs for new death sentences, just 20 have been imposed so far this year – with two more anticipated Friday – DPIC found, fewer than in any modern year before the pandemic. That’s down 93% from the peak in 1996, when courts levied 315 death sentences. The five-year average is 27 new sentences per year, the report says, the lowest in 50 years.\n\nAnd yet, those sentences were not imposed in what might be thought of as the most aggravated cases, the report notes, like that of the Parkland high school shooter, who got a life sentence after his Florida jury failed to unanimously recommend the death penalty.\n\nCases like this highlight the disproportional and often arbitrary use of capital punishment and undermine the idea the death penalty is reserved for the “worst of the worst,” the report notes.\n\nMoreover, this year’s relatively unwavering polling on support for the death penalty was striking, Dunham said, given perceptions of increased crime in an election cycle where crime ranked among the top issues for voters and Republican candidates made crime central to their messages and in political ads.\n\nCandidates who touted a general commitment to criminal justice reform were elected as prosecutors in jurisdictions previously responsible for a “disproportionate amount of death sentences and executions,” DPIC’s report says.\n\nConventional wisdom long had held that support for the death penalty increases when crime rises, Dunham told CNN.\n\nBut this year? “The conventional wisdom went out the window,” he said.\n\nCrosses on the front lawn of the Clark Memorial United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City represent people the state is scheduled to execute. Erin Clark/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nTroubled lethal injections highlight states’ challenges\n\nThe Death Penalty Information Center this year added seven cases – three in Alabama, three in Arizona and one in Texas – to its list of botched executions, in most cases because of execution teams’ inability to properly set intravenous lines to deliver the lethal drugs.\n\nMany experts use the term “botched” to describe any executions that depart from states’ official protocols, as well as those in which an inmate suffers inordinately or has an adverse or unexpected physical reaction during the procedure.\n\nThis was particularly evident in Alabama, beginning with Joe James, whose execution this summer has been heavily scrutinized after The Atlantic reported he likely “suffered a long death,” citing a private autopsy. That autopsy showed officials had cut into James’ skin to find a vein to set an IV line, which is not part of Alabama’s lethal injection protocol, Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University who witnessed the autopsy, told CNN.\n\nJames’ execution was followed by two attempted executions – Alan Miller in September and Kenneth Smith in November – that Alabama officials were forced to abort when they were again unable to properly set IV lines before the death warrants expired. Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, then called for a moratorium on executions and a review of capital punishment in the state, though she blamed not state officials but “legal tactics and criminals hijacking the system” for the aborted executions.\n\nStephen Barbee’s execution in Texas also was deemed a botched case by DPIC, which cited a disability that prevented the inmate from extending his arm so the needle with lethal injection drugs could be inserted. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice disputed the characterization, saying media witnesses to the execution also did not describe it as botched.\n\n“Due to Barbee’s disability, TDCJ did take extra time to ensure functional IV (lines),” spokesperson Amanda Hernandez told CNN this week in a statement, adding, “TDCJ followed all appropriate protocols for the execution.” Corrections officials in Alabama and Arizona have not responded to CNN’s requests for comment about the executions DPIC considered botched.\n\nStates also dealt in 2022 with challenges to their execution methods as officials have struggled in recent years to get the drugs for lethal injections from companies that don’t want them used to put people to death. As a result, the drugs used in lethal injections and how they are obtained are frequently shrouded in mystery, DPIC has said.\n\n“There were executions that didn’t even happen,” Dunham told CNN, “because of incompetence or misconduct or just plain arrogance by the states.”\n\nIn Tennessee, for example, GOP Gov. Bill Lee paused executions and called for an independent review in May after issuing a reprieve to Oscar Smith, saying he learned the required procedures for testing the execution drugs had not been followed.\n\nAnd in Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine, also a Republican, issued a series of reprieves this year, citing “ongoing problems involving the willingness of pharmaceutical suppliers to provide drugs” to Ohio corrections officials.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/15/tennessee-governors-recall-death-penalty-decisions/1189187001/", "title": "Tennessee governors recall death row decisions like Donnie Johnson", "text": "Bob Clement remembers walking past his father's bedroom inside the governor’s mansion when he was a boy.

Bill Haslam said he would uphold the state constitution if presented with a death penalty decision. It took eight years, but by the time Haslam exited office he had overseen three executions.\n\nMaking a decision on capital punishment was “far heavier” than Haslam anticipated and is something he thinks about from time to time, particularly this week as Lee is making a decision.\n\nLooking at the market:Tennessee whiskey exports slump amid Trump tariff turmoil, MTSU report says\n\n“You’re actually talking about a real person, a real crime and real victims, and the reality of it is at some point and time they look at you and say, ‘Do you want us to go ahead?’ That’s about as sobering a moment you can have,” he said.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Phil Bredesen oversaw five executions as governor. He said few have ever been through the experience of holding a person's life in your hands, and there is no life experience to prepare you. He vividly remembers overseeing his first execution, the death of Sedley Alley, in 2006.\n\n“You’re sitting there, it’s 11 o’clock in the evening, and the Supreme Court has said go ahead, and you’re the only person on earth with a 15-second phone call who can bring this to an end and save this person’s life,” he said. “It’s a very agonizing, unpleasant situation to be in.”\n\nSix Tennessee executions in 2 years\n\nDuring Clement’s first two terms as governor, he oversaw six executions, all withina two-year window from April 1955 to May 1957.\n\nBob Clement, the former U.S. congressman, said the childhood memory of his father’s prayers is sharp..\n\n“He knew all he had to do was pick up that phone, call the warden and stop the execution,” he said.\n\nU.S. Sen.

He was scheduled to die in November 1981, but, with less than a month remaining, exercised his final appeal.

I mean, there were prison riots, firings of Cabinet members, civil rights disturbances (and) all of that, but this was all by itself.”\n\nAlexander sought advice from others about how to handle death penalty clemency pleas, including Frank Clement's father, longtime Dickson city judge Robert Clement. Frank Clement died an untimely death in 1969, in part, Alexander believes, because of the agony of the death penalty judgments he made as governor.\n\nMore:Tennessee executions: 4 from Knox County still wait on death row\n\nTom Ingram, a Republican politico, was deputy and chief of staff to Alexander during his first term as governor. He set up the meeting with the elder Clement.\n\n“(The death penalty) was not something Lamar looked forward to at all,” he said. “It was a sense of relief when the appeals moved it down the road and we were fortunate in his two terms not to have to deal with it.”\n\nTaking its toll over time\n\nAs Alexander tells it, Frank Clement used to visit death row and talk to the prisoners before an execution date, even bringing the Rev. Billy Graham for one of his visits.\n\nBob Clement said his father would meet with the victim’s family. It took a toll.\n\n“He really struggled with capital punishment, but what made it so tough on him (was his visits),” Clement said. “I don’t know of any governor anywhere at any time who did what he did, personally going out to the state penitentiary to sit out with those on death row and talk with them one on one.”\n\nAlexander agreed.\n\n“He worried about it the whole time he was governor, and (his father, Robert) Clement thought it was probably what caused Frank to die an early death — his drinking as a result of his agony over the death sentence,” he said. “So, it’s a tough issue for the governor.”\n\nClement didn’t attribute his father's untimely death to the death penalty, but said the decisions were always emotional for him.\n\n“It was tough making those decisions. He did let some die, but he saved some of their lives … that’s an overwhelming decision to make, and all you have to do is pick up the phone and save someone’s life,” Clement said.\n\nFor Bredesen, “I’ve been able to put it out of my mind. I don’t agonize over it in retrospect. You wait until the decision is right, you make a decision and then go on with the next thing.”\n\nHaslam said capital punishment decisions were just part of the job, though not those he wanted to have.\n\n“It’s neither a decision that haunts me nor one that I just put out of my mind,” he said. “It continues to be one that feels heavy and sobering, but I think of those decisions as being ones that are part of the role.”\n\nDeath row decisions are matter of faith\n\nRepublican Gov. Don Sundquist oversaw the execution of West Tennessee’s Robert Coe in 2000, the state’s first execution in 40 years, but said his faith didn’t prohibit him from upholding the state’s constitution.\n\n“It's obviously a very heavy responsibility, but it met the criteria that I had for me that once I found he was guilty, then that was the penalty. It wasn’t that difficult for me.\n\n“It’s still something when you take somebody’s life, but I didn’t agonize over it. I agonized over the crime and the fact that he’s guilty.”\n\nHaslam said he spent time in prayer and spent hours upon hours calling people he respected and getting their opinion. He was with his wife, Crissy, waiting by the phone during the three executions.\n\nMore:From gallows to gurney: Six of East Tennessee's most infamous executions\n\n“I think like everything you do in a role like this, you’re constantly praying and thinking about what the right decision will be and talking with as many people as we can so we can get (more) perspective on it,” he said.\n\nMike McWherter, former Democratic gubernatorial candidate and son of the late Democratic Gov. Ned McWherter, said he and his father spoke about capital punishment. Their ideas of the governor’s role were similar, ideas the younger man was ready to adopt had he been elected.\n\n“I remember my father telling me at the time that he didn’t like the concept, but it was the law of the state of Tennessee and if he was going to swear to uphold the laws and constitution, he would enforce it.”\n\nNed McWherter served two terms without an execution.\n\nCommuting Tennessee inmates' sentences\n\nAfter overseeing six executions during his first two terms as governor, Clement won reelection after Gov. Buford Ellington served four years. He did away with the death penalty altogether in 1965 and commuted the sentences of everyone on death row.\n\nClement had the political will to do it after the state Senate voted to repeal the death penalty and the repeal fell only one vote short in the House, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court struck down death penalty cases in 1972, though the state rewrote the statute and reinstated the practice in 1975. Executions did not resume until 2000 under Sundquist.\n\nThirty states and the federal government have the death penalty on the books, but some of those states have imposed moratoriums, according to Reuters, including California in March. The vast majority of executions are carried out by a handful of states. There were 25 U.S. executions last year.\n\nBredesen commuted the death sentences of three inmates as governor, including Gaile Owens in 2010. She was released from prison a year later. Owens was sentenced to death for hiring a hit man to kill her husband in 1984.\n\nMore:Gaile Owens: 'I still struggle' with freedom\n\nBredesen commuted the death sentence of Michael Joe Boyd to life in prison months before his execution date. Days before leaving office, he commuted the death sentence of convicted murderer Edward Jerome Harbison to life in prison without parole.\n\nNo other governor has commuted death penalty sentences, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\n“The approach I decided was to say I’m not going to try to be the 13th juror … I’m (not) looking at it and saying whether the person is guilty or anything. I liked to think of it as being the final check on whether the system has worked here.”\n\nIn these cases, he thought the system had failed the convicted based on similar cases nationally or, as was the case with Boyd, that the convicted’s legal representation failed them.\n\nIn Gov. Bill Lee’s shoes\n\nBefore Lee had decided whether to offer clemency to Johnson, Alexander said he wouldn’t publicly advise the governor on what to do but said he’s “very sympathetic” for any governor who has to deal with the death penalty, particularly someone of faith like Lee.\n\nIngram said Tuesday he had not spoken with Lee about his pending decision but said he could imagine what he was going through.\n\n“Knowing him and knowing his faith and his compassion for people, I can imagine (it’s hard). It’s easy to respect the judicial process, but at the end of the day you have a life-or-death decision given to you by law. I think it’s probably the most difficult and personal decision a governor is ever faced with.”\n\nSundquist said Lee has to come up with a conclusion and follow his principles and then make a decision.\n\n“I wouldn’t tell him to do it or not do it. He’s going to have to reach that conclusion. The only thing I’d do to reach it is to make sure (Johnson has) had the appeal process required and that he’s guilty.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/01/17/kentucky-governors-pardon-power-is-unchecked/4491550002/", "title": "Bevin pardons: Kentucky's unchecked clemency power cuts out victims", "text": "When Gov. Matt Bevin granted more than 650 pardons and commutations last month, he didn’t consult with crime victims, prosecutors or judges for a simple reason.\n\nHe didn’t have to.\n\nIndeed, Kentucky gives its governor nearly unchecked power when it comes to handing out clemency — imposing the fewest restrictions of any state, a Courier Journal analysis shows.\n\nIn 17 states, the governor must notify prosecutors before granting a pardon or commutation. But not in Kentucky.\n\nIn 15 states, the victim must be notified. Not in Kentucky.\n\nA dozen states allow or require public hearings, and a dozen require the governor to consult with the state parole board. Neither is required in Kentucky.\n\nIndeed, Kentucky law says only that the governor may ask the parole board for advice. And the Kentucky Constitution's only requirement is that the governor must state a reason for clemency and make it public.\n\nThat could be about to change.\n\nBackground:Bevin pardons include man whose brother hosted fundraiser for him\n\nRepublican Senate President Robert Stivers said he supports not only notification for victims but creating a new pardon commission that would research proposed cases and make recommendations to the governor.\n\nChris Cohron, legislative director of the state association of commonwealth’s attorneys, said that at “a bare minimum” the legislature needs to ensure that the prosecutor and victim be given “ample notice and an opportunity to respond to the pardon application.”\n\nRob Sanders, the commonwealth’s attorney in Kenton County, where Bevin pardoned a man convicted of raping a 9-year-old girl, said: \"In light of the fact we obviously can’t trust every governor to do the right thing, yes, I would support legislation requiring notice.\"\n\nGov. Andy Beshear appears likely to support reform of Kentucky’s parole laws.\n\nAlthough he wouldn’t comment on specific measures, a spokesman, Sebastian Kitchen, said: \"Beshear has been clear he will handle the pardon process differently. He will never issue a pardon for a violent crime without talking to victims or their families and to prosecutors.\"\n\nThe Courier Journal reviewed clemency laws in other states after Bevin, as a lame-duck, issued more than 650 pardons and applications, including some to violent offenders.\n\nThat triggered an uproar among prosecutors, victims and their families, some of whom found out through news reports.\n\nThe latest:Dayton Jones must register as sex offender after Bevin freed him\n\nOutrage prompts curbs on clemency\n\nThe Courier Journal found that other states reined in their clemency powers after governors there issued similar flurries of last-minute commutations and pardons:\n\nIn Georgia, after the governor in his final 24 hours in 1943 pardoned 75 men, 22 of whom were convicted murderers, the state amended its constitution to reassign clemency powers to an independent board that still exists today.\n\nIn Ohio, Gov. Richard Celeste in 1991, with four days later in his term, granted clemency to 67 offenders — including a death-row inmate who raped and murdered a 7-year-old girl. The legislature subsequently adopted a variety of reforms, including a requirement that the governor obtain a nonbinding recommendation from the parole board in advance of any decision.\n\nIn Tennessee, after Democratic Gov. Ray Blanton pardoned or commuted prison terms for 52 inmates, 24 of whom were serving time for murder — and two top aides were convicted of selling clemency orders — the state legislature in 1979 created an independent pardon and parole board.\n\nTennessee's pardon-selling scandal was immortalized in a book and 1985 movie, \"Marie,\" starring Sissy Spacek as heroic state employee Marie Ragghianti, who blew the whistle on the scheme.\n\nBlanton was convicted of extortion and conspiracy and served 22 months in prison, but in a separate scandal, for selling a liquor license to a friend for $23,000.\n\nIn 2011, after another Tennessee governor, Phil Bredesen, on his way out the door pardoned 22 people and commuted the sentences of four others, including a man on death row for beating a woman to death while burglarizing her home, the legislature passed the \"Victims of Crime Executive Clemency Notification Act.\"\n\nRelated:Bevin granted commutations to 336 drug offenders. Nearly all were white\n\nIt requires the governor to notify the attorney general of clemency applications and prosecutors to notify the victim.\n\n\"We felt it was needed, we felt it was proper, and we felt it was constitutional,\" former state prosecutor Michael Dunavant, now U.S. attorney for the Western District of Tennessee, said in an interview.\n\nStivers, the Kentucky Senate president, said he believes restriction on the governor’s pardon power would require amending the constitution.\n\nBut University of Kentucky law professor William Fortune, a constitutional scholar, said he doesn’t believe requiring the governor to notify prosecutors or victims would require a constitutional amendment because \"it doesn’t strip away the governor's pardon power.\"\n\nState Sen. Chris McDaniel, a Republican from Northern Kentucky, has introduced a bill for a constitutional amendment that would remove a governor's power to grant pardons between an election and the inauguration of the next governor.\n\nAnd Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Whitney Westerfield, R-Hopkinsville, has already added a provision to notify victims about proposed clemency to Marsy's Law, an amendment that would add a variety of victim protections to the state constitution.\n\nVoters approved Marsy’s Law in 2018, but it was struck down by the Kentucky Supreme Court because the entire text of the law wasn’t included on the ballot.\n\nCriminal defense lawyers are likely to oppose any conditions or limitations on clemency.\n\nRetired Chief Jefferson County Public Defender Dan Goyette said giving advance notice to victims or prosecutors would subject governors to political pressure, undermining \"the purpose of clemency to correct injustices, especially in unpopular or controversial cases.\"\n\nFrom our editor:Bevin challenged us to scrutinize his pardons. We've done that\n\nClemency enshrined in American history\n\nClemency, which includes both pardons and sentence reductions, is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and those of every state. It is seen as vital for correcting mistakes in the courts.\n\nFounding Father Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers that the \"prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered\" and that without it, \"justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel.\"\n\nStates that limit a governor's pardon powers have had difficulty enforcing them.\n\nIn Mississippi, the state constitution says no pardon shall be granted unless felons publish notice of their application for 30 days in a newspaper in the county where their crime occurred.\n\nBut in 2012, the Mississippi Supreme Court allowed 165 pardons issued by Gov. Haley Barbour to stand, even though they violated that requirement, saying the validity of pardons is solely the governor’s call.\n\nA state-by-state comparison of clemency laws by the Restoration of Rights Project shows that states impose a variety of restrictions on their governor’s pardon power that don't exist in Kentucky.\n\nIn six states, for example, applications are decided by an independent board.\n\nIn eight states, the governor must get consent from the parole board.\n\nAnd in four states, including Indiana, the governor must notify the parole board, though its recommendations are not binding.\n\nKentucky is one of 15 states in which the governor may consult with the parole board but doesn't have to. The\\other 14 states, however, impose additional obligations on the applicant or the governor, including notifying victims, prosecutors or the sentencing judge, or providing the legislature with the reasons for clemency orders.\n\nIn Maryland, the governor must publish notices of proposed clemency in the newspaper. In North Dakota, the applicant must demonstrate \"compelling need,\" and in Vermont, the applicant must prove he or she has been rehabilitated.\n\nRelated:After an OD death, problems found among drug offenders freed by Bevin\n\nOther states mandate consent from high-level officials or legislative bodies.\n\nIn Rhode Island, for example, the governor must get the \"advice and consent\" of the state Senate. In Florida, the governor must get two cabinet secretaries to concur.\n\nIn Minnesota, a board composed of the governor, attorney general and chief justice of the state Supreme Court must vote unanimously for clemency.\n\nAnd in California, repeat offenders must be recommended for pardons or commutations by a majority of state Supreme Court justices.\n\nLaw professor Rachel Barkow, a clemency expert and director of New York University’s Center on the Administration of Criminal Law, said ideally governors should be required to consult with a well-informed board that can offer \"helpful analysis\" — but the governor should be allowed to make the final call.\n\nShe cited as a model Arkansas, where board members must have at least a bachelor’s degree and five years' experience in fields that include law enforcement, psychology, psychiatry, social work and other related areas.\n\nDaniel Kobil, another clemency expert who is a professor at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, said most clemency orders governors issue are valid and justified.\n\nBut Kobil, who has followed the news of Bevin’s clemency orders, including one he issued for a child rapist on the medically discredited ground that the victim’s hymen was intact, added, \"The problem is when a governor has the hubris to think he can decide whether a little girl has been raped or not.\"\n\nForgiveness, redemption, injustice:Why Bevin pardoned more than 250 criminals\n\nReporter Joe Sonka contributed to this story.\n\nAndrew Wolfson: 502-582-7189; awolfson@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @adwolfson.

It didn't seem like he was having any trouble.\"\n\nPostelle was declared dead at 10:14 a.m. at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. He was 35.\n\nHe apologized at his clemency hearing in December for killing four people but made no final statement Thursday.\n\nThe execution was the fourth since the state resumed lethal injections in October after a hiatus of more than six years. It came just days before the start of a federal trial that will determine whether any more executions will be carried out this year.\n\nAttorney General John O'Connor, whose assistants will represent the state at the trial, said the execution was carried out \"with zero complications.\"\n\n\"I believe the last couple of executions have been very smooth,\" Corrections Department Director Scott Crow told reporters afterward.\n\nWhat did Gilbert Ray Postelle do?\n\nPostelle was convicted of murdering four people on Memorial Day 2005 outside a trailer in Del City. He was sentenced to death for two of the murders and to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the other two.\n\nHe was 19 at the time of the murders. He acted along with his older brother and their father in a blitz attack involving assault rifles.\n\nShot the most was the trailer's resident, Donnie Swindle. Postelle's father had accused Swindle of causing his motorcycle accident the year before.\n\nAlso killed were Amy Wright, James Alderson and Terry Smith.\n\nJurors gave Postelle death sentences for fatally shooting Wright and Alderson after hearing testimony he hunted them down as they tried to flee. He later said Wright \"was over there screaming in the corner, and I got her ... a whole bunch of times and she shut up,\" according to testimony at his trial.\n\nSwindle's sister, Shelli Milner, called Postelle a monster who stole four innocent people's lives.\n\n\"To know that he will never walk this Earth again does give me a little more peace than I had yesterday, but I will never have peace knowing what he did to my brother Donnie, to Amy, to James and to Terry,\" she told reporters after the execution. \"He got what he deserved today.\"\n\nThe brother, David Postelle, is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole for his involvement. Their father, Brad Postelle, never went to trial because he was declared incompetent because of brain injuries from the motorcycle accident. The father died in 2011.\n\nIronically, authorities believe the father was wrong about the motorcycle accident and that Swindle was not to blame. \"There was no evidence to support any conclusion other than that Brad Postelle's wreck being simply a single-vehicle accident in which Brad was ejected from a rear-wheel skid that he alone caused,\" state attorneys told the Pardon and Parole Board.\n\nGilbert Postelle said at his clemency hearing that he absolutely still believed what his father told him about the accident. \"He was hit by a car and he was hit with something,\" he said.\n\nWhat was Gilbert Postelle's last meal?\n\nFor his last meal Wednesday, Postelle had 20 chicken nuggets with ranch, BBQ and honey mustard dipping sauces.\n\nHe also had three large fries with ketchup, a crispy chicken sandwich, a chicken sandwich, a large cola and a caramel frappe.\n\nGilbert Postelle's execution the last before trial over Oklahoma's execution procedure\n\nA trial over the state's lethal injection procedure begins Feb. 28 in Oklahoma City federal court. More than two dozen death row inmates are asking a judge to find the state's procedure unconstitutional.\n\nThe Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals will schedule executions for those inmates if the legal challenge fails.\n\nPostelle was kicked out of the federal lawsuit because he initially didn't specify an alternative method of execution. He later gave firing squad as an alternative but his choice came too late.\n\nHe said at his clemency hearing that he had been high on methamphetamine for days at the time of the shooting and only remembers bits and pieces.\n\n“I do understand that I’m guilty and I accept that,” he said. “My life at that time was filled with chaos and drugs.\n\n\"I do regret the pain and the loss that I have caused. ... There’s nothing more that I know to say to you all than I am truly sorry for what I have done to all the families.”\n\nHis attorney, Robert Nance, told the parole board he had a poor upbringing that included using meth for the first time in his father's presence at age 12. The attorney also said he suffered from intellectual deficits and mental illness.\n\nOne IQ test put his score at 76.\n\nThe parole board voted 4-1 to deny his clemency request. The U.S. Supreme Court in January denied his request for an emergency stay.\n\nHis daughter, ex-wife, fiancee and other supporters on Feb. 1 called on Gov. Kevin Stitt to delay the execution until after the federal trial. The governor did not.\n\nTwo other inmates who had been scheduled for executions were granted stays. A third, Julius Jones, had his sentence commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nOklahoma had problems with executions in 2014 and 2015. One was called off at the last minute when the doctor determined the wrong drug had been delivered.\n\nThe first execution in more than six years last October resulted in renewed criticism of the state's procedure. Media witnesses reported John Marion Grant convulsed repeatedly and threw up.\n\nGilbert Ray Postelle's final moments before execution\n\nDuring Thursday's execution, Postelle stayed silent and mostly stared straight up. He looked three times at the five media witnesses.\n\nThe curtain rose in the execution chamber at 10 a.m., and he was asked if he had any last words. He shook his head.\n\nHis eyes were drooping by 10:02 a.m. They were mostly closed a minute later. He was declared unconscious at 10:06 a.m. after a doctor came into the chamber and checked him.\n\nHis chest rose and fell slightly for another minute or so. His last movement came at 10:09 a.m. when a finger twitched.

Under that scenario, Jones would have immediately been eligible for parole on his murder conviction.\n\nThe governor's decision means Jones' execution, set for Thursday afternoon, is canceled.\n\nThe clemency marks a partial win for a diverse group of Jones activists and supporters who have proclaimed the inmate was wrongfully convicted in the 1999 fatal shooting of insurance executive Paul Howell during a carjacking .\n\nJurors chose the death penalty as punishment at a 2002 trial, and Jones has spent nearly 20 years on death row.\n\nJones' attorney praised the governor for blocking the execution, but said she had hoped Stitt would have granted her client the option of parole.\n\n“Governor Stitt took an important step today towards restoring public faith in the criminal justice system by ensuring that Oklahoma does not execute an innocent man,\" attorney Amanda Bass said in a statement.\n\nJones has maintained he is innocent, claiming his co-defendant shot and killed Howell and pinned the slaying on him.\n\nA growing number of supporters have also proclaimed Jones' innocence and begged Stitt to grant clemency.

This is another important move forward in the agency’s efforts to combat youth tobacco use and promote health equity.”\n\nThis landmark proposal could have a big impact on public health, experts said.\n\n“I want to underscore the momentous aspect of this. It will be it will be a game-changer,” Erika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy for the American Lung Association, said Thursday. “The rules will have a tremendous impact on stopping kids from starting to use tobacco and critically save lives of people, particularly from diverse backgrounds.”\n\nA long time coming\n\nMenthol is an equity issue that the FDA has been considering for more than a decade. It is the last special flavor allowed in cigarettes in the US. It was carved out of the 2009 Tobacco Control Act that banned all other flavored cigarettes and gave the FDA the authority to regulate the tobacco industry to protect public health. The law also required the FDA to conduct and fund research on menthol.\n\nAfter several years of FDA investigation and public input from hundreds of thousands of interested parties, the Public Health Law Center and other groups filed a citizens petition requesting the agency prohibit menthol in cigarettes. A 2020 lawsuit alleged the FDA unreasonably delayed issuing a final response. In 2021, the FDA announced it would pursue rulemaking.\n\nAbout 18.6 million people smoke menthols in the United States. That’s about 36% of all smokers, according to the FDA, and a disproportionate number are people of color.\n\nAn equity issue\n\nThe tobacco industry has heavily marketed menthol products to communities of color and other minority groups.\n\nAbout 30% of White smokers choose menthols, but they are the cigarette of choice for nearly 85% of smokers who are Black. About 40% of women smoke menthols, compared with 31% of men, according to the FDA.\n\nLGBTQ people are also significantly more likely to smoke menthols. A 2013 study that looked at data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2009-10 National Adult Tobacco survey found that 36% of LGBTQ smokers chose menthols, compared with 29.3% of straight smokers.\n\n“Today marks the beginning of the end of menthol cigarettes – a truly historic moment for public health. For decades, tobacco companies have intentionally pushed menthol cigarettes to hook young people on their deadly products and implemented racist marketing practices to intentionally target Black Americans; the resulting health consequences have been devastating,” Dr. Julie Morita, executive vice president at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation advocacy organization, said in a statement.\n\nMore than half of kids who smoke use menthol cigarettes, according to the CDC. A survey of adults who smoke found that the majority started with menthols. Other studies said kids who smoked menthol cigarettes were more likely to become regular smokers than occasional smokers.\n\n“The proposed rules would help prevent children from becoming the next generation of smokers and help adult smokers quit,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement Thursday. “Additionally, the proposed rules represent an important step to advance health equity by significantly reducing tobacco-related health disparities.”\n\nSmoking rates in the US reached an all-time low in 2018, according to the CDC, but smoking is still the top cause of preventable death, disease and disability in the country. In general, cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the US, including more than 41,000 deaths from secondhand smoke.\n\nCutting out menthol in cigarettes and cigars could have a significant effect on the number of smokers, the FDA said. By one estimate, it could even prevent 650,000 premature deaths over the next 40 years.\n\nAnother study projects that an elimination of menthol as a cigarette flavor would lead 923,000 people to quit smoking, including 230,000 African Americans, in the first year and a half.\n\nA switch to flavored cigars\n\nAfter the 2009 Tobacco Control Act banned flavored cigarettes, many smokers who preferred flavors – especially children – may have shifted to flavored cigars, including menthol and “kid-friendly” flavors like fruit punch, strawberry and grape.\n\nThe FDA said that the use of flavored cigars “increased dramatically” and that public health goals may have been “undermined” by the availability of these products. More than half a million youth in the US smoke flavored cigars, according to the FDA.\n\nFlavored cigars and cigarillos are especially popular among children, particularly Black and Hispanic kids, who are twice as likely to smoke them as their White classmates.\n\nThe FDA noted that one survey found that nearly 74% of teens 12 to 17 said they smoked cigars because they came in flavors that they enjoyed.\n\nIn 2020, more young people said they tried a cigar every day than tried a cigarette.\n\n“A prohibition on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars would mark a historic turning point in the decades-long battle against tobacco use and the epidemic of tobacco-related disease,” Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement Thursday. “The science is clear: Menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health and have no public health benefits as compared to non-menthol cigarettes. They increase the likelihood and degree of addiction among youth smokers, elevating the number of premature deaths from tobacco use. Their removal from the market would have enormous benefits for public health in this country.”\n\nIndividual consumers wouldn’t be prosecuted\n\nIf enacted, the FDA was careful to note, the rule will address only tobacco companies and the industry. The agency, as well as state and local law enforcement, does not independently enforce FDA rules.\n\nThe proposed rule would not prosecute individual consumers for possessing menthol products.\n\nSome activists, like the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Mothers of the Movement, have warned that a ban on menthol products could cause more violent encounters with police as they enforce the rule.\n\nAnti-smoking advocates have found that Sharpton and some other civil rights organizations have received money from cigarette makers for decades. Sharpton acknowledged to the New York Times in 2019 that Reynolds American has been a longtime donor to his National Action Network but said, “this is not about money.”\n\nOther groups, like the NAACP and many members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are in favor of a ban.\n\n“The targeting and marketing of menthol flavoring by the tobacco industry have had a devastating impact on our community. Menthol-flavored cigarettes have induced many children and adults, resulting in lifelong addictions, health challenges, and ultimately killing our loved ones,” the NAACP said in a statement. “Today is a huge win for equity, justice, and public health concerns.”\n\nThe FDA said Thursday that it “recognizes concerns related to how state and local law enforcement may enforce their own laws in a manner that may impact equity and community safety, particularly for underserved and underrepresented communities. The FDA is seeking comment on, among other things, how it can best make clear the respective roles of the agency and state and local law enforcement, as well as policy considerations related to the potential racial and social justice implications of the proposed product standards.”\n\nCaliff said this is something the agency will address more in the future.\n\n“We take these concerns seriously,” he said. “Let us make one thing abundantly clear. These measures and related enforcement would be on the tobacco industry, not individuals who possess or use these products.”\n\nNext up: Public comment period\n\nAn FDA ban on menthol and flavored cigars won’t go into effect right away.\n\nThe next step will be a comment period that will run from May 4 through July 5. The FDA will also hold public listening sessions June 13 and 15.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe agency is then expected to take time to review the comments before a rule becomes finalized.\n\nThe rule would take effect one year after the final version is published. Public health experts are confident that tobacco companies will also try to stop the ban by suing the agency, as the companies have with past tobacco-control legislation.\n\n“This is not trivial,” Califf said. Tobacco-related deaths are high, he noted, and so are tobacco-related illnesses.\n\n“My plea is that we not lose our sense of urgency about this,” he said. “Literally, lives can be saved.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/health/e-cigarettes-youth-nicotine-addiction-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "More adolescent e-cigarette users report vaping within five minutes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAlthough the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teens has declined in recent years, those who do vape are starting younger and they’re using e-cigarettes more intensely, a new study suggests.\n\nAmong adolescents who only use e-cigarettes, the percentage who used the products within the first five minutes of waking up in a day was less than 1% between the years 2014 and 2017, but that shifted to 10.3% from 2017 through 2021, according to the study published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open.\n\n“This increase in intensity may reflect increasing use of nicotine for self-medication in response to increases in adolescent depression, anxiety, tic disorders, and suicidality that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the researchers – from San Francisco and Massachusetts General Hospital – wrote in the study.\n\n“The pandemic has also been a lost year for school-based prevention and treatment efforts, meaning that abatement plans will need to be intensified to address the nicotine addiction in those adolescents who missed a year of contact with adults who might have otherwise helped them get treatment.”\n\nThe researchers analyzed self-reported data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Youth Tobacco Surveys and Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. The data included a total of 151,573 survey respondents, all in middle or high school in the United States.\n\nThe data showed that, between 2014 and 2021, the age at which adolescents first started using e-cigarettes decreased and the intensity of their use increased – rising from using e-cigarettes about nine or fewer days a month to 10 or more days a month.\n\nThe researchers found that the average age at first use got younger over time, by about 1.9 months per calendar year, for e-cigarettes but remained stable for other tobacco products. The mean age of survey respondents was 14.5 years old.\n\nAmong adolescents who currently use any type of tobacco product, the proportion whose first-ever use of a product at a young age was an e-cigarette increased from 27.2% in 2014 to 78.3% in 2019, and remained at 77% in 2021, according to the data.\n\n‘Concerning’ trends in the intensity of use\n\nThe overall prevalence of e-cigarette use peaked in 2019 and then declined. But by 2019, more e-cigarette users were using within the first five minutes of waking up each day compared with traditional cigarette users.\n\n“The changes detected in this survey study may reflect the higher levels of nicotine delivery and addiction liability of modern e-cigarettes that use protonated nicotine to make nicotine easier to inhale,” the researchers wrote.\n\n“The increasing intensity of use of modern e-cigarettes highlights the clinical need to address youth addiction to these new high-nicotine products over the course of many clinical encounters. In addition, stronger regulation, including comprehensive bans on the sale of flavored tobacco products, should be implemented.”\n\nThis study’s findings suggest that e-cigarettes may be putting a new generation of adolescents at risk for nicotine addiction, and research has shown that many adolescents are unaware that most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, said Ashley Merianos, a research affiliate member of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the Thirdhand Smoke Research Consortium, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n“It is encouraging that the prevalence of e-cigarette use has declined among U.S. adolescents from 2019 to 2021. However, the addiction and intensity of use trends reported in this study are concerning, especially since tobacco use is typically established during adolescence,” Merianos, who is also a faculty researcher at the University of Cincinnati, said in an email.\n\n“Unfortunately, early nicotine addiction could overturn the significant tobacco control progress made over many decades,” she said. “Currently, cigarette smoking is at a record low among U.S. adolescents, but the continued initiation and use of e-cigarettes among adolescents could halt this progress.”\n\nIn 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration banned flavored cartridge-based e-cigarettes, other than tobacco or menthol, from the market. But the researchers noted in their study that after the ban, disposable flavored e-cigarettes rapidly gained popularity among adolescents, and they are calling for clinicians to be on alert for possible cases of nicotine addiction among young people.\n\n“Because tobacco addiction is a chronic disease, clinicians should be ready to address youth addiction to these new high-nicotine products during the course of many clinical encounters,” the researchers wrote in their study. “The increasing intensity of use of modern e-cigarettes highlights the need for local, state, and federal comprehensive bans on the sale of flavored tobacco products and consideration of ending the sale of these products on the open retail market, as has been done in 47 countries as of 2021.”\n\nConcern over ‘more severe nicotine addiction’\n\nThe new study is among the first to examine nicotine use among adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic, said Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent and young adult medicine at Mass General for Children and Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n“Most of us pediatricians haven’t been certain about what to expect with regard to teen nicotine use amid these upheavals – but had been worried. This study fills a big knowledge gap,” Hadland said in an email.\n\n“National data suggest that adolescent vaping may have declined during the Covid pandemic – we suspect because substance use often occurs when teens are among their peers, and Covid socially isolated many teens,” he said. “But in my clinic, I have been seeing that the teens that ‘do’ vape are showing more severe nicotine addiction now than in all my years of practice.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHadland added that the new study findings match what he has seen on the front lines in his own practice, including the earlier age at which youth start to use e-cigarettes, higher frequency of use, and greater symptoms of addiction, such as vaping first thing in the morning.\n\n“Teens who vape often receive high levels of nicotine consistently throughout the day, which leads to greater nicotine dependence and risk for addiction. As a result, I routinely see teens who experience uncomfortable nicotine withdrawal if they try to stop vaping, as well as strong cravings to use,” Hadland said in the email.\n\n“I increasingly have needed to use medications (e.g., varenicline pills, nicotine patches, and nicotine gum or lozanges—and often a combination of these) to manage withdrawal symptoms and cravings in teens to help them quit,” he said. “This is all a phenomenon of recent years.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/07/state-e-cigarette-bills/22364765/", "title": "States racing to regulate e-cigarettes - USA TODAY", "text": "Liz Szabo\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe American Cancer Society has found itself in a surprising position: opposing state proposals to make it illegal to sell e-cigarettes to minors.\n\nThe cancer society doesn't want kids to use e-cigarettes, but it objects to what it calls \"Trojan horse\" legislation – bills that appear good for public health but that could addict more people to nicotine and roll back progress against clean air-- says Cathy Callaway of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. Several health groups have campaigned against e-cigarette bills around the country because of concerns about their health effects and potential to make smoking seem normal again.\n\nForty-one states have banned the sale of e-cigarettes, also known as \"vapor products,\" to people under 18, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nBut 17 of those state laws use language that could make it harder to regulate e-cigarettes like tobacco – imposing hefty taxes and including them in smoke-free laws – says Erika Sward of the American Lung Association, which also has been fighting the bills.\n\nKids have have many ways to get cigarettes, research shows, and there are more effective ways of keeping cigarettes away from teens than just prohibiting sales, Sward says.\n\nRaising taxes – something specifically forbidden by a new Missouri law – does far more to cut youth smoking by making cigarettes too expensive for teens with limited incomes, Sward says.\n\nAbout 40% of the price of a pack of cigarettes comes from tax, says Bonnie Herzog, an e-cigarette industry analyst with Wells Fargo Securities. Today, using e-cigarettes costs about the same as conventional cigarettes.\n\nBy lobbying for ineffective regulations and working to block stronger ones, the e-cigarette industry is \"trotting out Big Tobacco's playbook from decades past,\" Sward says. \"They're trying to protect themselves from these policies so their products remain cheap and accessible to kids.\"\n\nFive states have passed laws that forbid cities approving stricter ordinances, according to a January report in the medical journal Tobacco Control.\n\nThat could stifle community action around e-cigarettes, says Mark Pertschuk, director of Grassroots Change, a network of public health movements. He notes that most clean-air laws began as local ordinances before gaining enough traction to be passed statewide.\n\n\"It should always raise red flags when people who are trying to addict you to their product come up with what appears to be a good public health measure,\" says Iowa state Sen. Joe Bolkcom, a Democrat. He opposed an industry-backed e-cigarette law that passed last year because it didn't include taxes or restrictions on where people can use the products.\n\n\"We're in the process of making the same mistakes that we made with tobacco,\" Bolkcom says. \"We're going to see a whole generation of people addicted to these products.\"\n\nLawmakers in 26 states are considering e-cigarette bills in the current legislative session, Callaway says. Several would limit local action. Some impose additional regulations such as requiring childproof packaging.\n\nAn e-cigarette, also known as a vape pen, uses a battery to heat liquid nicotine into a vapor that can be inhaled. It doesn't produce smoke. Some of the liquids include flavors such as bubble gum and \"Frooty Loops.\" Some are nicotine-free. Early versions looked like cigarettes, but newer products come in different shapes and sizes.\n\nWith hundreds of brands for sale, the popularity of e-cigarettes is racing ahead of efforts to regulate them, Sward says.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has proposed regulations for e-cigarettes, including a prohibition against selling them to minors, but the agency has not yet finalized the rule.\n\nThis month, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vetoed a bill banning e-cigarette sales to minors because it would not have regulated them as tobacco products.\n\nToo soon for a \"sin tax?\"\n\nMany lawmakers say they're trying to strike a balance, protecting kids without crushing a fledgling industry.\n\nMichigan state Sen. Rick Jones, a Republican, says only adults should be able to use e-cigarettes. He says they are no different than nicotine patches or gum and should be taxed the same way, with a sales tax. \"They are simply a nicotine delivery device,\" says Jones, who was disappointed that Snyder vetoed Michigan's bill. \"They are not tobacco cigarettes. I cannot support taxing them that way.\"\n\nOhio state Rep. Stephanie Kunze, a Republican, says she can't see imposing a \"sin tax\" on e-cigarettes before science has shown whether they're harmful.\n\nMinnesota is now the only state to tax e-cigarettes. A tax in North Carolina is scheduled to take effect in July.\n\nSome lawmakers say they felt pressure to compromise so they could quickly ban e-cigarette sales to minors.\n\nLast year, for the first time, more teens used e-cigarettes than conventional cigarettes. About 17% of high school seniors used e-cigarettes, while 14% used conventional cigarettes, according to the University of Michigan's long-running Monitoring the Future study.\n\nKunze says she voted for Ohio's ban on selling e-cigarettes to minors because of concern for children like her two teenage daughters.\n\n\"My No. 1 concern was to make them illegal for purchase by kids as fast as we could,\" Kunze says. \"These things look like Sephora eyeliner and they taste like Dr. Pepper.\"\n\nIowa state Sen. Herman Quirmbach, a Democrat, sponsored his state's law banning e-cigarette sales to minors last year. While he says he knew including e-cigarettes in the state's ban on smoking indoors wouldn't pass, he felt it was important to take immediate action to protect kids, with the hope that lawmakers can revisit the issue.\n\nThe e-cigarette industry has been swift to shape how vapor products are regulated.\n\nReynolds American, which owns both R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., believes that taxing e-cigarettes like regular cigarettes would \"place hurdles that would discourage cigarette smokers from considering switching\" to e-cigarettes,\" spokesman Richard Smith says.\n\nAltria Group, formerly called Philip Morris, sells several e-cigarette brands through a company called Nu Mark.\n\n\"We've been pretty active at the state level in working with legislators on minimum-age-of-purchase laws,\" Altria spokesman David Sutton says. \"We've been working with legislators to make sure that vapor products are only available to adults.\"\n\nBut banning e-cigarette sales to kids only makes teens want them more, says Stanton Glantz, a professor of tobacco control at the University of California-San Francisco. Tobacco industry documents show that cigarette companies have cast smoking as an adult activity in order to appeal to kids, he says. Documents from cigarette maker Brown & Williamson in 1975, which were subpoenaed by the Federal Trade Commission, suggest targeting teens by presenting cigarettes \"as one of the few initiations into the adult world\" and as an \"illicit pleasure.\"\n\nTobacco companies have a lot riding on vapor.\n\nSales of e-cigarettes could reach $3.5 billion this year, Herzog says.\n\nWhile that market is modest compared with the $85 billion in sales from conventional cigarettes, Herzog predicts that e-cigarette sales will surpass those of what she calls \"combustible tobacco\" within a decade,\n\nTobacco companies are likely to dominate the e-cigarette market, Herzog says, because of their financial strength and longstanding relationships with retailers.\n\nRisks, benefits debated\n\nPublic health experts disagree about the risks and benefits of e-cigarettes.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health issued a warning last month urging people to avoid e-cigarettes because of their health risks.\n\nThe American Cancer Society has expressed concerns about the safety of e-cigarettes in light of a new study, published in January in The New England Journal of Medicine, that found e-cigarettes produce high levels of formaldehyde, which causes cancer.\n\nNicotine can be especially harmful to children and pregnant women, says Brian King of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"It's not harmless water vapor,\" King says. \"Clean air should be the standard, whether that's air free from secondhand smoke or the aerosol from an e-cigarette product.\"\n\nOther public health advocates say e-cigarettes have the potential to help smokers quit. Although there is no long-term data to show their effectiveness, e-cigarettes seem to work at least as well as other nicotine replacement products such as patches and gum, says Thomas Glynn, a consulting professor in cancer prevention at Stanford University.\n\n\"The scientific evidence is still pretty sparse,\" Glynn says. \"There are so many kinds of e-cigs, it's difficult to make any kind of statement about them.\" Still, he says, \"Some people – although probably not the revolutionary number that the e-cig enthusiasts predict – will stop smoking because of them.\"\n\nA December review by The Cochrane Collaborative, an independent organization that analyzes health research, found evidence from two studies that e-cigarettes can help smokers quit for at least six months, but it described the quality of the evidence as low because it was based on only two clinical trials.\n\nTo Glynn, it would be a shame to tax or regulate e-cigarettes out of existence if they have the potential to help people quit smoking. While nicotine is harmful, it's less dangerous than conventional tobacco, which kills more than 480,000 Americans a year.\n\nHe says, \"We should be focusing all of our efforts on helping the nation's 42 million cigarette smokers, and youth who may start using cigarettes, to stop or not start at all.\"\n\nPertschuk, the former president of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, says states don't need to wait for more evidence to regulate e-cigarettes like tobacco.\n\n\"When we started really fighting the tobacco industry on smoke-free air in the mid-1980s, it was an incredibly hard fight. I believe we had less evidence about secondhand smoke then than we do today about e-cigs,\" Pertschuk says. \"One of the things the tobacco industry did 30 years ago was confuse the science. They found out that confusion was more effective than outright denial.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/08/13/teen-vaping-fda-weighs-ban-flavored-e-cigarette-liquid/890218002/", "title": "Teen vaping: FDA weighs ban on flavored e-cigarette liquid", "text": "Jayne O'Donnell, Ken Alltucker and Josephine Chu, USA TODAY\n\nTeen vaping is at the tipping point before possible epidemic levels, federal officials and public health advocates agree, but they're feuding over how fast and far to go to rein in the booming electronic cigarette industry.\n\nSome of the health groups that sued the Food and Drug Administration for delaying regulation of vape products by four years charged last week that the agency let several new devices similar to the youth-favored Juul hit the market without approval.\n\nCompanies \"have introduced new products at an alarming pace in total defiance of law, with no apparent concern for FDA enforcement,” the groups wrote.\n\nMore than 2 million middle school, high school and college teens use these battery-powered devices to heat liquid-based nicotine into an inhalable vapor. E-cigarettes were by far the most popular tobacco product among teens: Nearly 12 percent of high school students and 3 percent of middle school students used the device in the past 30 days, according to the 2017 National Youth Tobacco Survey released in June.\n\nThat puts hundreds of thousands of them at \"exceedingly high\" risk of developing nicotine addictions, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told USA TODAY. The nicotine, he said, \"can rewire an adolescent’s brain.\"\n\nThe agency has hardly ignored the issue. It is reviewing more than a half million public comments as it mulls whether to restrict or even ban flavors in the liquid and is investigating youth marketing by Juul, which attracts young vapers with its nicotine-packed products, easily hidden USB size and alluring social media presence.\n\nSan Francisco-based Juul said it has worked to keep its products away from minors and has taken action against online retailers that sold devices to underage vapers.\n\nThis month, the FDA asked four e-cigarette companies for information about the appeal of their products to youths and said it could take enforcement action against the companies based on what it learns.\n\nIn mid-September, the FDA will launch a vaping prevention campaign targeting 10 million youths who vape or are open to trying it, Gottlieb said. It will continue enforcement against retailers that sell to minors.\n\n\"We are very concerned that we could be addicting a whole generation of young people,\" Gottlieb said. \"We only have a narrow window of opportunity to address it.\"\n\nInstead of committing to regulate flavor, the FDA solicited more research on flavor's role. Robin Koval, CEO of the anti-tobacco group Truth Initiative, said there is ample evidence that flavors attract teens.\n\n\"They understand the need for rapid response,\" Koval said. \"Nevertheless, the (rulemaking approach) doesn't obligate them to any timetable or even to act.\"\n\nLast year, the FDA delayed until 2022 the requirement that vaping products go through a rigorous approval process – filing a pre-market tobacco application – to remain on the market. Gottlieb said that will be a challenge for some to meet, so they \"better start now.\"\n\nAlternatives to cigarettes?\n\nE-cigarettes are marketed as alternatives to traditional cigarettes because they can quell smokers' urges for nicotine without cancer-causing tobacco.\n\nFederal health officials and other health experts said there's ample cause for concern about young people newly lured to nicotine and chemicals found in vaping juice. Vaping has not only usurped smoking tobacco among those under 20, it came along as youth smoking rates were declining and threatens to erase the health benefits from the gains.\n\nYoung adults who use e-cigarettes are more than four times as likely to begin smoking tobacco cigarettes within 18 months as their peers who do not vape, according to a study in December 2017 by the University of Pittsburgh Schools of the Health Sciences published in The American Journal of Medicine.\n\nTeen and 20-something vapers interviewed described moving back and forth between vaping and smoking, sometimes simply because the battery on their device was dead and cigarettes were available. When heavy drinking was involved, it could be whatever was handy.\n\nThere's been a rapid increase in the number of kids caught vaping over the past school year, said Brian Maslowski, an alcohol, tobacco or other drugs instructor for the Fairfax County Public Schools in Northern Virginia. He attributed the trend to the popularity of Juul among high school students.\n\n“It has exploded this past year,” he said.\n\nSome kids have vaped in classrooms. Others got caught in bathrooms. In fact, there's a whole genre of Twitter memes about bathroom vaping.\n\n\"This isn't tolerable from a public health standpoint,\" Gottlieb said.\n\n'Tingles for a couple seconds'\n\nSmoke-filled rooms are gone in Washington, but a haze rose over Georgetown University's library during the spring semester. Across town at Catholic University, the vapers lined up in the back of large seminar halls to sneak hits. At George Washington University, even those who didn't own the trendy Juuls often took a few hits off friends at parties.\n\nInhaling the flavored vapor often starts as a lark before it becomes a habit or an addiction. It provides a \"quick little head rush that is stronger than smoking a cigarette,\" said Emma Clary, a George Washington University sophomore who started vaping after a former boyfriend gave her a Juul as a gift.\n\n\"It's not like you lose control, but you feel a sort of a release in your body and tingles for a couple seconds,\" Clary said. \"It's a de-stressor – almost like a break.\"\n\nWhether they start because it satisfies an oral fixation, as consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow said, or a way to self-medicate for stress, as child psychologist Melissa Sporn suggested, harried young people increasingly turn to vaping.\n\n\"Let’s just say it’s a draw – no pun intended – to want to put things in your mouth and draw,\" said Yarrow, author of \"Decoding the New Consumer Mind.\" \"You thought that was only during infancy? It comes back during that initial period of separation from parents.\"\n\nOne pod, which can last a half day to more than two, has the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes and runs $4 to $5.\n\n\"It’s an expensive addiction,\" Clary said. \"I didn’t work this past school year, so I would go through phases where I'd say, 'I'm not going to Juul for the next month,' and then I'd be ready to splurge on Juul pods.\"\n\nSporn, who practices in Fairfax County, said some parents refer their teenagers to her when they learn about their vaping or, more often, teens who are patients will disclose it.\n\nHer discussions are \"looking at what’s going on that they are self-medicating,\" Sporn said. Usually, she said, it's because they are anxious or depressed, and \"it’s a numbing of those feelings.\"\n\nThat starts a dependence on a substance at a vulnerable age.\n\n“Without having any exposure to nicotine before, they are now getting a little buzz,” said Maslowski of Fairfax County schools.\n\nOne girl tried to quit cold turkey from vaping up to five times a day before a family vacation and wound up moody, with the shakes and unable to sleep, Sporn said.\n\nThe buzz factor\n\nCatholic University student Mike Venditti started vaping at the end of high school as a healthier alternative to the chewing tobacco and cigars he was using. More than two years later, he said he notices \"most of the kids now just got into it because of the buzz.\" He described it as the same feeling you get when you bend over quickly and the blood rushes to your head.\n\nAlthough some vapers described headaches and other withdrawal symptoms, Venditti said he generally just vapes in his house and doesn't \"need it\" in class.\n\nOtherwise, he vapes \"where kids are hanging out, mainly in the quads,\" he said. \"It's more of a social thing.\"\n\nKevin Kee, 22, took up vaping to give up smoking when he was starting college but found himself going back to smoking again when he noticed the Juul was “more ingrained in my life than cigarettes ever were.”\n\n“With the Juul, you can vape anywhere, 24/7. I went through pods way quicker – I could go through a pod in one day,\" Kee said. \"My tolerance was higher, and I didn’t want that kind of life coming out of college.”\n\nSpencer Re of Napa Valley, California, has been vaping for the past five years – since his senior year of high school when a friend gave him a vape with very little nicotine and watermelon-flavored \"e-juice.\"\n\nThat led him to try smoking cigarettes in college, he said.\n\n'\"I was more just looking for new experiences in college, and someone offered me a cigarette, so I tried one,\" Re said. \"But I think I was more likely to have taken the cigarette, because I vaped.”\n\nCigarettes eventually “completely replaced vaping,\" until he stopped smoking in early 2016 – with the help of vaping.\n\nEven though he smoked, Re said he can't stand the taste of tobacco and cream flavors, so he vaped only fruity flavors.\n\nRe's favorite flavors might help explain why health advocates support banning kid-friendly ones, such as Juul's fruit medley and mango. Kids are unlikely to like – if they even recognize – names such as \"Creme Brulee,\" the thinking goes.\n\nIn a statement, Juul CEO Kevin Burns said restricting flavors “will negatively impact current adult smokers” who want to switch from smoking to vaping. He said the company would support “reasonable regulation” to restrict advertising and the naming of flavors such as cotton candy and gummy bear that target children.\n\nUsers such as Re said they doubt kids are drawn to vaping by fruity flavors\n\n\"I think that (flavoring) really misses the mark of children wanting to try nicotine – forbidden substances and the little bit of taboo that comes with it,\" he said.\n\nKee said he thinks people who vape to quit smoking are a minority and most people \"vape just to vape.\" Out of college and working, he's given up cigarettes and vaping but fears a flavor ban would really hurt others.\n\n\"It’s become so ingrained in our culture that banning flavored nicotine would be like the prohibition,\" he said.\n\nWeighing risk, benefit\n\nAt the FDA, Gottlieb is tasked with balancing the benefit to public health of flavored vape liquid enticing adults to quit smoking against the likelihood that a young person who has never smoked will become hooked. If it were, say, a five-adult-to-one-child ratio, Gottlieb said that probably wouldn't be acceptable.\n\nMany of the more than 500,000 commenters to FDA about flavored tobacco and e-cigarettes would disagree. James Cherrette of Illinois is one of them.\n\n“I started smoking when I was 12 years old, and guess what … it wasn’t because Marlboro had a fresh fruity flavor,” he scoffed.\n\nBut research suggests that flavors are pivotal for a large percentage of teen and younger vapers.\n\nThat helps explain why Juul, which has a $3 billion company valuation and sweeping appeal, has become so ingrained in social media and youth culture that \"Juuling\" became a verb. Kee said he doesn't even think of Juuling as vaping, as it's more concentrated, trendy and easier to use.\n\n\"It's a very convenient way to get a nicotine high anywhere you are,\" he said.\n\nThe Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids and other groups urged the FDA in a letter Tuesday \"to take quick and aggressive action to enforce the law before one or more of these products become the next Juul phenomenon among our nation’s youth.\"\n\nAltria, the company formerly known as Phillip Morris, said its MarkTen e-cigarettes were on the market before August 2016 when the FDA's rules changed, but the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids said marketing materials suggest otherwise.\n\n\"Companies should know that the FDA is watching, and we will take swift action wherever appropriate,\" Gottlieb said in response to the letter.\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed at U.S. District Court in San Francisco by Juul users alleged that the vaping giant used a two-pronged approach to target adult smokers and teens.\n\nOne San Diego teen said she was introduced to Juul by eighth-grade classmates. When her device broke last November, she obtained a warranty replacement through Juul’s website even though she was only 14, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Juul targeted youth and nonsmokers through ads and “social media blitzes” using “alluring imagery.” Adult smokers were wooed with the promise of a lower or equal amount of nicotine compared with a cigarette even though the product is designed to be more potent and addictive than cigarettes, the lawsuit says.\n\n“On a puff-for-puff basis, this was designed to be more powerful than the gold standard – the cigarette,” said Esfand Nafisi, a San Francisco Bay Area attorney representing Juul users. “That potency was either not disclosed or misrepresented continuously from the time of the company’s inception.”\n\nIn response to the San Francisco lawsuit and other civil lawsuits, Juul said it does not believe the cases have merit and will defend itself against them vigorously.\n\nAshley Gould, Juul's chief administrative officer, said the company has sent cease-and-desist letters to online retailers that resell its products and target minors. She noted that the company teamed with Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller to keep vaping products out of the hands of children.\n\nAlex Bosman, who works at House of Vape in Vienna, Virginia, said Juul’s sleek design and ease of use are powerful lures for young vapers. A community of users share their vaping experience with others on social media sites such as Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter.\n\nIn that sense, Juul customers and influential social media users have become the company's biggest allies.\n\n“I am not going to say Juul specifically targeted kids with their marketing,” Bosman said. “It was kind of an organic style of marketing that happened.\"\n\nJames Xu, owner of Avail, one of the largest vaping companies in the world, started the business when he saw how e-cigarettes helped his wife kick her smoking habit. Xu, who owns other businesses such as home goods retailer Plow and Hearth, said vaping doesn't \"speak to me\" like his other companies, \"but I'm not ready to quit anytime soon because every day, I hear those moving stories touching people’s lives.\"\n\nHe's going to keep up the \"fight for flavors\" with the Global Vapor Standards Association run out of his Richmond, Virginia, headquarters where he makes about 100 flavors.\n\n\"The main reason people are able to switch away from tobacco is because of the flavors offered to them,\" Xu said. \"If nobody uses it, why bother?\"\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/05/e-cigarette-electronic-cigarette-cdc-teen-smoking-editorials-debates/26950819/", "title": "Butter Crunch e-cigarettes? Who are you really targeting? Our view", "text": "The Editorial Board\n\nUSATODAY\n\nJust when it looks like the battle against teen smoking might be headed for victory, along comes a potent and popular new threat — electronic cigarettes — to raise doubts.\n\nFirst, the good news. Smoking among high school students hit a historic low last year: 9.2% of high school students used cigarettes, down from a peak of 36% in 1997. This is a big deal because if you get out of high school without getting hooked, odds overwhelmingly are that you never will.\n\nMission accomplished? Not quite. Last year, 13.4% of high school students used e-cigarettes — three times the number in 2013 — making the device more popular than traditional smoking among teens, the federal government found in a national survey.\n\nPromoters of e-cigarettes — battery-operated inhalers that contain nicotine, the powerfully addictive substance in cigarettes — push the notion that teenagers are switching to a safer product. But no data exist to back that up, or to show whether these young e-cig users had smoked before.\n\nWhat is known about e-cigarettes is both troubling and familiar. The industry, which includes the three major tobacco companies as well as newcomers, is using its old tricks to market the devices and rewrite laws to their liking.\n\nWhile industry players repeat the mantra that e-cigarettes are only for adults, their marketing says the opposite. It includes the same sexy and rebellious images, celebrity users and pitches at sports and music events that helped addict generations of young smokers. E-cigarettes come in flavors such as Cherry Crush and Butter Crunch — not exactly the approach you'd expect to attract adults trying to quit.\n\nOf the 42 states that have passed laws banning sales to minors, about half adopted approaches that would make the industry happy. Those laws allow the industry to crow about opposing underage use while ensuring that e-cigarette use isn't subjected to the tough enforcement, stiff penalties, high taxes and smoking bans that apply to tobacco products. In 2013, then-Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee vetoed one such law, writing, \"Electronic cigarette laws should mirror tobacco laws, not circumvent them.\" Too bad other governors haven't followed.\n\nAnd with e-cigarettes all over the Internet, underage users find they are only a click away.\n\nBecause the devices are so new, scientists don't fully understand how addictive they are. But as the industry \"figures out the engineering, the products are going to get better at delivering a reliable amount of nicotine that will be optimally reinforcing to the user,\" says Eric Donny, director of the Center for the Evaluation of Nicotine in Cigarettes at the University of Pittsburgh. In cigarettes, that dose was enough to hook millions of users even after smokers knew the habit was deadly.\n\nThe worst response would be to let the e-cigarette industry set the agenda, which increasingly appears to be the case.\n\nThe best? More research to determine whether e-cigarettes can help smokers quit, whether they carry long-term risks, and how addictive they are. And strict laws to protect children before the nation finds a new generation duped into craving a potentially dangerous product.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

San Francisco-based e-cigarette company Juul, which rents city property that would fall under the ban, has contributed $50,000 to an effort to put a vaping initiative on the November ballot.\n\n'Intolerable':FDA proposes e-cigarette sale restrictions to curb teen vaping\n\nThe company has said in multiple statements that staff have deterred youth from purchasing its products by deactivating its Instagram account and improving its online age-verification process. Juul spokesman Ted Kwong said e-cigarettes, which city officials seek to ban, are a healthier alternative for adults who smoke tobacco.\n\n“But the prohibition of vapor products for all adults in San Francisco will not effectively address underage use and will leave cigarettes on shelves as the only choice for adult smokers, even though they kill 40,000 Californians every year,” Kwong said.\n\nDoctors have warned that vaping can lead to smoking cigarettes and cite health risks to developing brains.

Andrew Cuomo's 2020 budget tackles things that localities have tried, and failed, to make stick in the face of Big Tobacco.\n\nHere's what the governor's budget plan would mean:\n\nNo more yummy strawberry vape juice, or other teen-centric flavors or product names.\n\nNo more big store display walls of bright-colored cigarette boxes and sleek e-cig pens and pods.\n\nNo coupons to get deals on deadly tobacco products.\n\nNo more tobacco for sale in any pharmacy.\n\nA statewide minimum age of 21 to buy cigarettes, up from 18.\n\nNew licensing for e-cigarette vendors, similar to what tobacco sellers need, and an added 20 percent tax on vape sales.\n\nSome of these things have already been legislated at the local level:\n\nRockland enacted a law that raised the age for purchasing tobacco to 21 in April; Westchester passed a similar law in June.\n\nRockland became the first county in the state to ban the sale of tobacco and e-cigarette products in pharmacies back in 2017; other counties have followed. Over the years, though, many pharmacists have come to their own conclusion that selling carcinogens was not good for their health-care business model.\n\nThe state will likely have more success in making certain laws stick, because New York has more muscle and money to fight any legal challenges from tobacco companies than small towns and villages.\n\nThat's how it played out in little Village of Haverstraw. Back in 2012, the village enacted a ban on those big displays of cigarettes at stores. It was the first such law in the nation. But Big Tobacco and the convenience store lobby sued, arguing that banning tobacco products from public sight violated their freedom of speech. Haverstraw dropped the law to avoid costly litigation. \"We are a good candidate in their eyes because they are big bullies coming out against little guys,\" Haverstraw Mayor Michael Kohut said back then. \"I believe in the intent of the law, but I'm not going to drive us to the brink of bankruptcy to defend this.\"\n\nSTATE OF HEALTH CARE: What to expect in 2019\n\nVIEW: Cuomo backs recreational marijuana, but at what cost?\n\nMARIJUANA IN NEW YORK: Here's how Cuomo plans to legalize it, tax it\n\nStill, small places can spark big policy changes, said Denise Hogan, POW'R Against Tobacco's Rockland representative. She pointed to a 2012 law, the \"Rockland County Multiple Dwelling Smoking Policy Act,\" which mandates that apartment complexes enact a policy that lets residents know where smoking is, and isn't, allowed. Soon after Rockland's law came out, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg pushed through a similar law for NYC.\n\nThe state proposal would mandate a license for retailers to sell e-cigarette products, similar to the licenses they need to sell traditional tobacco products. But local governments are embarking on their own licenses to ensure where and how vaping products are sold, Hogan said. They are nicotine delivery systems, after all, and more teens are using them than actually smoking.\n\nLocal licenses for retail tobacco and vape sales accomplish different goals than a state licensing system. For example, tiny Dolgeville, a village in Herkimer County, just passed its own tobacco sale licensing regulations that restricts where retailers can be located, bans price promotions, like coupons, for tobacco or vape products and bans specialty vape and hookah shops in the village limits.\n\nRockland legislators are considering similar legislation, Hogan said. \"This decreases the number of retailers,\" Hogan said, \"and puts them under the eye of the county.\" The licensing would allow a community to set limits on the location, number and type of tobacco retailers.\n\nBedford enacted a law last May that restricted the sale of electronic nicotine delivery systems to a special business zone. A lawsuit aiming to overturn the ban was filed last month.\n\nNew Castle passed a law in 2017 that limits vape shop locations to at least 2,000 feet from a school's property and at least 500 feet from a park, playground, library or religious institution.\n\nHogan pointed to Rockland's history of curbing the convenience of tobacco use. In 2007, for example, the county was among the first to ban smoking in vehicles with minors aboard. That hard works shows in the statistics: Rockland has the lowest prevalence of adults who smoke in New York.\n\nTobacco sale restrictions on the state and local level likely won't dent the saturation of nicotine products for sale. \"There's more tobacco retailers than there are Starbucks in New York state,\" Hogan said.\n\n\"Fifty-five years ago, the Surgeon General said tobacco was bad for you,\" Hogan, a lung cancer survivor, said. \"Kids who would never had smoked a cigarette are vaping now. Vaping is smoking. It's nicotine.\"\n\nTobacco-related illnesses prematurely kill more than 28,000 New Yorkers a year, according to the state Department of Health, more people than alcohol, AIDS, car crashes, illegal drugs, murders and suicides combined.\n\n\"New York has the opportunity to save lives, save money, and become the first state in the nation to create a tobacco-free generation,\" states the New York Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Book.

About 18% of the Hawaii teens and 12% of the Connecticut high school students had used e-cigarettes in the past month. Both studies were done in 2013.\n\nThose rates are much higher than the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found 4.5% of high schoolers and 1.1% of middle schoolers had used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days in 2013.\n\nAuthors of the Hawaii study, published online Monday in Pediatrics, note that e-cigarette use has grown exponentially among kids, doubling every year since 2009. Sales of e-cigarettes in the USA were $11.7 billion in 2013, according to a January report in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Connecticut study was published Tuesday in Nicotine and Tobacco Research.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has proposed regulating e-cigarettes and other tobacco products, but it has not issued a final rule. The proposed rule would ban sale of e-cigarettes to people under age 18. Manufacturers of e-cigarettes would have to register any new products with the FDA.\n\nAlthough 40 states prohibit e-cigarette sales to minors, 16 million kids under age 18 live in states where they can buy e-cigarettes legally, according to a report released Thursday by the CDC.\n\nE-cigarettes resemble cigarettes but contain no tobacco. They heat a liquid into a vapor that's inhaled. The liquid contains nicotine as well as chemicals and flavorings such as chocolate, bubble gum and mango.\n\nThe Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association, an e-cigarette industry group, says it opposes marketing to minors and supports a ban on sales of e-cigarettes to people under 18. The association began a program this year that urges retailers to require proof of age before selling to anyone and to display signs saying they don't sell to minors.\n\nManufacturers say e-cigarettes are a substitute for tobacco and can help adult smokers quit.\n\nBut authors of the Hawaii study note that e-cigarettes are marketed in places that are popular with teens, such as shopping malls and movie theaters. Many teens who use e-cigarettes have never tried conventional cigarettes, the new studies show.\n\n\"There's no question that e-cigarettes are a gateway to smoking,\" says long-time tobacco researcher Stanton Glantz, a professor at the University of California-San Diego not involved in the new research.\n\nPeter Hamm, a spokesman for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, says the FDA should quickly put its proposed regulations in place. \"We can't afford more delays that buy the tobacco industry time to continue targeting kids with a new generation of products,\" Hamm says.\n\nTwo-thirds of the teens in the Hawaii survey saw e-cigarettes as healthier than traditional cigarettes, which may explain why more of them had experimented with e-cigarettes than other drugs. About 47% of the Hawaii teens had tried alcohol, 18% had tried marijuana and 15% had tried conventional cigarettes, according to the study.\n\nStudies show fewer kids today are using conventional tobacco.\n\nConventional cigarette use among teens has been cut in half since 2000, falling from 28% of high-school students in 2000 to 12.7% of high schoolers in 2013, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/09/14/trump-proposal-ban-vaping-flavors-amid-lung-illness-limited-impact-experts-say/2309607001/", "title": "Trump's proposed ban on vape flavors may not stop teens from ...", "text": "President Trump's proposed ban of electronic cigarettes with anything but a tobacco flavor could kill a big part of the vape store business, but it may have a limited effect on curbing use by young people who can already flavor their own cartridges with readily available and attractive dessert tastes, industry experts say.\n\nTrump's move came after new data showed teen vaping increased even as the availability of more kid-friendly flavors decreased. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb last year proposed restricting flavored e-liquids to vape stores that are age-restricted, but Trump's move would go much further.\n\nThe announcement came amid an outcry over the mounting death toll and hundreds of serious lung illnesses linked to vaping. Nearly all of the now-public cases involved young men who vaped both nicotine and THC oil.\n\nOn Sunday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a ban on the sale of flavored electronic cigarettes in the state through an emergency executive action.\n\nPick up a joint instead:Vaping illnesses highlight flawed marijuana regulations\n\nGottlieb told USA TODAY on Thursday that the deaths and illnesses and teen vaping concerns have been \"conflated\" and calls them \"separate actions and separate public health concerns.\" On CNBC Monday, Gottlieb called for a \"federal reckoning\" and regulation of cannabis because of its link to most of the reported lung illnesses and deaths.\n\nThe proposed flavored vape ban, he said, is an \"eminently reasonable step to take\" given that the logical alternative would have been banning all e-cigarettes because of the rising use by teens. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said this week that new data show about a quarter of high school teens vaped in the past 30 days, up from 20% from the year before.\n\nAs for whether companies could still sell separate flavors, Gottlieb said, \"if they‘re just selling a flavor, I think they might be able to.\"\n\nThe FDA declined to comment, saying only that \"the FDA plans to share more on the specific details of the plan and its implementation in the coming weeks,\" spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said.\n\nKyle Doerfler, owner of Liquid Nicotine Wholesalers in Phoenix, says he has been discussing the proposed ban with FDA officials in recent weeks and plans to meet with them in the next month or so. He says the focus is on what's sold in stores, and the agency understands the products can be separated into the flavorings and nicotine liquid, which is widely available but seldom used alone.\n\nDoerfler started his company in 2012 as a wholesale business selling flavored e-liquids with nicotine, as well as separate flavorings and unflavored e-liquid. He now sells flavors and e-liquids without nicotine as well and has started selling to individuals using an age verification system in addition to the wholesales sales.\n\n\"(The FDA's) stance is they’re not regulating the manufacturing sector or the ingredients,\" Doerfler said. \"That's not being looked at right now, but that can change at any time.\"\n\nThe FDA regulates nicotine, but industry officials say they don't believe it has authority over flavorings that can be added separately. Liquid Nicotine Wholesalers will sell customers banana split or apple pie flavoring they can vape with unflavored nicotine or alone if they just want a good taste and the feeling of smoking after years of cigarettes, Doerfler said.\n\nThe flavors can be tasted more easily the less nicotine the liquid has, says Jennifer Piera, co-owner of the Vaporfi vape stores in Baltimore and Alexandria, Virginia. Many customers simply continue vaping because they like the taste and it's hard to stop even when the nicotine is at a very low level.\n\n\"The habit is a big part of why people smoke,\" said Piera, who hasn't smoked and has vaped only in the 15 months since she opened her stores. \"It's something to play with in my hands.\"\n\nWhile vape industry officials warned it would kill a large and important industry that helps people quit the more dangerous habit of smoking, many public health advocates heralded Trump's announcement.\n\n\"For too long, e-cigarette companies have been given the ability to target our nation’s children with candy-flavored, nicotine-loaded products that are addicting a new generation and threatening decades of progress in reducing youth tobacco use,\" Kaiser Permanente CEO Bernard Tyson said.\n\nVaping lung illness:What we know about the recent spate of cases and deaths\n\nYoung people now use a variety of store-bought, homemade or modified devices to vape, and they inhale substances including dealer-bought THC oil that has been linked to most of the recent publicized hospitalizations. That makes industry officials and vaping proponents skeptical the ban will have much effect.\n\n\"Are we not to learn anything from the current THC hash oil acute lung illness situation?\" asked Jeff Stier, a senior fellow and tobacco harm reduction advocate at the free market Consumer Choice Center. \"We don't want consumers adding stuff to their e-cigs. And we don't want more sophisticated black-market folks doing it.\"\n\nDoerfler says the anti-vaping rhetoric is \"going crazy.\"\n\n\"We went from being heroes to villains in the last couple years,\" Doerfler said. \"I used to have pride in the fact I owned an e-cigarette company.\"\n\nIf you or family members are struggling with issues mentioned in this story and you would like to connect with others online, join USA TODAY’s \"I Survived It\" Facebook support group.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/14"}]}

Doug Ducey says he got tired of waiting for federal authorities to fill in the holes.\n\nCrews at his direction started stacking shipping containers along portions of the border in August. Now the Bureau of Reclamation is asking the state to remove them – a request that Ducey’s office calls “unacceptable.”\n\nMeanwhile, Arizona is starting to place shipping containers along another section of the border.\n\nHere’s what we know about what’s happening, and a look at the bigger picture.\n\nStacked shipping containers are filling four border gaps so far\n\nDucey, a Republican, issued an executive order in August telling the state’s Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to use shipping containers to fill in gaps along the border. The first project: closing a 1,000-foot gap near Yuma, Arizona.\n\n“Arizona has had enough,” he said at the time. “We can’t wait any longer.”\n\nThe 8,800-pound, 9-by-40-feet containers stand about 22 feet tall when stacked, welded together and topped with four feet of razor wire, the governor’s office said, while border fencing built during the Trump administration is about 30 feet high.\n\nShortly after the project began, two shipping containers toppled. A Univision reporter who shared photos of the fallen containers said contractors in the area had told her strong winds were to blame. Ducey’s office said they suspected foul play. Since then, no similar incidents have been reported, spokesman CJ Karamargin said.\n\nBy late August, 11 days after the first shipping container project began, officials announced that 130 stacked shipping containers were filling four gaps and covering more than two-thirds of a mile along the border in Arizona’s Yuma County.\n\nThat effort, Karamargin said, cost $13 million.\n\nThis aerial photograph taken from a CBP helicopter on September 28 shows the US-Mexico border fence stopping at a mountainside near Welton, Arizona. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nA federal agency says their placement is illegal and calls it trespassing\n\nConstructing a bigger border wall was one of former President Trump’s signature priorities, and among the initiatives most criticized by his opponents. President Biden swiftly halted border wall construction once he took office.\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security has said it plans to close small gaps in the wall. And in July, the Biden administration announced a plan to fill some gaps in the border wall near Yuma.\n\nThis photo from May shows a gap along the border wall in Yuma, Arizona. This gap is one of four the state's governor filled with shipping containers in August. US Customs and Border Protection has said it plans to fill the gaps with its own project starting next year. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation cited those plans in a letter sent to Arizona officials earlier this month. The letter, obtained by CNN affiliate KYMA, asks the state to remove most of the shipping containers to make way for US Customs and Border Protection’s plans to fill in the gaps.\n\nThe letter says 80 containers were placed on Bureau of Reclamation land near the Morelos Dam and 42 were placed on Bureau of Reclamation rights of way on the Cocopah Indian Tribe’s West Reservation.\n\n“The unauthorized placement of those containers constitutes a violation of federal law and is a trespass against the United States,” said the letter from Jacklynn L. Gould, a Bureau of Reclamation regional director.\n\nGould asked Arizona officials to remove the containers and “work with Reclamation, in consultation with the Cocopah Indian Tribe, so that CBP’s project may proceed without unnecessary delay.”\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on the letter.\n\nDucey’s office says the shipping containers will stay – for now\n\nSo far Arizona isn’t backing down from the effort.\n\nThe state’s director of emergency management sent a stern response to the Bureau of Reclamation, disputing allegations that Arizona had trespassed on federal land and stating that the shipping containers would remain in place “until specific details regarding construction are provided.”\n\n“Since December 2021, numerous federal representatives have claimed that construction on the border would begin,” Allen Clark wrote. “However, to date, Arizona has not seen any action by the federal government to do so and was therefore required to take its own action.”\n\nKaramargin told CNN that state officials recently received a letter from CBP describing plans to use mesh fencing to fill the gaps, something he described as “completely unacceptable.”\n\n“From Gov. Ducey’s perspective, the idea that we would take down a temporary measure so that they can replace it with a less effective temporary measure in a nonstarter,” Karamargin said.\n\nMigrants are detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents on May 22 in Yuma, Arizona. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nA description of the project on CBP’s website states that construction will begin in early 2023, with plans to fill gaps “using a combination of barrier and mechanized bollard vehicle gates that allow for access to the riverside of the barrier.”\n\nThe fact that CBP construction isn’t slated to start until next year and the timing of the Bureau of Reclamation’s letter, he says, reveal how seriously federal officials are taking the situation at the border.\n\n“We managed to fill 3,800 feet of gap in Yuma in 11 days. … It took these guys six weeks to write a letter,” he said. “They don’t seem to have a sense of urgency about this.”\n\nUltimately, he said, Arizona wants a permanent solution to fill the gaps – an extension of the 30-foot-tall steel border barriers. And until that happens, he said, the state will continue its efforts.\n\nDucey announced the next phase of the shipping container project began this week, this time in Arizona’s Cochise County, with plans to use 2,770 containers to fill a 10.25-mile wall gap.\n\nThe cost of the project is about $95 million, Karamargin said, coming from a state border security fund.\n\nGOP governors have criticized Biden’s border policies and announced their own measures\n\nDucey has been Arizona’s governor since 2015.\n\nHe’s part of a vocal chorus of GOP governors – along with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – sharply criticizing the Biden administration’s border strategy.\n\nWith midterm elections looming, the criticism has intensified, along with these governors’ highly publicized efforts to take matters into their own hands – such as state-funded buses and flights transporting migrants north to other locations in the US. The White House has called these efforts political stunts.\n\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey, shown here in 2020, is among a group of GOP governors who've criticized the Biden administration's border policies and announced their own efforts to curb illegal immigration. Ross D. Franklin/Pool/AP\n\nAnd Arizona’s top federal prosecutor has mocked the state’s makeshift border wall.\n\n“We’re not dumping a bunch of shipping containers in the desert and calling it a wall to get cheap press,” US Attorney Gary Restaino wrote in an August tweet after a meeting between federal prosecutors and their Mexican counterparts. “It’s about developing comprehensive, data-driven strategies.”\n\nKaramargin says there was a clear reason for the governor to begin the shipping container initiative this year: a marked increase in migrants crossing the border.\n\n“None of this would be happening if the federal government took border security seriously. And clearly they are not,” Karamargin said.\n\nDoubling down on his effort, Ducey filed a lawsuit over control of land along the border this month, asking a federal judge to effectively block federal agencies’ efforts to regulate the shipping container project. Ducey argues a 60-foot-wide swath of land known as the Roosevelt Reservation should be under state control.\n\nThis aerial photo taken September 27 shows shipping containers filling a gap in the US-Mexico border wall in Yuma, Arizona. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nThe governor’s office cites numerous local officials praising the shipping container effort, and points to a Border Patrol official’s recent comment that having more gaps in the wall that migrants can cross through makes things more difficult for agents.\n\nAccording to CBP data, the agency’s Yuma sector has seen the largest increase in migrant encounters over the past year – more than 170%.\n\nIn the month after the shipping containers were placed, the number of migrant encounters in the sector increased around 5%, from 24,226 in August to 25,495 in September.\n\nThis isn’t the first time border wall efforts have faced federal opposition\n\nEfforts to erect border barriers have run afoul of federal authorities before.\n\nIn 2019 another federal body, the International Boundary and Water Commission, forced open a gate in a privately funded wall near the US-Mexico border, saying the group that built it didn’t follow proper permitting procedures.\n\nUltimately the commission filed a lawsuit, but construction was allowed to proceed.\n\nIn recent years we’ve seen numerous conflicts over border barrier construction, from lawsuits to political sparring.\n\nAnd as large numbers of migrants keep crossing, and debates rage over how to handle the situation, we’re likely to keep seeing them erupt.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

Doug Ducey has filed a lawsuit pushing back against federal agencies seeking to force removal of 130 shipping containers used as a makeshift wall at Arizona's border with Mexico.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court on Friday, asks a judge to allow the state to continue placing shipping containers at the border and to stop the federal government from intervening. It presents a more broad question, too, about state authority when it comes to border issues.\n\nIn the past two weeks, Ducey's administration and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation have sparred over whether Arizona had the legal authority to put the containers in gaps where the federal government, though having plans to build a barrier, had not yet done so.\n\n\"We're not going to remove anything,\" Ducey told The Arizona Republic in a Thursday interview.\n\nDucey's administration has no plans to remove the containers until a permanent solution is in place. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials have said construction is to begin in January on the gaps near Yuma, using \"temporary mesh fencing\" and vehicle gates.\n\n\"Why replace temporary barriers with more temporary barriers?\" Ducey said in a statement Friday, calling it \"just another example of the federal government bureaucracy and out-of-control spending. The border barrier works and we’re not going to delay the safety of our citizens any longer.”\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation sent a letter to state officials last week, claiming Ducey's containers violated federal law. This week, Allen Clark, director of the Arizona Division of Emergency Management with the state Department of Emergency and Military Affairs, rejected that claim in a letter of his own.\n\n“This is the Bureau of Reclamation, some bureaucrat, who writes a letter,\" Ducey said. \"That's not going to slow down what we're doing to protect the people of Arizona. We're gonna plug ahead every day as long as I am governor.”\n\nThe lawsuit escalates that back-and-forth, citing the influx of migrants and drugs at the border as evidence the federal government has not done enough, forcing Arizona to step in.\n\n\"The citizens of Arizona are experiencing an unprecedented crisis at the state’s southern border, caused in large part by the federal government’s complete abdication of responsibility with respect to immigration and national security policy,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nThe lawsuit names the U.S. Forest Service and its chief, Randy Moore; the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and its commissioner, Camille Calimlim Touton; and Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack as defendants. The Forest Service and Bureau of Reclamation have joint jurisdiction over the land on which containers were placed. The agencies did not comment on Ducey's lawsuit.\n\nWhile the focus of the lawsuit is the shipping containers, one of its six claims serves to test whether states can declare an invasion at the border, a legal theory GOP candidate for governor Kari Lake has made central to her bid for office.\n\nDucey, who has made border security a hallmark of his almost eight years in office, has not signaled any interest in making such a declaration, which would upend decades of court rulings that have maintained the federal government has the enforcement authority for immigration laws.\n\nAsked why he hadn't pursued a declaration of invasion, Ducey said, \"We've done everything possible to address the border situation.\"\n\nWhat to know: 'Border invasion' becomes talk of GOP candidates\n\nNor does he intend to bus asylum seekers to cities on the East Coast other than Washington, D.C., a practice condemned by immigrants' rights groups as a political ploy, but that Ducey has said takes the border crisis to President Joe Biden's doorstep.\n\nArizona has sent 2,260 migrants to the nation's capital on a total of 63 bus trips since the governor quietly unveiled the transportation program in May. The trips cost about $82,000 each, according to the state's contract, resulting in the bill to the state of over $5 million so far. The taxpayer-funded trips supplement similar work already being done by nonprofits that aid migrants.\n\nDecisions by Republican governors in Texas and Florida to move migrants to other places, like New York and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, were condemned by Democratic leaders there.\n\nSuch programs have emerged as a new front in the political battle over immigration policy and border security.\n\nReach reporter Stacey Barchenger at stacey.barchenger@arizonarepublic.com or 480-416-5669.

The result is a dramatic rise in human smuggling activity across southern Arizona over the past year, according to multiple federal and local law enforcement agencies in the state.\n\nThe Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, conducted numerous interviews with experts and reviewed dozens of court cases and agency releases tied to human smuggling attempts in southern Arizona.\n\nThey point not just to an increase in criminal activity but a reversal to more unusual, dangerous and risky smuggling tactics, including the use of stash houses, which have not been as prevalent in recent years.\n\nOnce again, Arizona is a top corridor for migrants and smugglers making their illegal journey into the United States.\n\nOn July 12, border agents were conducting surveillance at a known stash house in Douglas when they spotted a nervous driver in an SUV circle the home, then approach it through the alley several times.\n\nAgents followed the SUV to the parking lot of a mortuary, according to court records. They attempted to make a stop, but the driver told them he was carrying the bodies of two people who had tested positive for COVID-19 and urged them to back off.\n\nAfter noticing that the driver was using only latex gloves for protection, agents approached the vehicle and found six migrants in the back of the SUV. The six people were lying next to a dead body that was covered in a blanket, court records showed.\n\nThe driver told agents he worked for a mortuary and was transporting the body to Bisbee. He later admitted that he agreed to smuggle people in order to pay off his debt to the cartel in Agua Prieta after he was caught trying to smuggle drugs through the Douglas border crossing.\n\nOn Nov. 2, U.S. Border Patrol agents responded to a call from police in the border city of Nogales. Officers told agents they had received a call from a woman in Tucson whose brother was being held for money by smugglers at a motel located two blocks away from the Police Department in downtown Nogales.\n\nAt the motel, officers and agents found three suspected smugglers holding seven undocumented migrants inside a room as well as cameras to monitor the entrance to the room. They also found weapons, including knives and a double-sided ax.\n\nMigrants told agents one of the suspected smugglers had brandished several weapons and pointed a rifle at one of them, according to court records. The brother was able to send a Whatsapp message to his sister in Tucson asking for help before their phones were taken away.\n\nAgents detained the seven migrants and arrested two U.S. citizens and a man from Mexico in connection with the case. The three face smuggling charges in federal court in Tucson.\n\n\"We're not seeing anything new, but we are seeing a return to what I call the dark days in Arizona of human smuggling,\" said Scott Brown, the special agent in charge in Phoenix for U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, the federal agency that investigates smuggling and other cross-border crimes.\n\nThe uptick in human smuggling activity across the entire U.S.-Mexico border is driven in large part by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brown said.\n\nAt the Supreme Court:President Trump's war on illegal immigration takes on political overtone\n\nThe same is true for Arizona's 372-mile border with Mexico, he added. But the increase has been greater in two specific areas of the state.\n\nThe notorious West Desert in western Pima County, which encompasses the Tohono O'odham Nation, always has been a highly trafficked smuggling route. That deadly corridor is where most migrant remains are found each year. The medical examiner for southern Arizona said recoveries already topped 200 this year, reaching their highest level since 2010.\n\nOn the other side of the state, Cochise County, a rural area larger than Connecticut and once a relatively quiet section of the border, has undergone a drastic change.\n\nWhile physical barriers are going up along more than half of the county's 80-mile-long border with Mexico, law enforcement agencies report a greater number of encounters with undocumented migrants, as well as more dangerous situations.\n\nThe morning of Nov. 13, a Tucson man driving four migrants led several agencies on a high-speed chase across the San Pedro Valley. He stopped and let the migrants out during the pursuit before reaching Sierra Vista, about 15 miles north of the border.\n\nThe 53-year-old driver, Mark Anthony Provencio, then barricaded himself inside a Lowe's department store, forcing police to evacuate the building for more than an hour, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety.\n\nHe managed to escape to a nearby motel, where state troopers arrested him. Provencio now faces several state charges, with more expected.\n\n\"It's more frequent than not that we're dealing with some kind of human smuggling at least once a day in Cochise County. That's human, not drug (smuggling),\" Sheriff Mark Dannels said.\n\nSmuggling is no longer just a nighttime activity, he said, but is happening in the middle of the day. In some instances, his deputies have been injured while in pursuit, Dannels added, but they are careful not to endanger the surrounding community while chasing suspected smugglers.\n\n\"They always run. They have nothing to lose. They don't have to follow the rules. They don't have to worry about liability,\" he said.\n\nPandemic driving rise in smuggling\n\nBorder enforcement statistics published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Nov. 19 showed that the apprehensions of undocumented migrants at the Arizona-Mexico border in October reached a new peak this year.\n\nAgents detained 11,901 migrants last month in Arizona, a relatively low figure compared with historical trends. But it is a 30% increase over the previous month, and in the midst of a raging pandemic. The overwhelming majority of migrants, nearly nine in 10, are single adults.\n\nApprehensions have climbed rapidly since March, when the Trump administration implemented large-scale restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border to curb the spread of COVID-19. Those restrictions include a freeze on asylum processing and, under Title 42, the immediate expulsion of any migrant apprehended at the border.\n\nAs of March 21, the United States has expelled 266,367 migrants to Mexico or their home countries under an emergency order from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by way of Title 42 of the U.S. Code.\n\nFact check:Claim that voting noncitizens affected 2020 election outcome is unverified\n\nOctober had the largest numbers of expulsions borderwide to date, according to the CBP.\n\n\"You have a lot more people, a lot more desperate to get out of really hard conditions in Mexico, hard conditions for themselves, living conditions, public health conditions and economic conditions,\" said Javier Osorio, a researcher and expert on organized crime violence at the University of Arizona.\n\n\"Criminal organizations see those opportunities, and they're the ones moving people,\" he said. \"And the more demand you have, the more supply is going to be on the other side. It's, like, very simple economics at play.\"\n\nThe expulsions under Title 42 also are having other consequences. Osorio said that since migrants are quickly removed from the country, sometimes in as little as two hours, they are able to try again repeatedly.\n\nMark Morgan, the acting commissioner for Customs and Border Protection, said Nov. 19 that recidivism rates, meaning the number of migrants who try to cross the border illegally after they are apprehended, stood at 37% since the pandemic restrictions started.\n\nAdalberto Ramos runs a migrant shelter in the Mexican border city of Agua Prieta, across the border from Douglas. He said he sees anywhere from 10 to 20 migrants, mostly single adult men and women, returned each day to that city under Title 42.\n\n\"Right now, since the borders are closed, the ones taking advantage of COVID are human smugglers and organized crime. Why? Because they have to give their blessing to allow them to cross their territory,\" he said.\n\nHis shelter remains on lockdown to avoid the spread of COVID-19, with only six families still waiting for their chance to apply for asylum once restrictions are lifted. As a result, the shelter has been unable to take in or feed migrants returned under Title 42.\n\nRamos said they are working on information and hygiene kits for migrants. In the meantime, the pandemic restrictions will continue to force those migrants into the hands of smugglers, he said.\n\n\"Migrants are still arriving to Agua Prieta, but with the permission of organized crime,\" he said. \"The smuggler makes the arrangements. I'm not sure how they handle it, but I do know migrants are arriving and that they're crossing them through the mountains or the border wall.\"\n\nHis observations illustrate a major shift on migration patterns at the border. Last year's migrant surge dealt mainly with large groups of families willingly turning themselves in to border agents. Now, more migrants are looking to evade detection and are hiring smugglers who, in turn, have sought to exploit weaknesses in U.S. border enforcement.\n\nSmugglers exploiting wall construction\n\nOne of the areas that smugglers are exploiting is the ongoing construction of barriers at the border.\n\nWork crews have completed or are in the process of finishing about 235 miles of new 30-foot bollards. That's the equivalent of nearly two-thirds of the state's international boundary with Mexico.\n\n\"You’ll notice that there’s a lot of movement of the construction vehicles. There are segments of the previous wall that have been removed or are being replaced. And because of that, there are opportunities for a smuggler to either make an effort driving through or smuggling people through there,\" said Roy Villareal.\n\nVillareal is the chief patrol agent for Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, which covers Cochise, Santa Cruz and Pima counties. On Wednesday, the Border Patrol announced Villareal was temporarily reassigned to its headquarters in Washington, D.C., to help with strategic planning.\n\nConstruction crews may be inadvertently aiding smugglers because the access roads they built or widened to allow heavy machinery to reach construction sites are often used by the smugglers.\n\nThe Tucson Sector has documented numerous instances this year of smugglers disguising their vehicles as construction trucks or using temporary gaps where older barriers once stood to simply drive across the border.\n\nDuring one recent incident, on the evening of Oct. 29, Tucson Sector agents stopped a pickup truck on Geronimo Trail Road, several miles east of Douglas. The widened dirt road runs parallel to the border and leads to several construction sites where crews are replacing about 20 miles of permanent vehicle barriers with 30-foot bollards.\n\nAgents could see seven people packed into the cab. As they approached, the driver jumped out and ran south to Mexico. They found another 10 migrants stacked on top of each other in the truck bed, concealed under a fiberglass cap.\n\nJust two weeks earlier, on Oct. 15, agents had stopped a sedan a few miles away from that same location along Geronimo Trail Road. That time, they found 10 Mexican migrants inside, including three in the trunk of the car.\n\nTrump immigration policies:Biden might need years to reverse actions on DACA, family separations, asylum\n\nThe Border Patrol determined the sedan drove illegally into Arizona through a gap in construction at the border. The driver used wood boards to drive over excavated footings for the new wall, according to the Tucson Sector. All 10 people were detained and returned to Mexico under Title 42.\n\nDouglas Police Chief Kraig Fullen said border wall construction provides an opportunity for smugglers to blend into the community because a large number of the construction workers live, shop and eat there during the construction project.\n\n\"Some of the activity we're seeing may be pushed to make it in before the fence project is complete,\" he said.\n\nBorder Patrol officials regularly tout that the construction of access roads and physical barriers is part of a \"border wall system\" that also includes improved technology, such as sensors and lighting. Villareal said those tools will help agents detect any incursions and illegal activity at the border.\n\n\"When that wall goes up, my prediction is that we’re going to see a cessation in vehicle drive-throughs, high-speed pursuits through there,\" he said. \"It’s going to return to being somewhat of a quiet area once again.\"\n\nFullen remains a bit skeptical.\n\nHe said this will be the third or fourth version of a border wall built in the Douglas area over the past two decades. The barriers resulted in significant drops in traffic in Douglas, he said, but larger concerns about human and drug smuggling have persisted.\n\n\"Each version of the barrier has been met with a renewed level of ingenuity, and in my time it has been tunneled under, climbed over, cut through, driven over, flown over, catapulted over, tossed over, shot over,\" he said. \"The risk will continue to rise along with the height of the fence.\"\n\nLocal agencies seeing more smuggling\n\nLocal law enforcement agencies in Cochise County have reported increases in smuggling activity this year compared with the same period in 2019. They increasingly are pulled into combating the crime, even though investigating and prosecuting human smuggling falls under the purview of the federal government.\n\nSgt. Tim Williams is director of the Southeastern Arizona Border Region Enforcement team or SABRE, the Cochise County sheriff's task force dedicated to tracking and fighting criminal activity tied to its location on the border.\n\n\"We've seen a fairly large increase of the human smuggling since about March of this year,\" he said. \"We probably tripled in the numbers than we used to see in previous years.\"\n\nAs part of SABRE, Williams oversees a system of 1,000 remote motion-activated cameras placed strategically across various points throughout the Tucson Sector to monitor foot traffic at the border. Their work is in coordination with the Arizona Department of Public Safety's Border Strike Force.\n\nThis year, the remote cameras have detected nearly 10,000 undocumented migrants crossing the Arizona border illegally, according to data shared by the Sheriff's Office. That's significantly higher than the past two years combined.\n\nThe latest available monthly figures show big differences in migrant traffic over the past year. In October 2019, the cameras picked up 617 migrants crossing the border; this year, they detected 2,544 migrants during that same month. In September 2019, cameras picked up 398 migrants, compared with 2,192 in September 2020.\n\nDouglas police figures reflect a similar trend.\n\nFrom July to mid-November, the Police Department recorded the arrests of 180 undocumented migrants by Border Patrol agents inside city limits. By comparison, agents made a total of 18 migrant arrests during the same period in 2019, according to Officer Jamilette Barrios, Douglas police spokesperson.\n\nBoth departments, along with Sierra Vista police, have reported an uptick in calls to their jurisdictions involving undocumented migrants, from agency assists to help the Border Patrol to responding to reports of trespassing and other local crimes.\n\nMigrants placed in harm's way\n\nAs human smuggling activity rises in southern Arizona, smugglers endanger the lives of migrants. The criminal groups' turn to riskier routes and measures to avoid arrest has resulted in injuries and even deaths.\n\nHomeland Security Investigations said it has seen an uptick in Arizona of smuggler use of firearms, overloaded vehicles and an increase in flight from law enforcement, sometimes using stolen vehicles.\n\nThe Border Patrol recognizes that smugglers are quick to adapt to changing U.S. policies along the Southwestern border. One constant, according to Villareal, is their disregard for human life.\n\n\"I think the true core element of evilness are the smugglers,\" he said. \"They’re not concerned about the well-being of the people they’re smuggling.\"\n\nSo far in 2020, southern Arizona has recorded the recovery of 205 migrant remains, according to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner, which tracks migrant deaths in the Tucson Sector.\n\nThat makes 2020 the third deadliest year for migrants at the Arizona-Mexico border since the medical examiner began compiling the data in 2000. With a full month remaining in the year, it is within striking distance to exceed 2010's record of 222 bodies found in a single year.\n\nThe majority of recoveries were either skeletal remains or migrants who died from exposure to the elements, especially with this year's record-breaking heat.\n\nDr. Gregory Hess, the chief medical examiner, said migrants also die other ways while crossing.\n\n\"Almost every year, we'll get some folks that die being pursued by Border Patrol, or they lay down the spikes grip or something, and they roll over the vehicle to try to avoid apprehension,\" he said.\n\nOne such incident happened June 2, when a high-speed chase near the New Mexico state line, east of Douglas, ended with the deaths of a 44-year-old migrant and a 17-year-old suspected smuggler.\n\nThe minivan that the teenager was driving with four migrants inside rolled over multiple times to avoid tire deflation spikes that pursuing agents had laid out. The three other migrants suffered injuries. One of them was put on life support but survived, court records showed.\n\nOf the 205 migrant remains recovered so far this year, at least 11 of the people died from blunt force trauma or other non-exposure-related injuries, according to data provided by the medical examiner.\n\nThe most recent case is a 25-year-old migrant who fell Sept. 23 trying to climb the border wall near Douglas. He was taken to a hospital in Tucson, where he died a few weeks later.\n\nThese types of deaths will continue, Hess said.\n\n\"Regardless of what they do on the border, people are still going to find a way across,\" he said. \"They travel for miles and miles with the intent to come into the United States. They're going to. There is no such thing as an impassible barrier. So it's going to continue to occur as long as people continue to cross here.\"\n\nOsorio, the researcher and expert on organized crime violence, said that as it becomes more difficult to smuggle people and drugs across the border, criminal networks are trying to maximize resources.\n\nOne way is to increase the price to smuggle people across. Those costs had already been going up before the pandemic. They since have likely risen even more, Osorio said.\n\nThe other option is to smuggle larger groups to boost profits, which can help explain the proliferation of cases involving groups of migrants packed tightly into vehicles.\n\n\"You get more money through smuggling 20 to 30 people instead of one or two,\" Osorio said.\n\nPandemic impacting prosecutions\n\nHuman smuggling is a federal crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine. But given its fleeting nature, there are challenges to prosecuting smugglers. Chief among them is making an arrest.\n\nMany times, especially in incidents near the border, smugglers will seek safety by running or driving back into Mexico, abandoning migrants as necessary.\n\nOther times, they will lead agents and officers in dangerous pursuits through border communities, with speeds sometimes reaching as high as 136 miles per hour, according to court records describing a high-speed chase on Nov. 6. The driver had attempted to evade an immigration checkpoint near Elfrida, north of Douglas.\n\nHe crashed his pickup truck into a steep ravine. No major injuries were reported, but agents apprehended 15 undocumented migrants squeezed inside the truck. The driver now faces two felony smuggling charges.\n\nFederal prosecutors were able to charge him thanks to new protocols the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona developed in April in response to changes to the criminal system because of COVID-19.\n\n\"Immigration prosecution is one of my priorities and a necessary priority for our office because of our location on the Southwest border,\" Michael Bailey, the U.S. attorney for Arizona, told The Republic. \"But the virus has probably impacted smuggling prosecution more than anything else.\"\n\nThe issue stems from federal prosecutors' reliance on using material witnesses to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the suspected smuggler knew the people they were transporting were in the country illegally. Often, these witnesses are the migrants whom the defendant was allegedly smuggling.\n\nCourt orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Arizona limited the transportation of defendants and witnesses to courthouses in the state, dealing a potential blow to prosecutors.\n\nIn addition, pandemic restrictions reduced operations in federal courthouses nationwide.\n\nBrown, who oversees investigations into human smuggling at Homeland Security Investigations' six offices in Arizona, said those restrictions present additional challenges in going after suspected smugglers.\n\n\"That impedes our abilities at times to bring charges or pursue grand jury indictments. We've had to postpone some of those activities,\" he said.\n\nIn response to those challenges, Bailey said his team worked with the Border Patrol to establish new protocols ensuring that agents record any evidence to prove alleged smugglers' guilt, so that material witnesses aren't needed to testify in the courtroom.\n\n\"It could be something as straightforward as a confession, it could be the smugglers observed taking evasive action, it could be that the smuggler has individuals hidden in some way in the vehicle,\" Bailey said. \"All of those type of things are useful to prove the smugglers' knowledge of immigration status.\"\n\nUnder the new protocols, prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona have brought federal charges in 160 cases of suspected human smuggling.\n\nThe court has granted prosecutors the limited use of material witnesses, especially in cases with extraordinary circumstances, such as the three accused smugglers who earlier this month held seven migrants inside the motel room in Nogales.\n\nAll eyes on the incoming administration\n\nFor now, the big question on the minds of law enforcement and experts in human smuggling is what will happen in the coming months, especially with an incoming administration that has pledged to shift immigration and border enforcement priorities.\n\nBrown said his investigators will continue to build out smuggling networks at the border as part of an effort to go after the key decision-makers, rather than foot guides and their collaborators.\n\n\"Some of the regulations put in place as a result of the pandemic, Title 42 removals ... if that should be rescinded, should the pandemic go away, I'm not sure how that will shake out,\" he said. \"Because what we are seeing is that because of those fast turnarounds, we're getting more people that are making two, three, four attempts.\"\n\nAs courts reopen, more migrants making multiple attempts to cross the border after getting caught will spend time in jail on illegal reentry charges before getting sent back, possibly reducing recidivism rates, he said.\n\nOsorio said that deteriorating economic conditions in Mexico and Latin America spurred by the pandemic, along with existing poverty and violence concerns, are aligning to produce large waves of migrants who will attempt to reach the United States in the near future.\n\nWithout President Donald Trump's strong-hand tactics to pressure Mexico into stopping these waves of migrants before making it to their shared border, he added, it remains to be seen how incoming President Joe Biden and the Mexican government will respond.\n\n\"We know it's just a matter of time before we have a critical mass with people accumulating,\" he said.\n\nU.S. border officials are banking on the newly built border walls, once completed, to help stem the flow of drug and human smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nDannels, the Cochise County sheriff, said that if history is any indication, the challenges will remain throughout border communities like his.\n\n\"They're still going to find ways to get across,\" he said. \"They've already cut through the fence too. ... So again, it just tells me no matter what we put up there, there's going to be that challenge of intrusion.\"\n\nHave any news tips or story ideas about the U.S.-Mexico border?

How long do they have to comply? Who pays for the testing?\n\nThose are some of the questions that can be answered now that the federal government has released details on the vaccination requirement President Joe Biden announced in September for larger businesses.\n\nThe rules from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration also apply to state and local government workers, including teachers and school staff, in about half the states.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWho is covered?\n\nThe new requirements apply to businesses with at least 100 workers, although the Labor Department is taking feedback over the next month on whether smaller workplaces should be included.\n\nThe rules also apply to state and local government workers in 26 states, including teachers and school staff.\n\nThat’s because five states – Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey and New York – have OSHA-approved plans specifically for public employees.\n\nAnother 21 states include public employees in their workplace enforcement plans that are required to be at least as tough as OSHA’s. Those states are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.\n\nRelated: 17 million health care workers must be immunized by Jan. 4 under Biden's COVID-19 vaccine plan\n\nWhen do workers have to get vaccinated?\n\nWorkers must be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4, or be tested at least weekly for COVID-19. Employees who aren't vaccinated must also wear a face mask at work beginning on Dec. 5.\n\nCan an employer mandate vaccinations?\n\nBusinesses can be tougher than the rules require and can mandate workers get vaccinated, rather than giving them the option of regular testing.\n\nWho pays for the testing?\n\nThat's up to the employer to decide. The federal government is giving businesses the option of requiring unvaccinated workers to pay for the tests they must take at least once a week.\n\nThe justification is that vaccines are safe, free and the most effective way for workers to be protected from COVID-19 transmission at work.\n\nEmployers, however, may be required to pay for testing because of other laws or collective bargaining agreements.\n\nWhat about time off to get vaccinated?\n\nEmployers must provide paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated as well as to recover from any side effects that keep them from working.\n\nBackground: Workers face Jan. 4 deadline as Biden rolls out COVID-19 vaccine rules for large businesses\n\nDo the requirements include boosters?\n\nWorkers will not have to get boosters to be considered vaccinated under the requirements. The agency is following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of \"fully vaccinated,\" which is one shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or two shorts of Moderna's or Pfizer's.\n\nDoes having had COVID-19 count as being vaccinated?\n\nNo. There are no exemptions to vaccination requirements based on “natural immunity” or the presence of antibodies from a previous infection.\n\nWhat happens to a business that doesn't comply?\n\nOSHA's penalties start at up to $13,653 per violation. But the agency can fine a business ten times that amount for actions considered willful or repeated.\n\nHow will the rules be enforced?\n\nLabor Department officials said they expect the \"vast majority\" of workplaces to comply, as they do with other rules. And as with other requirements, OSHA will rely both on worker complaints and spot checks for enforcement.\n\nWho counts as an employee?\n\nPart-time employees are counted toward the 100-worker threshold to determine if a business must follow the rules, but contractors are not. Employees who work offsite, such as at a customer's home, are counted. Those who work at home are counted but the vaccination requirements would apply only to the employees who work in the office at least part time.\n\nCan workers be fired for not complying?\n\nYes. An employee’s refusal to comply with an employer’s policy on vaccination is generally not protected under federal law.\n\nWhat about workers who don’t want to be vaccinated for religious or other reasons?\n\nIf an employee asserts that religious beliefs or medical conditions prevent them from getting vaccinated, they may be entitled to a “reasonable accommodation” under civil rights laws. They may still, however, have to be regularly tested, unless a belief or condition qualifies them for another accommodation.\n\nHow long will the rules be in effect?\n\nBecause OSHA used an emergency procedure to create the rules, it bypassed the usual comment and rulemaking process. That process must now be completed within six months for the rules to become permanent. At any time, however, OSHA could determine that the pandemic has abated enough to lift the requirements.\n\nWill the rules be challenged in court?\n\nRepublican governors and attorneys general are expected to immediately sue OSHA to block the rules. Some private employers might as well. The agency will have to prove to the courts that the requirements are necessary to protect workers from grave danger.\n\nWhat's the administration's justification for the rules?\n\nThe administration estimates the requirements will save thousands of lives and prevent more than 250,000 hospitalizations during the six months after implementation.\n\nWhat do critics say?\n\nRepublicans have denounced the workplace requirement as federal overreach and a threat to individual liberty that will result in massive disruptions in the labor market.\n\nWhat will happen in states that have moved to block vaccination requirements?\n\nThe federal rules override state rules or local ordinances unless the federal requirements are successfully challenged in court.\n\nWhen must states adopt new rules?\n\nThe 21 states that run their own workplace enforcement programs have 30 days to either adopt the federal regulations or come up with rules that are \"at least as effective.\"\n\nThree states, Arizona, South Carolina and Utah, have already missed the deadline for adopting an emergency rule OSHA issued in June for health care workers.\n\nWhat happens if states refuse to implement the rules?\n\nWorkers can ask the courts to require the states to follow the law. OSHA also has the authority to take over a state program that is failing to protect workers.\n\nHow do OSHA's rules affect federal contractors and health workers?\n\nSeparate from the OSHA rules, the federal government is requiring federal contractors and employees at facilities that treat Medicare and Medicaid patients to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4. That tougher requirement supersedes the OSHA rules for larger businesses that would otherwise be affected by OSHA's new standard.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/18/hybrid-coral-reefs-butterfly-petition-drawbridge-tragedy-news-around-states/50613275/", "title": "Hybrid coral reefs, butterfly petition: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAshland: A Florida college student exploring the Alabama wilderness with his girlfriend was fatally wounded during a shootout with a would-be robber who appeared to be living with others in the woods, authorities said. Adam Simjee, 22, was shot to death in the Talladega National Forest near Cheaha State Park on Sunday, the Clay County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Yasmine Hider and Krystal Diane Pinkins were charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery, the statement said. Wounded several times during the confrontation, Hider was awaiting transfer to jail from a Birmingham hospital, where she underwent surgery for her wounds. Pinkins, 36, was jailed. Simjee and girlfriend Mikayla Paulus, 20, were driving on a National Forest Service road when Hider flagged them down and asked for help with her car, sheriff’s officials said. She then pulled out a gun and ordered them into the woods, they said. Simjee also pulled out a pistol and shot Hider several times, but he also was hit and died at the scene. Hider called out for help, and Pinkins emerged from the forest before fleeing, authorities said. Authorities using a dog tracking team and a state police helicopter found a camp where they saw Pinkins, whose 5-year-old son ran from the woods with a loaded shotgun as officers were arresting her, sheriff’s officials said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Two oil and gas companies have announced plans to invest $2.6 billion into developing a major oil field on Alaska’s North Slope. Australia-based Santos and Spain-based Repsol made the announcement, which was lauded by state political leaders, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Santos has a 51% stake in the Pikka project, and the company said Tuesday that its investment will be $1.3 billion. Santos last year acquired Oil Search of Papua New Guinea, which had been working to advance the project. Santos, in a statement, said the funds will cover the initial phase of development at the Pikka field, with 80,000 barrels of oil daily expected to begin flowing in 2026. If developed, the field on state land east of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska could significantly boost the flow of oil through the trans-Alaska pipeline system. Development could also generate billions of dollars in state and local tax revenue, primarily through royalties to the state. Another major North Slope oil prospect, ConocoPhillips’ Willow project, has been delayed by litigation and a new environmental review. Alaska U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan lauded the plans for the Pikka project. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy said it “will continue the renaissance on Alaska’s North Slope.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An effort by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to use shipping containers to close a 1,000-foot gap in the U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma suffered a brief setback when two stacked containers somehow toppled over. Claudia Ramos, a correspondent for the digital platform of Univision Noticias in Arizona, posted on her Twitter feed a photo she took Monday morning of the containers on their side. She said they fell on the U.S. side of the border. No witnesses have come forward to say what happened Sunday night. Ramos said contractors in the area told her they believed the containers may have been toppled by strong monsoon winds. But C.J. Karamargin, a Ducey spokesman, said he doubted that hypothesis, adding that even though the containers are empty, they weigh thousands of pounds. “It’s unlikely this was a weather event,” Karamargin said, suggesting that someone opposed to the wall was to blame. The stacked pair of containers were righted by early Monday morning. “Clearly we struck a nerve. They don’t like what we are doing, and they don’t want to keep the border open,” the spokesman said. “This happened before securing the containers to the ground. They will be bolted later and will be immovable.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Medical marijuana patients spent $23.3million in July at the state’s 38 dispensaries to take home 4,171 pounds of cannabis. Natural Relief Dispensary of Sherwood had the largest month, with 392 pounds sold, while The Releaf Center of Bentonville followed with 308 pounds. The Arkansas Department of Health reports 88,893 active patient cards. “Medical marijuana purchases increased by more than $1 million from June to July,” said Scott Hardin, spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. “An average of $751,720 was spent daily on medical marijuana purchases in July.” Since Jan. 1, 2022, patients have spent a total of $157.9 million to obtain 27,782 pounds from the state’s 38 dispensaries. Arkansas patients purchased 12,056 pounds of medical marijuana in April, May and June totaling $68.75 million. The state tax collection for the first three-month period of the year totaled $8.23 million, the state department reported. For the month of July, the state collected $2.6 million in tax form sales. Patients pay a 6.5% regular state sales tax on medical marijuana and a 4% privilege tax. Cultivators who sell their product to a dispensary only pay the 4% privilege tax.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Forecasts for more scorching heat and monsoon moisture brought calls for Californians to conserve electricity Wednesday, along with warnings that lightning, thunderstorm winds and parched vegetation were a recipe for wildfires. The heat wave was expected to be most extreme in the state’s interior, chiefly the Central Valley, where some locations hit 110 degrees Tuesday. The wildfire risk was focused on northern counties. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s power grid, called for voluntary electricity conservation from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. due to expectation of increased use of air conditioning and tightening power supplies. Late afternoon through early evening is the period when the grid is most stressed due to high demand while solar energy production is decreasing. Red flag warnings for fire danger were posted for the northern Coast Range, eastern Shasta County and the Mount Lassen area. The National Weather Service warned of the possibility of “abundant lightning” and erratic gusts from thunderstorms. “Lightning can create new fire starts and may combine with strong outflow winds to cause a fire to rapidly grow in size and intensity,” the weather service said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Tumble out of bed and stumble to your mailbox. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is now available in Larimer County. The country music singer’s international children’s literacy program provides one free book a month to children until they turn 5 to help inspire an early love for reading. Parents in Larimer County can enroll their children in the program through the United Way of Larimer County. “People are really excited about the program,” said Allison Hines, United Way of Larimer County’s senior vice president of resource development. “This is a really great opportunity to get books in the hands of families that may not otherwise have access to them.” Any child qualifies for the program until their 5th birthday. In Larimer County alone, roughly 17,000 children are eligible. Since the program launched last week, over 2,000 people have registered their children for the program, Hines said. Officials hope to have 4,200 families signed up in the program’s first year.The Imagination Library is mostly funded through the Dollywood Foundation, supplemented by the Imagination Library of Colorado, which receives money from the state. The Dollywood Foundation selects the books and sends them directly to the child.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city is investing in public art, with two more artists now invited to paint murals downtown. It seems that 2022 has become the year for murals in Norwich with the murals on Market Street Garage and Castle Church. Now, two more are in the works. The Norwich Street Art Collective invited artists Carlitos Skills, whose legal name is Carlos Alexis Rivera Rivera, from Bayamon, Puerto Rico, and Golden, legal name Cristhian Saravia, of Miami, to town. Both of their murals are expected to be finished Thursday. Peter Helms, founder of the Norwich Street Art Collective, was inspired by the street art in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, once a blighted neighborhood but now a place where culture and business thrive. “A group of people decided that if they brought in art, that would inspire people and give them a sense of pride in their community and ultimately transform it economically,” Helms said. Norwich is in a unique position. While millions of people visit the nearby casinos every year, there hasn’t been enough of a draw to pull casino visitors into the city. An outdoor art museum may have the kind of pull needed, Helms said. As long as it was family-friendly, the artists could do anything they wanted, as tight restrictions are “not how you get the best art from artists.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Riverside community celebrated the completion of 74 mixed-income apartments Tuesday, bringing updated public housing as well as units designated for people with disabilities and special needs as part of a $100 million redevelopment project in the Wilmington neighborhood. Over 100 state, federal and local elected officials, community leaders and neighbors gathered outside the first phase of Imani Village, where units have been set aside to house seniors, veterans and individuals with disabilities, along with transitioning families out of outdated Wilmington Housing Authority apartments into newly built apartment homes with up to four bedrooms. This is the first of six phases of a “Purpose Built Community” redevelopment plan spearheaded by the nonprofit Reach Riverside. It will offer 59 affordable units as well as 15 market-rate apartments. The second phase, expected to be completed by the end of the year, will add another 50 affordable and 17 market-rate units, said Jennifer Lienhard, Reach Riverside’s director of marketing and communications. Announced in 2018, the multimillion-dollar project aims to build hundreds of public housing units as well as mixed-income and homeownership opportunities, revamp early education and health services at Kingswood Community Center, and add high school grades to the local EastSide Charter School.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A Catholic school in Northeast D.C. is raising money to repair the damage after someone broke several concrete windowsills and knocked down a statue of the school’s namesake weeks before the first day of classes, WUSA-TV reports. St. Anthony Catholic School said three benches were also pulled out of the ground and damaged. According to a police report, an unknown suspect destroyed the school’s property overnight Aug. 11 and took the head off the statue. St. Anthony Catholic Principal Mike Thomasian discovered the damage Friday and said he was disappointed to see someone would target the school’s patron saint. “Hate crimes can happen in any house of worship, and Catholics are being attacked right now,” he said. “And I didn’t know how strongly I felt about that until it hit home.” The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the incident as a suspected hate crime. It is at least the third religious hate crime investigated by police this year. Then, St. Anthony was targeted again over the weekend, according to Thomasian. He said a custodian discovered the principal’s office had been ransacked, and two religious statues had been destroyed. Thomasian said the thief also took $1,400 that children had raised for a charity. A GoFundMe had raised more than $30,000 in donations as of Wednesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Scientists and students from the University of Miami dove into the dark waters a few miles off the shores of Miami this week as part of an effort to develop hybrid reefs. The team from the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science was on a mission to collect eggs and sperm from spawning staghorn coral, which they hope to use to fertilize other strains of staghorn corals in a lab. It’s all part of a $7.5 million federal grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to help address security threats to the military and civilian infrastructure along vulnerable coastal regions in Florida and the Caribbean. The Miami-based project seeks to protect coastal bases from damaging hurricane storm surge using hybrid reefs. “Our mission is to develop hybrid reefs that combine the wave-protection benefits of artificial structures with the ecological benefits of coral reefs,” said Andrew Baker, a professor and director of the Coral Reef Futures Lab at the Rosenstiel School. “We will be working on next-generation structural designs and concrete materials and integrating them with novel ecological engineering approaches to help foster the growth of corals on these structures.” They will also be testing new adaptive biology approaches to produce corals that are faster-growing and more resilient to a warming climate, he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Attorneys for the family of a woman killed by gunfire last year as sheriff’s deputies executed a search warrant at her cousin’s home are calling for the U.S. Justice Department to investigate, arguing the deadly raid echoes the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. Shooting broke out within seconds after Camden County deputies knocked down the door of Varshan Brown’s darkened home in Woodbine, about 100 miles south of Savannah, just before 5 a.m. May 4, 2021. The officers had a warrant to search the house for drugs. Brown’s cousin, 37-year-old Latoya James, was killed by bullets as deputies and Brown fired guns at each other. Brown was wounded and later charged with crimes. Local prosecutors brought no charges against the deputies after concluding they were justified in using deadly force. Lawyers for James’ family say there are striking parallels between this case and the 2020 raid by police in Louisville, Kentucky, that left Taylor dead. In both cases, officers arrived in the middle of the night and forced their way into homes with little to no warning. And each involved a shootout that killed an unarmed Black woman. “Latoya James was innocent in all aspects of this case,” said Harry Daniels, an attorney for her family. “She was at her cousin’s house. She wasn’t a target of any investigation.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Warning of a tough flu season ahead, state health officials are urging residents to get vaccinated against influenza and COVID-19 alike, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State lawmakers who made it more difficult for transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a U.S. court ruling banning such obstacles must pay $321,000 in legal fees to the winning side after losing in the same court. Republican Gov. Brad Little and Secretary of State Lawerence Denney on the State Board of Examiners on Tuesday approved paying the winning side’s legal fees set by the court in June. The court in March 2018 banned Idaho from automatically rejecting applications from transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. The court ruled the restriction violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. But lawmakers in 2020 approved a ban anyway, and Little signed the bill into law. The 2018 case was reopened, and Idaho lost again, resulting in the $321,000 legal bill. The state previously paid $75,000 after losing the initial case in 2018. The plaintiffs in the case were represented by Lambda Legal, which on its website describes itself as a national legal organization working to get full civil rights recognition for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and everyone living with HIV. The Board of Examiners typically sends such bills to the Constitutional Defense Council but instead sent the bill to the Legislature on Tuesday.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state’s first lady has again bested her husband in an Illinois State Fair tradition, with M.K. Pritzker outbidding Gov. J.B. Pritzker for the fair’s grand champion steer. The first lady’s $105,000 bid for the steer, King, also beat her own record from 2021, when she and the governor were again pitted against each other in the auction.\n\nIndiana\n\nFremont: Hundreds of fish found dead in a northeastern Indiana lake likely died from natural events tied to recent hot weather, state wildlife officials said. Fisheries biologists with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources visited Clear Lake on Aug. 4 after residents reported numerous dead fish in the lake near the Steuben County town of Fremont, The Journal Gazette reports. The DNR said an estimated 500 fish were found dead, including bluegill, crappie and bass, in the lake about 50 miles northeast of Fort Wayne. The state agency said Monday that natural events likely caused the fish to die and noted that heat, warm water and windless days can produce low levels of dissolved oxygen in lakes. “Without dissolved oxygen, fish are unable to breathe and can die rapidly and in large numbers,” the DNR said in a news release. DNR biologists will continue monitoring conditions at Clear Lake. While the public health threat is considered very low, the agency said people should use common sense when visiting natural waterways, especially during periods of hot weather.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A City Council member is countersuing two police officers who took the unusual step earlier this year of suing several people who participated in a 2020 protest following a Minneapolis officer’s killing of George Floyd. Councilwoman Indira Sheumaker’s countersuit says Officers Peter Wilson and Jeffrey George used excessive force and violated her civil rights when they arrested her during a protest July 1, 2020, outside the Iowa State Capitol. Sheumaker’s lawsuit also accuses the officers of filing a frivolous lawsuit against protesters. In June, Wilson and George sued Sheumaker and five other protesters, accusing them of assault and seeking monetary damages, including an unspecified amount in punitive damages. The protest was among demonstrations against racism and police brutality that erupted worldwide following Floyd’s killing. It began as a rally at the Iowa State Capitol to push for the restored voting rights to felons and turned violent as police led away arrested protesters. The officers’ lawsuit – which they filed as individuals and not as representatives of the Des Moines Police Department – accuses Sheumaker and another protester of putting George in a chokehold as protesters attempted to thwart the officers’ attempts to arrest several people on prior warrants.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Federal officials are expected next month to rename five creeks and a stream on federal land in the state because their names include a slur for Native American women. That word, “squaw,” was formally declared derogatory last November in an order issued by Deb Haaland, the nation’s first Native American Secretary of the Interior. The term is an ethnic, racial and sexist slur, particularly for Indigenous women, Haaland said in a news release. “Our nation’s lands and waters should be places to celebrate the outdoors and our shared cultural heritage – not to perpetuate the legacies of oppression,” she said. Haaland ordered the Board on Geographic Names, the federal body tasked with naming geographic places, to find replacement names for more than 660 geographic features bearing that term, including the six sites in Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky State Parks has launched a photo contest that encourages visitors to capture some of the best parts of their stay. The contest aims to attract more travelers and showcase these “places of beauty, from scenic mountain views to tranquil beaches,” Kentucky Department of Parks Commissioner Russ Meyer said in a statement. Photos can be entered in the categories of camping, scenic, trails and park activities and will be judged on factors including originality and artistic composition, officials said. Photo submissions can be made through Oct. 31, and winners will be announced in December. A grand prize winner will receive a two-night cottage stay, a Canon camera and a $100 Kentucky State Parks gift card. Four honorable mention categories will have first- and second-place winners, who will receive camping certificates and gift cards.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: State law does not require that a candidate who mistakenly fills in the wrong address on a qualification form must be tossed off the ballot, a lawyer for Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins told the Louisiana Supreme Court on Tuesday. A lawsuit says Perkins did not use the address where he claims a homestead tax exemption when he signed up to run for reelection, as the law requires. He used another address for a residence he owns in the city. Perkins has acknowledged the mistake, and none of the seven justices Tuesday accused him of perjury. The case involves the question of whether “there are some things that a candidate does not have to tell the truth about,” Justice Jay McCallum said as he questioned Perkins’ attorney, Scott Bickford. Bickford said state law does not specifically call for disqualifying a candidate for using the wrong address. Jerry Harper, attorney for plaintiff Francis Deal, said the use of false information on the sign-up form for the Nov. 8 election – information the candidate swears to be true – disqualifies Perkins, who wants to run for a second term. Justice Scott Crichton at one point suggested that allowing Perkins on the ballot would be tantamount to nullifying the law. It was unclear when the justices would rule. So far, a district judge and an appellate court have ruled against Perkins.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to defrauding federal pandemic assistance programs of more than $300,000, which investigators say was spent on trucks, exercise equipment, a big-screen TV and laptop computers. Craig Franck, 40, of Levant, also used some of the relief money to post bail and hire a defense attorney after being charged with felony fraud in Florida, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and money laundering charges. He faces up to 20 years in prison when he’s sentenced. U.S. Attorney Darcie McElwee vowed to go after those who “take advantage of a national emergency simply to line their own pockets.” Franck formerly owned CCF Acoustics LLC and CCF Acoustical Systems, but neither company was in business or had employees in 2020 and 2021 when he applied for federal assistance during the pandemic, prosecutors said. Franck received $177,400 from the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program through the Small Business Administration and $145,060 from a private lender through the Paycheck Protection Program, prosecutors said. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker entered a forfeiture order Tuesday for about $320,000. Franck’s lawyer didn’t immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.\n\nMaryland\n\nCrofton: The family of a man fatally shot by a police officer filed a federal civil right lawsuit Monday against the department and individual officers. Dyonta Quarles Jr. was shot Jan. 30 when Anne Arundel County officers responded to his Crofton home after his mother called 911 saying her son wouldn’t let her leave, according to the Attorney General’s Office. Bodycam footage shows Quarles punching Officer J. Ricci. As officers handcuff Quarles, the video shows him bite Ricci and another officer deploy a stun gun. Ricci calls on colleagues to shoot Quarles, then fires himself. Quarles died, and Ricci was taken to a trauma center in serious condition, officials said. Mikel Quarles said at a news conference announcing the suit Monday that she was asking for help, and her son was killed, news outlets report. Attorneys for the family said part of the suit focuses on officers’ training. The officers weren’t properly trained “and reacted in a manner which was unconstitutional, unreasonable and excessive,” attorney Gregory Kulis said. The officers should have reduced tension, he said. “The police arrived with guns drawn,” Kulis said. “They were ready to go to battle.” The Attorney General’s Office said the case remains under investigation. County police declined comment but said Ricci is still recovering.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city is seeking to ban fossil fuels from new building projects and major renovations, Mayor Michelle Wu announced Tuesday. The Democrat said the state’s largest city will take advantage of a key provision in the climate change bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker last week. That legislation, which is meant to bring the state closer to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, calls for a pilot project allowing 10 Massachusetts cities and towns to require new building projects be all-electric, with the exception of life sciences labs and health care facilities. Wu said the city will file a home rule petition with the Legislature to join the pilot. “Boston must lead by taking every possible step for climate action,” she said in a statement. “Boston’s participation will help deliver healthy, energy efficient spaces that save our residents and businesses on utilities costs and create local green jobs that will fuel our economy for decades.” Wu’s office said natural gas, oil and other fossil fuels used in buildings represent more than one-third of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions. New York, Washington, D.C., and Seattle are among the major U.S. municipalities that have enacted similar bans, The Boston Globe reports.\n\nMichigan\n\nGaylord: Recent solar activity and weather conditions could give Michiganders the chance to view the northern lights through Friday night, according to the National Weather Service in Gaylord. The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are created when charged particles ejected by the sun collide with atoms and molecules in Earth’s atmosphere. These charged particles then emit light that viewers perceive as the aurora. The Upper Peninsula is known to offer great conditions to view night sky phenomena due to its latitude, but Lower Peninsula residents may also get the chance to witness the northern lights, as they’re predicted to be visible as far south as Ohio and Pennsylvania. To spot the northern lights, look for greenish streaks of light that move and change, unlike clouds, which move in one direction. For best visibility, avoid areas with light pollution, and try to gain an unobstructed view of the night sky. The aurora will be visible closer to the horizon and will appear higher up in the sky the farther north the viewer are located. Strong solar activity may interfere with electronic communications such as radio, cellphone, television and satellite signals.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Former Minneapolis police Officer Thomas Lane, who was sentenced to 21/ 2 years for violating George Floyd’s civil rights, will do his time at a low-security federal prison camp in Colorado. A court order Tuesday directs Lane to report to the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood in the Denver suburb of Littleton on Aug. 30. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson had recommended that the Bureau of Prisons send Lane to the low-security prison camp in Duluth, closer to his home, but the bureau makes the final decisions on where to place inmates, including weighing safety concerns. “He should be fine there,” said Lane’s defense attorney, Earl Gray. According to the Bureau of Prisons website, FCI Englewood is a low-security prison for men with an adjacent minimum security satellite camp. It holds 1,032 inmates, including 97 at the camp. Housing is dormitory or cubicle style. Life there is highly regimented, including frequent head counts and having to wake at dawn.\n\nMississippi\n\nLexington: Police have “terrorized” Black residents in a small town by subjecting them to false arrests, excessive force and intimidation, according to a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday by a civil rights organization. The group, JULIAN, is seeking a temporary restraining order against the Lexington Police Department to demand protection for the town’s largely Black population. Lexington is about 63 miles north of the capital, Jackson. “It’s both unconscionable and illegal for Lexington residents to be terrorized and live in fear of the police department whose job is to protect them,” said Jill Collen Jefferson, president and founder of JULIAN. “We need both the courts and the Department of Justice to step in immediately.” The town’s city attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The town’s interim police chief, Charles Henderson, cast doubt on many of the allegations in response to an email request for comment. “I’m working on moving the Lexington Police Department forward,” he said. “I will say, don’t buy into everything you hear. This is defamation of character.” The lawsuit comes after JULIAN said it obtained an audio recording in July of then-Lexington Police Chief Sam Dobbins using racial slurs and talking about how many people he had killed in the line of duty.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: As the U.S. government expands incentives for renewable energy, a decision by the Missouri Supreme Court is moving the state in the opposite direction by halting a solar energy tax break that has been on the books for nearly a decade. The high court struck down a 2013 state law granting a property tax exemption for certain solar energy systems, saying the tax break wasn’t allowed under the state constitution. The case involved a privately run solar farm supplying energy for City Utilities of Springfield, which serves Missouri’s third-largest city. As a result of the ruling, the company owning the solar energy farm will owe at least $423,360 in property taxes from 2017 to 2020, Greene County Collector Allen Icet said. It’s not clear how many other solar energy sites across Missouri could be affected by the ruling or exactly how much tax revenue is at stake. But the ruling could have a chilling effect on solar energy development in Missouri, just as the federal government is trying to encourage it. “This obviously would put a big kink and cost in the way of someone trying to lay out a large panel system, if you’ve got to pay taxes on the material generating this renewable, free energy,” said Jon Dolan, executive director of the Missouri Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs can be held responsible for damages awarded to a woman who became pregnant after an on-duty BIA officer used the threat of criminal charges to coerce her into having sex, the Montana Supreme Court has ruled. The woman, identified by the initials L.B. in court documents, sued former BIA officer Dana Bullcoming and his employer for the October 2015 sexual assault on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation that resulted in the birth of a child, who is now 7, said her attorney, John Heenan. “This is a woman that had the courage to report a federal law enforcement officer for sexually assaulting her and then had the courage to go through the entire process, including agents there to collect DNA when the child was born,” Heenan said Wednesday. She pursued the case on behalf of people living on reservations to show “that they should have the same rights as Montanans do on this issue.” U.S. District Judge Susan Watters of Billings awarded the woman $1.6 million in damages in May 2020 but had ruled earlier that the BIA could not be held responsible for paying them because under federal law, the coercion and sex were outside the scope of Bullcoming’s duties.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The special board appointed by President Joe Biden to intervene in stalled railroad contract talks suggested Tuesday that 115,000 rail workers should get 24% raises and thousands of dollars in bonuses as part of a new agreement to avert a strike. Railroads and unions will use those recommendations as the basis for a new round of negotiations over the next month. It remains to be seen, however, whether railroads will agree to the higher wages or find ways to address union concerns about working conditions. If the two sides can’t agree on a new deal by mid-September, federal law would allow a strike or lockout. But Congress is likely to intervene before then to keep the supply chain moving. A railroad strike could devastate businesses that rely on Union Pacific, BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX and other major freight railroads to deliver raw materials and ship their products. In past national rail labor disputes, lawmakers have voted to impose terms on the railroads before workers could strike. A White House official said Biden is optimistic the report will provide a good framework for successful negotiations because avoiding a rail shutdown is in the nation’s interests.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Conservationists who are already suing to block a geothermal power plant where an endangered toad lives in western Nevada are now seeking U.S. protection for a rare butterfly at another geothermal project the developer plans near the Oregon line. The Center for Biological Diversity is petitioning the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the bleached sandhill skipper under the Endangered Species Act at the only place it’s known to exist. It says the project the Bureau of Land Management approved last year 250 miles north of Reno could ultimately lead to the extinction of the 2-inch-long butterfly with golden-orange wings. “This beautiful little butterfly has evolved over millennia to thrive in this one specific spot, and no one should have the right to just wipe it off the face of the Earth,” said Jess Tyler, a scientist at the center who co-wrote the petition. USFWS has 90 days to decide whether there’s enough evidence to conduct a yearlong review to determine if protection is warranted, so any formal listing is likely years away. But the petition signals the potential for another legal fight all too familiar to Ormat Nevada, which wants to tap hot water beneath the earth to generate carbon-free energy the Biden administration has made a key part of its effort to combat climate change with a shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A hermit known as River Dave – whose cabin in the New Hampshire woods burned down after he had spent nearly three decades on the property and was ordered to leave – has found a new home in Maine. David Lidstone, 82, has put in windows and is working on installing a chimney on his rustic three-room cabin, which he said is on land he bought. “The foundation needs repair work,” Lidstone, who received more than $200,000 in donations following the fire, said in a phone interview Monday. “It’s just an old camp, but I enjoy working (on it).” Lidstone, who grew up in Maine, declined to say where he was living or provide a contact for the landowner. A search of Maine county registers of deeds did not show any recent transactions involving Lidstone, but a cousin confirmed he had moved to Maine, and a Facebook post had photos of Lidstone with a family member in his new home. “He’s working on putting it together and clearing land and planting gardens, and he’s got some chickens. He’s moving on,” said Horace Clark, of Vermont, Lidstone’s cousin. Lidstone said he had to leave Canterbury, New Hampshire, over his dispute with a different landowner since 2016 over a patch of forest near the Merrimack River that Lidstone called home for 27 years.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s casinos, horse tracks that offer sports betting, and the online partners of both types of gambling outlets won $480.7 million in July, an increase of 6.7% from a year ago. But some of Atlantic City’s nine casinos continue to struggle to return to pre-pandemic levels in terms of the amount won from in-person gamblers, with five of them individually winning less in July 2022 than they did in July 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic began. Figures released Tuesday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show that the casinos collectively won just under $299 million from in-person gamblers. That’s more than the $277 million they collectively won in July 2019. But five casinos – Bally’s, Borgata, Golden Nugget, Harrah’s and the Tropicana – won less from in-person gamblers last month than they did in July 2019. Nonetheless, Atlantic City’s performance in July “showed indications of a strong summer season fueled by a return to normal operations and consumer behavior,” said Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University. James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, said the resort is off to a good start to the crucial summer season.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: A fundraiser organized by a local LGBTQ organization at a brewery in Aztec was canceled after the owners of the business reportedly received threats. Nicole Hall, board president of Identity Inc., the Farmington-based nonprofit that was organizing the Aug. 12 fundraiser, said she received a call from one of the owners of the 550 Brewing Taproom two days prior saying the business had received several threats from people apparently upset about the all-ages event including a drag show. The Back to School Bash planned by Identity Inc. at the brewery was intended to raise cash and draw donations of school supplies for children and teachers, according to a flyer for the event posted on the organization’s Facebook page. It included a $5 cover charge and featured a drag show, an open mic session, games and more. But Hall said the brewery owner said she and other business representatives had been contacted through various means by people upset by the prospect of children being present for the drag show. Some reportedly threatened the owners and members of their family, Hall said she was told. “My immediate response was, ‘I’m so sorry people are being hateful to you. We’re used to it, but I didn’t think it would boil over to you and your family,’ ” Hall said she told the brewery’s owners.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities say they have busted an organized crime racket reminiscent of the Mafia’s heyday, involving illegal gambling parlors in New York City and Long Island and a police detective accused of helping to protect the lucrative schemes. Two indictments unsealed Tuesday charged nine people, including the detective, with crimes such as racketeering, illegal gambling, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Nicknames of the defendants included “Joe Fish,” “Sal the Shoemaker” and “Joe Box.” The top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn said the racketeers operated from fronts including a coffee bar, a soccer club and a shoe repair shop. “Today’s arrests of members from two La Cosa Nostra crime families demonstrate that the Mafia continues to pollute our communities with illegal gambling, extortion and violence while using our financial system in service to their criminal schemes,” U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said. He called the detective’s alleged conduct “shameful.” The Nassau County Police Department detective, Hector Rosario, is accused of accepting money from the Bonanno crime family in exchange for steering police raids toward competing gambling clubs.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Although illegal marijuana and lawful hemp look and smell the same, criminal prosecution for pot can still be legitimate when sight or odor contributes to a warrantless search and seizure, the state Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday. A three-judge panel found no errors related to a trial judge or attorney for Derek Edwin Highsmith, who was convicted last year of felony marijuana possession stemming from a Duplin County traffic stop in 2017. He was sentenced to a maximum of a little over four years in prison. Highsmith argued unsuccessfully at a hearing before his trial that the evidence collected after a K-9 alerted officers to possible drugs inside the vehicle should have been suppressed because it was unlawfully obtained. Superior Court Judge Henry Stevens IV denied Highsmith’s suppression motion, saying the K-9’s positive alert for narcotics, along with other factors, provided officers with the facts to find probable cause to conduct the search. The prosecutor called ït a “K-9 sniff-plus case,” Tuesday’s opinion said. Sheriff’s officers said it saw a vehicle that left a residence after many complaints about narcotics sales there, according to the opinion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The city’s school board will reconsider its decision to stop reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at each of its meetings, after the move drew widespread criticism and threats of retaliation from some conservative state lawmakers. Fargo Board of Education President Tracie Newman told board members in a memo that she believes the pledge should be reinstated because the onslaught of “negative local and national feedback” could cost time and resources ahead of the new school year. She called a special meeting for Thursday. The Fargo board voted 7-2 last week to nix a previous board edict from April to recite the pledge before each meeting. The board includes four newcomers from the June election. In deciding against reciting the pledge, the board said the move didn’t align with the district’s diversity and inclusion code, largely because it says “under God” in one phrase. Robin Nelson, one of two board members to vote against dropping the pledge, said no one complained after the panel started reciting the patriotic vow. But since last week’s vote, the board has received “hundreds and hundreds of local and national emails and phone calls,” she said. She has heard personally from state lawmakers who have threatened to get even.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A federal judge awarded $650 million in damages Wednesday to two Ohio counties that won a landmark lawsuit against national pharmacy chains CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, claiming the way they distributed opioids to customers caused severe harm to communities and created a public nuisance. U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said in the ruling that the money will be used to abate a continuing opioid crisis in Lake and Trumbull counties, outside Cleveland. Attorneys for the counties put the total price tag at $3 billion for the damage done to the counties. Lake County is to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County is to receive $344 million over the same period. Polster ordered the companies to immediately pay nearly $87 million to cover the first two years of the abatement plan. In his ruling, Polster admonished the three companies, saying they “squandered the opportunity to present a meaningful plan to abate the nuisance” after a trial that considered what damages they might owe. CVS, Walmart and Walgreens said they will appeal the ruling.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state lawmaker has filed an Open Records Act lawsuit seeking records about expenditures from Governor’s Emergency Education Relief funds. Republican state Rep. Logan Phillips filed the lawsuit Tuesday against the Office of Management and Enterprise Services and said Gov. Kevin Stitt and Education Secretary Ryan Walters, also both Republicans, have not responded to his requests for the documents. “I am seeking declarative and injunctive relief because I believe failure to provide the requested records is unlawful, and the records need to be made publicly available,” Phillips said. Stitt and OMES representatives told the Tulsa World that Phillips failed to attend scheduled meetings to see the documents. A U.S. Department of Education audit in July sharply criticized state officials for lack of oversight and accountability in how they used nearly $40 million in coronavirus relief funds intended for education. The audit recommended the state return nearly $653,000 spent on non-educational items such as televisions and Xbox gaming systems and audit another $5.4 million for possible refund of misspent funds. The state blamed the Florida-based contractor hired to administer the programs and sued the company for how it distributed the funds.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Oregon’s gubernatorial election took a step closer Tuesday to being a three-way race when unaffiliated candidate Betsy Johnson delivered thousands of voter signatures to get on the ballot. If the signatures are verified by election officials, the former state lawmaker will face Democratic nominee Tina Kotek, who is a former Oregon House speaker; and Republican nominee Christine Drazan, a former leader of the minority GOP in the House. “Coming onto the ballot through the power of people’s signatures is one of the most meaningful and foundational elements of my campaign,” Johnson said. She and several supporters delivered boxes of signature sheets to election officials in Salem. Johnson’s campaign said it delivered 48,214 signatures to Secretary of State Shemia Fagan’s election officials. Officials need to verify 23,744 of them as valid by Aug. 30 for Johnson to qualify for the November ballot. Tuesday was the deadline to deliver the signatures. “By delivering more than twice the number of signatures needed, we’ve made it very difficult for the political establishment to imagine ways to keep me off the ballot,” Johnson said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Two former judges who orchestrated a scheme to send children to for-profit jails in exchange for kickbacks were ordered to pay more than $200 million to hundreds of people they victimized in one of the worst judicial scandals in U.S. history. U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner awarded $106 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages to nearly 300 people in a long-running civil suit against the judges, writing the plaintiffs are “the tragic human casualties of a scandal of epic proportions.” In what came to be known as the kids-for-cash scandal, Mark Ciavarella and another judge, Michael Conahan, shut down a county-run juvenile detention center and accepted $2.8 million in illegal payments from the builder and co-owner of two for-profit lockups. Ciavarella, who presided over juvenile court, pushed a zero-tolerance policy that guaranteed large numbers of kids would be sent to PA Child Care and its sister facility, Western PA Child Care. Ciavarella ordered children as young as 8 to detention, many of them first-time offenders deemed delinquent for petty theft, jaywalking, truancy, smoking on school grounds and other minor infractions. The judge often ordered youths he had found delinquent to be immediately shackled, handcuffed and taken away without giving them a chance to put up a defense or even say goodbye to their families.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A group of police officers put on body cameras Tuesday as part of a two-month pilot program that’s expected to pave the way for all the department’s patrol officers to wear them. Sixteen Warwick officers wore the Axon body cameras, which officers are now wearing on all three of the department’s patrol shifts. “This pilot program is really us getting our feet wet,” said Warwick’s police chief, Col. Brad Connor. The camera tryout in Warwick evokes a buzz of activity at police departments across the state as many local police officers get ready to do their jobs, day in and day out, with body cameras. A 30-day public comment period for a set of proposed rules and regulations runs out Friday. The draft policy was developed by the office of Attorney General Peter F. Neronha and the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety with guidance from the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association. Under the program, which is based largely on legislation passed last year, the draft policy can be approved following consideration of public input. The approved policy would govern the use of body cameras by police departments that tap into $15 million in funding that has been allocated by the state legislature.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Attorneys for disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh say prosecutors are taking too long to share their evidence alleging the disbarred attorney killed his wife and son, unfairly making it tougher to defend him at his upcoming trial. It’s a technical legal dispute that precedes many trials, but because of overwhelming public attention on Murdaugh’s case, attorney Dick Harpootlian called a news conference Wednesday that drew a dozen cameras at which he declared prosecutors want a “trial by ambush.” Prosecutors shot back. “This manufactured drama is just a well-known part of defense counsel’s playbook,” the state Attorney General’s Office responded in legal papers. Murdaugh, 54, was indicted in July on murder charges in the shooting deaths of his wife Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, who were killed June 7, 2021, at one of the family’s homes in Colleton County. He has adamantly denied killing them. Murdaugh’s lawyers immediately asked for the prosecution’s evidence, and court rules require authorities turn it over in 30 days. That deadline was Monday, and defense lawyers said prosecutors didn’t provide the evidence because they wanted a judge to decide whether to require a protective order limiting to whom the defense can show the evidence and how it handles documents, photos and recordings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., has introduced a bill that would prevent foreign powers like China from buying U.S. agricultural land, according to a press release. The bill plays off the PASS Act introduced on the House side in July by Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and co-sponsored by Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D. The Senate bill would amend the 1950 Defense Production Act to allow for the review of agricultural transactions, according to the bill’s language. The difference between Rounds’ bill and the Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security Act includes prohibiting China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from investing in agricultural land, as well as requiring the U.S. secretary of agriculture to report on the risk of foreign takeovers and investments in agricultural companies or land use for ag purposes. “Protecting American farmland is critical to maintaining our national security,” Rounds said. “In my travels around South Dakota, I’ve heard from many farmers and ranchers who are concerned about foreign adversaries owning American farmland.” More than 350,000 acres of farmland in South Dakota belong to foreign businesses, despite a 1979 law barring non-resident foreigners from owning more than 160 acres.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two Black men who challenged their criminal convictions after jurors deliberated in a courthouse room containing Confederate symbols have received opposite rulings from different judges on the same appeals court. One was granted a new trial. The other was denied. The conflicting decisions likely mean the matter will be appealed up to the Tennessee Supreme Court to sort out the discrepancy. The rulings from two three-judge panels of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals center on trials held at the Giles County Courthouse, putting jurors in a room adorned with items maintained by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, including an antique Confederate flag and portraits of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. John C. Brown. In June, a state commission approved plans to move the artifacts to a museum. This week, a panel of judges ruled unanimously against a new trial for Barry Jamal Martin, who went to trial in February 2020 and was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The ruling says none of the jurors testified to “even noticing or being aware that the memorabilia was in the room.” The decision also questioned whether an average person would be able to recognize who was in the portraits or what the flag meant.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: Just months after an armed teenager entered Robb Elementary and killed two teachers and 19 children, a summer of conflicting government narratives has set parents on edge, particularly after a state report showed that 376 law enforcement officers showed up at Robb on May 24 but did not engage the shooter for more than an hour. Parents are now trying to plan for the back-to-school season and facing tough choices about their children’s education and safety. Some are keeping their kids in the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District when school starts Sept. 6, the Texas Tribune reports. Some are choosing home-schooling, and others are looking at private schools. At Uvalde High School’s auditorium this past week, district officials laid out for parents new safety measures and increased access to mental health resources for the upcoming school year. Superintendent Hal Harrell discussed the district’s partnership with Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine, which helps identify behavioral health needs of children and adolescents. The district is also contracting Rhithm, a company with an app that allows staff and students to log how they are feeling. Communities in Schools, a nonprofit focused on connecting students with resources, is also sending teams to the district to provide additional behavioral health support to students.\n\nUtah\n\nSanta Clara: A 12-year-old Little League World Series player was in critical condition Tuesday with what his family said was a head injury suffered when he fell off the top bunk of his bed at a dormitory complex. Easton Oliverson is a pitcher and outfielder for the Snow Canyon team out of Santa Clara. The Little League World Series began Wednesday in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. His dad, Jace Oliverson, is an assistant coach on the team. “I’ve always been a firm believer of prayer and the power that comes with it, and I feel like if people continue to rally around us that he will make a full recovery,” Oliverson told KSL-TV. “Right now it’s slow. They keep telling me it’s a cross-country race.” Oliverson gave an update on his son’s condition through Facebook and said doctors told him his son had punctured an artery, which caused bleeding on the brain and required the removal of a piece of skull. Snow Canyon Little League started an online store to support the team while in Williamsport. Now, proceeds from the fundraising will go toward Easton’s recovery. Snow Canyon is the first team from Utah to advance to the Little League World Series by winning the Mountain Region. The Santa Clara-based club plays its first game Friday at 1 p.m. and will face the winner of the New England vs. Southeast game.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A city police officer is on leave after he shot a man in the leg who was having an apparent mental health crisis Saturday afternoon, according to a news release from the Vermont State Police. David Johnson, 20, is still in the hospital, and no information has been shared by police about his condition. Sgt. Simon Bombard, who has worked for the Burlington Police Department for seven years, is on procedural administrative leave. Three police officers responded to a call just before 3 p.m. and found Johnson with a large kitchen knife standing outside the house and threatening suicide, according to the state police. The officers reportedly attempted to speak with Johnson, whom they knew from previous interactions, and de-escalate the situation. After about four minutes, Johnson reportedly charged one of the officers. The officer used an electroshock weapon on him, but it did not stop Johnson, according to the state police investigation. Another officer, whom state police have identified as Bombard, shot Johnson once in the upper left leg. The officer’s bullets also hit nearby occupied cars, and one person suffered minor injuries from broken glass. Johnson is expected to face charges, police said.\n\nVirginia\n\nMontpelier Station: The U.S. Postal Service has closed a small post office over agency management’s concerns about its location inside a historic train depot that also serves as a museum about racial segregation. In a statement this week addressing the closure, the USPS noted that the museum near former President James Madison’s Montpelier estate has historical signage above two exterior doors, one labeled “WHITE” and another labeled “COLORED.” It added that “Postal Service management considered that some customers may associate the racially-based, segregated entrances with the current operations of the Post Office and thereby draw negative associations between those operations and the painful legacy of discrimination and segregation.” The statement said operations were being suspended at the Montpelier Station Post Office with the intention of finding suitable alternative quarters in the community or, in the absence of any, proceeding with a study of whether to discontinue the branch. The post office location had one employee and operated four hours daily, according to the statement. It served about 100 people and closed in June, according to the Culpeper Star-Exponent.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state’s apple crop is forecast to be a bit smaller this year because of the cool spring. The Washington State Tree Fruit Association projected this week that the 2022 fresh apple crop will total 108.7 million 40-pound boxes. That’s an 11.1% decrease from 2021’s 122.3 million boxes. “We are pleased with the size of the harvest, particularly in the face of a long, cold spring,” WSTFA President Jon DeVaney said. The estimate shows that five popular apple varieties make up the majority of the harvest. Gala leads production at 20%, and Red Delicious and Honeycrisp are each projected at 14%, followed by Granny Smith at 13.4% and Fuji at 12.7% of total production. Cosmic Crisp, which is grown only in Washington state, is 4.6% of the harvest, up from 3.2% last year. Washington apples are sold in over 40 countries and are the state’s top farm commodity, representing 20% of the state’s farm-gate agricultural value in 2020. On average, 30% of the harvest is exported.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Officials in one county hit by flooding this week are starting the task of removing residential debris. Curbside debris collection began Wednesday in flood-ravaged neighborhoods of eastern Kanawha County where up to 5 inches of rain fell Monday, the county commission said in a news release. Among the hardest-hit areas were Hughes Creek, Kelleys Creek and Campbells Creek. The statement said dump trucks will collect debris through at least Sunday. The cleanup comes as forecasters predict another rainy stretch of weather starting Saturday. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice declared a state of emergency in Kanawha and Fayette counties, enabling the National Guard to respond to hard-hit areas. Some people had to be rescued by boat as the flooding damaged more than 100 homes, bridges and roads, interrupted drinking water systems and left more than 2,000 customers without electricity. Along the Fayette-Kanawha county line, several feet of mud made roads impassible in the Smithers area. The state Department of Environmental Protection on Wednesday issued an advisory against the recreational use of a 10-mile area downstream of the Mount Olive Correctional Center to the London Locks and Dam.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A man vacationing in the city fell to his death after a drawbridge was raised while he was walking across it. Richard Dujardin, 77, of Providence, Rhode Island, was crossing the Kilbourn Avenue Bridge in downtown Milwaukee on Monday afternoon with his wife, according to a Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office report. Rosemarie Dujardin made it across the bridge, which spans the Milwaukee River, but her husband was about halfway across when it began to open. He grabbed onto a side rail as the bridge sections rose to a 90-degree angle, but he lost his grip and fell about 70 feet to the pavement below, the report says. He suffered a head wound and was pronounced dead at the scene, investigators said. The bridge is controlled by the city’s Department of Public Works, and its two halves are raised and lowered for boat traffic by someone working remotely who has two camera views of the span. The lights and bells were operational as the two sections were raised, and crossing arms came down at each end of the bridge, according to investigators. Interim Public Works Commissioner Jerrel Kruschke said the employee who operated the bridge is in his fourth year and has conducted hundreds of bridge openings. He said the employee has been put on leave and offered counseling.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon has a clear path to reelection after winning the Republican primary Tuesday, while state Rep. Chuck Gray won the GOP primary for secretary of state. Megan Degenfelder defeated incumbent Brian Schroeder in the GOP primary for state superintendent of public instruction. Democrats, meanwhile, have all but ceded these offices to Republicans, fielding just two candidates who don’t even have websites for governor and just one candidate for state superintendent. Gordon had faced fierce opposition within the GOP for public health measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus, causing speculation he’d face a tough primary challenge. He didn’t, after lifting a statewide mask mandate and other coronavirus restrictions. Last year, Gordon urged the National Rifle Association to move its headquarters from Virginia to Wyoming. In March, he signed a ban on most abortions that briefly took effect a month after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and is now on hold pending a lawsuit contesting the ban. Both moves helped buttress Gordon’s right-wing credentials. And while Gordon hasn’t gone out of his way to praise Donald Trump, neither has he criticized the ex-president’s fixation on the false belief that fraud cost him reelection in 2020. Gordon on Tuesday defeated Brent Bien, a retired U.S. Marine Corps colonel who oversaw operations in Guam.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/politics/biden-state-of-the-union-2022-transcript/index.html", "title": "READ: President Biden's State of the Union address transcript | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivered his 2022 State of the Union address on Tuesday. Here’s his speech as prepared for delivery and released by the White House.\n\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.\n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.\n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans.\n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.\n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.\n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.\n\nHe met the Ukrainian people.\n\nFrom President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.\n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nIn this struggle as President Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.\n\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.\n\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.\n\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.\n\nThey keep moving.\n\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.\n\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.\n\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations.\n\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.\n\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.\n\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.\n\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.\n\nWe prepared extensively and carefully.\n\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.\n\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.\n\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.\n\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.\n\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.\n\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.\n\nTogether with our allies – we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.\n\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.\n\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.\n\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\n\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.\n\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.\n\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze – on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value.\n\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame.\n\nTogether with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.\n\nWe are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.\n\nAnd we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.\n\nLet me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\n\nFor that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\n\nAs I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.\n\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.\n\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.\n\nAnd a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.\n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.\n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.\n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.\n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.\n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\n\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.\n\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.\n\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.\n\nThis is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.\n\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.\n\nHe will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.\n\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced.\n\nThe pandemic has been punishing.\n\nAnd so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.\n\nI understand.\n\nI remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it.\n\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.\n\nBecause people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did.\n\nFew pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.\n\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat Covid-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.\n\nHelped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance.\n\nAnd as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room.\n\nAnd unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind.\n\nAnd it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs.\n\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year\n\nthan ever before in the history of America.\n\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.\n\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else.\n\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century.\n\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.\n\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up\n\nand the middle out, not from the top down.\n\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well.\n\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth.\n\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world.\n\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that.\n\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history.\n\nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen.\n\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks.\n\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade.\n\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.\n\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people.\n\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America.\n\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice.\n\nWe’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities.\n\n4,000 projects have already been announced.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\n\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs.\n\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure.\n\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century\n\nto make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses.\n\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it.\n\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America.\n\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors.\n\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\n\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it.\n\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land.\n\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built.\n\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”.\n\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs.\n\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives.\n\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent.\n\nBut that’s just the beginning.\n\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from\n\n$20 billion to $100 billion.\n\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history.\n\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.\n\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.\n\nAnd we will really take off.\n\nAnd Intel is not alone.\n\nThere’s something happening in America.\n\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story.\n\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.\n\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas.\n\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country.\n\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year.\n\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.\n\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.”\n\nIt’s time.\n\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.\n\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel.\n\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.\n\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories.\n\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains.\n\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up.\n\nLook at cars.\n\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy.\n\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up.\n\nSo—we have a choice.\n\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\n\nI have a better plan to fight inflation.\n\nLower your costs, not your wages.\n\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America.\n\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America.\n\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America.\n\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America.\n\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.\n\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”\n\nI call it building a better America.\n\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.\n\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan:\n\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in 10 Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.\n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.\n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom.\n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.\n\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be.\n\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.\n\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.\n\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does.\n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.\n\nSecond - cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\n\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.\n\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.\n\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.\n\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work.\n\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.\n\nAll of these will lower costs.\n\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.\n\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.\n\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share.\n\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.\n\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.\n\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.\n\nThat’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.\n\nSo that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families.\n\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\n\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\n\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted.\n\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back.\n\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\n\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.\n\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.\n\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition.\n\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism.\n\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices.\n\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under.\n\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America.\n\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits.\n\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.\n\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.\n\nThat ends on my watch.\n\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect.\n\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees.\n\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.\n\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\n\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.\n\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.\n\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.\n\nFor more than two years, Covid-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.\n\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted.\n\nBut I also know this.\n\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say\n\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.\n\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against Covid-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.\n\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines.\n\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.\n\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks.\n\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, Covid-19 need no longer control our lives.\n\nI know some are talking about “living with Covid-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with Covid-19.\n\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard.\n\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.\n\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection.\n\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children.\n\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do.\n\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get Covid-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.\n\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 million pills this month and more than double that next month.\n\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\n\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\n\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward.\n\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.\n\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from Covidtests.gov starting next week.\n\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants.\n\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.\n\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed.\n\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\n\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.\n\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.\n\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\n\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.\n\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely.\n\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks.\n\nOf course, continuing this costs money.\n\nI will soon send Congress a request.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.\n\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.\n\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation.\n\nAnd we won’t stop.\n\nWe have lost so much to Covid-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.\n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at Covid-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.\n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.\n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on Covid-19 and other issues we must face together.\n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.\n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old.\n\nOfficer Rivera was 22.\n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.\n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time.\n\nI know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\n\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice.\n\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.\n\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\n\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.\n\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.\n\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced.\n\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon?\n\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued.\n\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.\n\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault.\n\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections.\n\nWe cannot let this happen.\n\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.\n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.\n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.\n\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system.\n\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.\n\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\n\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.\n\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\n\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours.\n\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\n\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.\n\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do.\n\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nLet’s get it done once and for all.\n\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women.\n\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before.\n\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America.\n\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong.\n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\n\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\n\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\n\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.\n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\n\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\n\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\n\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.\n\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\n\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\n\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\n\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.\n\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\n\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care.\n\nThird, support our veterans.\n\nVeterans are the best of us.\n\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.\n\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\n\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\n\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.\n\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.\n\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness.\n\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\n\nI know.\n\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.\n\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.\n\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can.\n\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\n\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.\n\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\n\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\n\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter.\n\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body.\n\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end.\n\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she.\n\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.\n\nTonight, Danielle—we are.\n\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\n\nI’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve.\n\nAnd fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it.\n\nThis is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you.\n\nCancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease.\n\nLast month, I announced our plan to supercharge\n\nthe Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.\n\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.\n\nMore support for patients and families.\n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.\n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.\n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more.\n\nA unity agenda for the nation.\n\nWe can do this.\n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight, we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy.\n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.\n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.\n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.\n\nNow is the hour.\n\nOur moment of responsibility.\n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.\n\nWell I know this nation.\n\nWe will meet the test.\n\nTo protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity.\n\nWe will save democracy.\n\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.\n\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp.\n\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity.\n\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity.\n\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.\n\nSo on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union.\n\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong.\n\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago.\n\nAnd we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.\n\nNow is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time.\n\nAnd we will, as one people.\n\nOne America.\n\nThe United States of America.\n\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/26/remembrance-run-lucy-elephant-pasty-fest-news-around-states/118472418/", "title": "Remembrance Run, Lucy the Elephant: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Legislators on Tuesday took the first formal steps in a process that could eliminate racist language in the state constitution and perhaps make the heavily amended document more readable. The Committee on the Recompilation of the Constitution met for the first time Tuesday morning to hear a presentation on ways to reorganize local amendments. The panel, which will carry out the decrees of a constitutional amendment approved by voters last November, should take up racist language at its first meeting in September. “It’s for citizens to know what laws apply to them,” said Othni Lathram, director of the Legislative Services Agency, adding that “750-plus of the 970-some odd amendments apply in only one county or one city.” The committee could consider retaining the current chronological organization of the amendments or organizing them by county or topic. The 1901 Alabama Constitution disenfranchised Black Alabamians and poor whites, and supporters made explicitly racist appeals to white voters to enact it. Most of the racist aspects therein have been nullified by amendments or court decisions. But previous efforts to remove the language have foundered over questions about a desegregation-era provision saying Alabama “did not recognize any right to education or training at public expense.”\n\nAlaska\n\nDenali National Park and Preserve: Road access in a popular national park is being restricted due to a long-running landslide issue that has been exacerbated by climate change, the park announced Tuesday. The lone road through Denali National Park and Preserve spans 92 miles of interior Alaska. Nearly half it – the area west of mile 43 – closed Tuesday to nonessential vehicles, pedestrians and bikes because of unsafe conditions caused by a landslide in the Polychrome Pass area, according to a statement from the park. Buses, the main way for visitors to access the park, will continue to run to mile 42. According to the park, slides have affected the area since at least the 1960s but used to require maintenance every two to three years. “During the 1990s, the landslide, which occurs below the roadbed, only caused small cracks in the road surface,” the statement said. “However, by 2018 the slumping increased to almost half an inch per day, and then to three and a half inches per day by August 2020.” Rains earlier this month appear to have caused the rate to increase significantly, with much of the landslide moving downhill at more than 10 inches per day, the park said. Climate change “has taken what was previously a problem solved by maintenance staff performing road repairs and made a challenge too difficult to overcome with short-term solutions,” it said.\n\nArizona\n\nDouglas: Several metal floodgates in the newly built section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall in easternmost Arizona were ripped off their hinges last week by flooding from unusually heavy monsoon rains, authorities say. A spokesman for the Border Patrol’s Tucson sector confirmed the gates were open last week when water from the historic rainfall rushed through the Douglas area near the San Bernardino Wildlife Refuge in Cochise County. He said a Border Patrol team was assessing flood damage along the wall. An official with Customs and Border Protection said authorities planned to repair the damage. Floodgates are located in areas along the border to prevent boulders, branches and other debris from building up during rains. Border Patrol agents typically open the gates when major rainfall is expected. “The rainfall this year is far above normal,” said forecaster Aaron Hardin of the National Weather Service office in Tucson. He said the Tucson area had already seen about 11.8inches of rainfall, compared with about 1.6 inches during the current monsoon season that began June 15 and runs through Sept. 30.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state ran out of intensive care unit beds for COVID-19 patients Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced, as a surge in cases continued overwhelming hospitals. The state’s ICU capacity for COVID-19 patients barely eased hours after Hutchinson’s announcement, with only one hospital in southeast Arkansas showing availability, according to the state’s system for coordinating coronavirus patients, who were filling about half of the state’s ICU beds. “Everyone should know the strain this puts on our hospitals and the need to get our vaccinations and how critical our bed space is,” Hutchinson said. Arkansas Department of Health Chief of Staff Renee Mallory said one hospital planned to open additional beds later Tuesday and possibly later in the week. “For us, it is much more difficult to coordinate these transfer requests,” said Jeff Tabor, program manager for Arkansas COVIDComm, the state’s system for matching COVID-19 patients with hospitals. “The patients during the summer surge are so much sicker than during the winter surge.” Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. It has one of the lowest vaccination rates, with 40% of the population fully inoculated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A state agency didn’t properly distribute federal relief funds meant to help homeless residents during the coronavirus pandemic, and the mismanagement was so prolonged that local organizations may lose the money because of missed deadlines, auditors said Tuesday. After receiving $316 million under the federal CARES Act to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on unhoused people, the California Department of Housing and Community Development “did not take critical steps to ensure those funds promptly benefited that population,” the state auditor’s office said in a report. The department was in charge of distributing the funds to local groups that collaborate on homeless services and prevention under the so-called continuum of care. It took so long to finalize contracts that the local entities did not have access to much of the funding during the height of the pandemic, auditors found. “Recognizing it lacked the capacity to manage this emergency funding, the department hired a contractor to manage the program although it did not do so until 14 months after the CARES Act passed” in March 2020, the report said. Because the local groups did not have access to the money in a prompt manner, they may struggle to spend the full allocations within federally mandated time frames and lose the funding, auditors concluded.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A couple whose young dog was shot by a police officer has filed a lawsuit accusing his supervisors of covering up what happened and claiming the city has fostered a culture that encourages the use of force. In body camera footage released Wednesday, two dogs run toward Officer Matthew Grashorn as he gets out of his patrol car while responding to a trespassing report in an empty parking lot in June 2019. Grashorn raises his gun. One of the dogs stops and begins to turn back, in response to calls from owners Wendy Love and Jay Hamm, according to the lawsuit. The younger one continues toward the officer and is shot, falling to the ground. After asking for permission from Grashorn, Love rushes to the wounded dog, but Grashorn warns her, as she cries, that he could bite her because he’s hurt. She also asks for permission to take him to a veterinarian, but that is not allowed to until about eight minutes later, after Grashorn’s supervisors arrive. The lawsuit claims police accused the animal of attacking Grashorn and charged Hamm with having a dangerous dog to justify the shooting after Hamm said he would talk to the media about what happened. The charge was later dropped, the suit says. According to the lawsuit, Grashorn did not announce himself because he wanted to surprise the couple.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 2,066 restauranteurs across the state are “stuck in limbo,” waiting to see if there are going to be enough federal COVID-19 assistance funds to cover applications totaling more than $489 million, a business group said Tuesday. The Connecticut Restaurant Association, the National Restaurant Association and state restaurant associations across the U.S. sent a letter to congressional leaders Tuesday, asking them to replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. Nationally, there are approximately 177,000 applications for financial relief still pending. “The small gains that our industry has made toward financial security are in danger of being wiped out, dashing the hopes of communities, entrepreneurs, and consumers nationwide,” according to the letter. A recent survey conducted by the national group found a majority of adults changed their restaurant use as the delta variant of the coronavirus has become more prominent in the country, such as not going out to eat, canceling plans, and ordering takeout instead of sitting inside. Scott Dolch, executive director of the Connecticut Restaurant Association, said the rise of the variant threatens to push the state’s financially struggling restaurants toward permanently closing their doors.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s largest two-day outdoor cultural event, the Brandywine Festival of the Arts, returns next month, celebrating its 60th birthday. The festival, which averages 15,000 guests annually, is scheduled for Sept. 11-12 and will feature work from about 200 artists across a variety of mediums such as photography, woodwork, fabric, painting, pottery, sculpture and jewelry. This year’s featured artist, painter Sandy Askey-Adams, has been exhibiting at BFA for more than 20 years. At least 30 of this year’s exhibitors are emerging artists – young professionals who are new to the fest or have exhibited for fewer than three years, according to Barry Schlecker, proprietor of Barry’s Events and producer of the festival since 2010. “The festival offers a great opportunity to fill your home – or your yard or your jewelry box – with a tremendous selection of original art,” Schlecker said. “And our two-day admission policy means you can browse on Saturday and come back Sunday to make your final selections, all for one low price.” The event at Brandywine Park will run from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $5 for both days; children under 12 accompanied by an adult are admitted free. Dogs on leashes are welcome.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: U.S. Capitol Police didn’t adequately respond to frantic calls for help from officers when they pressed panic buttons on their radios seeking immediate backup as scores of pro-Trump rioters beat officers with bats, poles and other weapons, an inspector general’s report found. The report obtained by the Associated Press offered new details about the shortcomings by law enforcement during the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. The inspector general found that most of the emergency activations from individual officers’ radios were never simulcast on police radio, a standard protocol designed to spread the word to other officers about emergencies and crises. The on-duty watch commander appears not to have been made aware of at least some of the system activations, the report said. Police officials in Washington are increasingly concerned about a rally planned for Sept. 18 on federal land next to the Capitol that organizers have said is meant to demand “justice” for the hundreds of people already charged in connection with January’s insurrection. “Without the ability to connect with help or request reinforcements during emergencies, officers are at risk of facing dangerous or even deadly situations,” the report said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Just over half of the state’s 2.8 million public school students now face mandates to wear masks in classrooms as a courtroom battle continues over efforts by Gov. Ron DeSantis to leave such decisions up to parents. A majority of school board members in Orange County told the superintendent Tuesday to require most students to wear masks and agreed with her recommendation to keep the mandate through Oct. 30. The district began its school year this month with a parental opt-out, but a surge in students across the Orlando area testing positive for the coronavirus has disrupted classes. At least 10 school boards making up some of the largest districts in Florida are now defying the DeSantis administration’s attempt to ban local school masking rules. The Orange County board also said it wants to challenge the legality of a Florida Department of Health rule enforcing the ban. In Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday, the Broward County School Board told the Department of Education that it won’t back down on its mask policy, which gives parents a medical opt-out for students. The board said parents don’t have an unlimited right to send their kids to school without a mask, which would infringe on the rights of other parents who want their children to be safe.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A new grant will be used to train law enforcement officers to draw blood from drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, state officials said. The Georgia Governor’s Office of Highway Safety said it has received an impaired driving grant of about $44,000 that it plans to use to establish a phlebotomy program. The agency said the funds will pay for training of state and local officers as well as for blood-drawing equipment. The office said training officers to draw blood will help in the prosecution of DUI cases because it will provide critical toxicology evidence. “A blood test is often the key piece of evidence needed to convict a DUI driver in court, but the barriers law enforcement officers are facing in getting blood drawn during a DUI investigation are resulting in too many of these cases going to trial without any toxicology evidence,” Allen Poole, director of the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety, said in a news release. Getting blood evidence as soon as possible provides a more accurate measure of a driver’s blood alcohol level, the agency said. The training for officers is set to include 10 hours of online training and 32 hours of classroom training. After completing the program, the officers will have the same qualifications as phlebotomists in hospitals, doctors’ offices and other medical facilities.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Geologists said Tuesday that they had detected a swarm of earthquakes at the Kilauea volcano, though it is not erupting. The quakes began overnight and continued into the morning, The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said. More than 140 earthquakes were recorded as of 4:30 a.m. The largest was magnitude 3.3. Most were less than magnitude 1. At the same time as the swarm, scientists recorded changes to the ground surface of the volcano. That may indicate magma was moving beneath the south part of Kilauea’s caldera, the observatory said. There’s been no evidence of lava at the surface. The observatory changed its volcano alert level to watch from advisory, meaning Kilauea is showing heightened or escalating unrest with more potential for an eruption. Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes, having erupted 34 times since 1952. In 2018, about 700 homes were destroyed when lava surged through volcanic vents in a residential neighborhood during the final year of an eruption that lasted more than three decades. Kilauea is about 200 miles south of Honolulu, on the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Hospitals are bursting at the seams as coronavirus numbers continue to skyrocket across the state, prompting officials to call on residents to serve as volunteers to help keep medical facilities operating. “There’s a wide variety of positions available, a wide variety of skill sets – we need positions in every part of the state,” Elke Shaw-Tulloch, administrator for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s Division of Public Health, said Tuesday. Idaho’s situation is dire, Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said. As of Friday, the number of new COVID-19 cases statewide had increased 31% compared to the previous week, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and coronavirus-related hospital admissions had also climbed by about 30%. “We’re almost near the peak we were at in December for hospitalized patients, and we’re actually higher than we’ve ever been for the number of patients on ventilators,” Jeppesen said. People with lapsed health care licenses can get temporary authorization to work under the state’s COVID-19 response plan, and people without medical backgrounds can help with hospital housekeeping, data entry or contact tracing, Shaw-Tulloch said, by signing up on a new website, VolunteerIdaho.com.\n\nIllinois\n\nUrbana: A new administrator at the University of Illinois flagship campus will advise school leadership on Native American issues. Jacki Thompson Rand was appointed the Urbana-Champaign campus’ associate vice chancellor for Native affairs last week. Chancellor Robert Jones pledged that the school will “go beyond the rhetoric of celebrating Native American history and culture to actually doing it.” Rand, a professor of history, is an enrolled citizen of the Choctaw nation of Oklahoma, The News-Gazette reports. She previously taught at the University of Iowa. Jones, who’s now in his sixth year as chancellor, has pushed the Urbana-Champaign campus to change its relationship with Native American imagery and nations. Prior projects include campus and community discussions of the retired Chief Illiniwek mascot, creation of the Commission on Native Imagery and ongoing work to build connections with Native American nations.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue Pete, with his blank stare and disproportionately large head, has been named the creepiest mascot among NCAA Division I football teams. The figure known to scare kids received the dishonor in a survey this month from Quality Logo Products Blog. The dubious accolades didn’t stop there. Purdue Pete was also named second-worst among the 128 mascots judged in categories that included “The Sexiest College Mascots in America” and “The Most Offensive College Mascots in America.” In addition to being named the creepiest college mascot, Pete was an honorable mention in the “unsexiest” in America. The distinction may not come as a surprise to Purdue University or Boilermaker fans. Purdue Pete has undergone five makeovers, according to the school, since he first appeared in University Bookstore ads in 1940. In 2010, the university attempted a remake of the mascot after reports he was frightening children. “Look, I’m the one who gets the phone calls from parents who say that big face scares their 3-year-old,” the late Purdue Athletic Director Morgan Burke said at the time. “It’s been 25 to 30 years since he got a makeover. At some point, the poor old guy has to come into the 21st century.” But as with New Coke, the makeover didn’t go over well, and old Purdue Pete ultimately reemerged.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A proposed class-action lawsuit claims Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision to cut off enhanced unemployment benefits for tens of thousands of residents violated state law and asks a court to reinstate their eligibility. The lawsuit, filed this week in Polk County, seeks to make claimants eligible for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in jobless aid they have been denied since Iowa dropped federal pandemic benefit programs June 12. Reynolds, a Republican, announced in May that Iowa would end participation in federal programs that provided an extra $300 per week and expanded eligibility criteria. She cited a “severe workforce shortage,” saying the move would encourage people to return to work. The lawsuit claims the decision violated a law that says Iowa’s workforce agency “shall cooperate with the United States Department of Labor to the fullest extent” necessary in order “to secure to this state and its citizens all advantages available” under federal unemployment programs. The suit notes that the Iowa law calls economic insecurity caused by unemployment “a serious menace to the health, morals and welfare” of residents. “The Legislature decided it was a serious menace. Unfortunately, the governor appears to be treating it like it’s an inconvenience to big business,” attorney B.J. Stoltze Jr. said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state now appears to be the site of the first documented COVID-19 death in the United States, coming months earlier than long suspected. Updated records from the National Center for Health Statistics currently show that the first death from the coronavirus in the country happened the week ending Jan. 11, 2020, and that there was only one COVID-19 death that week. Kansas has also recently revised its records to show a single COVID-19 death Jan. 9, 2020. Coroners and other medical professionals responsible for determining causes of death could still conclude that the pandemic had begun to kill people in the country even earlier. That reflects how little was known about the virus in the early weeks and months of the pandemic. Virtually no testing was available. Scientists were still learning about the novel coronavirus and its spread around the world. Jan. 9, 2020, was the same day the World Health Organization announced a cluster of coronavirus cases in patients hospitalized with pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The revelation came from updated death certificates reviewed by the states and reported to the federal government. The January cases were originally reported by The (San Jose) Mercury News.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: With legislative Republicans now largely at the helm of handling the state’s response to an ever-surging pandemic, Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers on Tuesday announced a campaign that includes free “I took the shot” wristbands and pizza coupons to boost COVID-19 vaccinations in his home of Clay County, where only about 32% of the residents are inoculated against the deadly disease. The campaign, eight months after the first vaccines arrived in Kentucky, comes amid lagging immunizations rates in many counties and a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the delta variant that threatens to overrun hospitals with mostly unvaccinated patients. It also comes as GOP lawmakers are ready to flex new power that comes with a state Supreme Court ruling Saturday that cut the emergency authority of Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, and gave more to Republicans, who control the Legislature. “These are the types of things we’re looking at,” said Stivers, who had hinted at GOP plans for the state at large in comments Monday. “This is the direction we think we should go. We think it can be successful.” The plan drew immediate praise from the Republican Party of Kentucky, but Democrats were not impressed, quickly deriding the pizza incentive as not going nearly far enough to save lives.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Students who took part in the state’s program for 4-year-olds from low-income households showed benefits throughout high school, according to a new study that reviewed the performance of the program’s students. The Advocate reports the study, released by the Council for a Better Louisiana, compared students in the taxpayer-financed LA 4 program with children who did not attend prekindergarten classes. The review, which focused on 40,000 students, showed the LA 4 children outperformed their peers in most subjects in the fourth and eighth grade and in high school. The prekindergarten children scored higher on the ACT college readiness test and were 45% less likely to be placed in special education programs. The study also showed 88% of LA 4 children graduated from high school, compared to the statewide average of 79%. “There is such a consistent pattern of good news, year after year, about improved academic achievement in the children who received LA 4,” Sharon Ramey, a professor of psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience and human development at Virginia Tech, said in a statement.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: A new fixture at the state’s agricultural fairs – alongside the harness racing, farm animals and food – is the COVID-19 vaccination clinic. And health care workers say any dose delivered is a victory. Relatively few shots have been given so far at fairs in Skowhegan and Bangor, but many have gone to vulnerable or previously skeptical Mainers. Craig Moore, 50, of Sumner, rolled up his sleeve at the 203rd Skowhegan State Fair. Moore said he’d just been told by his doctor that he should get the shot because his liver condition makes him vulnerable to the coronavirus. “You always hear about side effects, and with my liver failure, I’m not sure how I’ll react,” he said told the Bangor Daily News. “But my doctor told me I should.” Clinics will continue this fair season. A clinic run by the University of New England School of Pharmacy and Northern Light Health gave out vaccines at the Bangor State Fair. The Union Fair that begins Thursday will offer a clinic, too.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Members of Gov. Larry Hogan’s staff have tested positive for the coronavirus, but Hogan and Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford both tested negative, the governor’s office said Tuesday. Spokesman Mike Ricci said four members of the governor’s staff tested positive, The Washington Post reports. All members of the governor’s staff are fully vaccinated, Ricci said. The Daily Record first reported the news of the positive tests among Hogan’s staff. Those with the virus were quarantining in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol. The governor’s office also said contact tracing was being conducted. Hogan, a cancer survivor, announced Sunday that he had received a third shot of a COVID-19 vaccine last week. The Maryland Association of Counties announced Tuesday that “several” attendees at the organization’s conference in Ocean City tested positive for the coronavirus. The annual event draws officials from around the state and wrapped up Saturday. Both Hogan and Rutherford recently attended parts of the conference, but Ricci declined to say whether the governor’s staff members who tested positive were at the conference.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group of Nantucket residents filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday to block the construction of dozens of wind turbines off the coast of the famous island resort and nearby Martha’s Vineyard. ACK Residents Against Turbines say Vineyard Wind’s proposed project 14 miles south of the island poses a risk to the endangered Northern Atlantic right whale. Mary Chalke, an island resident and member of the group, said the lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and other federal agencies isn’t just about Vineyard Wind but the consequences of greenlighting other turbine projects also in the pipeline. “We all want renewable energy,” she said after the group filed the suit in Boston federal court. “This represents the transformation and industrialization of a pristine natural environment.” BOEM and other federal agencies have determined that the wind project will have minimal impact on the species. But Vallorie Oliver, an island resident and member of the group, argues federal officials haven’t provided adequate research to back up their claims in more than two years of reviewing the project. “We’re simply asking for real science-based answers to the impact on our natural environment,” she said alongside other group members in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse.\n\nMichigan\n\nCalumet: A festival dedicated to the most famous food of the Upper Peninsula returned to town after a year off because of the pandemic. Sean Nichols won the pasty-eating contest by eating nearly three Saturday in Calumet. People in pasty costumes marched during a parade. And a local curling club rolled rutabagas, The Daily Mining Gazette reports. “The rutabagas are all misshapen, so getting them to stop was hard,” Jared Maggio said of the vegetables. “It was a spectacle, but it was fun.” Calumet, population roughly 750, is known for its copper mining history, and pasties were commonly eaten by miners. They typically are made with meat and potatoes stuffed into a pastry crust. During the pasty-eating contest, the six participants could use water or ketchup. “You’re not going to use gravy because that’s an abomination in my eyes,” said organizer Rebekka Mikkola. Nichols was stuffed. “The second and third ones I was given – they were double the size of the first one,” the victor said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear an appeal by opponents of Enbridge Energy’s Line 3 oil pipeline, letting stand a key decision by independent regulators to allow construction on the project to proceed. Without comment, the high court declined to take the case, issuing a one-page order that effectively affirmed a decision in June by the Minnesota Court of Appeals. And it left the Native American and environmental groups that have been protesting at construction sites across northern Minnesota with a dwindling number of legal options. The Court of Appeals declared that the state’s Public Utilities Commission correctly granted Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge a certificate of need and route permit for the 337-mile Minnesota segment of what’s a larger project to replace an aging crude oil pipeline built in the 1960s that can run at only half-capacity. The Supreme Court’s decision Tuesday dismayed the opponents, who cited the impacts of climate change being felt around the world and the drought in Minnesota. They have long argued that the line violates treaties and threatens waters where wild rice grows, and they fret that the oil it carries will aggravate global warming.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s top health official said Tuesday that he has received threats from people who are spreading lies about his family as he urges the public to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The state has seen a rapid increase in cases since early July, driven by the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus and the state’s low vaccination rate. Dr. Thomas Dobbs has been imploring people for months to get inoculated. “I have received some threatening phone calls and want to clarify any confusion there may be with some conspiracy theories going around,” Dobbs wrote on Twitter. Dobbs said one lie is that his son, who is also a physician, receives a World Bank-funded kickback when Dobbs urges people to get vaccinated. “I get zero $ from promoting vaccination,” Dobbs wrote. More than 1,000 out-of-state medical workers were starting to deploy to 50 Mississippi hospitals Tuesday to help with staffing shortages amid the COVID-19 surge. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said 808 nurses, three certified nurse anesthetists, 22 nurse practitioners, 193 respiratory therapists and 20 paramedics were hired under 60-day contracts that could be extended, if needed.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit Tuesday that seeks to stop school districts from enforcing mask mandates aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19. The action drew a rebuke from President Joe Biden, who finds such lawsuits “unacceptable,” his press secretary said. The lawsuit names Columbia Public Schools along with the district’s Board of Education and board members but is a class-action suit that “would apply to school districts across the state that have a mask mandate for schoolchildren,” said Chris Nuelle, a spokesman for Schmitt. The new school year began Monday in several districts across Missouri, and with the delta variant causing a big spike in coronavirus numbers, more than four dozen districts are requiring students, teachers and staff to wear face coverings. The lawsuit by Schmitt, a Republican, cites the low death rate among school-age children. “We filed this suit today because we fundamentally don’t believe in forced masking, rather that parents and families should have the power to make decisions on masks, based on science and facts,” Schmitt said in a news release. Spokeswoman Michelle Baumstark said the Columbia district is “extremely disappointed,” saying the mandate is “not a forever decision” but is currently necessary to keep students safe.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A state law is limiting health departments’ ability to issue quarantine orders as a wave of COVID-19 cases threatens Montana’s health care system. The law passed by the GOP-dominated Legislature and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte last spring bans discrimination based on people’s vaccination records, putting vaccine status alongside sex and race as a protected class in the state’s human rights law. Local health departments in some of the most populous counties decided last week that they would no longer issue quarantine orders for people who come in close contact with people who’ve tested positive for the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that vaccinated people not be required to quarantine. Facing the choice of either quarantining all close contacts or none, health officials in Lewis and Clark, Butte Silver Bow, Cascade, and Gallatin counties decided they would no longer issue quarantine orders for anyone, regardless of whether they have gotten COVID-19 shots. Just over 50% of eligible Montana residents have been inoculated against the disease. But in Missoula, health officials decided Tuesday to keep following CDC guidance at the risk of violating state law.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s veterans affairs agency is facing questions from a lawmaker after it published job advertisements for nurses touting the fact that Nebraska doesn’t require its employees to get COVID-19 shots. The ads on a state jobs website prominently note the lack of vaccination requirements for state employees, right after mentioning a $5,000 hiring bonus. In a separate mail advertisement, the state lists “No mandated COVID-19 vaccination” as one of the “many great benefits” of its nursing jobs. State Sen. Carol Blood, of Bellevue, said she inquired about the ad after constituents with loved ones in Nebraska’s state-run veterans homes brought it to her attention. Blood said she understands that the state faces a chronic nursing shortage but is concerned because many veterans home residents are elderly and sick. “It almost appears as if we saw this as an opportunity to scoop up people who don’t want to be vaccinated,” said Blood, whose district includes the Eastern Nebraska Veterans’ Home. “I don’t know if that’s a really good strategy.” The listings were posted shortly before Nebraska’s largest hospital systems jointly announced that they will require their employees to get vaccinated.\n\nNevada\n\nYerington: A high school senior and his family organized a run across the high desert from Carson City to Yerington to honor the memories of ancestors who were removed from their families and sent to the Stewart Indian School. The significance of his “Remembrance Run” didn’t sink in until Ku Stevens was finishing up the two-day, 50-mile trek. The school that operated on the south edge of Carson City from 1890 to 1980 was one of about 350 across the U.S. and Canada created to force the assimilation of Native Americans. Stevens’ great-grandfather, Frank “Togo” Quinn, escaped from the school three times – the first when he was 8 years old, finding his way back to his family more than a century ago. “Running down that hill and seeing my valley and seeing my home and my people’s land out here, goosebumps all the way down,” Stevens said after he finished the run Aug. 15. “Thinking what it would be like to be a kid, coming over those hills and trying to get here. Realizing you’re safe, at least until they come to get you again.” Stevens, a national-caliber track athlete who runs cross-country for Yerington High, reflected on how much more difficult it would have been in 1913. “They didn’t have Gatorade,” he said. “It was a hard journey. So many of them did it multiple times. So many of them tried to do it, and some of them didn’t make it. It was a brutal reality back then.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The U.S. Secret Service is investigating the theft of $2.3 million from the town of Peterborough by foreign thieves using fake email addresses. Town officials said Monday that the investigation began July 26 when they learned the ConVal School District had not received its $1.2 million monthly transfer from the town. On Aug. 18, they realized another $1.2 million meant to go to a general contractor working on a bridge construction project was similarly diverted. “It pains us to inform the residents and taxpayers of Peterborough that like so many other towns and cities, we have fallen victim to an internet-based crime that has defrauded our taxpayers,” Select Board Chair Tyler Ward and Town Administrator Nicole MacStay said in a statement. Officials said investigators have identified email exchanges between the town’s finance department staff and thieves posing as school district staff using forged documents and email accounts. Bank transfers meant to go to the construction contractor were diverted through similar means, and the investigation showed that the email exchanges originated overseas. The money can’t be recovered by reversing the transactions, and officials don’t yet know whether the losses will be covered by insurance.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate: Beach-side landmark Lucy the Elephant is having all of its metal skin replaced because more than 50% of its exterior has degraded beyond repair. The six-story-high elephant statue in Margate will close Sept. 20 after architects determined it would be more cost-effective to replace the metal siding than to try to restore it, according to Richard Helfant, executive director of the Save Lucy Committee. Built in 1881, Lucy was saved from demolition and moved a short distance from its original location in 1970. The National Historic Landmark on the Jersey Shore is one of the oldest roadside attractions in the country. The new overhaul will cost $1.4 million and is funded in part by a grant from the Preserve New Jersey Preservation Fund administered by the New Jersey Historic Trust, Helfant said Tuesday. During restorations, a weatherproof scaffolding will be built around Lucy. The target for reopening is Memorial Day 2022, Helfant said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order Wednesday making New Mexico the latest Western state to join an ambitious effort to conserve nearly one-third of America’s lands and waters by 2030. The Biden administration detailed its plans in May for achieving the goal, saying conservation and restoration of lands and waters was an urgent priority. Democratic officials and environmentalists see the effort as a tool to increase green space, protect drinking water sources and reduce wildfires risks. To make significant progress on the decadelong commitment, experts have said that Western states must play a key role in the effort. Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, said she wants to “bring people together” in New Mexico for the initiative that she hopes will make a difference for decades to come. Her executive order calls for the creation of committee made up of key state agencies and others to draft a plan for reaching the goal. The group will meet four times a year and report back annually to the governor. “I just want action,” Lujan Grisham said before signing the order, “but if you don’t have a guide … we’re not going to get every opportunity that we deserve.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Delivering another blow to what’s left of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s legacy, the new governor acknowledged on her first day in office that the state has had nearly 12,000 more deaths from COVID-19 than Cuomo told the public. “The public deserves a clear, honest picture of what’s happening. And that’s whether it’s good or bad, they need to know the truth. And that’s how we restore confidence,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said on NPR. In its first daily update on the outbreak Tuesday evening, Hochul’s office reported that nearly 55,400 people have died of the coronavirus in New York based on death certificate data submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s up from about 43,400 that Cuomo reported to the public as of Monday, his last day in office. The higher number is not entirely new. Federal health officials and some academic institutions tracking COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have been using the higher tally for many months because of known gaps in the data Cuomo had been choosing to publicize. But Hochul, who was lieutenant governor before being propelled to the state’s highest office, said it is vital to be fully transparent about the numbers. “There’s a lot of things that weren’t happening, and I’m going to make them happen,” she said Wednesday on MSNBC.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A state Senate hearing on how racial concepts are taught in classrooms devolved into chaos Tuesday when one of North Carolina’s highest-ranking Republicans shouted at a prominent Democratic lawmaker and stormed out of the room. Despite the uproar, the Senate Education Committee ultimately advanced the measure, which would bar teachers from compelling students to personally adopt any of 13 beliefs. North Carolina is one of more than two dozen states where GOP lawmakers have moved to define how racism and sexism can be taught in schools. An hour before the hearing, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson held a news conference with other top Republicans and released an 831-page task force report highlighting instances when teachers allegedly assigned inappropriate reading materials on racism and sexuality to young pupils. Democrats on the committee grilled Robinson, saying he and other Republicans could not identify a single case in which the bill – if signed into law – would prevent such cases of “indoctrination” from taking place. Senate Democratic Whip Jay Chaudhuri accused Robinson and his task force of threatening educators, saying legislators were wasting time “debating a Fox News-driven issue that’s more about fearmongering and has turned into a fishing expedition of our public school teachers.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Residents are sharing personal experiences and painful stories of loss due to COVID-19 as part of a public education campaign aimed in part at boosting the state’s dismal vaccination rate. The North Dakota Health Dakota Department’s “COVID-19 Impact Wall” was launched Wednesday and will feature videos and short stories from North Dakotans affected by the coronavirus. The website also is intended to serve as memorial for those who have died of the virus, Health Department spokeswoman Marie Moe said. The campaign’s rollout comes as COVID-19 cases in the state surged to the highest level of the year, driven by highly infectious delta variant that is spreading rapidly across the United States. “When people are hit with tragedy, people come together,” Moe said. “This is a place where people can come and gather and share how COVID impacted them and to share their stories of loss.” Along with testimonials, health officials said the site will provide information about COVID-19 vaccines, plus interviews with health experts on long-term effects, risk of hospitalization and death. Moe called the site a “virtual gathering place to share experiences, reflect, remember and learn.” The $775,000 federally funded public health campaign will run for two years.\n\nOhio\n\nLebanon: Nineteen people have pulled petitions to run for City Council after the community became the first in the state to enact a measure outlawing abortion. Two new activist groups favoring abortion rights – the Lebanon Handmaids and Activate: Lebanon – also have formed in Lebanon, a small city of about 21,000 people in southwest Ohio. Lebanon City Council unanimously passed an ordinance May 25 declaring Lebanon a “sanctuary city for the unborn.” The ordinance makes it illegal to provide an abortion, aid an abortion, provide money or transportation for an abortion, or provide instructions for an abortion within city limits. Lebanon has no clinic that provides abortions, so the immediate impact of the ordinance or its legality was not clear. A city governance shake-up was already brewing regardless of spirited competition for City Council. Lebanon Mayor Amy Brewer announced in August that she is retiring after a 32-year career in elective office, including the past 20 as mayor. Since its formation, the Handmaids group has affiliated with Planned Parenthood.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of coronavirus hospitalizations in the state topped 1,500 on Wednesday for the first time since January, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, as the highly contagious delta variant spreads. There were 1,578 people hospitalized due to the virus, including 416 in intensive care, with 2,534 newly reported virus cases for a total of 534,922 since the pandemic began, according to the health department. The seven-day average of new cases has increased from 2,025 on Aug. 9 to 2,271 on Tuesday, and Oklahoma is 11th in the nation in new cases per capita with 770.8 per 100,000 residents, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. State health officials have said the increase is due to both the delta variant and a low number of COVID-19 vaccinations in the state. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 42.6% of Oklahomans are fully inoculated, and 52% have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Nationwide, 51.6% of the population is fully vaccinated, and 60.9% have received at least one dose, according to the CDC.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Regardless of vaccination status, people across the state will once again be required to wear masks in most public outdoor settings – including large outdoor events where physical distancing is not possible – beginning Friday. The outdoor mask mandate, announced Tuesday by Gov. Kate Brown, is part of a growing list of statewide mandates implemented in Oregon in an attempt to slow the rapid spread of COVID-19. There was already an indoor mask rule in place. Over the past month, coronavirus cases, fueled by the highly transmissible delta variant, have overwhelmed hospitals in the Pacific Northwest state. “The Delta variant is spreading fast and wide, throwing our state into a level of crisis we have not yet seen in the pandemic. Cases and hospitalizations are at a record high,” Brown said in a statement. “Masks are a quick and simple tool we can immediately deploy to protect ourselves and our families, and quickly help stop further spread of COVID-19.” Health officials say part of the reasoning for the new mandate is that they are seeing instances in which cases are clustering around outdoor events, such as music festivals. The mandate requires masks for all individuals in outdoor settings in which individuals from different households are unable to consistently maintain physical distance.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s opioid disaster declaration was set to expire at the end of Wednesday after lawmakers, newly empowered to help manage statewide emergencies, declined the governor’s request for another extension. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf first declared a public health emergency in January 2018 after Pennsylvania set a record for opioid deaths, then renewed it more than a dozen times as the state battled an overdose epidemic that has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic. Wolf had to seek legislative approval for another extension because of a newly approved constitutional amendment limiting a governor’s emergency powers. But the GOP-led General Assembly declined to go along. “Our fight is not over,” Wolf said in a statement. “We have an obligation to support individuals desperately in need of substance use disorder services and supports. With or without a disaster declaration, this will remain a top priority of my administration.” The disaster declaration made it easier for people to get treatment, expanded the state’s prescription drug monitoring program, and established an interagency opioid “command center” to coordinate efforts. Officials had cited progress, but overdose deaths climbed again amid COVID-19. More than 5,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2020, according to the Wolf administration.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Those looking for a little culture in their lives now need to prove they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 if they want to enjoy an indoor performance, a coalition of nine of the state’s most prominent live performance venues announced Wednesday. The organizations came to the decision “to provide for the safety of their audiences, artists, staff, and volunteers, based on current scientific evidence and best practices around the country,” they said in a statement. “While great strides have been made in vaccination rates, the recent rise in cases caused by the delta variant inspired arts, cultural, and entertainment leaders to take these steps,” the venues said. In lieu of proof of vaccination, patrons can also provide proof of a negative coronavirus test within the previous 72 hours in the case of a PCR test or the previous six hours with an antigen test. All patrons, regardless of vaccination status, will also be required to wear masks at all times while inside a venue, unless eating or drinking. The organizations are the Festival Ballet Providence, Gamm Theatre, Island Moving Company, Providence Performing Arts Center, Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra & Music School, Trinity Repertory Company, United Theatre, Veteran’s Memorial Auditorium, and Wilbury Theatre Group.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld Dylann Roof’s conviction and death sentence for the 2015 racist slayings of nine members of a Black congregation, saying the legal record cannot even capture the “full horror” of what he did. A unanimous three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, rejected arguments that the young white man should have been ruled incompetent to stand trial in the shootings at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. In 2017, Roof became the first person in the U.S. sentenced to death for a federal hate crime. Authorities have said Roof opened fire during the closing prayer of a Bible study at the church, raining down dozens of bullets on those assembled. He was 21 at the time. In his appeal, Roof’s attorneys argued that he was wrongly allowed to represent himself during sentencing, a critical phase of his trial. Roof successfully prevented jurors from hearing evidence about his mental health, “under the delusion,” his attorneys argued, that “he would be rescued from prison by white-nationalists – but only, bizarrely, if he kept his mental-impairments out of the public record.” But the 4th Circuit found that the trial judge did not commit an error when he found Roof was competent to stand trial and issued a scathing rebuke of Roof’s crimes.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg will avoid a trial and take a plea deal on misdemeanor traffic charges in a crash last year in which he hit and killed a man who was walking along a rural highway, a prosecutor said Wednesday. Beadle County State’s Attorney Michael Moore, one of two prosecutors on the case, said that “there won’t be a trial, and there will be a plea entered,” but he declined to discuss further details of the arrangement. The plea will be entered Thursday, when Ravnsborg’s trial was scheduled to begin, he said. Moore said a judge’s order that bars state officials from discussing details of the investigation prevented him from disclosing more. Ravnsborg, the state’s top law enforcement officer, was charged with three misdemeanors that each carry sentences of up to 30 days in jail and up to a $500 fine. The charges don’t affect the Republican’s qualification to hold the office of attorney general in South Dakota, but lawmakers from his own party have called for him to step down and pushed for the Legislature to impeach him. The widow of Joseph Boever, the man who was killed at age 55, has indicated that she plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Ravnsborg, who initially told authorities he thought he had struck a deer or another large animal and didn’t realize he’d killed a man until the next day.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State Supreme Court Justice Roger A. Page has been elected chief justice for the high court. Page was chosen by his colleagues to lead the five-member Tennessee Supreme Court, the state court system said in a news release Tuesday. Page’s term begins Sept. 1. He’ll succeed Jeff Bivins, who has served as chief justice since September 2016, the state court system said. Page was elected circuit court judge in 1998 for the 26th Judicial District, which includes the counties of Chester, Henderson and Madison. He was appointed to the Court of Criminal Appeals in 2011 by then-Gov. Bill Haslam. Haslam appointed Page to the state Supreme Court in 2016. Page is scheduled to be sworn in at the Madison County Criminal Justice Complex on Sept. 1. The event will be livestreamed.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Hospital systems are increasingly closing their off-site emergency rooms temporarily and sending their staff to their hospitals to support staff overstretched by COVID-19. Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston closed three suburban emergency rooms Monday in Kingwood, Spring and Sienna to help ease the burden on its hospital staffs, it said in a statement. St. Luke’s Health in Houston has closed its Conroe ER to help meet surging admissions at its hospital in nearby The Woodlands. Texas Health Hospital Rockwall, near Dallas, has closed its free-standing ER to help its hospital ER. An air-conditioned tent also has been erected outside the hospital to accommodate 10-15 overflow patients, according to a hospital statement. Hunt Regional Healthcare has closed its ER in Commerce to supplement the staff at its flagship hospital in nearby Greenville. About 93% of intensive care unit beds in Texas hospitals were filled Tuesday, with 51% taken by COVID-19 patients, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Meanwhile, COVID-19 patients filled the most hospital beds in more than seven months. “Our hospitals are ... pulling all the levers to extend their abilities, but even if we have the space, we don’t have the staff,” Texas Hospital Association spokeswoman Carrie Williams said.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Another petroglyph has been defaced, the Utah Bureau of Land Management said Wednesday, adding to a rash of petroglyph vandalism in the city this year. BLM Utah said a concerned citizen found the defacing in Mill Creek Canyon and sent a tip to the agency. Officials were dispatched to the scene and completed an emergency treatment, a Wednesday tweet said. Now, they are looking for who is responsible. The vandalism, which appears to be scratched into the red rock, says: “Petroglyphs Taylor Trey Wes Travis Aug. 3, 2021.” Though the emergency treatment removed or faded most of the words, a side-by-side comparison shows “TL 2021” still appears next to a piece of the art. In April, the 1,000-year-old Sunshine Wall north of Arches National Park had climbing bolts driven into it. The man who defaced it said it was an accident and reported it to rangers himself. About a week later, the 2,000-year-old “Birthing Panel” in Moab was defaced with the phrase “white power” – a phrase associated with white supremacists – with graphic images. First-time vandals can face fines of up to $20,000 and one year in prison under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act. Anyone with information on who might be responsible is asked to contact BLM law enforcement at 435-259-2131.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: Three prison inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus, the Department of Corrections said. In tests conducted Monday and Tuesday on new arrivals, the department found two cases among incarcerated individuals at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans and one at Northeast Correctional Complex in St. Johnsbury. Two staff members at the St. Albans prison were identified as close contacts and will be monitored for symptoms but are not quarantined because they have been vaccinated against COVID-19. They were the first cases at the St. Albans prison since March and the first at the St. Johnsbury prison since May. On Monday, the department reported that two staff members at the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport tested positive for the virus. Earlier this month, Gov. Phil Scott announced that state employees who work with vulnerable populations, including correctional staff, would have to be vaccinated or undergo regular testing for the virus.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The school board has postponed a vote on policies to protect transgender students, meaning the district won’t have comprehensive policies in place when the school year starts as required by law. A vote was scheduled Tuesday, but news outlets report the board postponed it after two members noted the measure wasn’t eligible for a vote because it hadn’t come before the board twice. The board voted 9-1 to take the measure up at its next meeting Sept. 14. Board member Dottie Holtz voted against the delay, saying the board had heard from the public and had the information needed to decide. State law requires school boards to pass policies by the start of the school year to protect students who don’t identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. Virginia Beach has some but not all of the required protections in place. With the support of a majority of Virginia Beach’s board, approval is likely, but in neighboring Chesapeake, a majority of the school board opposed the policies Monday. Newport News rejected the policies last week but has since called a special meeting to reconsider. The policies passed with little opposition in Norfolk and Portsmouth.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Fire chiefs and union leaders in Pierce County say about 30% of their departments or membership have yet to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and they worry that a vaccine mandate will prompt people to quit. The News Tribune reports some firefighters have told co-workers they are looking at other jobs, leaving the state or retiring early. “We’re going to be forced to decide whether to take this vaccine or whether to seek alternatives that could potentially be outside of this job,” Pierce County Professional Firefighters President Aaron James said. “It’s a disgrace for our members as this has been their livelihood and their career.” Gov. Jay Inslee ordered all state employees, educational employees and health care workers to be vaccinated against the disease by Oct. 18 or face termination. Firefighters have EMT and paramedic training and are therefore considered health care workers. James, the union president of Pierce County Professional Firefighters IAFF Local 726, said between increased COVID-19 calls and wildfires, firefighters have already had a busy year and a half. “To take the governor’s proclamation or mandate would really devastate our workforce even further,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A task force established by Gov. Jim Justice has recommended that residents be able to access career, education and social services choices in one online location. The task force will now look at ways to build a single-point web system involving services and programs focused on career opportunities and job placement assistance, health care and family assistance services, and training and education opportunities such as adult education and apprenticeships, according to a statement from the West Virginia Community and Technical College System. Justice established the task force in June with the goal of better employment opportunities by linking college training programs with the state’s workforce development programs. The task force includes leaders from businesses, two-year colleges and various state agencies. It is chaired by Ann Urling, Justice’s deputy chief of staff. “We really want to remove the bureaucracy West Virginians currently face in navigating multiple systems,” said state higher education chancellor Sarah Armstrong Tucker. “An integrated web system would allow individuals to not only access resources in one location but also be better informed about the additional services they might be eligible for and weren’t previously aware of.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A high schooler has won a national award for building his own lightsaber. Wisconsin Public Radio reports Madison Country Day School senior Kaebren Walker’s creation earned him a gold medal at the NAACP’s Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics. The 43rd annual event involved about 500 students competing in categories including science, engineering and the humanities. The winners were announced during the NAACP convention in July. Jedi Knights in the “Star Wars” movie saga use lightsabers, described by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi as “an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.” Walker said he got the idea to build a lightsaber while watching “Return of the Jedi.” It took him 18 months to build the lightsaber, using approaches detailed on You Tube. His creation ignites acetone and methanol, which evaporate in a 3-foot span that becomes the blade. He said it looks like a thin flamethrower. “It was surreal because I never thought that I would be among these amazing other competitors who genuinely had amazing projects,” Walker said about the competition. “They were working with VR, cameras ... sensory technology, and here I am. I mean, I made a lightsaber. It came off really complex to other people ... I’m like, ‘Man, I feel like an actual Jedi.’ ”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Two-thirds of University of Wyoming students and almost 90% of employees report being vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the school. Students and staff were surveyed anonymously as they were tested for the coronavirus in the days prior to Monday’s start of the fall semester, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Fewer students have reported to the university’s health department that they have received vaccines, and officials urge students to make those notifications. The university reported 72 active cases of COVID-19 as of Monday, including in 48 students who live off campus. The school will continue an indoor mask mandate at least through Sept. 20, said UW President Ed Seidel. The university has encouraged but not mandated vaccines.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/12/arizona-governor-candidates-katie-hobbs-kari-lake-mexico-border-proposals/8177250001/", "title": "Arizona governor candidates Katie Hobbs, Kari Lake on border ...", "text": "For nearly eight years, Arizona Gov.

The Alabama State Port Authority says it has signed a deal to build a $60 million automotive terminal in Mobile. It’s supposed to be ready early next year and will allow for vehicles to roll on and off ships. The 57-acre terminal will be able to handle 150,000 vehicles annually with connections to rail service and highways, officials say. Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Honda currently make cars in the state, and Mazda-Toyota is building a factory in north Alabama. A docks official says the new terminal will open a new business stream for the docks. The project is a joint venture between Terminal Zarate, S.A., a Grupo Murchison company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Neltume Ports, based in Santiago, Chile.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Legislators have proposed changes to key elements of the state’s Village Public Safety Officer Program. About 1 in 3 communities in the state has no police of any kind, Anchorage Daily News reported last week in partnership with ProPublica. The Department of Justice subsequently declared the public safety gap a federal emergency, officials said. The 40-year-old program uses state money to train and pay officers working in remote villages, but the number of officers fell to a record-low 38 compared to the more than 100 in 2012, legislators in the working group said. The working group spent five months seeking ways to fix the program, which includes placing more certified officers in rural Alaska, increasing morale among current officers and retaining village-based first responders who know their communities best, legislators said.\n\nArizona\n\nQueen Creek: A company’s proposal to take water from farmland along the Colorado River and sell it to this growing Phoenix suburb has provoked a heated debate, and some Arizona legislators are trying to block the deal with a bill that would prohibit the transfer. The legislation introduced by Rep. Regina Cobb would bar landowners who hold “fourth-priority” water entitlements from transferring Colorado River water away from communities near the river. Cobb said this water was supposed to be used for agriculture, and diverting it elsewhere would harm farming communities along the river. “We just needed to get ahead of it and let them know that we’re not for this,” said Cobb, R-Kingman. Cobb said without legislation, she’s concerned hedge funds will try to make more deals to use farmlands for selling off water.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Forrest L. Wood, who created one of the top brands in the boating industry and was a pioneer of bass tournament fishing, has died at age 87. Wood, born in Flippin, Arkansas, founded the company Ranger Boats in 1968 with his wife, Nina. The business quickly grew and became a household name among fisherman around the U.S. He sold the company in 1987. Wood was known as the “father of the modern bass boat.” Keith Daffron, his grandson, said in a Facebook post that Wood died Saturday surrounded by his family, after a brief illness. In a statement, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wood’s death “is a deeply sad moment for our entire state.” Former President Bill Clinton said in a statement that Wood was “ambitious and determined and Arkansas is a better place because he fully invested his time and his talents right here.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Former Gov. Jerry Brown wants to know who is trying to sell his father’s memorabilia related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Private letters and other items that had belonged to Edmund G. “Pat” Brown when he was governor are being offered by the auction house Sotheby’s, which estimates the value at $20,000 to $30,000. Sotheby’s says the seller wants to remain anonymous. The elder Brown, who died in 1996, was California’s top elected official from 1959 to 1967, and eight years later his son started the first of his record four terms as governor. Jerry Brown says he was not consulted or informed of the sale and believes the items should instead reside at the University of California, Berkeley, “with the rest of my father’s papers.” Sotheby’s touts Brown’s materials for sale as unique because “it comes from a single source” and “chronicles a country in mourning.” The auction opened Monday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped to 2.5% in December, the lowest level in at least 44 years. An unemployment rate of 2.6% in October and November tied the previous record-low rate in early 2017. The lowest rate before that, 2.7%, occurred in 2000, The Denver Post reports. Yuma and Kiowa counties in northeastern Colorado had the nation’s lowest seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate of 1.1% in December. Low unemployment is better than high unemployment but can make it hard for employers to find workers, economist Gary Horvath said. “We are in uncharted territory,” Horvath said. “I’m baffled by how companies are making this work.” Colorado has averaged about 84,000 job openings a month since 2001. Colorado had about 150,000 openings in September but only 85,000 people unemployed and seeking work, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Voters who are registered with one party but want to vote in a different party’s presidential primary are facing a key deadline. Secretary of the State Denise Merrill said those voters must change their registration by Tuesday. Voters can look up and check their current registration status online and make any changes at myvote.ct.gov/register. Unaffiliated voters, the state’s largest block of voters, have until April 23 to register with a party online, by mail or at the Department of Motor Vehicles if they want to participate in that party’s presidential primary. They have until April 27 to register in person. Connecticut’s Democratic and Republican presidential primary elections are scheduled for April 28. There are currently 2,192,828 active voters registered in Connecticut. Of those, 895,218 are registered as unaffiliated, 803,802 as Democrats, 459,403 as Republicans and 34,405 in some other party.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: This tiny coastal town’s environment committee held its first discussion last week on ways to reduce plastic intake. Committee members are in the early stages of suggesting various restrictions on plastic, from banning materials outright to putting a fee on others. Along with Wilmington and Newark, Rehoboth is the “farthest along” in reducing plastic use, like charging a fee for single-use bags, says Dee Durham, president of Plastic Free Delaware. The environment committee is eyeing single-use plastic bags, plastic straws and polystyrene, which Durham calls the “low-hanging fruit” of plastic products, meaning they are typically easier to restrict. Last year, state lawmakers chose to ban single-use plastic bags at large retailers. That law, which goes into effect in 2021, doesn’t really impact Rehoboth Beach because it generally applies only to stores 7,000 square feet or bigger or ones with three or more Delaware locations at least 3,000 square feet.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A male harbor seal considered geriatric for his species has died at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo. Luke, 35, was humanely euthanized last week, according to a statement. The zoo said he outlived the median life expectancy for his species – 25 years in the wild and 30 years in human care. Luke had been experiencing ocular discomfort and had trouble orienting himself recently, according to the zoo’s statement. He had also experienced a loss of appetite and an unusual lack of interest in training with keepers and socializing with other animals. Animal care staff decided to euthanize him after trying several methods to treat his symptoms. Luke was born June 17, 1984, at New York Aquarium in Brooklyn, and he came to the nation’s capital in 2011, the statement said. He didn’t father any pups, according to news outlets, but lived at the zoo’s American Trail habitat with another male harbor seal and a gray seal colony.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: Residents in an upscale community are seeing red over a paint job on a half-million-dollar home. The home was painted in large patches of extremely bright primary colors with random splatters throughout. The home in the Il Regalo Circle Community in Naples resembles a preschool play toy or cartoon home. Even the trees, lawn and mailbox were splattered with paint. Neighbors said the paint job got worse over the course of a week. WBBH News reports that Collier County Code Enforcement are investigating the paint job. Jeffrey Leibman, 40, is listed as the owner of the home, according to property appraiser records. Neighbors said he painted it, but the management company for the neighborhood said he no longer lives there. The company estimated that reversing the paint job could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is proposing that the state borrow nearly $900 million for construction projects and equipment next year, an amount likely to rise before lawmakers get done with the budget. Key projects in the Republican governor’s plan include $70 million to expand the state-owned convention center in Savannah and $55 million to build a new headquarters for the Department of Public Safety in Atlanta. Lawmakers authorized borrowing of nearly $1.1 billion last year. The agency that forecasts Georgia’s borrowing said the state could issue up to $1.2 billion in bonds this year. In one shift, Kemp wants to move more funding to aid school construction from districts statewide to those that have small property tax bases. Kemp would borrow $155 million for construction in such low-wealth districts, up from $44 million this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State lawmakers have proposed initiatives to help reduce the number of traffic-related fatalities after transportation officials confirmed more than 100 deaths in the past year. Those initiatives include installing traffic cameras to capture drivers running red lights, and enforcing zero-tolerance policies for drinking and driving, Hawaii News Now reports. “Every year, you hear of a horrific pedestrian accident that’s occurring at an intersection because someone did not stop at a red light,” state House Speaker Scott Saiki said. The cameras would automatically record anyone who runs a red light, and a ticket would then be mailed to the address associated with the license plate number, officials said. “There could potentially be a bench warrant for someone who doesn’t appear or who doesn’t respond to the ticket,” Saiki said. “And if you have a bench warrant, potentially there could be some jail time.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two environmental groups have given notice that they intend to file a lawsuit to stop a proposed underground natural gas pipeline from Idaho to Wyoming that the groups say will harm protected grizzly bears and other wildlife. The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection sent a required 60-day notice to sue to the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week. The groups contend the Forest Service’s approval of the pipeline project in November violated the Endangered Species Act. The groups also say the 18-mile portion of the 50-mile pipeline would cut a corridor through the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and create a road through six Inventoried Roadless Areas. The 2001 Roadless Rule prevents road construction and timber harvest in designated roadless areas, which are typically 5,000 acres or larger.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The story of a boy who grew up across the street from Abraham Lincoln’s family and later presided over one the nation’s larger retailers will be told in the annual George L. Painter Looking for Lincoln Lecture. Julius Rosenwald spent his formative years in the shadow of the future president and grew up to be president of Sears, Roebuck & Co. He used the fortune he amassed to help those who faced racial injustices. His life will be recalled as part of the annual lecture series at 8:30 a.m. Feb. 12 at the Lincoln Home National Historic Site. It’s presented with the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area, which preserves the history of the central Illinois communities touched by Lincoln’s life. The Rosenwald home, part of the Lincoln historic site, will be renamed in his honor and an exhibit panel about his life and legacy unveiled.\n\nIndiana\n\nJasper: A one-room schoolhouse where the last lessons were taught in early 1950s has been dismantled after efforts to find a buyer for the small building failed. The Dick School had educated generations of Dubois County residents in rural Jasper from 1892 to 1951. But a few weeks ago, the shed-like building was taken down piece by piece in the city about 40 miles northeast of Evansville. The weatherboard structure with a tin roof was moved to a new location after it was closed, and it had remained in good shape. Robin Pate, the current owner of the property on which it stood, had advertised the old schoolhouse and reached out to the Dubois County Historical Society. But Pate couldn’t find any takers for the school, which had been the region’s last functioning one-room schoolhouse, The (Jasper) Herald reports. She’s selling the 2-acre site on which the building stood.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: The leaking inflatable dam on the Cedar River in downtown Waterloo has been fixed, officials said. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports contractors found a slit in the half-inch-thick rubber and repaired it. Associate city engineer Wayne Castle said the final cost of the project will be significantly below the original $388,350 contract approved in November with J.F. Brennan Co., of La Crosse, Wisconsin. “We’re not completely done yet, but we should be just under $220,000,” Castle said. A major reason for the lower cost was that a marine contractor was able to use divers to inspect the riverbed on the downstream side of the dam, Castle said. The original contract anticipated the contractor building a more expensive wall around the inspection area. The city has inflated the bladder dam since 2009, raising the Cedar River level by about 4 feet to enhance boating. It’s usually inflated in June and deflated in October.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: An effort is underway to more fully tell the story of a boulder that was a sacred prayer rock for a Native American tribe before it was moved to Lawrence and inscribed with the names of the city’s founders. The Lawrence Journal-World reports Pauline Eads Sharp, who serves as secretary and treasurer of the Kanza Heritage Society, and Lawrence artist Dave Loewenstein are leading a wide-ranging team of people, including historians, geologists, artists and filmmakers, to increase interest in the 23-ton red quartzite Shunganunga boulder. At issue is that there currently is no mention on the boulder-turned-monument of the Kanza tribe, which was forcibly removed to Oklahoma in 1873. The approximately yearlong project, called Between the Rock and a Hard Place, will include research, community workshops and the creation of a documentary film and book.\n\nKentucky\n\nHopkinsville: A prosecutor has been absent from court in the weeks following the release of the letter in which he asked former Gov. Matt Bevin to pardon a man convicted of sexual abuse. Two judges in Christian County said there is an agreement between them and Commonwealth’s Attorney Rick Boling that he remain absent from their courtrooms for the “foreseeable future,” The Kentucky New Era reports. Dayton Jones was granted a commutation by Bevin on Dec. 9. The letter Boling wrote on official letterhead Dec. 7 asking the former governor to pardon Jones was released Jan. 9. Boling apologized after it was released. Jones pleaded guilty in 2016 to sodomy, wanton endangerment and distribution of matter portraying a sexual performance by a minor. Boling wrote in his letter to Bevin that the prosecution of Jones was politically motivated. He said the case involved intoxicated teenagers and people in their early 20s “being stupid and immature.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Fans of the late Louisiana author Ernest J. Gaines, who wrote such storied works as “A Lesson Before Dying” and “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” are gathering to remember his work as part of Black History Month celebrations. The Louisiana Center for the Book in the State Library of Louisiana is hosting the discussion Feb. 19, according to a news release from Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser. Gaines died Nov. 5, 2019. He grew up on a small Louisiana plantation, experiences that later translated into his rich literary characters. “A Lesson Before Dying,” published in 1993, was an acclaimed classic. Both “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman” (1971) and “A Gathering of Old Men” (1984) became honored television movies. The program will be hosted by Darrell Bourque, who is a two-time Louisiana poet laureate, a close friend of Gaines and a member of the Ernest J. Gaines Center.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The Finance Authority of Maine’s board on Monday approved loan guarantees and a loan necessary for a Boston investment group to proceed with purchasing Saddleback Mountain and reopening the area to skiers next winter. The board unanimously approved $2.5 million in loan insurance on a $12.5 million loan, which was smaller than the original request, along with a $1 million direct loan. Arctaris Impact Fund also raised private funds and received a separate $1 million loan through the Maine Rural Development Association. The finance authority and rural development funds will be part of a $23.5 million funding package that includes private equity, new market tax credits, community loans, and community grants for the purchase of Saddleback, officials said. Bruce Wagner, CEO of FAME, said the agency is pleased to “help restart this historic and beloved Maine ski mountain.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Singer and recording artist CeCe Peniston – who released her signature dance hit, “Finally,” in 1991 – will be the headline entertainer and grand marshal for the city’s first organized LGBTQ+ pride celebration, according to Salisbury’s branch of PFLAG, the United States’ first and largest LGBTQ+ ally organization. The city made the announcement in a video on Facebook. The lovably corny clip features Mayor Jake Day vibing to Peniston’s “Finally” in the city government offices. Peniston rose to fame in the early 1990s, when she rapidly become one of the most successful dance club artists in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play Charts, according to her official website. Salisbury PFLAG announced the city’s inaugural Pride Parade and Festival on National Coming Out Day last October. The event is set for 11 a.m. Sunday, June 7.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has received more than $160 million from federal immigration authorities since 2012, most of which went to four county jails in exchange for housing and transporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, according to a report in The Boston Sunday Globe that cited documents obtained through a public records request. Advocates and immigration attorneys oppose the agreements with the jails. They say the payments are a waste of taxpayer money, and there are better alternatives to deal with people facing federal immigration charges. The sheriff’s offices for Plymouth, Bristol, Franklin, and Suffolk counties that run the jails have defended the arrangements, with at least two saying their relationship with ICE has made Massachusetts safer. But Matt Cameron, a Boston-based immigration lawyer, said there was “no good public safety justification” for local sheriff’s departments to house ICE detainees.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Home values are projected to increase by an average of 20% across most of the city’s neighborhoods, according to Mayor Mike Duggan. Residential assessments for 2020 also show that property values are up 30% in several parts of the city. The city said that the figures are based on two years of actual market sales and that homeowners are protected by a 2% cap on property tax increases as long as ownership has not changed. Property owners can appeal assessments until Feb. 22. Detroit residential property values rose an average of 13% last year. “This is great news for Detroit homeowners, particularly those who held on to their properties and stayed in the city,” Duggan said. “Home values in nearly every neighborhood are rising and helping to build new wealth, without significant tax increases. This shows as clearly as anything that the city’s revitalization has reached nearly every corner of our city.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The city has planted hundreds of trees in the past few years in an effort to green up downtown, but many aren’t surviving past their first year. City staff have been trying to figure out why, and they think they might have found the culprit: salt. Soil tests show that salinity levels in some of the planting spots are much higher than what’s ideal for trees to thrive, said Ben Shardlow, director of urban design for the Minneapolis Downtown Council and the Downtown Improvement District. Salt is used liberally in downtown Minneapolis to keep sidewalks and parking lots clear of ice. After the ice melts, the extra salt left behind piles up or gets pushed to the side – sometimes directly into the places where the trees are trying to grow. For three years in a row, a tree census showed only half of the trees the city planted had survived, Shardlow told Minnesota Public Radio News.\n\nMississippi\n\nIndianola: A historical marker will commemorate the legacy of civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. Research for the project was led by a Mississippi Valley State University student and professor, the Greenwood Commonwealth reports. C. Sade Turnipseed is an associate professor of history, and 17-year-old Nigerian native Brian Diyaolu took her public history course during the fall semester. They recently received approval from the Sunflower County Board of Supervisors to place the Hamer sign in front of the county courthouse. It will be unveiled during a ceremony March 27. Students in Turnipseed’s course are assigned a historical topic, and Diyaolu’s was Hamer. He said he wrote three drafts of the historical marker’s narrative before pitching the idea to the supervisors. He said other students helped him edit the narrative and prepare the presentation. Hamer was born to sharecroppers in Montgomery County on Oct. 6, 1917.\n\nMissouri\n\nCreve Coeur: The St. Louis Holocaust Museum & Learning Center will triple in size with an $18 million expansion as officials seek to reach even deeper into issues of bias, bigotry and hate. Details about the expansion were announced Monday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Officials hope to make the building more visible and accessible. The museum, in the suburb of Creve Coeur and operated by the Jewish Federation of St. Louis, draws 30,000 annual visitors, about two-thirds of whom are students. Admission is free. Museum officials are in touch with about 30 Holocaust survivors who live in the St. Louis area. Monday’s announcement came on International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The museum’s new executive director, Sandra Harris, says groundbreaking will be in May, and the goal is to finish by the end of 2021.\n\nMontana\n\nIsmay: U.S. Postal Service officials say mail service will resume in this town where a fire destroyed the post office. The fire in early January has prompted some residents of Ismay to worry about their mail. Since the fire, they’ve taken turns dropping off and picking up mail in a town almost 20 miles away. Postal officials plan to put a mailbox in a community center in tiny Ismay, population 20, Postal Service spokesman James Boxrud says. Meanwhile, property owners Rita and Gene Nimitz tell the Billings Gazette they’re making tentative plans to rebuild the post office, which dated to the 1920s. A faulty furnace or electrical wiring is believed to have started the blaze.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The city’s school district is about to take a major step in the recovery from a fire that destroyed the district office more than eight years ago. The school board is expected to vote next month on a nearly $1.15 million construction project agreement to build a backup data center, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. It’ll be constructed in the basement of the building built to replace the office burned in May 2011. The blaze was started by a disgruntled teacher who was later sentenced to prison for arson. The fire wiped out nearly everything in the building, including severely damaging the computer system that held email servers, grades, payroll and other records. District officials worked with University of Nebraska-Lincoln information technology staff to get the data system back online. The district built an off-site data center near Lincoln High School about a year later. The district wants the backup data center finished this summer.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Local tourism officials have canceled several activities tied to the launch of a new city slogan in the wake of basketball star Kobe Bryant’s death. A 60-second spot touting the “what happens here, only happens here” campaign aired during the Grammy Awards as planned Sunday night, but other plans were postponed. The new slogan is a play on the longtime saying that “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.” The city had intended to display the new slogan on more than two dozen hotel and casino marquees on and around the Strip. Instead, most resorts showed messages of grief. They included “L.A., OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO YOU” and “#RIPKOBE.” Steve Hill, CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said all the planned activities will take place at a future date. But Bryant, his daughter and the other lives lost in a helicopter crash were too much on everyone’s minds.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State health officials are seeking input on whether the state needs a residential treatment facility for youth with mental health and addiction issues. The Department of Health and Human Services has issued a request for information about the opportunities and challenges associated with establishing a psychiatric facility that would provide the highest level of care next to an acute psychiatric hospital. The state’s only youth drug and alcohol treatment center closed last month after a spate of nonfatal overdoses. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu says a new facility would ensure that young people struggling with addiction, mental illness or both get the right level of care in a safe environment. The deadline for submitting information is Feb. 24.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGalloway Township: Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled a sweeping energy plan Monday that sets goals for shifting the state to 100% clean energy by 2050. The first-term Democratic governor announced the plan at Stockton University alongside two Cabinet officials who will be carrying the plan out, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Catherine McCabe and Board of Public Utilities President Joe Fiordaliso. Murphy cast climate change as an urgent concern and pointed to a Rutgers study that indicated the state could see 1 foot of sea level rise in the next decade. “Quite frankly it will be hard for future generations to create their Jersey Shore memories if the Jersey Shore is only a memory,” Murphy said. The plan calls for reducing the use of fossil fuels while increasing renewable sources of energy. New Jersey currently gets 94% of its electricity from natural gas and nuclear plants, according to the U.S. Energy Department.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A former state lawmaker’s emu that has been missing since Thanksgiving is safely back at its home near the city. Former state Rep. Brad Cates learned his emu had resurfaced last week thanks to a barrage of images people shared on social media. Pictures of the large bird around a subdivision near Cates’ home prompted inquiries from a state livestock inspector and a game warden. Later Sunday, Cates with some help corralled the 150-pound emu named “Hey You!” Cates was also the Republican nominee for Dona Ana County district attorney in 2016. He lost to Mark D’Antonio.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State taxpayers could decide to contribute to a fund that helps pay for abortions under a proposed bill. State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and Assemblymember Karines Reyes say their bill would create an abortion access fund to which taxpayers could voluntarily contribute when they file their personal income tax returns. The Democrats say the fund’s money would go to not-for-profit groups that provide financial and logical assistance to individuals seeking abortion care. The Legislature passed a sweeping law last year to protect a right to abortion care in New York in case of changes on the federal level. Lawmakers could consider passing the latest bill this year before they depart in early June. The bill would also require a report to lawmakers and the governor about the amount of money deposited in the abortion access fund and how it was spent. The state wouldn’t be able to request the names of anyone who sought money from the fund.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Three months after a set of anonymous, threatening, racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic emails sent a wave of fear through the sociology department at Wake Forest University, the department chairman says he’s still waiting for university leaders to announce a meaningful response. The emails to faculty in sociology and two other departments called for a “purge” of minorities and the LGBTQ community. Alarmed by what he deemed white supremacist terrorism, chairman Joseph Soares canceled sociology classes for a week. When they resumed, Wake Forest police officers were stationed outside classrooms and the building itself. Doors normally open were closed and locked. Even a study lounge was locked. “It was the most stressful experience of my academic life,” said Soares, who began his college teaching career in 1991 and has taught at Wake Forest since 2003. “My faculty were afraid.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A massive 1984 diesel spill in Mandan, North Dakota, has finally been cleaned up. State officials said the cleanup at a rail yard in downtown Mandan was complicated because of limited access to the affected area, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Workers collected about 770,000 gallons of fuel over the years, said Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. “It’s pretty much gone,” Glatt said at a Wednesday meeting. “It seems like a long time, but when you look at, in a downtown area where access is limited, we had 4 to 6 feet on top of the groundwater in some areas. This is a success.” Burlington Northern ran the rail yard when the spill was found in 1984, but BNSF Railway runs it now.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Cheetahs from the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden will have about 5 acres of open terrain where they can run at a facility anticipated to be completed this summer. The cheetahs will be transported from the zoo in suburban Cincinnati in custom, built-in van crates to the “Cheetah Run” at the zoo’s Bowyer Farm in Warren County. The animals will have the space to run but will not be required to do so, said zoo spokeswoman Michelle Curley. Zoning records indicate some residents raised safety concerns, but the Warren County Board of Zoning and Appeals approved the plan last year. The tree-lined “Cheetah Run” project will be enclosed by a fence. Zoo officials have no safety concerns, said Mark Fischer, vice president of facilities, planning and stability for the zoo. He said the cheetahs, raised by humans and dogs, are “docile” and “timid.” Fisher said the run will be fun for the cheetahs – Tommy, Nia, Savanna, Donni, Cathryn, Willow, Redd, and Kris – and give them space to stretch their legs.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A prosecutor has been arrested, accused of domestic abuse. Robert McClatchie, an Oklahoma County assistant district attorney, was booked into Oklahoma County jail about 4 a.m. Saturday on complaints of domestic abuse by strangulation and domestic abuse in the presence of a minor child. Jail records also did not list an attorney for him. District Attorney David Prater said in a statement that McClatchie “will remain in jail until he is released by a judge or when his bond is posted after a judge sets his bond, like any other person arrested on a domestic abuse charge.” Prater said he’s “not intervening in this matter in any way.” He said the case will be assigned by the attorney general to another district attorney to assist Oklahoma City police in their investigation “and ultimately, make a charging decision.”\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Local police now have an extra set of eyes with them. Each of Pendleton’s 24 sworn police officers has been equipped with body cameras that will record each call of service to which they respond, the East Oregonian reports. “Certainly, the preservation of evidence in real time is something you can’t replace,” Police Chief Stuart Roberts said. The cameras are located on the officers’ left breast pocket and attached using a magnetic plate. Officers must double tap the camera to activate it when responding to a call. The program joins Pendleton police with departments in Boardman and Hermiston as the only agencies with body cameras in Northeast Oregon. All footage collected by the department will be held for a minimum of 180 days, and anything that is a part of an investigation or court case will be held for an additional 30 months, officials said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Former Mayor Stephen Reed, who served for almost three decades but was later sentenced to probation for accumulating Wild West artifacts he bought with public money for a museum that was never built, has died. He was 70. A statement from the family reported by PennLive.com said Reed died Saturday “surrounded by his family.” “Reed was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006 and fought it courageously,” the statement said. Reed served seven terms but lost the 2009 primary amid criticism over the millions of dollars he had spent on museum-related items. He and city officials scoured the country for artifacts that would stock the museum, which he had called part of a wider plan to make the city a museum destination for tourists. He pleaded guilty in 2017 to 20 counts of receiving stolen property and was sentenced to two years of probation. Reed apologized and told the judge he took responsibility for his actions, calling his prosecution “a gut-wrenchingly humiliating” process.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo wants to reform the state’s criminal justice system through a series of proposals in her budget and administrative actions. The Democratic governor released a nearly $10.2 billion state budget plan this month. The Legislature will review the proposals and present its plan before the 2021 fiscal year begins in July. The budget includes recommendations from Raimondo’s working group on criminal and juvenile justice. Among them, the proposal seeks to improve discharge planning, shift staffing to improve access to health care, update the parole statute to include geriatric parole and provide incestives for work release programs. Raimondo is also looking to bring her signature workforce training program to prisons.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Residents who want to vote in the state’s Democratic presidential primary next month face a deadline to register this week. The State Election Commission said all voters for the Feb. 29 primary must be registered by Thursday. The first-in-the-South presidential primary is open, which means a voter does not have to be a registered Democrat to cast a ballot. People who are 17 years old can vote in the primary as long as they will be 18 by Election Day on Nov. 3. Registration forms can be downloaded at scvotes.org, and residents can also check to see if their South Carolina registration is current. Voters can also register at their county registration offices. Republicans will not have a presidential primary in South Carolina as President Donald Trump runs for reelection.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster State Park: After the near-decimation of the Custer State Park bighorn sheep herd, wildlife managers are now seeing the group as a success story, the Black Hills Pioneer reports. In 2004 the herd was 200-plus animals strong when members contracted mycoplasma ovipneumoiae, a pneumonia-causing bacteria that killed 70-80% of the animals. Since that time, the adults in the herd obtained an immunity to the bacteria, but the lambs suffered – most died from the disease within months, and on a good year, one would survive. Some wildlife managers even began discussions about destroying the remaining 20-25 animals and starting over with disease-free sheep. Then, three years ago, biologists discovered that only three of the bighorns shed the pathogens responsible for the die-off. Those were removed from the herd, and the population rebound began. The first lambing year, eight of the nine born in the park survived.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A new $200 million Amazon distribution center in the city’s Raleigh neighborhood will employ 1,000 workers and should be up and running in time for this year’s holiday season, officials said Monday. With the building’s skeleton and yellow bulldozers in the background, Amazon officials and state and local politicians gathered at the busy construction site in north Memphis to provide details about the project. Workers will make at least $15 per hour as they pack and ship books, electronics and other consumer goods alongside Amazon’s robots, officials said. At 855,000 square feet – the equivalent of 14 football fields – the order fulfillment center will be Amazon’s third in Memphis. The company employs about 6,500 people in Tennessee, Amazon officials said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Local police are inviting people to drop off their unwanted firearms and ammunition, with no questions asked, Tuesday at an East Austin police substation. This is the first of several gun surrender events this year, police said. On Tuesday, people can drop off these items from 3 to 8 p.m. at the Robert T. Martinez Central East Substation. “No questions asked” means police will not attempt to identify those who drop off guns, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said. “We merely want to get weapons that are no longer wanted off the streets, out of homes, and destroyed so they don’t end up potentially in the wrong hands if there was to be a burglary,” Manley said. “This is a service we want to provide for the community.” Austin police will host similar programs throughout the year on April 28, July 28 and Oct. 27.\n\nUtah\n\nLogan: An event straight out of the Old West is attracting more people with its mountain-man appeal, organizers said. About 50 people gathered in Blacksmith Fork Canyon to compete in the state-organized biathlon – an event combining cross-country skiing and sharpshooting – that features muzzleloader guns, the Herald Journal reports. Many wore traditional mountain-man gear to the event this month dubbed Willy Wapiti’s Smoke Pole Biathlon at Hardware Ranch, which is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and populated by hundreds of elk. Shooters raced along a snowy trail, with or without snowshoes, to five separate shooting stations. Prizes like electronic earmuffs, knives and fire starters were given to the best score out of 10, said Rachael Tuckett, a wildlife recreation specialist with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, which organized the event. Prizes also are given for the best mountain man outfit. The event has grown by 40% since last year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The completion of a 93-mile rail trail across northern Vermont would help link an ever-expanding network of recreation trails across New England and beyond, advocates say. The effort got a big boost last week when Republican Gov. Phil Scott asked lawmakers to approve $2.8 million as the state’s share of the estimated $14.1 million cost of completing the remaining 60 miles of the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. It runs from Swanton, near the Canadian border, to St. Johnsbury, not far from the Connecticut River border with New Hampshire. The 30-mile section of the trail currently open is already benefiting businesses and the communities that people visit so they can use it, officials say. Trail advocates say completing one section of the trail boosts other nearby trails.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The post office where survivors reunited after a mass shooting in a government office building now is named after the man who gave his own life for his co-workers. A plaque was unveiled Friday honoring Ryan Keith Cox at the post office that now bears his name, The Virginian-Pilot reports. Cox was one of 12 people who died in the mass shooting last May 31 at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center. “We are a city of heroes, and Keith is a perfect example of one of them,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said during the ceremony. In interviews, Cox’s co-workers have said he ushered women into a room and told them to barricade the door. Cox then left to see if anyone else needed help. The gunman and shot and killed him soon after that. Cox, 50, had been an account clerk in Virginia Beach’s public utilities department for 12 years.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A school district has warned parents about a potentially dangerous “penny challenge” spreading on social media. The Tacoma School District said a middle school student in the district took part in the online trend last week, KOMO-TV reports. The school district provided a photo of a burned electrical wall outlet resulting from the penny challenge. No injuries were reported. Social media users are challenged to record a video of themselves sliding a penny between a partially plugged-in cellphone charger and a wall outlet, officials said. Users are asked to film and post the results on the TikTok video-sharing channel. Placing a penny across an active electrical connection will create sparks that can damage the outlet and potentially start a fire and cause injury, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Projects involving sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places are eligible to apply for historic preservation development grants through the West Virginia Historic Preservation Office. Projects should involve the restoration, rehabilitation or archaeological development of historic sites, the state Department of Arts, Culture and History said in a news release. Approximately $369,000 is expected to be available for the grants, depending on appropriations from Congress or the Legislature. Privately owned properties are only eligible where there is evidence of public support or public benefit, the release said. Governmental properties that aren’t accessible to the public are not eligible for funding. Applications must be postmarked by March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nLa Crosse: For nearly a century and a half, the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration have said prayers every hour of every day in their chapel in La Crosse. But next month that practice will be coming to an end. The sisters have announced that after a dozen years of study and reflection, they will begin to cut back their prayer ritual, which began in 1878, to 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily. In 1997, prayer partners were invited to take the daytime hours while sisters living at St. Rose Convent continued the night hours. As demographics continued changing in the early 2000s, the sisters began studying the future of the practice. “Our thoughtful study over the years has included a growing understanding of a modern way to live in adoration through our prayer lives and actions, no matter where we are,” said FSPA President Eileen McKenzie.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The city’s police don’t have the authority to enforce the new federal law that increased the legal age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21, the agency says. Officers can only legally enforce state laws and Cheyenne city ordinances, spokesman David Inman says. He says city officials posted the clarification on Facebook because they’d been receiving calls from residents and local businesses. Nonetheless, it’s still illegal for someone under the age of 21 to purchase products containing tobacco or nicotine, including vaping products. The Legislature is expected to consider a bill that would change state law to match the new federal law on tobacco sales. If it passes, Inman said the city would likely pass a similar ordinance, and then police would have the power to enforce it.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/20/queen-prairie-sports-bubble-bursts-reactor-overhaul-news-around-states/50112783/", "title": "'Queen of the Prairie,' sports bubble bursts: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Plaintiffs in lawsuits challenging the state’s law criminalizing medical treatment for transgender youth plan to file a new suit after withdrawing two actions Friday. Melody Eagan, an attorney with Birmingham-based Lightfoot, Franklin and White, which represented two families and two physicians in a lawsuit titled Ladinsky v. Ivey, wrote in an email Monday that they planned to “file a new case in the immediate future” against SB 184. Gov. Kay Ivey signed the law April 8; it will take effect in early May. “We promptly filed a lawsuit on behalf of two families and two doctors on the day Governor Ivey signed the bill,” Eagan wrote. “After filing that case, we are hearing from numerous Alabama families, including patients facing loss of critical medical care and parents facing potential criminal penalties. We also are hearing from numerous medical providers and others who care for transgender youth.” The law subjects doctors who prescribe puberty blockers and hormones to transgender youth to a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. It also forbids public and private school personnel from withholding information about a student’s confusion over their gender identity and bans genital surgeries (except circumcisions) on minors. Health professionals have said surgeons don’t perform those procedures on youth in Alabama.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials have purchased a gondola in Austria for a city-owned ski area in Alaska’s capital city, but questions remain about the installation and long-term plans for the gondola. City officials have expressed interest in working with an Alaska Native corporation on the project. Eaglecrest Ski Area’s general manager and a city project manager recently visited a ski area in Austria to examine the lift and sign a sale agreement for $1.33 million, the Juneau Empire reports. Deputy City Manager Robert Barr said the city is seeking bids from transport companies to bring the gondola to Juneau. Eaglecrest has said its leaders have been looking for ways to expand summer operations and create opportunities for a more sustainable year-round model. The ski area, on its website, said it would work with planners, engineers and contractors on the best placement for the new infrastructure. Eaglecrest is on Douglas Island. City leaders last week authorized City Manager Rorie Watt to negotiate an agreement with Goldbelt Inc., an Alaska Native corporation that operates a tram near downtown Juneau and owns land near Eaglecrest. Watt, in a memo to the city’s Assembly, said Goldbelt has expressed interest in providing funding for up to $10 million for the installation of the gondola and “other related improvements.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Metro-area eviction filings are climbing back to pre-pandemic levels despite hundreds of millions of dollars in rental aid going to landlords. Moratoriums helped keep many Valley renters in their homes, but those are over. Now tenants, some still trying to pay back rent after struggling during COVID-19, are also facing skyrocketing rents and wages that aren’t keeping up. And Maricopa County renters who had evictions filed against them during the pandemic are facing record judgments despite all that relief money funneled to landlords. Housing researchers and tenant advocates say the rent-income gap, the lightning speed of Arizona’s eviction process and a lack of legal support for renters led to an eviction crisis in the Phoenix area that started even before the pandemic. An Arizona Republic analysis found eviction filings in Maricopa County hit a five-year high in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, February and March of this year, Valley evictions reached about 91% of filings from the first three months of 2019. About 65,000 Arizona renters believe they will likely be evicted in the next two months, according to the latest Census Pulse Survey. State law allows a landlord to initiate an eviction as soon as five days after a tenant misses rent, and the tenant is typically locked out within three weeks of filing.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders continues to far outpace her rivals in fundraising and spending for her bid for governor, the latest campaign finance reports show. Sanders, the daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, reported raising more than $680,000 last month in her bid for Arkansas governor by Friday’s deadline for monthly campaign finance reports. She faces former talk radio host and podcaster Doc Washburn in next month’s Republican primary. Sanders spent more than $834,000 during the month and reported having nearly $7.4 million on hand. Sanders has raised more than $14 million since announcing her candidacy last year, a record for a governor’s race in the state. Sanders’ closest rival among the Democrats, Chris Jones, raised more than $120,000 in March and spent more than $213,000. Jones’ campaign reported having nearly $94,000 on hand. Jones faces Anthony Bland, Jay Martin, James “Rus” Russell and Supha Xayprasith-Mays in next month’s Democratic primary. Term limits bar Republican incumbent Asa Hutchinson from seeking reelection.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A $1.8 billion facility intended to connect Metro light-rail lines under downtown Los Angeles is 90% complete, and test runs of trains are underway, officials said Monday. The Regional Connector Project was designed to save commuters’ time by eliminating transfers between trains, allowing one-seat rides across Los Angeles County. “The trackwork, the rail guideways, the platform areas are now complete,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told a press conference. “We’ve been waiting for like 10 years.” County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, board chair of the Los Angeles County Transportation Authority, said the connector will open later this year. The overall project is a 1.9-mile underground light-rail extension connecting the A, E and L lines and three new stations, including the Grand Av Arts/Bunker Hill Station about 100 feet beneath ground level.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state is expecting the birth of another litter of wolf pups any day now, creating both excitement and concern over the natural rebirth of a predator with a long, human-induced absence from the state. The breeding pair of wolves that naturally migrated into the state last year formed the pack north of Walden in Jackson County with the birth of six pups. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials had watched the pups for some time before announcing their birth in early June as the first litter of wolf pups born in the state in several decades. And soon that pack could grow, as wolves typically have pups from mid-April through mid-May. State wildlife officials said staff have not seen evidence of denning behavior or any sign of a new litter from the pack this year. “How could it get any better that soon we will see more pups,” said Dale Baker, a wolf advocate from Fort Collins who volunteered to watch North Park rancher Don Gittleson’s cattle herd after Gittleson lost three cows to the wolfpack. “The folks in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming had a big outcry when they brought wolves there, but now that this is naturally happening here, it seems like there should be less of an outcry.” Gittleson said the pack’s adult female was observed in heat, ready to mate in a pasture on his property in February.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city’s aging housing is creating public health concerns on top of squeezing a tight market. Shiela Hayes, president of the NAACP Norwich Branch, said the pandemic laid bare the importance of having the city address housing quality. “We can no longer act like that neighborhood, or that section, or that backstreet (can) continue to be underperforming housing stock; we don’t have that kind of luxury,” Hayes said. The majority of resident-owned homes in the state are 60 years or older, said Sam Giffin, a policy and data analyst for the Hartford-based Open Communities Alliance, as housing production has fallen since the baby boom – more so in Connecticut than in other parts of New England. Some of the risks that come from older houses include paint and other sources of lead. “There’s concern across the state that our old housing stock is a concern to both health and safety,” Giffin said. Hayes said Norwich has a lot of older housing, especially in Greenville, Taftville and downtown, where there are cheaper, privately held, multi-rental units converted from single-family homes. “They’re old, and they take a lot of maintenance,” Hayes said. Maintenance is usually not a matter of upgrading a single unit but multiple units at the same time, which means more money must be spent to get them up to code.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: President Joe Biden will return to his alma mater to give the commencement speech at the University of Delaware graduation in May, the university announced Tuesday. It’s the first time a sitting president will speak at a UD graduation ceremony. Biden is no stranger to visiting UD or giving graduation speeches there. May’s ceremony will be his fifth time speaking at commencement at the school – last in 2014, while serving as vice president. “(Biden’s) commitment to a lifetime of public service is an inspiring example for our graduates, as well as all our students and alumni, of what they can accomplish with a UD education, whatever path they may choose in life,” University President Dennis Assanis said in a statement. Students and their guests should expect heightened security at the graduation ceremony, UD spokeswoman Andrea Boyle Tippett said. Secret Service members will also likely visit campus to prepare with UD Police Department officers prior to the president’s arrival. The ceremony to honor this year’s 4,000-student graduating class is slated to start at 9:30 a.m. at Delaware Stadium on May 28. The event will also be livestreamed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Museum of American History is opening a permanent entertainment exhibit in December, WUSA-TV reports. “Through the National Museum of American History’s extraordinary collection of theater, music, sports, movie and television objects, the exhibition Entertainment Nation will feature a powerful, ever-changing selection of objects and interactive experiences,” the museum said in a press release. “Through the objects and their stories, the exhibition will explore how, for over 150 years, entertainment has provided a forum for important national conversations about who we are, and who we want to be.” Some of the items set to go on display can be previewed online, including pop culture relics like Prince’s yellow “cloud” guitar, Muhammad Ali’s boxing robe, and Tejana singer Selena’s leather jacket and pants. The goal is to highlight how entertainment has shaped the nation’s society and shine a light on entertainers who have broken barriers. The permanent bilingual exhibit is set to open Dec. 9.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state Department of Education rejected more than 50 mathematics textbooks – about 40% of those submitted – for failing to meet Florida’s new learning standards or because they “contained prohibited topics” that included references to critical race theory. Now, the only publisher approved by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the department for K-5 mathematics is Houston, Texas-based Accelerate Learning. “In the subject area as large as mathematics for grades K through five, it is unusual for there only to be one publisher to choose from,” said Billy Epting, assistant superintendent for academic services for Leon County Schools. DOE said more than half the textbooks being disallowed incorporated “prohibited topics or unsolicited strategies, including CRT,” which is an academic framework that is rarely seen outside of higher education. The term has become a highly charged catch-all buzzword for discussion of diversity of inclusion. Other books were not allowed because publishers “rebranded” Common Core Standards. DeSantis has taken a lead role nationally in Republican efforts to aggressively push back against liberal cultural values and what he calls “woke indoctrination.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Students at Druid Hills High School put together a short documentary video, shot on iPhones, to show the troubling conditions inside their learning environment. The video opens with a student explaining how human waste flows up from the ground and floods an area where he and his friends eat lunch. The high schoolers’ footage shows the classrooms, hallways and bathrooms crumbling around them. Plaster falls off walls, and water drips around electrical outlets. So much water has leaked into the weight room that it oozes up from the floor when a student steps on it. Another student demonstrates how one of the holes in a ceiling is so large that he can put his entire hand through it. “You can tell someone about the conditions, but when you visually see it, it’s a lot more impactful,” sophomore Harley Martz, one of the video’s producers, told the Associated Press in an interview. “Some of the things we pointed out in the video are very undeniable.” In the video, Druid Hills junior Montrice Berry describes the assault on the senses: “As you walk through the school now, you can smell the mold, and it’s kind of really nasty. So I tend to walk outside just so I can avoid the smell.” The video, which has garnered more than 40,000 views since it was posted on YouTube this month, has prompted outrage among some parents in the suburban area just east of Atlanta who want repairs made. It was produced after the DeKalb County School Board in February removed Druid Hills from a list of schools in need of priority renovations.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Federal authorities have begun monitoring the state’s wastewater for COVID-19, while Hawaii expects its own monitoring program to be fully operational this summer, officials said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been testing in the islands as part of its National Wastewater Surveillance System, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The agency posts wastewater data on its COVID Data Tracker website, denoted by dots on a U.S. map. Data from Hawaii hasn’t been included yet due to “a technical glitch being resolved with how the points are displayed on the map,” said CDC spokesperson Nick Spinelli. The agency said it would also display data from the Hawaii Department of Health once the state is able to submit its own figures. More than 30 states have been funded to participate in the CDC program, but some are still getting their collection efforts up and running. Several issues delayed Hawaii’s early plans to set up its own statewide monitoring program. The state faced a six-month wait for shipment of sample-collection machines, which were back-ordered due to high demand. Federal funds paid for the the monitoring equipment at a cost of about $100,000. The equipment is now in place, as are protocols.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory have completed a rare overhaul of one of the world’s most powerful nuclear test reactors, and normal operations are expected to resume later this spring, officials said Monday. The 11-month outage at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Test Reactor in eastern Idaho allowed a core overhaul that’s done, on average, about every 10 years. The change-out was the sixth since the reactor started operating in 1967 and the first in 17 years. “Overall, I’m very pleased with the ATR workforce and teamwork they demonstrated during the longest and most complex outage in our history,” said Sean O’Kelly, associate lab director for the Idaho National Laboratory’s Advanced Test Reactor Complex. He said the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain issues caused some delays beyond the best-case scenario of completing the work in nine months. Experiments at the reactor help the U.S. Navy’s nuclear-powered war fleet stay at sea longer, bolster NASA’s space exploration, and advance lifesaving medical treatments. The reactor also plays a key role in the effort to keep commercial nuclear power plants running longer and creating new and safer reactors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The reactor is now going through readiness assessments, instrument calibrations and low-power system checks.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Federal authorities on Monday said they will not criminally charge Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer convicted of murder in the 2014 shooting death of Black teenager Laquan McDonald. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago said in a news release that the decision was made after consulting with the McDonald family and that the “family was in agreement not to pursue a second prosecution.” According to the release, prosecuting Van Dyke on federal charges would have been much more difficult than it was to prosecute him in state court because the burden of proof is far higher. Federal prosecutors “would have to prove not only that Mr. Van Dyke acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids, but also that his actions were not the result of mistake, fear, negligence, or bad judgment,” the office said in the release. “It requires federal prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt what Mr. Van Dyke was thinking when he used deadly force, and that he knew such force was excessive.” Van Dyke, who was captured on video shooting the teenager 16 times, was convicted in Chicago in 2018 of second-degree murder and aggravated battery and sentenced to 81 months in state prison. The former officer served less than half that sentence before he was released from prison in February.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: A priest who was “suspended from public ministry” last month is suing a man who came forward with allegations about the priest’s behavior. James De Oreo, who was an associate pastor at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, was suspended March 11 after allegations of “inappropriate conduct with a minor.” The priest filed a lawsuit April 4 against the man who wrote two letters in 2021 to the Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana about De Oreo’s behavior toward him when he was a teen attending St. Alphonsus Liguori Catholic Church in Zionsville. The man said he was considering becoming a priest, and De Oreo used his position of power to emotionally abuse, sexually harass and groom him for sexual abuse. This led to an eating disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as “extreme emotional distress” from acts that his lawyer said were intentional and preventable. In the lawsuit, De Oreo disputed the man’s claims and said there was no “intentional infliction of emotional distress.” He said the man’s allegations could lead to “irreparable harm” that would prevent him from participating in parish ministry and doing his job. Diocese spokesperson Gabby Hlavek confirmed the diocese was aware of the De Oreo’s lawsuit but didn’t comment further.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A ride at an amusement park where an 11-year-old boy died last summer will not reopen this year, the park’s new owners said. Bill Lentz, general manager of Adventureland in Altoona, said officials have not determined if the Raging River ride will ever reopen. Michael Jaramillo died and his brother and father were injured July 3, 2021, after their raft overturned and trapped them in the water. Park owner Palace Entertainment has hired the ride’s original maker, Intamin Amusement Rides, to determine what would be needed to make the ride safe, Lentz said. That project could take several months, he said. Palace Entertainment, the U.S. subsidiary of Madrid-based Parques Reunidos, bought the almost 48-year-old theme park in December. Ryan Best, the attorney representing the Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, said recently that his clients believe the ride should never be reopened. The Iowa Division of Labor, which licenses amusement park rides, required Adventureland to make several changes and receive approval from the ride’s manufacturer or a certified engineer to reopen the ride.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Under legislation signed Monday by Gov. Laura Kelly, fairgoers will be able to more widely consume adult beverages at the Kansas State Fair. The proposal, Senate Bill 2, will allow beer and wine to be consumed outside designated areas. The fairground’s current liquor policy confines drinking to the grandstands and certain beer gardens throughout the property. It will also pave the way for the sale of hard liquor. Fair officials have not yet determined if the policies will be in place for the 2022 edition of the fair, scheduled to take place Sept. 9-18, or if they will instead roll out next year. The policy was intended to help the fair recoup revenue lost after the 2020 event was canceled due to COVID-19. Legislative proponents of the bill also argued it was in line with what consumers were demanding from the event. “People wanted to have more wine and more outlets at the state fairground. They also wanted spirits,” Rep. Louis Ruiz, D-Kansas City, said on the floor of the Kansas House. “They wanted to walk around to look at animals ...with a daiquiri.” But the move was not without its critics, some of whom argued making liquor more readily accessible would harm the fair’s family-friendly nature. Some Wichita-area lawmakers pointed to the city’s vaunted Riverfest festival, which opted to expand liquor sales, dividing residents.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: The National Corvette Museum says it’s adding an education gallery that will feature artifacts and interactive technology to share the brand’s story. Construction of the 2,000-square-foot gallery is set to begin in late May, museum officials said. The gallery is scheduled to open late this year or in early 2023 at the Bowling Green-based museum. “This new gallery will educate, engage and entertain our guests,” said Sharon Brawner, the museum’s president and CEO. The gallery will provide a state-of-the-art educational experience geared toward the next generation of Corvette enthusiasts, the museum said. “The new education gallery will be designed for both children and adults to enjoy, featuring artifacts and interactive technology celebrating the unique story of Corvette,” said museum educator Deb Howard. The project was made possible through the generosity of donors Tim and Melanie McMichael of Gypsum, Colorado, the museum said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A proposal to let New Orleans adopt a set of gun control measures than are stronger than the state currently allows was overwhelmingly rejected Tuesday by a state House panel. The Criminal Justice Committee voted 9-1 against the measure by state Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, despite calls for passage from a City Council member, a deputy chief of the police department and District Attorney Jason Williams. Among the specified laws the city would have been allowed to pass were the bill to become law: a requirement that loss or theft of firearms be reported to police, prohibition against openly carrying firearms at public events requiring government permits, and prohibition on carrying firearms where alcohol is being served. Backers of the bill said it would help fight increasing violent crime by helping prevent gun trafficking or the use of guns at large events where alcohol is consumed, in a city known for festivals and Bourbon Street nightlife. “At the end of the day, we’re asking this committee and the Legislature to allow New Orleans to carve out legislation that affects the unique problems that we have,” said City Council member Eugene Green. Gun control advocates said the laws the city sought to pass would be ineffective and slammed the bill as an attack on Second Amendment rights.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The arrival of the first large cruise ship in two and a half years in Maine is another signal tourism is getting closer to pre-pandemic normalcy. Last year, more than 15.6 million visitors came to the state – a third more than made the trip the year before, at the start of the pandemic, officials said. But there were no large cruise ships until the arrival of the Norwegian Pearl in the waters off Bar Harbor. The ship dropped anchor in Frenchman Bay, and visitors were ferried to shore on tenders. “It’s exciting to see these ships and their passengers coming back to Maine,” said Sarah Flink, executive director of CruiseMaine. Cruise ships could restore some visitation. The number of visitors last year remained about a million below 2019, before the pandemic. Cruise ships made 409 port calls and brought 450,000 passengers in 2019. One positive sign from the 2021 tourism numbers is that spending soared. Spending grew 63.7% from 2020 and 20.3% from 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A former small-city mayor who admitted to posting nude photos of his ex-girlfriend on Reddit will not have to spend time behind bars under a plea deal announced by the state prosecutor’s office on Monday. Former Cambridge Mayor Andrew Bradshaw pleaded guilty to five counts of distributing revenge porn online and was sentenced to a year and a day for each of the five counts, with all the incarceration time suspended. He also was sentenced to three years of supervised probation and fined $1,000 for each count. Bradshaw was ordered to pay $750 in restitution to the victim and to perform 100 hours of community service. The ex-mayor had faced a maximum penalty of two years’ incarceration and a $5,000 fine for each count. Bradshaw pleaded guilty to posting nude photos of a woman with whom he was once in a relationship after the relationship had ended. The woman contacted authorities in May after learning the photos were posted on Reddit. She told authorities she had sent the photos only to Bradshaw while they were in an intimate relationship, and she didn’t give him permission to redistribute them. Investigators discovered Bradshaw had made numerous separate public posts that contained at least 10 unique visual representations of the victim, many with language related to humiliation and degradation, the state prosecutor’s office said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A shooting at an MBTA station in the city left one person injured Monday, according to transit police. Officers were called to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s Ruggles Station shortly after 6 p.m. on reports of shots fired. At an area where buses stop for passengers, officers found a man suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. The man was taken to a hospital with injuries that were considered serious but not life-threatening, police said. No arrests had been made in the shooting. Police said they were investigating and would continue to look for suspects. Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden denounced the shooting and said gun violence “is something that we’ve really got to lay a hold of and take care of.” “Every time there’s a shooting, there are multiple victims,” Hayden said, according to WCVB-TV. “There’s obviously the victim that’s shot, but there’s also the community at large.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state has reached a 19.3% recycling rate, an increase of 35.4% from prior to 2019, according to an analysis the state of Michigan released Monday ahead of Earth Day on Friday. Before 2019, the state estimated Michigan’s recycling rate, the rate at which recyclable materials are recycled from waste, was 14.25%. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy estimates the state now has a 35.4% recycling rate. Increasing access to recycling services has helped the state to increase recycling, EGLE Director Liesl Clark said at a news conference Monday. More than 75% of the state’s households have access to either curbside recycling bins or drop-off sites in their communities. The increase in recycling equals out to Michigan recycling 500,000 more tons of recyclable materials a year, according to EGLE. Since 2019, more than $460 million has been invested into technology for recycling and maintaining existing recycling infrastructure, Clark said, all in an effort to help Michigan reach its goals to fight climate change and reach a 45% recycling rate by 2030. This Thursday, the state will release a plan outlining a 30-year strategy to make Michigan a carbon neutral state by 2050. A rough draft of the plan was released earlier this year.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Roseville School District has settled two federal lawsuits accusing a former second grade teacher of discriminating against Black students. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the district settled the cases privately, and terms were not disclosed. One case was settled last week and the other in January, according to court records. The lawsuits accused Geraldine Cook of making the Black students in her class sit apart from their peers in 2019. She allegedly grabbed a girl’s arm, tearing her shirt, and choked a boy after he gargled water and made him walk to the principal’s office with his hands behind his back. The mothers of the girl whose shirt was torn and the boy who was choked filed the lawsuits. Cook taught at Harambee Elementary, a year-round racial integration school. She resigned in December 2019.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An assistant chief says the city’s police department is short-staffed, and recruitment and retention are big challenges. Joseph Wade of Jackson Police Department discussed staffing levels Monday during the City Council’s Public Safety Committee meeting, WLBT-TV reports. He said JPD is budgeted for 356 sworn officers but has 258. On the civilian side, JPD is budgeted for 199 employees and has 132. “I went to a leadership class in Ohio, and guess what? They’re having (retention issues),” he said. “It’s not a popular job right now.” JPD loses officers to smaller departments, where officers can earn comparable salaries but answer fewer calls, Wade said. He said the city needs to enforce a state law that would require departments to reimburse JPD for training costs of any officer it hires who has been with Jackson less than three years. Wade said JPD leaders appreciate the premium pay that the City Council approved for police department employees earlier this year. The assistant chief also suggested a signing bonus and a tuition reimbursement program for new officers. Capitol police officers, who work for the state Department of Public Safety, also patrol in parts of Jackson where state government buildings are located.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Regal fritillary butterflies, which subsist on violets and stick to prairie habitats, are disappearing. “They’ve almost been entirely lost from the eastern U.S.,” Chris Barnhart, distinguished professor of biology at Missouri State University, said of the vulnerable insect species. One-third of Missouri used to be covered in tallgrass prairie. Where there’s a decent patch of prairie, regal fritillary butterflies can be seen in good numbers, Barnhart said. However, without extra help, Missouri may lose the “Queen of the Prairie” altogether. MSU and the Missouri Department of Conservation are two years deep into a project to examine the reproduction and survival of the butterflies, developing methods to raise them in captivity and reintroducing them to suitable sites. Missouri has some of the highest numbers of these butterflies, Barnhart said during a tour of MSU’s Temple Hall greenhouse. Fifteen million acres of tallgrass prairie once covered Missouri, said Francis Skalicky, MDC spokesman. “Today, 99% of Missouri’s tallgrass prairie habitat has disappeared, and a number of species that depend on plants found in this habitat have been negatively impacted by the state’s dwindling prairie acreage,” Skalicky said. The regal fritillary butterflies are considered “a species of concern” and at a S3 level of endangerment, Skalicky said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The board of trustees of the state’s largest school district has voted to allow students additional time to graduate after a public campaign by the family of a student with Down syndrome who otherwise would not have been allowed to attend her senior year with her classmates. Under the policy passed Monday by a 5-3 vote, any student who does not turn 20 before Sept. 10 will be able to enroll in classes at Billings high schools. For students receiving special education services, enrollment will continue as long as the student hasn’t turned 21 before the Sept. 10 deadline, The Billings Gazette reports. The family of Emily Pennington had urged the school district to take advantage of a law passed by the Legislature in 2021 that offered some state funding for students who are receiving special education services to continue attending school as long as they had not turned 21 before Sept. 10 and had not graduated. Schools are not required to participate. Emily repeated kindergarten because she had been dealing with numerous medical issues. She will turn 19 in July, which would have made her ineligible to attend school this fall under the old policy. After the school board declined to hear Emily’s request for a change in the age-out policy, Billings West students staged a brief walk-out in support.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, a Democrat who served one term representing the state’s Omaha-centered district, died Tuesday morning. He was 72. Ashford’s family announced his death in a Facebook post, saying that “his death was peaceful though much too premature.” Just two months earlier, Ashford had revealed he was undergoing treatment for brain cancer. Ashford was a state senator from Omaha when he unseated longtime Republican incumbent Lee Terry to represent Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. Ashford lost the seat two years later to current GOP Rep. Don Bacon. He sought the seat again in 2018 but lost the Democratic primary to Kara Eastman. In 2020, his wife, Ann Ferlic Ashford, announced her candidacy for the seat, but she also lost the primary to Eastman. Brad Ashford shook up the general election race by endorsing Bacon over Eastman. An attorney and lifelong Omaha resident, he began his political career in the 1980s as a Democrat but switched parties several times over the years and pitched himself as an independent-minded moderate. Ashford earned his bachelor’s degree from Colgate University in 1971 and his law degree from Creighton University in Omaha in 1974. He worked as an attorney for the Federal Highway Administration in 1974 before opening a private practice the next year. In the 1990s, he became co-owner of the Nebraska Clothing Company.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Nevada office of the FBI has a new special agent in charge, with the announcement Monday that Spencer Evans will head the bureau’s Las Vegas field office. Evans has held various investigative and leadership positions since joining the FBI in 2004 as an agent in New Haven, Connecticut. His most recent post was as deputy assistant director in human resources at FBI Headquarters in Washington. In Las Vegas, Evans replaces Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse, who retired in February after 25 years with the bureau. Rouse arrived in the city in 2016 and headed the Nevada field office during the 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that killed 58 people and became the deadliest in modern U.S. history. Two additional deaths later were attributed to the shooting.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMerrimack: A chemical company agreed Monday to providing drinking water to about 1,000 properties in the state that showed elevated levels of toxic industrial compounds associated with serious health conditions. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics announced the agreement for properties in the towns of Bedford, Hudson, Litchfield, Londonderry and Merrimack. It also provides a framework should additional properties be affected. “Ensuring safe drinking water is something we take very seriously,” state Attorney General John Formella said in a statement. “This agreement is an important step forward in a continuing, multi-faceted effort to ensure impacted New Hampshire residents have access to clean drinking water.” A spokesperson for Saint-Gobain didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company, which bought the Merrimack plant from ChemFAB in 2000, initially believed it wasn’t emitting anything harmful. But the state said that changed in 2004 after the company installed more sophisticated technology and realized it was emitting the chemical. After the company alerted the state, DES determined Saint-Gobain was exceeding state air limits for the chemical, and the company agreed to significantly reduce emissions.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s robust sports betting market broke the $1 billion mark for the sixth time last month in terms of the amount of bets taken. But the news was bad in March for seven of the nine casinos that continued to lag behind their in-person gambling revenue levels from before the coronavirus pandemic hit, according to figures released Monday by state gambling regulators. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement reported the state’s casinos and three horse tracks that take sports bets handled over $1.12 billion worth of such wagers in March, aided by the March Madness college basketball tournament. Yet out of that total, only $66.4 million was kept as sports betting revenue by the casinos and tracks after paying off winning bets, third-party partners and other expenses. The casinos and tracks made $423.6 million in gambling and sports betting revenue in March, up nearly 18% from a year earlier. However, that comparison is flawed because in March 2021, Atlantic City’s casinos were still operating under state-imposed pandemic-related restrictions. Going back two years is also an invalid comparison because the casinos shut down in the middle of March 2020 as the pandemic originally surged.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is getting married, and Vice President Kamala Harris has been picked to officiate. The first-term Democratic governor made the announcement through her personal spokesman Tuesday, saying a small ceremony will be held May 21 in Washington, D.C. No other details about the upcoming ceremony were released. Lujan Grisham, who is running for reelection, will be tying the knot with fiancé Manny Cordova. The couple have been together about 10 years, and Cordova was at her side during an inaugural Mass in Santa Fe before her public swearing-in ceremony Jan. 1, 2019. “We’re delighted to celebrate our wedding in front of family and close friends,” Lujan Grisham and Cordova said in a joint statement. “Like so many New Mexicans, we’ve postponed family celebrations over the past two years during this pandemic. We feel fortunate to be with our loved ones in celebration of our marriage.” The couple initially planned to get married in 2021 but had not set a date, said Jared Leopold, a spokesman for Lujan Grisham. Both Lujan Grisham, 62, and Cordova, 66, were previously married and have adult children and grandchildren. Lujan Grisham was married to her first husband, Gregory Grisham, for more than 20 years until his death in 2004. The son of ranchers, Cordova grew up in a rural community south of Albuquerque. He owns an auto repair shop in Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nBinghamton: About 100,000 customers were without power Tuesday morning in upstate New York as a late-season storm dumped a foot or more of heavy, wet snow on some high-elevation areas. In the Binghamton area, Broome County Executive Jason Garnar declared a state of emergency and issued a travel ban for nonessential workers. Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an interview on Binghamton radio station WNBF that listeners in the area should stay home if they could. “It was a very heavy snow. And as a result, the weight … is snapping these limbs, which is sad when you see your beautiful trees harmed like that,” Hochul said. “But it also can be dangerous for people walking on the streets or walking under power lines or if people are getting into their cars.” Some higher-elevation areas of the Southern Tier had up to 14 inches of snow, though accumulations were less for lower elevations, according to the National Weather Service in Binghamton. “That is pretty typical for a for a late-season storm; you’re going to have quite a bit of elevation dependency,” said meteorologist Bryan Greenblatt. Power outages stretched from the Southern Tier to the Adirondack Mountains, which was forecast to get up to a foot of snow by Tuesday night.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Buncombe County jail detainees have spent up to a week in group holding areas with no blankets, constant light, cold temperatures, and nowhere to sleep but hard surfaces, such as concrete floors, according to several people who spent time behind bars in the local facility. “There’s no cots; they don’t give you a blanket. Everyone is in flip-flops without socks. And all the drunk tanks were full. There’s 10 of you in there. And it’s all concrete,” said Eric Stimson, who said he spent five days trying to find ways to sleep and stay warm in a group cell with an overflowing toilet before being moved to a regular cell for the remainder of his 16-day DUI sentence in January. The harsh conditions were detailed by three detainees and confirmed by the Buncombe County chief public defender. They appear to represent direct violations of state rules meant to protect those in the custody of the jail, most of whom have not been convicted of crimes of which they are charged and are awaiting their day in court. Spokespeople for Sheriff Quentin Miller, who is responsible for managing the jail, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In an attempt to block out light to sleep and find some comfort, detainees took to stuffing their court papers behind COVID-19 masks to use as eye shields, Stimson said, adding that they would stack their slippers to create something like a pillow. As far as COVID-19 infection concerns go, “if you didn’t have COVID coming in, you’ve got it now,” he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: The future of Minot State University’s sports bubble is up in the air after a blizzard last week caused it to collapse. The university was forced to cancel all the activities that were scheduled in the bubble, which is on the grounds of the athletic facility. The bubble has been used as a fallback location for softball games when weather is poor, Minot Daily News reports. And MSU planned to hold a spring football game in the bubble, which is also used for various sports practices. The athletic staff is meeting this week to begin rescheduling and searching for other places to practice. Athletic director Andy Carter said the university is waiting for the company that supplied the bubble in 2016 to send representatives to assess the damage and how much it would cost to repair it. “It’s covered in snow now,” he said. “You can’t even really get to it right now.” He said a considerable amount of sporting equipment had been stored in the bubble. “It could be a big issue. We don’t even know because we can’t see it. So we don’t know if it’s damaged or it’s just sitting there under the tarp,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A judge has blocked early enforcement of an abortion law signed by Gov. Mike DeWine in December that included additional licensing requirements challenged by the ACLU and Planned Parenthood as unnecessarily onerous. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Alison Hatheway’s ruling Friday blocked restrictions imposed on two southwest Ohio clinics by the Ohio Department of Health that came before June 21. That date ends a 90-period for compliance that followed its original effective date of March 23. Hatheway issued a temporary restraining order against the law March 2, before it could take effect. The stated goal of the bill was to impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance of a baby born alive following an abortion attempt. However, provisions were added to the legislation that prevented abortion providers from contracting with backup physicians who teach at or contract with public medical schools. Abortion rights groups said eliminating such a broad swath of physicians to serve as their backups could lead to two clinics in southwest Ohio being closed. The lawsuit argued the requirements would almost certainly have shuttered Women’s Med in Dayton and Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio in suburban Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed legislation Monday to allow law enforcement to keep from the public audio or video recordings showing an officer’s line-of-duty death. The measure was drafted after Tulsa police were required under Oklahoma law to release a video of a suspect shooting two officers, one of whom later died. A jury trial began Monday for the man accused of the killing. “This bill is about protecting the dignity not only of our fallen heroes but their fellow officers and surviving family members who can be retraumatized by these recordings,” state Sen. John Haste, R-Broken Arrow, said in a statement. “It can also make it more difficult to seat a jury in such cases.” The bill prohibits the public release of such videos unless a judge determines the public interest outweighs the reason for denial. It also authorizes a deceased officer’s family members to view the audio or video. Prosecutors and defense attorneys retain the right to use such videos in legal proceedings under the new law.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown has signed a bill into law that phases out the state’s agricultural overtime pay exemption. The Capital Press reports Brown wrote in a letter Friday to Senate President Peter Courtney and Speaker of the House Dan Rayfield that she views the bill as an important step in the right direction to correct a historic wrong. “This policy will make a significant difference in the lives of farmworkers and their families,” Brown wrote. The new law establishes overtime pay requirements for agricultural workers in Oregon after 40 hours per week, with the requirements phased in over five years starting in 2023. Under the law, farmworkers will be owed time-and-a-half overtime wages after 55 weekly hours of work next year, after 48 hours of work in 2025-2026 and then after 40 hours per week beginning in 2027. Most farmers will be eligible for one of three tiers of tax credits, depending on how many people they employ. Tax credits will incrementally decline between 2023 and 2028 and then will end or be reevaluated by lawmakers. Brown wrote that the law may need to be changed and improved over time, so she said it’s important that conversation about the issue continue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDents Run: The FBI might not have found any Civil War-era gold at a remote woodland site, but it definitely has records of the agency’s 2018 dig and will soon have to turn them over to a father-son pair of treasure hunters. A federal judge has ordered the FBI to speed up the release of records about the search for the legendary gold, ruling Monday in favor of Finders Keepers, the treasure hunting outfit that led FBI agents to the remote site. The group accuses the Justice Department of slow-walking their request for information. The FBI must turn over 1,000 pages of records per month, starting in 30 days, and the first batch of records must include a key report sought by Finders Keepers, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta ordered. The ruling came four months after Finders Keepers sued the Justice Department over its failure to produce records on the FBI’s search. The FBI has long insisted its March 2018 dig came up empty, but Finders Keepers says the government has acted suspiciously throughout the four-year saga. Finders Keepers’ owners, the father-son duo of Dennis and Kem Parada, spent years looking for the fabled 1863 shipment of Union gold that was supposedly lost or stolen on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. The pair eventually led the FBI to the remote site, where the agency took over.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s newly formed reparations commission is considering what form payments might take and looking to other cities for inspiration. In a meeting Monday, Silas Pinto, who is serving as Providence’s first-ever director of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, noted that reparations are being considered and implemented in a dozen other cities, including Boston and Amherst, Massachusetts. So far, housing and land ownership comprise one of the largest spending categories for cities investing in reparations. Those funds are not paid to individuals but toward renovations and down payments, for example. Direct cash payments, tuition and scholarships have also been popular investments. Pinto said it’s evident that cities are “viewing reparations work really through the lens of closing the racial wealth gap,” and “it’s going to come down to issues around land ownership, around how are we supporting our minority-owned businesses, and how are we helping individuals?” However, as Providence is aiming to use $15 million in federal pandemic relief, it will need to comply with rules on how those funds should be spent.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Five University of South Carolina trustees won’t be allowed to run for reelection next month after some powerful lawmakers felt they were responsible for hiring a president who crudely criticized the school, interfered in daily school affairs and left in less than two years. The legislative board that screens university trustees is refusing to send them to a May 4 election by the General Assembly at which more than a dozen other trustees for universities across the state will be elected. The decision comes as the state Senate prepares to review a bill that passed the House earlier this month, the day after it was proposed, that would fire all current trustees at the end of June 2023 and redraw their districts, cutting the board from 20 members to 13. Trustees kicked off the board could run for the new seats. The University of South Carolina trustees the College and University Trustee Screening Commission refused to allow to run for reelection to a new four-year term are board chairman C. Dorn Smith as well as trustees Thad Westbrook, C. Edward Floyd, John von Lehe and Charles Williams. The trustees will be allowed to remain until either the board is restructured or the screening board takes further action.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A deadline for Gov. Kristi Noem to respond to a pair of ethics complaints levied again her last year has passed. But neither Noem nor the panel of retired judges vetting whether the Republican governor misused state airplanes for personal use and improperly interfered in a state certification program in which her daughter was enrolled will say whether a response was submitted by Friday’s deadline. The South Dakota Government Accountability Board is scheduled to revisit both complaints during its next meeting at 10 a.m. May 2 in Sioux Falls. But because the confidential nature of the board and the complaints it examines, few other details are known. Assistant Attorney General Katie Mallery, who serves as the board’s liaison, said Tuesday that the April 15 deadline for the subject of the complaints to respond remained in place, though she declined to say whether any response or responses were received by the board. Created in 2017 by the Legislature, the South Dakota Government Accountability investigates complaints against state officials. The majority of its work is done behind closed doors. Considering complaints in secret, GAB is by law required to keep any complaints and related information it receives confidential throughout its proceedings.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican legislators passed legislation Monday to make camping on public property a misdemeanor crime, which critics say effectively criminalizes homelessness. Under HB978, a person who camps on the shoulder, right-of-way, bridge, overpass or underpass of a state or interstate highway could face a misdemeanor offense and a $50 fine or community service requirement. The legislation cleared the state Senate last week after a lengthy debate and now goes to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. Sponsors Sen. Paul Bailey, R-Sparta, and Rep. Ryan Williams, R-Cookeville, have defended the bill as a tool local law enforcement could use to address homelessness. Rep. Antonio Parkinson, D-Memphis, said he experienced homelessness multiple times as a child and criticized the legislation, calling for a more “compassionate” approach. Sen. Frank Niceley, R-Strawberry Plains, drew widespread criticism last week for meandering comments tenuously connecting Adolf Hitler to the legislation. Niceley said Hitler at one point lived on the streets and used the experience as a “way to connect with the masses.” “People can come out of these camps and have a very productive life, or in Hitler’s case, a very unproductive life,” Niceley said. Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Nashville, called the comments “embarrassing” to Tennessee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Some Republicans are pushing state leaders to declare an “invasion” at the Mexican border in response to an increase in migrant border crossings, allowing Texas to enforce federal immigration policies, according to some interpretations of the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, chair of the House Committee on General Investigating, has asked state Attorney General Ken Paxton for a legal opinion on “whether the federal government has failed to uphold its obligations to protect Texas from invasion under article IV section 4 of the United States Constitution, and whether Texas has the sovereign power to defend itself from invasion.” Paxton’s opinion would be nonbinding, but his answer could add ammunition to a push from conservative groups for states bordering Mexico to use a formal declaration of an “invasion” to justify allowing state authorities to deport migrants suspected of crossing the border illegally. The effort comes as Republicans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have continued to criticize the Biden administration for not doing enough to stem the flow of illegal immigration and as federal authorities prepare to end a Trump-era public health mandate that allowed for the immediate expulsion of migrants.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Huge numbers of Washington County students started eating breakfast and lunch at school last year when pandemic-related federal waivers made it possible for schools to offer free meals to all students. Now, the program that made those free meals possible is ending, and some hunger advocates are worried that children who benefited from the program could go back to being hungry. The Seamless Summer Option program had allowed any Washington County School District student to receive two free meals per day, regardless of status. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, school officials in Washington County and across the U.S. were concerned for students’ well-being and whether they would find enough food to eat. The U.S. Department of Agriculture set aside money to help schools offer free meals on a temporary basis. With the expiration of the federal waivers, as well as the SSO program, local schools will go back to offering free or reduced-price meals only to students who qualify under household income guidelines. With no limits on who could get their meals for free, the district saw large increases in the number of students who ate at school. In September 2020, the district provided 1,842 breakfasts and 10,712 lunches a day on average. By March 2022, those figures had jumped to 4,531 and 16,166.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: After a failed attempt to pass a plan to regulate short-term rentals, city councilors have decided to begin the process again in an attempt to reach a compromise. City officials and councilors agree that short-term rentals are contributing to the housing shortage. The ongoing argument lies in how to regulate the housing that is commonly rented through sites like Airbnb and VRBO. A new version of the ordinance that will be considered in the City Council’s ordinance committee would allow for short-term rentals to be located in detached homes, accessory dwelling units, duplexes and homes with three to four units as long as they are on the same lot as the host’s primary residence. Hosts could also rent their own home out to guests. The exceptions to the necessity for owner-occupancy would be seasonal homes and units in a multi-unit building where one unit is rented out at an affordable rate to a long-term tenant. A previous version of the ordinance that Mayor Miro Weinberger vetoed would have limited short-term rentals to bedrooms within a host’s home with few exceptions. The prior proposal would have stopped people from creating short-term rentals out of independent units on their property such as detached houses, carriage houses and units in an owner-occupied multi-unit home.The ordinance committee will bring a new proposal for regulating short-term rentals to council by June 1.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The father of a journalist fatally shot during a live broadcast in 2015 has conceded that he failed to make the ballot in the Democratic nomination contest for the 5th Congressional District. Andy Parker, who announced in January that he would seek to unseat incumbent GOP Rep. Bob Good, said in a statement Monday that he would instead throw his support to Democratic nominee Josh Throneburg. “I was looking forward to a spirited primary and campaign against Good this fall, but to my great disappointment our campaign did not meet the technical requirements to be on the primary ballot. I want to thank the thousands of Virginians and supporters across America who stood with me,” Parker said. Since the death of daughter Alison, a 24-year-old reporter at Roanoke’s WDBJ-TV who was killed by a former colleague during an interview, Parker has pushed for gun-control measures. He’s also battled with Facebook over its allowing the video of his daughter’s slaying to circulate. Parker’s campaign told WDBJ last week that it was reviewing its petition signatures after being informed that the 5th District Committee was able to verify only 937 of the 1,000 required. Alison Parker’s death also prompted her boyfriend, WDBJ anchor Chris Hurst, to run for the General Assembly in 2017. The Democrat served two terms in the House of Delegates before being unseated by a Republican last November.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Klickitat County’s claim to a portion of the Yakama Indian Reservation, likely ending a dispute that has raged for more than a century. The court denied the county’s appeal without comment. Klickitat County had argued that 121,465 acres in the southwestern portion of the reservation, including the eastern half of Mount Adams and the Glenwood Valley, were not actually included when the reservation was created. “The Supreme Court’s decision once again validates the continuing strength of our treaty rights under the United States Constitution,” said Yakama Tribal Council Chairman Delano Saluskin. “The Yakama Nation will never compromise when our treaty is at stake.” The dispute involved ambiguous language in the tribe’s Treaty of 1855 with the U.S. government. Territorial Gov. Isaac Stevens, who drafted the treaty, wrote that the reservation’s southwestern border passed “south and east of Mount Adams, to the spur whence flows the waters of the Klickatat and Pisco rivers.” The tribe said that no such spur existed and that the Yakama Nation had always understood that Mount Adams and land known as Tract D was reservation land. That position was affirmed by the Indian Claims Commission in 1966, by an executive order by President Richard Nixon in 1972, by federal surveyors in 1982 and by numerous earlier court cases.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: New River Gorge National Park and Preserve is offering special events this week to celebrate National Park Week. The park is uploading its museum collection online. Information and images give details about the prehistoric and industrial past of the communities in the area. Some of the more than 5,000 items include a miner’s belt designed for self-rescue, a fossil from a time when the entire gorge was an underwater home to marine life and a Native American hammerstone used to prepare food hundreds of years ago. On Wednesday, the public can watch Cultural Resource Program Manager David Fuerst clean a 1942 mural that depicts early 20th-century coal miners. The park hopes to restore the painting to its appearance 80 years ago. The mural demonstration leads up to the opening Friday of the Smithsonian Institution’s “Crossroads: Change in Rural America” exhibit at the historic Cottle Mountainair Hotel in Mount Hope. The exhibit runs through May 30. Winning art for the Youth Arts in the Parks Appalachian Spring Wildflower Art Contest will continue to be displayed at Tamarack Marketplace and online at nps.gov/neri/youth-arts-in-the-parks.htm.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The brother of former first lady Michelle Obama and his wife are suing a private school alleging it refused to allow their two sons to reenroll after they voiced concerns that racism and inappropriate conduct at the school had not been satisfactorily addressed. In a civil lawsuit filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court, Craig and Kelly Robinson accuse University School of Milwaukee of terminating their 9- and 11-year-old sons’ reenrollment contracts for the 2021-2022 school year after the couple complained that teachers treated students of color and socioeconomically underrepresented students unfairly. According to the lawsuit filed Monday, the school failed to provide the supportive and inclusive learning environment it had promised in its enrollment contracts with the Robinsons. The boys had attended the pre-K-12 school for about five years, the Robinsons said Tuesday in an interview with the Associated Press. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and a trial by jury. USM said in a statement that the enrollment decision had nothing to do with their complaints of inequity or discrimination. The independent school, with a campus that stretches from Milwaukee to the nearby suburb of River Hills, enrolls about 1,100 students every year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Federal officials are including only about two-thirds the previously expected number of Wyoming sites for lease for oil and gas exploration this summer, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The first such lease sale of President Joe Biden’s administration will list 129 tracts across the state, covering more than 130,000 acres, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}]}

Who is the richest person in the world?\n\n1. Who is the richest person in the world?\n\nTesla’s chief Elon Musk took the top spot in the Forbes 36th Annual World’s Billionaires List for the first time this year.\n\nWhen Forbes “locked in” the net fortunes of the planet’s richest people in March, Musk was worth an estimated $219bn, having added $68bn to his fortune in the 12 months before “on the back of a 33% jump in the share price” of the electric vehicle maker.\n\nThe magazine’s real-time rankings show that his fortune has fluctuated and returned to $219bn as of today, while several of the other top ten have seen their wealth drop. “Investors are feeling the effects of new inflation data and hiked interest rates that hit US markets - and the richest people in the world are not immune,” said US magazine Entrepreneur.\n\nThe last few years have also been “a roller-coaster ride” for Bernard Arnault, the luxury goods tycoon, said Business Insider. The pandemic “sank” LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton stock, but “strong sales” in his fashion businesses and “an uptick in alcohol sales” have meant he has maintained a pole position in the rich list leaderboards.\n\nHere The Week looks at the top ten richest people in the world, according to the Forbes real-time billionaires list.\n\nElon Musk: $219bn Elon Musk is the CEO of electric car giant Tesla and the founder and CEO of SpaceX. He divides his time between the two companies and projects like Hyperloop, a proposed ultra-high-speed train line. In April 2022 it was announced that Musk had become Twitter’s single biggest shareholder after buying a 9.2% stake worth almost $3bn. A “months-long saga” has been underway since January, when Musk first began investing in Twitter, before offering to buy the company in April for $44bn, said ABC News. He attempted to pull out of the deal and then revived his plans again last week. A guide to Elon Musk’s big family\n\nBernard Arnault and family: $146.2bn “When it comes to the world of luxury goods, perhaps no one is more successful than Bernard Arnault,” said Business Insider. The Frenchman – and wealthiest European on the rich list – oversees the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton empire of more than 70 brands, including Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and TAG Heuer.\n\nJeff Bezos: $136bn Former hedge fund manager Jeff Bezos started Amazon in his garage in 1994. He has invested heavily in space technology too, having founded Blue Origin as a “pet project” back in 2000. After stepping down as Amazon CEO he took on the new role of executive chair. He also owns The Washington Post newspaper. Into the blue: a new frontier for Jeff Bezos\n\nGautam Adani & family $127.8bn Gautam Adani has made his money through infrastructural investment. The share price in his listed companies “in sectors ranging from ports to power stations” have risen sharply this year, and he “briefly” overtook Bezos to become the world’s second richest man in September, reported CNN Business. Now, “he may be too big to fail”.\n\nBill Gates: $101.3bn Microsoft founder Bill Gates has been a permanent fixture near the top of the rich list for the past 20 years, despite selling and then giving away much of his stake in the tech company. He now owns just 1% and focuses predominantly on his philanthropic work.\n\nWarren Buffett: $96.1bn Buffet was 11 years old when he first bought stock, according to Forbes. Now in his ninth decade, the Berkshire Hathaway chief executive, known as the “Oracle of Omaha”, is one of the most successful investors of all time. Like Bill Gates, Buffett has pledged to give away more than 99% of his fortune to charity.\n\nLarry Ellison: $89.1bn American business magnate Larry Ellison is co-founder, chairman and chief technology officer of Oracle. He owns around 35% of the software giant.\n\nLarry Page: $85.8bn Internet entrepreneur Larry Page is one of the co-founders of Google. He stepped down as CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc in December 2019 but remains a board member.\n\nMukesh Ambani: $84.9bn Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani is founder and chairman of Reliance Industries.

Gates has been the richest person in the world for 18 of the past 24 years.

What constitutes “wealthy” today may be very different from what it meant to be rich a century ago. In fact, as inflation increases the price of living, the number of billionaires is increasing as well.\n\nIn 2021, Forbes reported 2,755 billionaires worldwide. The 2021 list added a record high of nearly 500 new billionaires from 2020.

Musa and the empire owned almost half of the Old World’s gold, BBC reports. Musa is credited for funding and encouraging literature, education, architecture and the arts.\n\nAccording to History.com, Musa showed the true size of his wealth on a pilgrimage to Mecca, surrounded by tens of thousands of soldiers and slaves carrying mass amounts of gold. He left behind gifts of gold as he crossed through Egypt, a gift generous in thought but not in actuality. The precious resource actually decreased the value of metal and had a disastrous impact on the economy for over a decade.\n\nWho was the first billionaire?\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller became the world’s first billionaire by measurable dollars. The Standard Oil Company founder became a billionaire in 1916 and was worth about 2% of the national economy. According to Forbes, the Rockefeller family’s wealth stood at $8.4 billion as of 2020. The fortune is spread out among over 70 heirs.\n\nJust curious?:We're answering life's everyday questions.\n\nWho is the richest person in the world?\n\nElon Musk holds the title of richest person in the world as of September 2022.

Bezos ranked number one on Forbes’ list in 2020 and 2021.

Sam Walton was the founder of Walmart, and left behind his legacy and wealth to his three children and their families.\n\nComing in close behind the Walton family for the title of the world’s richest family is the Mars family with an estimated wealth of $142 billion and the Koch family at $124 billion, according to Investopedia.\n\nWho owns Walmart?:A look at the biggest shareholders in the company.\n\nWho is Elon Musk?:What to know about the Tesla CEO", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/03/01/zuckerberg-top-gainer-forbes-2016-billionaires-list/81146342/", "title": "'Forbes' 2016 richest list: Zuckerberg zooms up", "text": "Kevin McCoy\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the biggest gainer in Forbes' 2016 billionaires list of the world's richest people, moving up 10 spots from last year to claim the ranking as the world's sixth richest person, the business magazine said Tuesday.\n\nThe tech executive and social media leader achieved the feat with total net worth that Forbes estimated at $44.6 billion, up from $33.4 billion in the 2015 ranking.\n\nZuckerberg is among 1,810 billionaires who made the updated list, with aggregate net worth of $6.48 trillion, down from $7.05 trillion last year, Forbes said.\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates maintained the top spot as the world's richest person. His estimated $75 billion net worth, down from $79.2 billion last year, gave him the number one position for the 17th time in the last 22 years, Forbes said.\n\nSpanish clothing retailer Amancio Ortega, best known in the U.S. for the Zara fashion chain, moved up two spots to second place as his estimated net worth increased $2.5 billion to $67 billion, the listing showed.\n\nFamed business investor Warren Buffett kept third place in the ranking even though his net worth dropped $11.9 billion to an estimated total of $60.8 billion.\n\nMexican telecom magnate and investor Carlos Slim Helú ranked fourth, down two spots from last year, as his estimated net worth fell to $50 billion from the $77.1 billion Forbes reported in 2015.\n\nAmazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos moved up to fifth place from the 15th spot last year as his net worth increased to $45.2 billion.\n\nRounding out the new top ten are Larry Ellison, executive chairman of software giant Oracle ($43.6 billion); Michael Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor who heads the business information firm that bears his name ($40 billion); and brothers Charles and David Koch ($39.6 billion), who lead U.S. multinational corporation Koch Industries.\n\nThe new ranking is also notable for those who didn't make this year's list.\n\nJ.

Josh Hawley.\n\nThe move marks lawmakers’ latest step against the short-form video app that has become popular with over a billion users worldwide. US officials fear that TikTok’s user data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government due to that country’s influence over TikTok’s parent, ByteDance.\n\nA companion bill was introduced in the House last year by Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck. It has yet to be approved by members of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday it isn’t yet clear whether the chamber will take up the TikTok bill in light of its Senate passage, saying lawmakers were consulting with White House officials on its language.\n\n“Once again, Sen. Hawley has moved forward with legislation to ban TikTok on government devices, a proposal which does nothing to advance U.S. national security interests,” a spokesperson for TikTok said in a statement. “We hope that rather than continuing down that road, he will urge the Administration to move forward on an agreement that would actually address his concerns.”\n\nThe latest legislative action comes as TikTok and the US government have been negotiating a deal that may allow the app to keep serving US users. There have been years of closed-door talks between TikTok and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, as well as recent reports of delays in the negotiations.\n\nSome lawmakers have expressed frustration with an apparent lack of progress in those talks. Following Wednesday’s vote, Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, a vocal critic of TikTok, said of the process: “My patience is running out.”\n\nOn Tuesday, US lawmakers led by Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio introduced a bill to ban TikTok in the United States more generally, along with other apps based in, or under the “substantial influence” of, countries that are considered foreign adversaries, including China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela. In introducing the bill, Rubio also indicated some frustration, saying that the federal government “has yet to take a single meaningful action” on the matter.\n\nBut several senators, including Warner and Hawley, have stopped short of endorsing Rubio’s proposal. On Thursday, Hawley said he would be “fine” if the US government and TikTok reached a deal to safeguard US users’ data. “But if they don’t do that … then I think we’re going to have to look at more stringent measures,” Hawley said.\n\nIn the past two weeks, at least seven states have said they will bar public employees from using the app on government devices, including Alabama, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and Texas. (Another state, Nebraska, banned TikTok from state devices in 2020.)\n\nSome US government agencies have independently taken steps to limit TikTok usage among their employees. Already, the US military, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security have restricted the app from government-owned devices.

Kim Reynolds' public health emergency declaration, but municipal golf courses like Waveland remain open.\n\nMayor Frank Cownie said Saturday afternoon that whether the Des Moines courses stay that way is under review.\n\n“We’re asking our Parks Department to take a look at it and decide whether it’s good policy to stay open at this point,” he said.\n\nGolf course staff are taking precautions, he said, such as only allowing one person to a cart and letting visitors come inside buildings only to use the restrooms.\n\nCownie has advocated for Gov. Kim Reynolds to issue a shelter-in-place order that would limit residents from leaving their homes except out of necessity for essential tasks like getting groceries or medical care. Last week, he called on Des Moines residents to only leave home for essential items for two weeks.\n\nHe said Saturday that he believes a shelter-in-place order from the governor would likely result in the golf courses closing.\n\n\"At the same time, we’re trying to do the conscientious, right thing — regardless of what the governor does,\" he said. \"We’re speaking with public health people and asking, 'What do you think?' \"\n\nCownie said the city is finding as many ways as possible for city employees to work from home and is trying to constantly review its practices to ensure their safety. Leaders are also working to find a balance between giving people public places to exercise while also keeping everyone safe. For example, city parks remain open, but the public playground equipment in the parks is closed.\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, Polk County had 40 reported cases of the coronavirus, second only to Johnson County's 61. There are 298 reported cases in Iowa so far.\n\nIowa National Guard soldiers activate for COVID-19 response\n\nMarch 28: Approximately 75 more Iowa National Guard soldiers activated on Friday to help with the state’s response to the coronavirus.\n\nThe soldiers are with the Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment of the 734th Regional Support Group and its subordinate units, the 1034th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion out of Camp Dodge in Johnston, and the 1133rd Transportation Company out of Mason City.\n\nWorking with the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, the soldiers delivered around 32 pallets of personal protective equipment to 23 county distribution centers on Friday.\n\nSince beginning distribution missions Tuesday, Iowa National Guard soldiers have delivered 166 pallets to more than 75 counties, according to an Iowa National Guard news release.\n\nEight soldiers from the 186th Military Police Company out of Camp Dodge also set up two tents at the Central Iowa VA Healthcare System in Des Moines.

He said the lab estimates the ISU resources could expand its capacity by a third or more, although it's hard to assign a specific number to the fresh equipment.\n\n\"Thanks to the support of IDPH (the Iowa Department of Public Health), the governor, general assembly and, now, ISU — and with SHL (the State Hygienic Lab) working three shifts — the lab has been able to keep pace with demand and can grow its capacity as needed in the near term,\" Pradarelli said in an email.\n\nThe Coralville-based lab has been able to test for COVID-19 since late February. Pradarelli said the lab can do about 500 per day right now, but it's working on increasing that number to 750.\n\nIowa State’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory typically runs tests to detect infectious agents in livestock, poultry and pets. It runs more than 1.25 million tests each year, according to the news release.\n\nThe transferred equipment includes some of the lab’s high-throughput molecular diagnostic test methods, reagents, supplies and instrumentation.\n\n“To have the opportunity to help a human testing lab in this way has been very rewarding for us,” Dr. Karen Harmon, clinical associate professor in the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, said in the release.\n\nReynolds’ office, along with the Iowa Economic Development Authority, facilitated the partnership between the two laboratories.\n\nDNR closes bathrooms, limits camping\n\nMarch 28: Parks managed by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources are still open, however, all bathrooms are now closed through April 15. As a result, no soap or hand sanitizer will be available to visitors. The department advises visitors to bring their own hand sanitizer.\n\nShelters, camping cabins, youth camps and lodges are closed because of the lack of bathroom access.\n\nClosed bathrooms mean that camping is limited to self-contained campers with their own bathrooms.\n\nVisitors are advised not to use the playgrounds because park staff cannot clean them according to guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLast week, the DNR closed the Olofson shooting range near Big Creek State Park and the Banner shooting range near Summerset State Park through March 31.\n\nFor a full list of closures, visit the Iowa DNR closures page.\n\n'Hang in there': Gov. Reynolds tears up in plea that Iowans stay home\n\nMarch 27: As Iowans learned Friday that two more people in the state had died after contracting COVID-19, Gov. Kim Reynolds began to tear up at her daily news briefing.\n\nShe was talking about the hardships Iowans have faced because of business shutdowns and social distancing, and conflicting views over whether those restrictions should be tightened or were already an overreaction, when she paused, as if to let the gravity of the situation take hold.\n\n“You know, Iowans are scared and they’re nervous, and I appreciate that, but we’re going to get through it,” Reynolds said, her voice cracking. “If you keep doing what we’ve asked you to do, we will be back to those good days.

Those workers previously had no paid sick leave, human resources director Michelle Lindsay said.\n\nThe resolution also allows full-time employees to take more paid sick leave days than they have and \"go negative\" if needed, Lindsay said.

The food was leftover items that team had been planning to sell during its final home games.\n\nTeut said the Buccaneers were planning to use three of those games as food pantry donation nights where if fans brought three non-perishable items to the game, they could get a general admission ticket. The games didn’t happen so the team never got a chance to donate the non-perishable items. Instead, they found another way to make it up to them.\n\n“We still wanted to do something and with the arena being closed, I just didn’t have any source or means for having the food just sitting here,” Teut said.\n\nErnst: Now is not the time to be nickel and diming\n\nMarch 26: U.S. Sen.

We in Congress have a duty to act.”\n\nErnst called the package — which includes direct payments to most Americans as well as sweeping relief across numerous industries — “the largest package that has ever been passed in United States history.”\n\nShe said it’s important to be fiscally responsible, but relief to American workers and families is critical. If more is needed, Congress would consider passing additional rounds of emergency aid, she said.\n\n“What we have to understand, folks, is this is a pandemic,” she said. “So arguing, nickeling and diming at a time like this is unwarranted when we have a carefully crafted package that will provide relief to Iowans and to all Americans.”\n\nDes Moines Art Center launches virtual tours of galleries and exhibitions\n\nMarch 25: The Des Moines Art Center has officially launched seven virtual tours of their permanent collections and special exhibitions.

The news release did not specify their ages, genders or if they had traveled to high-risk countries, been in contact with other people identified as infected with coronavirus or if they were instances of community transmission, the term for when a case has no easily identifiable point of origin.\n\nAmy McCoy, a policy adviser for the IDPH, said at this point in the virus' spread, trying to pinpoint the source of the infection isn't as important as mitigating the spread. She emphasized the need for social distancing and other individual actions to prevent its spread.\n\n► MORE:Here's a map of the coronavirus cases in Iowa\n\nPhotos: Downtown Des Moinies' Court Avenue closed on St. Patrick's Day\n\nHy-Vee making changes to stem coronavirus' spread\n\nMarch 17:Hy-Vee is shortening its hours, closing the dine-in portion of its restaurants and suspending its weekly coupon ads.\n\nThe company announced Tuesday the grocer will only be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., saying it will use the extra to more thoroughly clean the store. In compliance with Gov. Kim Reynolds’ order earlier in the day, Hy-Vee will not allow diners to eat in the store. It is also closing the Market Grille bar.\n\nCustomers also will not be able to order food directly from Hy-Vee’s Aisle Online program. Any shoppers who want groceries delivered will need to order through apps like Shipt and Door Dash. In its news release, Hy-Vee said this will allow workers to focus on pick-up orders and the needs in the store.\n\nHy-Vee is suspending the weekly coupon ads in newspapers because it cannot guarantee local stores will have those items in stock. The company already printed some of those ads, which consumers may see this weekend. Hy-Vee says it will still honor those advertised sales.\n\n“This is an unprecedented situation for all of us,” Randy Edeker, Hy-Vee’s chairman, CEO and president, said in a statement. “We’ve never dealt with anything like this before, and we know our customers haven’t, either. We appreciate their patience and loyalty as we navigate these changing times.”\n\nCoronavirus patients discharged from hospitals\n\nMarch 17: At least two coronavirus patients have been released from Iowa hospitals.\n\nA coronavirus patient who had been hospitalized at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in recent days has been discharged. Molly Rossiter, a spokeswoman for the Iowa City hospital system, confirmed the information Tuesday.\n\nRossiter did not release any other information about the patient, including whether the patient has recovered.\n\nThe University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics announced Sunday that its latest patient was admitted. The hospital system is separately treating another patient who tested positive for coronavirus. That patient was admitted on March 11, according to the hospital.\n\nIn a news release, it said the individual was infected with the virus through community-acquired transmission, another term for “community spread” that is used to describe infections from an unknown source. At a news conference on Tuesday with Johnson County public health officials, Mercy Iowa City spokeswoman Margaret Reese said its hospital system has been treating two coronavirus patients. One has been discharged, according to Reese. She did not provide more information.\n\nMore:As UIHC treats second patient with COVID-19, staff ramp-up screening, start a hotline\n\n​​​​​​​DMARC hands out food to families\n\nDes Moines Area Religious Council gave bags of food to families in the Carver Elementary parking lot.

Hart, the chief medical officer and board president of the Physician’s Clinic of Iowa, said. “We don't know how bad this can get, and we just want to be prepared and to make sure we have enough supplies if things do get worse.”\n\nThe suspended surgeries include things like carpal tunnel and hip and knee replacement. Urgent procedures will still be done, Hart said. Even so, he expects this will affect hundreds of patients. The suspension is slated for at least a month, with officials revisiting the policy weekly.\n\nThe decision was jointly made by officials at UnityPoint Health – St. Luke’s Hospital, Physician’s Clinic of Iowa, Mercy Medical Center and the Surgery Center of Cedar Rapids. Mercy Medical Center is unaffiliated with MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center.\n\nMore:Des Moines hospital official warns: 'We do not have enough of supplies' to combat coronavirus\n\nDART waving bus fares\n\nMarch 17: Starting Tuesday, the Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority is waiving bus fares in an effort to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe metro’s public transportation provider won’t accept cash, bus passes or tickets, DART said in a news release on its website.\n\nBeginning Wednesday, bus riders will also be instructed to get on and off the bus via the rear doors, away from the driver.\n\nDART also encouraged riders to practice social distancing: staying 6 feet apart, remaining at home when sick and only taking the bus to go to work or other location that’s absolutely necessary.\n\nOn Sunday, the authority began cleaning its buses daily with an antiviral cleaning agent recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Staff have cleaned the buses at the end of the service day.\n\nCorteva says one employee in Johnston tested positive for coronavirus\n\nMarch 17: Corteva Agriscience said Tuesday an employee at its Johnston campus has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe seed company said it’s identifying and reaching out to people who “had close contact with the impacted employee, advising self-quarantine.\"\n\n\"We have informed the appropriate public health officials, the employee is quarantined, and we are working to support the employee and their family at this time,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"Within our offices, following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other local authorities, as well as our own policies, we have taken significant actions to contain any potential spread.\"\n\nCorteva, the new parent of Pioneer seed, said it's cleaning and disinfecting the site as needed as well. “The health and safety of our employees is our top priority,\" the company said.\n\nFareway stores restrict operating hours\n\nMarch 17: Fareway supermarkets announced that beginning Wednesday, they will limit their hours to 8 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday through Saturday because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIn a statement, Fareway communications manager Emily Toribio said the reduced hours will allow extra time for cleaning, sanitation and restocking.\n\nIn addition, she said the first hour of operation each day, 8 a.m.-9 a.m., will be reserved for customers 65 and over, expectant mothers, people with serious medical conditions and \"anyone with an underlying medical condition that increases the susceptibility to serious illness from COVID-19.\"\n\n​​​​​​​ National Guard deployments to go forward\n\nMarch 17: Deployments announced by the Iowa National Guard prior to the pandemic will move forward as scheduled, a spokesperson said Tuesday.\n\nAbout 680 Iowans from two units who received their deployment orders within the last six weeks will leave in May and June, Col. Michael Wunn said.\n\nIn late May, the 133 Infantry Battalion out of eastern Iowa — also known as the Ironman Battalion — will deploy about 550 soldiers to Operation Spartan Shield in U.S. Central Command, located in the Middle East, Wunn said.\n\nComing from armories in seven communities — Charles City, Davenport, Dubuque, Iowa City, Iowa Falls, Oelwein and Waterloo — this deployment is expected to last a year. Their mission will still involve security and “force protection operations,” as a news release previously announced.\n\nIn June, two troops from the 113th Cavalry Regiment will deploy about 130 soldiers to Operation Enduring Freedom in U.S. Africa Command.\n\nAlso lasting a year, this deployment will include 90 soldiers from Le Mars, Iowa, and 40 from Johnson. These troops will help with “military operations, exercises and security cooperation activities on the African continent, its island nations and surrounding waters,” as a news release previously announced.\n\nFull-time staff members of the Iowa National Guard are following travel restrictions announced Monday by the Department of Defense, which limits military and personal travel to just “mission essential” or personal hardship trips, including funerals and family emergencies. Traditional guardsmen are not subject to the personal travel restrictions, but the Guard has significantly restricted training, conferences and any events that can be delayed or postponed.\n\n“This is a very fluid situation,” Wunn said, adding that they are making decisions every day based on recommendations from the Iowa Department of Public Health, the CDC and the Department of Defense.\n\n“We will protect the health of the force and make sure they are being taken care of while doing what we can to stop the spread,” Wunn said. “And we will balance that with our focus on mission readiness in case we need to support the Governor as well as the strict timeline our forces are on to prepare for deployment.”\n\nThe Iowa Gold Star Military Museum and the Wellness Center at Camp Dodge will be closed to the public by the end of the day Tuesday, though Camp Dodge will remain open, Wunn said.\n\nThe Guard is currently looking at events scheduled to take place at armories across the state and accessing next steps with organizers.\n\nReynolds prohibits gatherings of more than 10 people, closes theaters, casinos, restaurants, bars\n\nMarch 17: Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is closing restaurants, bars and other recreational facilities in Iowa for two weeks in an effort to restrict the spread of coronavirus.\n\nReynolds made the announcement in a news release Tuesday. The order goes into effect at noon and continues until March 31.\n\nThe news release says the governor has issued a State of Public Health Disaster Emergency, a proclamation designation that allows her to take these actions.\n\nRestaurants will be able to provide food through drive-through, carry-out and delivery only. Bars and other facilities like gyms, theaters and casinos will close.\n\nIowa lawmakers grant Gov. Kim Reynolds expanded power\n\nMarch 17: The Iowa Legislature has suspended its session for 30 days after passing legislation early Tuesday morning to keep the government running and grant Gov. Kim Reynolds expanded powers to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe bill, unanimously passed by lawmakers just after midnight, grants Reynolds, a Republican, increased ability to transfer spending between state agencies and departments, giving her flexibility to allocate funds where needed. It also allows her to tap 10% of the state's $200 million Economic Emergency Fund to deal with the coronavirus.\n\nThe bill also waives schools' requirement to make up class days canceled as a result of the virus and passes a supplemental appropriation for some state programs, including $525,000 for processing COVID-19 test kits at the State Hygienic Lab at the University of Iowa.\n\nMore:Iowa lawmakers grant Gov.

The notice did not specify the person’s condition.\n\nThe district also announced that all of its schools would be closed beginning March 16 for four weeks, adhering to the recommendation from Gov. Kim Reynolds. The closure includes cancellation of all school-related programming, activities, athletics, Adventuretime and community education classes. Under current plans, students would return to school on Monday, April 13.\n\nThere have been 23 known cases of coronavirus in Iowa. Some of the cases involve people who do not know how they contracted the virus, and some of those infected have had to be hospitalized. COVID-19 is the respiratory illness caused by the virus. It is unclear if this employee is part of that 23 or if the person is an additional case.\n\nMore:Urbandale district employee tests positive for coronavirus\n\nDes Moines-area YMCAs completely shut down for 15 days\n\nMarch 16: The six membership branches and the Y-Camp serving the greater Des Moines area will shut down for 15 days, officials announced Monday night.\n\nNo coronavirus cases have been linked to a YMCA facility, but its leadership is following federal, state and local health officials' guidance to try to slow its spread, Ruth Comer, the YMCA's vice president for marketing and communications wrote in an email.\n\nIt had previously canceled all group fitness classes, personal training sessions, youth programming and facility rentals and suspended Learn and Play centers and guest passes.\n\nFull-time staff will remain employed during the closure. President and CEO of YMCA of Greater Des Moines Leisha Barcus asked members to pay dues and register for future programs as they're able to help it operate once the crisis passes.\n\nDes Moines Water Works suspends water shutoffs\n\nMarch 16: Des Moines Water Works, which provides drinking water to most of the Des Moines metro area, announced Monday that it would stop shutting off the water service of delinquent ratepayers.\n\nWater needs to be available to help residents sanitize, which will hopefully slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, the utility said in a news release. The suspension is temporary.\n\nDes Moines Water Works’ water remains safe to drink, the release said. COVID-19 hasn’t been detected in drinking water, and water works’ treatment practices kill viruses. There’s also no need to boil tap water.\n\nThe U.S Environmental Protection Agency said, “Americans can continue to use and drink water from their tap as usual.”\n\nStarting Tuesday, water works will also prohibit walk-in customers at its general office building on George Flagg Parkway. In-home visits, except for emergencies, will also be suspended.\n\nWater customers can pay online at dmww.com, by phone at (515) 283-8700, at the office’s dropbox, by mail or at pay stations at local Hy-Vee or Wal-Mart stores.\n\nThe utility has also started “stockpiling” chemicals, repair parts and other equipment to ensure the production and distribution of safe drinking water, the news release said.\n\nIowa DOT may make customers wait in cars, encourages appointments\n\nMarch 16: The Iowa Department of Transportation is encouraging people to postpone in-person services and, if unavoidable, for customers to make an appointment before visiting.\n\nMany services, including renewals, address changes and certified copies of driving records, are likely available online. To view those services, or make an appointment, visit https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/. Customers can also call 515-244-8725.\n\nOfficials hope appointments will reduce the number of people waiting at the service centers. Staff will watch the size of groups in the waiting areas and may ask people to come back another time or wait in their vehicles if the room becomes crowded, according to a news release.\n\nStaff will also ask customers questions designed to evaluate their risk of exposure to the coronavirus and risk of exposure to other customers. If someone is determined to be a “heightened risk,” they will be asked to delay their visit. The news release did not specify what criteria will be used to make that judgment.\n\nDOT staff are also instructed to increase how often they clean and disinfect the facilities.\n\nYour subscription makes work like this possible.

Kim Reynolds closes bars ...", "text": "To combat spiking coronavirus cases, Gov. Kim Reynolds on Thursday ordered the shutdown of all bars, breweries and nightclubs in six of Iowa's most populous counties.\n\nThe closure order, affecting Polk, Linn, Johnson, Story, Dallas and Black Hawk counties, also bans restaurants from selling alcohol after 10 p.m.\n\nThe order is in effect until Sept. 20.\n\nReynolds cited high positive test rates among adults age 19 to 24. Statewide, that age group has accounted for 23% of all new positive coronavirus tests over the past two weeks.\n\nIn Johnson County, home of the University of Iowa, that age band accounted for 69% of the positive coronavirus tests over the past week. In Story County, home of Iowa State University, they made up 74% in the same period.\n\n“While we still know that this population is less likely to be severely impacted by COVID-19, it is increasing the virus activity in the community, and it’s spilling over to other segments of the population,” Reynolds said.\n\nWhile some local officials applauded the more stringent health precautions in areas with high spread, others said Reynolds has been too slow to act.\n\n\"It's better than nothing,\" Johnson County supervisor Rod Sullivan said Thursday. \"But it's too little, too late.\"\n\nReynolds ordered bars, along with many other businesses, to close this spring to slow the coronavirus. She allowed them to reopen with restrictions in late May and lifted capacity limits in June.\n\nMore:Full text of Gov. Kim Reynolds' order closing bars in 6 Iowa counties\n\nMore:What does a second shutdown mean for Iowa bars?\n\nIowa reported a spike in coronavirus cases Thursday morning, with more than 1,400 new positive tests reported over the preceding 24 hours. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 59,000 Iowans have tested positive for the virus and more than 1,000 have died.\n\nThe coronavirus causes COVID-19, a highly contagious and potentially fatal respiratory disease. People with underlying health conditions are particularly susceptible to serious illness if they contract it.\n\nReynolds said Thursday morning she’s concerned the spread of the virus will start to affect the workforce, particularly the health care and education sectors. She also noted that flu season will soon begin.\n\n“I don't make these decisions lightly, and it's not lost on me that every business forced to close all through their hours and sales, even temporarily, plays a role in the lives of Iowa workers and our small businesses,” Reynolds said. “But these actions are absolutely necessary.”\n\nReynolds called on police to enforce the new requirements and asked for people who gather with 10 or more to practice social distancing. She did not rule out further restrictions to stem the spread of the virus.\n\n“It is my hope that we’ll be able to dial back these restrictions in the near future,” Reynolds said. “But if they simply move large-scale parties and other high-risk activity elsewhere, then we’re going to be prepared to do more.”\n\nUniversities, schools battling rising cases\n\nReynolds' proclamation comes as Iowa's public universities battle coronavirus cases as the fall semester draws students back to campus.\n\nLast week, at least 107 students and four employees at the University of Iowa had tested positive, and 19 students were quarantining in residence halls.\n\nAfter images circulated on social media of people packed into Iowa City’s downtown bars last weekend, University of Iowa President Bruce Harreld on Monday told students they need to take responsibility to limit the spread of the coronavirus. He issued a statement Thursday applauding Reynolds' move.\n\n\"Without those actions I was very concerned about the rise in cases and the upcoming weekend,\" he said in his statement.\n\nAt Iowa State University, officials on Monday reported that 130 students, staff and faculty members had tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nMany of Iowa's K-12 schools welcomed students this week, under a Reynolds proclamation mandating 50% in-person instruction. The Iowa Department of Education has said it will not publicly report COVID-19 outbreaks at schools as it does for nursing homes, but some of those schools are already reporting coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nAfter cases spiked in Johnson County, the Iowa Department of Education granted the Iowa City Community School District permission to begin the school year online. The approval comes days after the district joined the Iowa State Education Association in a lawsuit challenging Reynolds’ 50% in-person mandate.\n\nClear Creek Amana High School, which sits in Johnson and Iowa counties, also announced it would move to a virtual format on Thursday after a positive COVID-19 case was reported to the school Wednesday night.\n\nOfficials from Des Moines Public Schools similarly requested state permission to jettison in-person classes. State officials denied that request. Des Moines officials are also suing the state over the in-person mandate, which can be lifted by waiver only under certain absenteeism and county positivity metrics.\n\nAnd in suburban Polk County, Ankeny school officials announced Wednesday that seven students and one staff member had tested positive for the virus and that a number of others were proactively quarantining. School started for Ankeny students on Thursday.\n\nMore:Schools are reopening in the Des Moines metro: Here's what local districts have planned this fall\n\nBar owner: 'She just killed my whole business'\n\nSome bar, brewery and nightclub owners said the Thursday announcement came without warning and will further cripple an industry already suffering from the extended closures in the spring.\n\n“She’s killing me. She just killed my whole business,\" said Larry Mason, the owner of Club 525 in Des Moines' East Village. He said he had been taking plenty of precautions and business had been going strong.\n\nScott Selix, owner of Lua Brewing in Des Moines and president of the Iowa Brewers’ Guild, said the order would bring more pressure.\n\n“We see retail stores, their numbers are up hundreds of percentage points because people are just buying their beer at the store, and so we were already hurting,\" Selix said. \"And we’re not throwing the blame at them, we were just already hurting. And now it’s worse. The hard truth is that breweries will end up closing. And we just try to minimize the damage.”\n\nJessica Dunker, president of the Iowa Restaurant Association, said many places will have a hard time recovering.\n\n“Unless we get just flat-out grant money, where people are just given money so that they can come back after this, it is over,\" she said. \" ... Quite honestly, if we can find $100 million dollars for agriculture, for an agriculture-specific fund that includes everything down to vegetable producers, we better be able to find some CARES Act money for the hospitality industry specifically.”\n\nMore coverage:\n\nAmes Tribune reporter Robbie Sequeira, Iowa City Press-Citizen Reporters Hillary Ojeda and Isaac Hamlet, and Des Moines Register reporters Katie Akin and Sierra Porter contributed to this report.\n\nIan Richardson covers the Iowa Statehouse for the Des Moines Register.

Here's the list", "text": "As state governments continue to unveil a patchwork of plans to gradually reopen the American economy, the question that looms in the coming weeks is whether increased resident mobility leads to a surge in new coronavirus cases.\n\nAnd that question will likely be answered soon. The majority of states are moving forward with phased-in approaches that often vary by county and city.\n\nTexas could be a telling case. The state became one of the first to take aggressive measures, allowing restaurants and retailers to reopen to limited customer capacity May 1. Last week, on May 14, Texas reported its highest single-day increase of new cases, with 1,448, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.\n\nBy Saturday, that mark swelled to 1,801. Just in Amarillo, a city in North Texas whose population is a shade under 200,000, there were more than 700 new cases Saturday.\n\nThat prompted Gov. Greg Abbott to release a statement that said as Texas \"continues ramping up its testing capabilities, there will be an increase in positive cases as the state targets the most high-risk areas.\"\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has pivoted to a three-phase plan that leaves the decision to reopen the economy to states, creating an uneven strategy that some health experts warn could undermine the progress that has been made in stemming the spread of coronavirus.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned May 12 in a Senate committee hearing that reopening the country amid the coronavirus may lead to \"some suffering and death.\"\n\nGet daily coronavirus updates in your inbox:Sign up for our newsletter now\n\nU.S. coronavirus map:Track how the outbreak has spread in your state\n\nThis week, almost half of the 50 states are lightening restrictions in some form. We will keep this file updated as measures are announced:\n\nAlabama\n\nOn May 23, large entertainment venues, athletic activities, and school and child-care facilities will be allowed to reopen with physical distancing guidelines and capacity limits, the Washington Post said. Entertainment venues include bowling alleys, arcades, casino, theaters and concert venues.\n\nGov. Kay Ivey loosened coronavirus restrictions effective May 11, allowing limited operations of restaurants, hair and nail salons, and gyms.\n\nRestaurants, bars and breweries may open with limited table seating. Restaurants must limit tables to eight people and maintain six-foot distances between dining groups. The establishments are urged to offer curbside service.\n\nGyms, athletic facilities and hair and nail salon providers also opened \"subject to social-distancing and sanitation rules and guidelines.\" Gyms are forbidden from offering sports that require close contact with others or sharing sporting apparatus and equipment. They must also limit capacity to 50%.\n\nThe order also removed a 10-person restriction on nonwork gatherings. That will allow churches to resume regular services.\n\nPreviously, Ivey loosened some restrictions on retail operations, and said the state would monitor the situation to decide what further steps could be taken.\n\nAlaska\n\nLife went back to the way it was \"prior to the virus\" on May 22, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced.\n\nAll businesses – including restaurants, bars, retail stores and gyms – will be allowed to open without any capacity restrictions and without needing to provide hand sanitizer or enforcing social distancing guidelines.\n\nPreviously, Dunleavy and state officials had issued a number of health orders as a part of the phased Reopen Alaska Responsibly Plan. The final two phases were carried out simultaneously on May 22.\n\nOn April 24, Alaska began allowing restaurants to resume dine-in service and for retail shops and other businesses to reopen, all with limitations, under an initial phase of the state's reopening plan.\n\nPersonal care services, like barbershops and nail and hair salons, were allowed to reopen April 27.\n\nGatherings have been limited to 20 people, or 25% maximum capacity, whichever number is smaller and can now include guests from other households. Social distancing, however, must be obeyed.\n\nReligious services must also follow the gathering guidelines.\n\nArizona\n\nGyms, spas and community swimming pools were allowed to open May 13, and professional sports leagues were allowed to begin practicing in Arizona after the state's current stay-at-home order expired May 15, Gov. Doug Ducey said.\n\nMovie theaters also opened May 16.\n\nThose activities can resume as long as appropriate health precautions are in place, Ducey said.\n\nAdditionally, The Grand Canyon National Park opened its South Rim entrance on May 15, with some restrictions. It opened despite objections from Navajo officials and others that it could hurt efforts to control the coronavirus.\n\nBarbershops and salons were able to resume hair, nail, waxing and other services by appointment May 8, if they limit occupancy, implement social distancing measures, up sanitation protocols and provide cloth masks to employees, the governor said.\n\nOn May 11, restaurants and coffee shops started offering dine-in service. To do so, they are required to limit occupancy and physically distance diners, in addition to checking employees for COVID-19 symptoms before their shifts.\n\nArkansas\n\nPools and water parks can reopen on May 22 with new capacity limits and other restrictions, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said May 8.\n\nArkansas restaurants were also able to reopen their dining rooms on May 11 with restrictions.\n\nDental services resumed May 11. State Health Secretary Dr. Nate Smith said the original plan was to resume dental services on May 18, but the dental lobby persuaded the state that protective gear supplies were sufficient and that protective protocols were planned by most dentists.\n\nThe state's three casinos reopened on May 18.\n\nLarge outdoor venues may reopen to the public with a limit on the size of crowds, Hutchinson said May 4. On May 18, Arkansas reopened large indoor venues such as movie theaters, museums, and bowling alleys.\n\nHutchinson also reiterated the state's COVID-19 guidelines for places of worship and gave his blessing on churches resuming in-person services.\n\nArkansas' barbershops and beauty salons, which have been closed since March 25, reopened May 6.\n\nGyms, fitness centers and indoor athletic facilities reopened on May 4 with restrictions including guidance on face masks, hand sanitizer and social distancing.\n\nFacilities will not be allowed to admit anyone displaying possible COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. Those with compromised immune systems or chronic diseases will also be barred from entry. Pools, spas, showers and saunas at gyms and similar facilities will remain closed until further notice.\n\nHutchinson had announced April 22 that the state would begin lifting restrictions on elective medical procedures; that went into effect April 27.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOn May 18, Gov. Gavin Newsom said sports would be permitted to return to his state the first week of June, with certain restrictions and without spectators.\n\nThe California State University system that comprises 23 campuses such as Fresno State, San Diego State and San Jose State announced May 12 that it would cancel in-person classes for the fall semester. Online instruction will still be offered, with a few exceptions for courses.\n\nNewsom said more businesses could reopen statewide and approved requests from counties to move ahead more quickly if they have been minimally harmed by the pandemic. Los Angeles County, the most populated in the state, has targeted July 4 for a fuller reopening.\n\nOn May 20, Ventura County, which has been under stay-at-home orders since mid-March, became the first county in Southern California to be approved for accelerated reopening.\n\nLos Angeles County reopened its beaches May 13 for “active recreation,” and similar moves were announced for several beaches along Ventura County's south coast.\n\nNewsom has repeatedly said counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders. In mid-May, Tesla's car plant reopened, defying orders from the Alameda County Public Health Department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions.\n\nColorado\n\nCamping in state parks resume by reservation only on May 12, Gov. Jared Polis said. Counties can decide independently if they do not want to reopen camping in state parks within their boundaries.\n\nPolis said officials expect to have more data about how the coronavirus is being transmitted on May 25, giving them \"more data to make the call\" on next steps for restaurants, summer camps and spring skiing.\n\nOffices deemed nonessential were allowed to reopen May 4 with reduced staff. Current restrictions allow curbside retail and real estate showings. Getting a haircut and shopping in person at retail stores were allowed again in much of Colorado starting May 1 as the state eased restrictions.\n\nDenver lifted its stay-home restrictions on the weekend of May 9, and Polis said state officials would be paying close attention to potential health impacts.\n\nOne week before the state's stay-at-home order lifted April 27, Polis announced the next phase, called \"safer at home\": The goal is for Coloradans to maintain 60% to 65% social distancing, and vulnerable residents should continue to shelter in place.\n\nSchools will remain closed, and bars and restaurants will not immediately reopen.\n\nColorado hospitals, dental offices, optometrists and other health care providers could start seeing patients for elective procedures again by early May.\n\nConnecticut\n\nThe Constitution State took its first steps toward a return to normalcy on May 20, as offices, retail stores, malls, restaurants (for outdoor dining), outdoor museums and zoos are now open.\n\nBut, Gov. Ned Lamont pushed back the reopening of barbershops and nail salons, originally set for the same day, until June 1.\n\nBeth Bye, the commissioner of the state Office of Early Childhood, said May 11 that summer camps could open on June 29 with strict public health guidelines in place. The governor’s office later clarified that would not include overnight camps.\n\nOn May 5, Lamont canceled in-person classes at all Connecticut K-12 public schools for the rest of this school year, requiring districts to continue distance learning.\n\nDelaware\n\nGov. John Carney announced that all retail establishments in Delaware may operate by appointment only beginning May 20.\n\nGov. Carney earlier had announced that arts facilities, retail stores, malls, barbershops and hair salons, exercise facilities, tanning salons, casinos and racetracks and food/drink establishments can reopen with strict requirements on June 1.\n\nAt restaurants, breweries and bars that offer table service, guests must be given single-use, paper disposable menus. All condiments also have to be in single-use disposable containers unless the reusable containers are thoroughly cleaned between each patron's use.\n\nCarney said there would be “interim steps” to reopen the economy between May 8 and June 1.\n\nIn mid-May, Rehoboth Beach joined a handful of coastal towns that are slowly loosening their grip on beach access.\n\nCarney announced plans May 5 to allow some businesses to operate again under social distancing rules to limit the spread of coronavirus.\n\nMany businesses could resume \"limited operations\" starting May 8, according to the announcement from the governor's office.\n\nRetail stores, such as clothing, book or music stores, will be able to do curbside pickup.

The state won’t preempt those rules, he added.\n\n“I hope that this will be good for folks over the summer,\" he said. \"I really trust parents. I trust the physicians who work with the kids, the local leaders, coaches, camps.\"\n\nGov. DeSantis said May 15 that people who are healthier are less likely to die from the coronavirus, which is part of his rationale to include gyms as the state expands the first phase of its reopening.\n\nBeginning May 18, the state also increased restrictions on restaurant and retail store capacity from 25% to 50%, as well as allowing the reopening of museums, libraries and gyms at 50% capacity. Bars and movie theaters will remain closed.\n\nOn May 20, the state's biggest tourist destination – Walt Disney World – began its reopening by opening its shopping and entertainment complex (but not the park itself.)\n\nOn May 14, DeSantis signed an executive order to move Miami-Dade County and Broward County – both of which are the hardest hit in the state – into Phase One of his reopening plan.\n\nBeaches in the two counties will remain closed. Miami, Miami Beach and Hialeah – Miami-Dade’s bigger cities – will allow retailers to reopen May 20 and restaurants to open, likely, the following week.\n\nThe counties account for almost half of the state's confirmed virus cases.\n\nBoth Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez and Broward County Mayor Dale Holness said that when beaches do open in their counties, they will be at the same time to avoid people flocking to one location. Beaches will not open until at least May 26, Holness said.\n\nDeSantis allowed hair stylists, barbers and nail technicians to reopen, he announced May 8. In mid-May, DeSantis signaled the state's openness to pro sports returning..\n\nGeorgia\n\nGov. Brian Kemp on May 12 announced plans to relax some restaurant restrictions and allow some summer camps to open but extend bar and nightclub closures through May.\n\nKemp allowed businesses such as tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and hair and nail salons to reopen with restrictions in late April, a sweeping move that prompted national criticism. Restaurants and movie theaters have since been able to welcome customers back in on a limited basis, and a statewide shelter-at-home order has expired.\n\nSome malls reopened May 4, though things were far from normal with many businesses inside still shuttered and parking lots sparsely filled.\n\nKemp allowed his statewide shelter-in-place order to expire at midnight April 30 but extended his emergency powers to June 12 and told the elderly and medically fragile to stay at home until then.\n\nIn-person religious services resumed over the April 25-26 weekend, and restaurants and theaters reopened on April 27 with \"specific social distancing and sanitation mandates.\"\n\nHawaii\n\nGov. David Ige has relaxed some restrictions, including allowing shopping malls to reopen. In Maui, they did so May 11; in Oahu they reopened May 15.\n\nBeaches on Oahu opened on May 16.\n\nIge in early May issued an updated proclamation allowing certain establishments to reopen, including astronomical observatories.

Brad Little allowed his five-week stay-at-home order to expire April 30. Idaho residents have been successful at reducing infections and deaths, Little said.\n\nOn May 14, Little gave the go-ahead to begin stage two of reopening Idaho as scheduled on May 16. That meant that dine-in restaurants, nail and hair salons, and gyms began reopening on May 16.\n\nOn May 1, the state entered the first of his four-stage plan to recover from the economic damage caused by the virus. Little said the process will take time, and advancing through the stages to return the state to near normalcy by the end of June will be based on declining infections and strong testing. The readiness of the health care system is another factor.\n\nChild-care centers were able to reopen May 1. Churches also reopened with distancing and sanitation rules. Bars, gyms, salons, movie theaters and sporting venues remain closed. Restaurants can offer curbside and delivery service.\n\nIllinois\n\nGov. J.B.

The plan says reopening contingent on meeting certain metrics, with the last phase allowed only if there's a vaccine or an effective treatment.\n\nOn May 8, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot released the city's five-step path toward re-opening, which includes some stricter standards than the state plan.\n\nThe next phase of the state plan will see manufacturing, offices, retail, barbershops and salons reopen with capacity limits and social distancing requirements. Health clubs, gyms and fitness studios will be allowed to provide one-on-one personal training in indoor facilities and outdoor fitness classes. Gatherings of 10 or fewer will be allowed, including groups boating and camping, and face coverings and social distancing will also remain standard.\n\nPritzker announced Wednesday that the state was on track to enter the next phase on May 29. Restaurants and bars would also be allowed to reopen for outdoor service starting in the third phase, earlier than expected,Pritzker said.\n\nIndiana\n\nOn May 24, a major reopening of Indiana will occur, with gyms, fitness centers, playgrounds, pools, campgrounds, and movie theatres scheduled to open, all with restrictions. Also, retail stores and malls may move to 75% of capacity while maintaining social distancing, WHTI-TV reports.\n\nAs of May 4, Gov.

Gatherings of up to 25 people are allowed in all but the three hardest-hit counties; malls and other nonessential retailers can open at 50% capacity and churches can begin holding services with no limits on the number of attendees\n\nThe reopening plan calls for the removal of additional restrictions in phases through July 4. Beginning May 11, for example, restaurants opened at half capacity in all counties but Marion, Lake and Cass, which have been hotspots for the virus. Lake County restaurants opened at half capacity on May 18.\n\nSome cities and counties have set their own restrictions.

Those establishments will continue to be subject to some capacity restrictions and extra health measures.\n\nReynolds said May 6 she will allow dental services to resume and campgrounds, drive-in theaters, tanning facilities and other businesses to reopen statewide beginning May 8 if they meet certain requirements.\n\nReynolds is allowing retail stores in malls to reopen, but the shopping centers must keep common spaces such as play areas and food courts closed. She's also allowing fitness centers to reopen by appointment only, limiting to one person inside at a time.\n\nDentists may resume providing services if they comply with guidelines for safely reopening adopted by the Iowa Dental Board, have adequate personal protective equipment, demonstrate a plan to preserve such equipment and have a supply chain to obtain more equipment if needed.\n\nKansas\n\nGov. Laura Kelly’s stay-at-home order expired May 3 as she moved the state into the first part of a multi-phase plan to reopen Kansas between now and at least June 15.

On that date, restaurants, personal care businesses and pools reopened, the New York Times said.\n\nIf data trends look promising, the state would move into Phase 2, which includes the lifting of the stay-at-home order and a limited reopening of other businesses and churches with reduced capacity.\n\nUnder Phase 1, people will be allowed to leave their homes for commercial activity and to go to any business that is open – though the governor hasn’t elaborated about which businesses that includes when pressed by journalists in statewide briefings.\n\nThe order removes the distinction between essential and nonessential businesses. Retail businesses are allowed to open at 50% capacity and will be required to see that customers are at least 6 feet apart, the release says. Businesses also will be required to screen workers for COVID-19 symptoms, perform frequent cleanings and provide hand sanitizer when available.\n\nBut many businesses will remain closed.

On that day, 31 of the state's 36 counties began to ease stay-home restrictions and enter into Phase 1 of the governor's reopening plan, according to KGW-TV.\n\nOregon reopened a small number of outdoor destinations on May 6, beginning a gradual effort to relax limits imposed on recreation. Eight state parks and boat ramps reopened at that time, with more places to come the following week, officials said.\n\nSki resorts will also be able to resume activities under a forthcoming executive order from Brown.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGov. Tom Wolf said May 8 that 13 more counties will move to the yellow phase of reopening the following week. Also on May 8: Two dozen previously announced counties located in rural northern Pennsylvania made that transition.\n\nThe 13 new counties are in the western part of the state, including much of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.\n\nStay-at-home orders will be lifted in \"yellow\" counties and retail shops can start to reopen, though other restrictions will remain in place as counties move from \"red\" to \"yellow\" in a three-phase reopening plan.\n\nWolf also allowed golfers to hit the course and boaters to hit the water starting May 1.\n\nGolf courses, marinas, guided fishing trips and privately owned campgrounds will be able to open, but campgrounds in state parks remained closed through May 14. Social distancing and masking guidelines will be required just as for other essential businesses.\n\nWolf also announced that he reopened construction in the state beginning on May 1, moved up from May 8.\n\nAfter state liquor stores were closed in March, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is now allowing select stores to offer curbside delivery.\n\nPreviously, Wolf signed a bill to allow online notary services so online auto sales can resume.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nOn May 11, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced allowed construction and manufacturing to resume, provided that strict measures are followed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAmong the sectors included are private construction and maintenance and repair work done to bolster the infrastructure in anticipation of hurricane season.\n\nThat follows comments made by Manuel Laboy, the secretary of the Department of Economic Development and Commerce, that other businesses like barber shops and hair salons would be able to open May 25 as long as confirmed new cases continue to decline.\n\nA medical task force appointed by Vázquez Garced submitted recommendations on April 25, suggesting that Puerto Rico abide by strict social distancing and hygienic measures for 18 to 24 months, absent of a vaccine or proven treatment for the virus.\n\nThe task force recommends a gradual reopening in four stages, broken down by the infection rate per industry. In the first tier are construction, mining, computing, agriculture and manufacturing. Rather than provide specific target dates for the stages, it recommended enacting each by monitoring the rate of transmission on the island.\n\nOn May 1, Vázquez Garced extended a lockdown order through May 25. It allows residents to leave their homes only from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. for essential activities. After 7 p.m., a daily curfew goes into effect until the following morning. The latest extension allows residents to walk, jog, run, ride bicycles and exercise, while observing social distancing measures from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nRhode Island\n\nGov. Gina Raimondo lifted a statewide stay-at-home order effective May 9.\n\nRetail shops deemed nonessential and some parks can reopen. The state's limit of five people or less for social gatherings remains in effect, however.\n\nRaimondo announced May 12 that the state will allow restaurants to offer limited outdoor dining starting May 18 under regulations from the governor’s office.\n\nRaimondo on April 22 announced plans to roll out a staged reopening of parks and beaches in the coming weeks, citing encouraging virus statistics.\n\n“It is my hope that we will be able to enjoy our parks and beaches in some form or fashion in the month of May,” she said.\n\nThe next phase of reopening, however, will wait until June, the governor said Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nOn May 11, Gov. Henry McMaster allowed dining inside South Carolina restaurants to resume.\n\nAnd close-contact businesses including gyms, barber shops, hair salons and pools reopened on May 18.\n\nRestaurants are limited to 50% capacity. State officials also issued a host of guidelines detailing how tables and equipment must be sanitized.\n\nMcMaster also removed all remaining coronavirus-related restrictions on South Carolina boaters, including a prohibition against anchoring in waterways except for fishing.\n\nThe announcement came four days after outdoor dining was allowed to resume at restaurants in the state. A mandatory stay-home order also was lifted Monday in South Carolina.\n\nMcMaster announced a plan April 21 called \"Accelerate South Carolina\" to \"stomp on the gas\" and reopen certain sectors of the economy.\n\nClothing, department, furniture, jewelry and sporting goods stores, as well as florists and flea markets can reopen but will be forced to operate at reduced capacity. The closure on beaches will be lifted, though it will be up to local officials to decide on the reopening of specific beaches.\n\nThe order still encourages social distancing directives to be followed. Barber shops, beauty salons, bingo halls, gyms and nightclubs must remain closed for now.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nGov. Kristi Noem unveiled in late April a \"Back to Normal Plan\" for businesses and residents for the next phase of the coronavirus response.\n\nThe plan lays out actions for residents, employers, schools and health care providers once four criteria categories are met, including a downward trajectory of documented coronavirus cases for 14 days in an area with sustained community spread.\n\nNoem had not issued a stay-at-home order but had placed some statewide restrictions.\n\nTennessee\n\nGuidance issued by Gov. Bill Lee's office May 1 says house of worship should exercise caution, encouraging their community members to wear face coverings and remain six feet away from others. The guidance urges faith communities to \"conduct as many activities as possible remotely.\"\n\nThe state reopened salons and barbershops May 6, the latest in a string of restrictions to be loosened in the state.\n\nDetails of business restrictions in the order, which also continued the state of emergency, apply to all but six counties in the state. Those counties, which are home to the state's larger urban areas, are following the guidance of their respective health departments which are operated locally.\n\nElvis Presley's Graceland in Memphis will reopen the week of May 18 after closing March 20. Tour capacity will be reduced to 25% and temperature checks will be given to guests.\n\nNashville city officials transitioned to the first phase of reopening the city on May 11, allowing restaurants and retail stores to open at half capacity, despite a recent increase in new coronavirus cases.\n\nPreviously, Lee allowed for restaurants to reopen on April 27, many retailers on April 29 and gyms on May 1, each of which came with rules on limited capacity and suggested guidelines.\n\nUnder Tennessee’s plan, businesses in six counties – Davidson, Shelby, Knox, Hamilton, Madison and Sullivan – will not open until local officials sign off on their own reopening proposals.\n\nOn April 28, Lee issued an executive order extending the closure of bars and close-contact businesses through the end of May.\n\nTexas\n\nGov. Greg Abbott on Monday announced his next wave of reopenings designed to restart the Texas economy during the coronavirus pandemic, saying child care facilities can reopen immediately, bars can open May 22 with limited capacity and sporting events can return without fans at the end of the month, the Texas Tribune said. Abbott also said he would permit restaurants to operate at 50% capacity starting May 22, up from 25% that’s allowed now.\n\nHair and nail salons reopened May 8 with restrictions on capacity and distances and gyms got back to business on May 18, Gov. Abbott said.\n\nBars, meanwhile, will remain shuttered pending more information on the best ways to keep staff and customers safe amid the fast-spreading pandemic, Abbott said.\n\nEvery restaurant and retailer across the state was allowed to open doors to customers May 1, although more widely in some cities than others and still under social distancing requirements.\n\nOutdoor sports such as golf and tennis can resume, as long as four people or fewer are participating in the event and social distancing is followed.\n\nAbbott announced executive orders April 17 that mandated all schools, public and private, to remain closed for the rest of the school year.\n\nAbbott, seeking to end a political firestorm, announced May 7 that officials will be prohibited from jailing Texans for violating any of his coronavirus-related executive orders.\n\nUtah\n\nGov. Gary Herbert said most of the state moved to \"yellow,\" or low-risk, May 16.\n\nA yellow designation means there can be social gatherings of up to 50 people, team sports are allowed and swimming pools are opened. Additionally, travel is opened up throughout the state — though Washington County has seen significant visitor numbers in recent weeks at the state parks.\n\nUtah moved May 1 from the \"red\" to \"orange\" phase of Herbert's proposal to gradually scale back restrictions.\n\nEvery household also has a chance to order face masks from the government. The program, which he dubbed \"A Mask for every Utahn,\" was unveiled as Herbert announced an official step back from the state's most stringent stay-at-home orders.\n\nVermont\n\nGov. Phil Scott made moves to relax numerous restrictions in early May.\n\nVermont's retail stores began to reopen on May 18. The stores will have to abide by certain conditions to reopen, including requiring all employees to wear masks and limiting the number of people in the store at a time. Big box stores will also be allowed to begin selling non-essential items again.\n\nChild care programs and summer camps will be allowed to open this summer — as long as they follow strict health guidelines, Scott said May 8. Regulated day care facilities that adopt those guidelines would be able to open June 1.\n\nGatherings of 10 people or fewer were allowed with precautions and golf courses and some other forms of outdoor recreation reopened May 7, Scott announced May 6.\n\nSome elective health care procedures will be able to resume as the spread of the new coronavirus in the state continues to slow, Scott announced May 4.\n\nScott on May 1 also announced additional steps to ease restrictions under the state's \"Stay Home, Stay Safe\" order.\n\nManufacturing, construction and distribution companies reopened May 4, with a maximum of 10 employees. The following week, on May 11, those same sectors re-opened at full operations with as few employees as necessary.\n\nIn order to return to work, Vermont employers and employees must undergo mandatory health and safety training developed by the Vermont Occupational Safety and Health Agency.\n\nVirginia\n\nOn May 12, Gov. Ralph Northam signed an executive order that allows much of the state to enter Phase One of his \"Forward Virginia\" plan and reopen on May 15.\n\nThe new order also allowed certain Northern Virginia localities to delay Phase One until midnight on May 28 in order to meet health metrics. Northern Virginia, whose counties are close to Washington, D.C., has suffered a higher infection rate than the rest of the state.\n\nNortham detailed measures in Phase one:\n\nNon-essential retail — In phase one, non-essential retail stores will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Northam said this is a slight increase from the current 10 person limit.\n\n— In phase one, non-essential retail stores will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Northam said this is a slight increase from the current 10 person limit. Restaurants and breweries — Restaurants, breweries and beverage services will still be limited to take out and delivery.

Veterinarians will also be allowed to see non-emergency pets, Northam said.\n\nWashington\n\nNon-essential medical procedures and services can resume May 18, CNN reported.\n\nOn May 11, Gov. Jay Inslee outlined metrics that counties must reach before they are allowed to enter Phase 2 of his \"Safe Start\" plan. Counties with fewer than 75,000 residents that have not had a new coronavirus case over a three-week span can apply for a variance to enter Phase 2 before other parts of the state.\n\nOnce approved, counties may enter Phase 2 effective immediately. It allows restaurants to resume operations at limited capacity. Restaurants will not be required to get customers’ contact information as initially planned, Inslee's office said in a May 15 release.\n\nThe Democratic governor's office in a news release Friday said that instead, businesses are asked to keep a list of those who voluntarily provide contact information.\n\nInslee said on May 8 curbside retail sales in Washington could begin almost immediately for businesses with reopening plans approved by health officials. Multiple rural counties will also be able to relax some stay-at-home restrictions early as the state move through the reopening process.\n\nInslee announced May 1 that the state's coronavirus stay-at-home order would be extended through at least May 31 and said there will be a four-stage phase for lifting of restrictions, starting with allowing retail curbside pickup, automobile sales and car washes by mid-May.\n\nThere will be a minimum of three weeks between each phase, though he said some counties with lower numbers of cases and deaths may be able to open parts of their economy sooner if approved by the Department of Health.\n\nFishing, hunting and golfing resumed on May 5, at which time people could also return to state parks and other state lands for day trips.\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOn May 13, Mayor Muriel Bowser extended the District's stay-at-home order through June 8.\n\nSix stores, including four bookstores, were allowed to reopen May 18.\n\nBowser announced on April 23 the formation of a task force, the Reopen D.C. Advisory Group, that will issue recommendations in May on the timeline to ease restrictions. To accelerate the process, Bowser said the city would look to hire several hundred contact tracers.\n\nBowser said the District will be \"deliberate and strategic\" in its plans.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice on May 13 widened the most aggressive phase of his coronavirus reopening strategy to allow tanning salons to open just before Memorial Day weekend.\n\nOn May 18, fitness centers, gymnasiums and recreation centers were able to resume operations in West Virginia, with limitations.\n\nJustice announced that more businesses would reopen, including restaurants with indoor seating on May 21.\n\nLarge specialty retail stores can open back up on that date. That doesn't include indoor malls, but he said mall anchor stores with exterior entrances can resume operations.\n\nBar areas at restaurants must remain closed and those businesses are limited to 50% seating capacity. Patrons will not be allowed to congregate in waiting areas and there will be no buffet-style service or self-serve salad bars. Drinks are recommended to be served in cans or bottles, according to the guidelines.\n\nOn May 11 physical therapy centers and drive-in movie theaters were allowed to reopen.\n\nJustice has so far let hospitals resume elective procedures and allowed the reopening of small businesses, outdoor dining restaurants and barber shops.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court on May 13 struck down Gov. Tony Evers' order shutting down daily life, marking the first time a statewide order of its kind has been knocked down by a court of last resort.\n\nThe ruling, for now, immediately throws out the administration's tool to control the disease for which there is no vaccine and comes at a time when Evers has already begun lifting some restrictions as the spread of the virus slows down for now.\n\nOn May 11, Evers said all stand-alone or strip-mall based retail stores are able to offer in-person shopping, as long as customers are limited to five at a time and social distancing practices are maintained. The new order is \"focused on small retailers,\" Evers said.\n\nEssential retail businesses like grocery and hardware stores were opened with reduced capacity.\n\nAnd on May 1, 34 state parks and forests could open under special conditions. The openings come with attendance limits and reduced daily hours, while facilities like public restrooms, shelters and playgrounds will remain closed.\n\nOutdoor recreational vehicle rentals like those that deal with boats, golf carts, kayaks and ATVs could also open April 29, as could automatic or self-service car washes.\n\nWyoming\n\nWyoming will again allow people to dine in at restaurants, meet in bars and gather in larger numbers, Gov. Mark Gordon said May 13.\n\nBar and restaurant tables will need to seat no more than 6 people at a time and be spaced at least 6 feet apart. Staff must wear face coverings and be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 under new state public health orders that took effect May 15.\n\nAs many as 25 people — up from 10 currently — will be allowed to gather, enabling movie theaters and other performance venues to reopen with limited numbers of customers.\n\nOn May 15, a strip club in Cheyenne became one of the first in the country to reopen.\n\nYellowstone and Grand Teton national parks also reopened on May 18.\n\nWyoming's famed Devils Tower National Monument partially reopened May 22 after an almost two-month closure.\n\nPreviously, Wyoming eased some of its coronavirus restrictions May 1, with barbershops, gyms, nail salons and child care centers among the businesses that were allowed limited re-openings, Gordon said.\n\nGordon also said residents were allowed to camp at state parks as of May 15.\n\nContributing: Savannah Behrmann, Grace Hauck, USA TODAY; Natalie Allison, Nashville Tennessean; Stacey Barchenger, Bergen Record; Teresa Boeckel, York Daily Record; Lisa Kaczke, Sioux Falls Argus Leader; Laura Peters, Staunton News Leader; Dustin Racioppi, Bergen Record; Sady Swanson, Fort Collins Coloradoan; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2020/03/11/south-dakota-coronavirus-update-confirmed-cases-death-covid-19/5019927002/", "title": "Coronavirus in South Dakota: Updates, latest news during the ...", "text": "As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in South Dakota grows, here are the latest updates and information.\n\nEditor's note: This story, and many others, are being provided free for all to read.

Meanwhile, health officials from the state’s three large health Systems – Avera, Sanford and Monument Health – won’t elaborate on how they contributed to the process.\n\n'No more than 10' rule for S.F. businesses could extend into May\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken could keep emergency prohibitions on select Sioux Falls businesses in place through the end of the month at least.\n\nSince March 26, Sioux Falls bars, restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues have been barred from having no more than 10 patrons on their properties at a time. Originally, the emergency rules adopted in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Sioux Falls were set to expire April 8. However, councilors this week OKed a two-week extension to the sunset, moving out the expiration date to April 22.\n\nNext week, Sioux Falls city councilors are expected to consider another extension to the \"no lingering\" ordinance.\n\nCase update: 89 new cases in South Dakota, most in Minnehaha\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health announced Friday that 89 more cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been confirmed in the state.\n\nThe new cases bring the state's total to 536, a number that does not include pending tests in private labs and people who have the virus but have not been tested.\n\nNo new deaths were attributed to the disease. Six people have died from COVID-19 in South Dakota to date.\n\nThe number of people who have recovered from the disease increased to 177.\n\nIn Minnehaha County, 78 new cases were confirmed for a total of 352, while Lincoln County's confirmed case total rose by 5 to 38. The two counties combined account for 72% of the state's total cases.\n\nSioux Falls Health Department tours Smithfield facility, offers recommendations\n\nThe Sioux Falls Department of Health toured the Smithfield Foods facility and gave them some recommendations about how to curb the spread of coronavirus in the facility.\n\nSmithfield will close for three days Saturday after it was revealed that at least 80 workers tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nSioux Falls Public Health Director Jill Franken said the company is adding additional screening measures based on the health department's recommendations. That includes additional screening questions in addition to the temperature checks already being performed when workers arrive.\n\nThursday, April 9\n\nCafe worker in Lane, South Dakota tests positive for COVID-19\n\nA worker at the Lane Cafe in Lane tested positive for COVID-19, state health officials announced Thursday.\n\nThe person reported working last Wednesday through Saturday at the business.\n\nAnyone who visited the cafe during those dates should monitor for symptoms over the next 14 days, a news release from the South Dakota Department of Health said.\n\nThose who develop symptoms should call their health care provider and avoid contact with other people, according to the release.\n\nFirst responders ask for donated face masks amid COVID-19 outbreak\n\nThe City of Sioux Falls is asking residents to donate homemade face masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 among first responders.\n\nResponders use N95 masks during patient contact, but the city is asking for cloth masks for responders to follow CDC guidelines and wear around coworkers and the public.\n\nThe 600 masks are needed for dispatchers, emergency medical services and firefighters, according to a news release Thursday. They could also be distributed by first responders to vulnerable communities and individuals they respond to.\n\nMask drop-off bins will be placed at Sioux Falls fire stations, or they can be mailed to SFFR Station 3 on 2820 South Minnesota Avenue.\n\nGov. Noem announces app to help trace spread of coronavirus;\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced a new app available to South Dakotans to help with tracing the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nThe app, called Care19, comes through a partnership with North Dakota. It tracks the user's location, and, if the person later gets COVID-19, the app will help the health department track who may have been in contact with the infected person.\n\nUse of the app is voluntary, but it's intended for use by those who are essential workers or who must be out in the community to do essential business.\n\nData tracked by the app won't be used for anything but contact tracing, Noem said.\n\nNearly 500 people had chosen to use the South Dakota function of the app as of 3:45 p.m. Thursday.\n\nSmithfield closure another blow to livestock industry\n\nHog prices were already in a free fall.\n\nScott Kirsch is expecting things to get worse now that Smithfield Foods has closed its Sioux Falls plant for three days as it works to address an outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nKirsch co-owns the Platte Livestock Market, where he’s already noticed the effect of the novel coronavirus pandemic on the prices hog farmers are getting.\n\n“It’s going to be devastating to the industry,” he said of the closures caused by the worsening pandemic and resulting state of emergency.\n\nCase update: 54 more cases in South Dakota, majority in Sioux Falls area\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health announced that 54 more cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been confirmed in the state.\n\nThat brings the state's total number of confirmed cases to 447, a number that does not include tests pending in private labs or people who have the virus but have not been tested.\n\nThe number of deaths in the state have not increased, remaining at 6.\n\nThe number of people who recovered from the disease increased to 161.\n\nMinnehaha County's confirmed case total increased by 46 for a total of 274 confirmed cases in the county, accounting for 61% of the state's cases. Adding Lincoln County's 33 cases, the Sioux Falls area accounts for nearly 69% of the states confirmed cases.\n\nSmithfield Foods to close plant for 3 days after becoming COVID-19 'hot spot'\n\nSmithfield Foods will close its Sioux Falls plants for three days, the company announced Thursday.\n\nThe closure comes less than 24 hours after Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdom confirmed that more than 80 employees had tested positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nThe company will suspend operations in a large section of the plant on April 11 and completely shutter the Sioux Falls facility on April 12 and April 13.\n\n\"Smithfield is taking this action out of an abundance of caution for its 3,700 employees in Sioux Falls, a portion of whom have tested positive for COVID-19,\" said a news release sent to media Thursday morning.\n\nWednesday, April 8\n\nMore than 80 cases reported with workers at Smithfield Foods\n\nMore than 80 employees at a Sioux Falls food processing business have tested positive for the coronavirus, Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon confirmed Wednesday.\n\n\"There are a number of cases connected, that number has changed every day,\" Malsam-Rysdon said.\n\nShe added that the more than 80 confirmed cases were employees, and that number did not include others who may have become infected from those employees.\n\nSmithfield Foods, Inc. saw its first positive case on March 26, and nearly a week prior officials said the plant would maintain normal operations and would not close or send employees home amid the new coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCases update: Confirmed cases see biggest one-day jump\n\nState health officials confirmed a total of 393 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, in the state of South Dakota as of Wednesday morning.\n\nThat's an increase of 73 confirmed cases, or about 23% — the largest one-day total yet — since Tuesday, when the state had 320 confirmed cases of the disease, according to the South Dakota Department of Health's website. Those numbers don't include tests that are pending in private labs, or people who have the virus but have not been tested.\n\nThe number of people who have died from COVID-19 in the state remained at 6.\n\nMinnehaha County once again was the location of the majority of the new confirmed cases, with 63 more added on Wednesday for a total of 228. Minnehaha County and neighboring Lincoln County, which now has 31 confirmed cases, account for nearly two-thirds of the confirmed cases across the state.\n\nMayor: Sioux Falls has several 'hot spots'\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken announced Wednesday that city officials have identified several areas considered hot spots within Minnehaha County, or areas where the novel coronavirus is spreading rapidly.\n\nTenHaken would not go into specifics of where the hot spots are, but said healthcare officials are working closely with at least one particular employer within the city. The announcement came as part of the city's daily update to media about the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus that's become a global pandemic.\n\nAsked whether the hot spots included Smithfield Foods after employees have raised concerns about working conditions and at least one confirmed positive case has been found within the business, TenHaken did not say the Sioux Falls plant was considered a hot spot directly.\n\nTuesday, April 7\n\nYankton Walmart pharmacy employee tests positive for coronavirus\n\nThe Department of Health is warning people in the Yankton area about the risk of potential exposure to the coronavirus at a Walmart pharmacy.\n\nState health officials said Tuesday that an employee at the Yankton Walmart pharmacy tested positive for COVID-19 and potentially transmitted the virus to others while working shifts on March 25 and March 30.\n\nCase update: Two new deaths, confirmed cases at 320\n\nWith 32 new confirmed cases today, South Dakota has more than 300 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nThe state now has a total of 320 confirmed cases, a number that does not include tests pending at private labs and individuals who have the disease but have not been tested.\n\nThe number of deaths in the state increased to 6.\n\nTenHaken appears on CNN to discuss response\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken was on CNN on Tuesday morning discussing the city's coronavirus response as well as Gov. Kristi Noem's stance on stay-at-home guidelines.\n\nCNN anchor John King prefaced the interview by saying South Dakota was just one of a handful of states that hasn't issued a stay-at-home order even though Noem said 70 percent of the state's population could get infected.\n\nThat's especially important in a state like South Dakota, TenHaken said, because of how mostly rural the state is with a large population center in Sioux Falls.\n\n\"A blanket strategy that you could look at doing, in some cases, is probably hitting a nail with a sledgehammer,\" he said. \"But in places like Sioux Falls where we have the density, I think people would be open to (further restrictions).\"\n\nPOET scales back ethanol production amid slowdown\n\nSioux Falls-based POET announced Tuesday that it will idle ethanol production at some of its facilities amid a drop in demand for gasoline.\n\nThe world’s largest biofuel producer said it would idle production at facilities in Chancellor, S.D., and Ashton and Coon Rapids, Iowa, and delay the start-up of a new plant in Shelbyville, Indiana. The company estimated it would reduce corn demand by 110 million bushels and 330 million gallons of ethanol.\n\nMonday, April 6\n\nNoem executive order puts restrictions on Lincoln, Minnehaha county residents\n\nGov. Kristi Noem plans to extend and more strongly word an executive order related to how the state should operate amid the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"We are at a critical juncture,\" Noem said. \"In order for us to continue to flatten the curve, I'm taking additional steps that will help us do that.\"\n\nThe governor will also issue a separate order specific to the Sioux Falls area urging specific individuals to stay home for three weeks. That includes those who are over 65 years old or who have conditions like diabetes, lung disease, kidney or liver disease, moderate to severe asthma or who have weakened immune systems.\n\n\"I need this group in Minnehaha and Lincoln Counties to stay home,\" Noem said.\n\nGov. Noem says public schools will remain closed the rest of the school year\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced Monday that she's recommending schools to be closed and that online learning be continued through the rest of the year.\n\nThe decision comes after the confirmed number of coronavirus cases neared 300 Monday, and extends her initial recommendation made mid-March for school districts to close through May 1 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to help slow the spread of the virus.\n\n\"It just doesn't make sense to bring our kids back into our school buildings this year,\" Noem said.\n\nThe confirmed cases do not include tests pending in private labs or those who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nMeanwhile, summer classes for all public universities will be online or done remotely, the South Dakota Board of Regents announced Monday.\n\n48 new cases, two more deaths confirmed in South Dakota Monday\n\nSouth Dakota has reported 48 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThe new cases, reported Monday, bring the total number of confirmed cases in South Dakota to 288, a number that does not include tests pending in private labs, or people with or without symptoms who have not been tested.\n\nThe state's death total also increased to 4. It's unclear whether the newly-reported deaths are separate from the deaths of a resident at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community who died from the disease on April 3, or state Rep. Bob Glanzer, who also died on April 3 after being hospitalized with the disease in late March.\n\nMayor TenHaken issues 'stay at home' proclamation for Sioux Falls\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken on Monday issued a proclamation strongly encouraging Sioux Falls residents to stay at home.\n\nThe proclamation outlines recommendations to businesses and residents in the city to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. See the guidelines here.\n\nMeanwhile, TenHaken, along with more than 160 municipal and county officials, signed a letter Monday requesting Gov. Kristi Noem to declare a public health emergency.\n\n\"What little authority counties possess, which is also untested in these circumstances, is cumbersome at best. In these difficult times, local governments need to know with certainty they are able to adequately address the COVID-19 emergency and that all levels of government are working cooperatively,\" the letter states. \"To accomplish this, it is imperative for you to encourage the Secretary of Health to declare a Public Health Emergency in South Dakota with your consent and exercise your authority.\"\n\nSunday, April 5\n\n28 positives reported, increasing to 240 cases\n\nSouth Dakota reported 28 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases to 240.

There were three new cases reported in Yankton, bringing the total to 14, while Lincoln County added two new cases to get to 21 total.\n\nThe state's death total remained at two, but two deaths presumably tied to the coronavirus were reported later Friday night and were not included in the numbers.\n\nCoronavirus claims life of South Dakota lawmaker Bob Glanzer\n\nHuron state Rep. Bob Glanzer has become the fourth known fatality in South Dakota from coronavirus, dying Friday in Sioux Falls, according to his son Thomas Glanzer via Facebook.\n\nGlanzer, 74, had been airlifted to Sioux Falls from Huron on the morning of Tuesday, March 24. The Republican lawmaker told the Argus Leader on March 23 that he had a fever that was worsening and that he received a positive test result the day prior. He said he’d been self-isolating for about a week and didn’t think he’d had contact with others who had tested positive in Beadle County.\n\nFriday, April 3\n\nRetirement home reports state's third death\n\nA resident at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community has died from the COVID-19 virus, according to Avera Health officials.\n\nThe resident was one of three residents who was infected with the virus this week. The other two patients are still being cared for at the facility, according to a news release.\n\nThe age or gender of the person has yet to be released.\n\n“The health and safety of our residents is our priority, and we are deeply saddened by this loss,” said Justin Hinker, administrator for Avera Prince of Peace. “We will take all precautions possible to stop the spread of this virus in our facility.”\n\nUp to 600,000 South Dakotans could get coronavirus, will peak in mid-June\n\nUp to 70% of South Dakotans could get the novel coronavirus, according to projections shared by Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday.\n\nNoem and health experts from the state's major hospital systems on Friday shared projections on how the novel coronavirus will spread throughout the state.\n\nPreviously, Noem had said she expected 30% of the state to become infected by the respiratory illness, but that number has expanded to include up to 70% of the state, or 600,000 people. That's taking into account those who get the virus but will show no symptoms or very minor symptoms.\n\nSanford, Avera to offer rapid testing\n\nBoth of Sioux Falls' major hospital systems will be offering rapid COVID-19 testing.\n\nSanford Health now has the capability to get test results for the disease in 90 minutes, according to a press release by the healthcare system Friday.\n\nAvera will also have rapid testing starting next week, and the expected turnaround is 45 minutes, according to a press release Friday.\n\nConfirmed cases keep rise to 187 in South Dakota\n\nThe number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Dakota hit 187 Friday.\n\nThat's with an addition of 22 known cases, a number that doesn't include pending tests or those who are not being tested. The state lab and hospitals are focusing primarily on high-priority cases, meaning those with symptoms who do not fall into high-priority categories may not be tested. The data also does not include people who may have the virus but are asymptomatic.\n\nIn Minnehaha County, the number of confirmed cases rose from 54 to 68. Sioux Falls officials have prohibited certain businesses from having more than 10 patrons on their premises and closed local parks.\n\nThursday, April 2\n\nNoem to call on National Guard to build 100-bed units in South Dakota\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced Thursday she will be requesting help from the National Guard to build up capacity in South Dakota's two major cities to deal with the upcoming surge in COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe National Guard will set up 100-bed supplemental units in Rapid City and Sioux Falls in the coming weeks, state health secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon said, though it's unclear how soon the units will be ready. Officials have to find the right location first, she said.\n\nThe National Guard will go to those cities first, and then look at other communities across the state that may need help, Noem said.\n\nThe state will use federal funding to help cover the cost to use the National Guard.\n\nNeed to get tested for coronavirus? Here's what it will cost you\n\nSouth Dakotans with health insurance who get tested for the novel coronavirus hitting the country might never see a bill.\n\nBut for those who self-insure or go without, the cost could be hundreds of dollars, depending on where the COVID-19 swab is done.\n\nThe Argus Leader this week requested from the three healthcare systems in South Dakota — the state health office, Sanford Health and Avera Health — that are conducting the most COVID-19 testing how much each is charging for taking a sample, analyzing it and reporting the results back to the patients.\n\nSouth Dakota confirms 36 more cases Thursday\n\nSouth Dakota saw 36 more confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus as of Thursday morning.\n\nThat brings the state's total number of cases to 165 from Wednesday's count of 129 cases, a number that doesn't include the tests pending in private labs, or those without symptoms who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nThis is the largest one-day increase in known cases of the virus so far.\n\nFourteen more cases were confirmed in Minnehaha County, where nearly a third of the state's cases have been confirmed. Sioux Falls officials have prohibited certain businesses from having more than nine patrons on their premises, closed local parks and may issue a stay-at-home order.\n\nThousands more South Dakotans file for unemployment amid COVID-19 turmoil\n\nThousands more South Dakotans filed for unemployment benefits last week, a result of businesses across the state sending workers home and cutting hours amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn total, nearly 2,700 filed unemployment insurance claims with the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation in the week ending March 28. That's on top of the 1,761 who filed for unemployment the week prior, and continues a nationwide trend where a record-setting amount of people are out of work.\n\nWednesday, April 1\n\nSecond death confirmed, total jumps to 129 known cases in South Dakota\n\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has caused the death of a second person in South Dakota, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThat's along with 21 new confirmed cases in the state, including nine more in Minnehaha County — bringing the state's total confirmed cases to 129, a number that doesn't include tests pending in private labs, or people with symptoms who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nThe death announced on April 1 is the second caused by COVID-19 in the state, following the March 9 death of a man in his 60s from Pennington County. The age and gender of the person whose death was announced today is unknown at this time.\n\nQuint Hofer, husband of Mari Hofer, who died suddenly on Saturday morning at a Sioux Falls hospital confirmed that the 51-year-old mother of three from Huron tested positive for COVID-19. Quint Hofer said he received the positive test results Tuesday.\n\nInternet usage up as Midco adjusts to remote work, learning\n\nThe Sioux Falls area’s largest provider of broadband internet is making adjustments as it responds to the growing number of families working and learning from home.\n\nMidco staff noticed a jump in daytime traffic about mid-March as the state of emergency caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, reached Sioux Falls and the rest of South Dakota, forcing cancellations and closers and underlining the need for a home internet connection.\n\nAnticipating the greater need, the Sioux Falls-based telecommunications company made a number of proactive decisions designed to optimize the flow of data across its infrastructure, said Jon Pederson, Midco’s chief technology officer.\n\nVolunteers, businesses sew face masks during COVID-19 outbreak\n\nLinda Hoefert prays over each face mask she sews.\n\nShe prays for the nurse or doctor or technician who will wear the patterned cotton mask. She prays that it helps protect them as they work on the front lines of the COVID-19 outbreak and that the people they are helping would be protected as well.\n\nHoefert is one of several volunteers donating their materials, skills and free time to sew handmade masks for hospitals. While several healthcare systems across the U.S. are running out of protective gear like masks in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, South Dakota-based healthcare systems say they haven't had a shortage of supplies yet.\n\nTuesday, March 31\n\nTwo residents at Avera Prince of Peace test positive for COVID-19\n\nTwo residents at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community in Sioux Falls tested positive for COVID-19, according to a news release from Avera on Tuesday.\n\nNeither resident has needed to be transferred to the hospital, and they were isolated from others as soon as their symptoms appeared, according to the news release.\n\nThe retirement community restricted all visitors to the building two weeks ago, so officials believe the transmission likely came from an employee.\n\nLatest coronavirus numbers report 12 hospitalized\n\nThe number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Dakota continue to rise.\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health's latest case numbers posted Tuesday morning online show seven more cases were discovered since the same time yesterday.

Forty four people have recovered.\n\nTuesday's new cases were reported in: Kingbury, Lincoln, Minnehaha (4) and Yankton.\n\nThe state has reported one death as a result of COVID-19, a man from Pennington County.\n\nNoem: Cities have public health powers, but counties left out in final legislative day\n\nSouth Dakota cities have the power to take broad measures to stem a public health crisis, Gov. Kristi Noem said Tuesday, but a similar move to give county governments the same power failed in the final hours of the legislative session.\n\nNoem, speaking hours after the Legislature closed a marathon final day that included the passage of several emergency bills, said lawmakers had good debate on a day that lasted more than 16 hours.\n\n“Well, we got through it,” she said.\n\nRetirement home employee in Clear Lake tests positive for coronavirus\n\nAn employee at the Deuel County Good Samaritan Society in Clear Lake has tested positive for the coronavirus, the retirement home confirmed in a statement.\n\nThe employee has not been publicly identified at this time, nor has the employee’s position at Good Samaritan Society.\n\nThe statement noted the retirement home facility is working closely with federal officials to monitor the situation. Families of residents have been notified that there has been potential exposure from the employee. Extra precautions are being taken to monitor health of the residents and staff, the release said.\n\nSioux Falls closing off parts of parks to limit gatherings\n\nThe city of Sioux Falls is closing portions of parks in Sioux Falls to reduce people from gathering in large groups.\n\nThe restrictions mean basketball hoops will be coming down, playgrounds will be taped off and dog parks will be closed, Mayor Paul TenHaken said. Skateboard parks will also be closed.\n\nThe bike trail will remain open and people can continue to go to parks to walk their dogs or run, but TenHaken wants to limit the number of people who are gathering in groups.\n\nThe restrictions do not affect Falls Park, but the visitor's center there remains closed.\n\nMonday, March 30\n\nHelpline center sets up 24-hour hotline\n\nAvera Health and the Helpline Center are creating a 24-hour hotline for people who need some mental health support because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Helpline officials announced today.\n\nThe hotline will be available immediately, according to a press release from the Helpline Center.\n\nSanford doctor in Watertown tests positive for COVID-19\n\nSanford Clinic of Watertown confirmed Tuesday that Dr. William Devine has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nSanford's policy is not to disclose identifying information regarding patients, but Devine chose to self-identify, according to the health care provider. His exposure is believed to be travel related, and he is now resting at home.\n\nBecause Devine self-isolated as soon as he developed symptoms, Sanford officials believe his exposures to patients was limited. Those who were seen by Devine on or after March 25 will be contacted by the South Dakota Department of Health. Sanford also encourages patients who have had recent contact with Devine to monitor themselves closely and call the Watertown clinic at 605-886-1565 or schedule an e-visit using My Sanford if they have COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nSouth Dakota reaches 101 total confirmed cases Monday\n\nSouth Dakota reported 11 new cases of COVID-19 Monday and brought the lab's pending test number to zero.\n\nThe new numbers provided by the South Dakota Department of Health Monday bring the total confirmed cases in South Dakota to 101.

There is no end date to the resolution.\n\nNoem says special session needed for 'significant' changes to state budget\n\nState lawmakers will meet next week to vote on a number of bills to help the state respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic, but Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday more work will be needed.\n\nThe governor said she's looking to call a special session in June to make \"significant changes\" to the state budget.\n\nNoem plans to sign existing bills in the meantime, but she's not going to spend those funds allocated for the next fiscal year until the state has a clearer picture of how the pandemic will affect state revenues.\n\nTwelve new confirmed cases reported in South Dakota\n\nTwelve new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been confirmed in the state as of Friday, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThat brings the state's total to 58 confirmed cases, a number that does not take into account the state's 20 pending tests or those with symptoms who are not being tested.\n\nCommunity spread of the virus has also been confirmed in nine counties with substantial spread in Beadle and Minnehaha.

Kristi Noem to take further action to address the COVID-19 outbreak in South Dakota in a news release Thursday.\n\n\"South Dakota must do more,\" the release said.\n\nThe association, which represents physicians, residents and medical students across the state, called for Noem to close all nonessential businesses in South Dakota to prevent community spread.\n\nThe association also asked Noem to suspend nonessential elective surgeries and prohibit payment for nonessential surgeries during the pandemic in order to preserve medical equipment.\n\nCouncil unanimously passes coronavirus-related business restrictions effective immediately\n\nThe Sioux Falls Board of Health and City Council voted unanimously to prohibit select businesses from allowing more than nine patrons in their buildings at once.\n\nIt's a recommendation that came out of Mayor Paul TenHaken's office after substantial community spread of the novel coronavirus in Minnehaha County was confirmed by the South Dakota Department of Health earlier this week.\n\nThe businesses included in the 10 or more prohibition are:\n\nBars\n\nRestaurants\n\nBreweries\n\nCafes\n\nCasinos\n\nCoffee shops\n\nRecreational or athletic facilities\n\nHealth clubs\n\nEntertainment venues\n\nPending COVID-19 tests to be 'down to zero' Monday, Noem says\n\nFive new cases of the novel coronavirus were confirmed in South Dakota as of Thursday morning.\n\nThose numbers do not take into account pending tests or people with symptoms who are not being tested.\n\n\"We expect on Monday to have pending tests down to zero,\" Noem said.\n\nThe new confirmed cases brought the total to 16 known cases in Minnehaha County, where substantial community spread is occurring.\n\nNoem added that none of the new confirmed cases were from inmates in the state.\n\nThe governor also addressed the surge in unemployment claims in the state, and she asked state residents who are healthy to donate blood to help the growing need of the American Red Cross.\n\nShe also sent regards to Sen. John Thune, who was flown back to South Dakota Wednesday night after reporting not feeling well.\n\nWhittier student tests positive for COVID-19, school officials say\n\nThe Sioux Falls School District now has its second confirmed case of COVID-19.\n\nThe case is a student from Whittier Middle School. The other confirmed case is a Laura Wilder Elementary School staff member, which was announced earlier this week.\n\nParents were notified about the Whittier case via email and a letter sent home, school officials said Thursday morning.\n\n\"We recently notified staff and families at Whittier Middle School that a student has tested positive for COVID-19,\" district spokesperson Carly Uthe said in a statement. \"The Department of Health tells us there is no risk of transmission to other staff or students at the school due to the student's last day of attendance at Whittier.\"\n\nNothing in state law allows delay of upcoming city election\n\nState law allows cities and school districts to hold their elections during the June primary election, but Sioux Falls missed a deadline that would have allowed that to happen in this year’s contest.\n\nMeanwhile, city leaders have asked Gov. Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Steve Barnett to postpone the joint city-school district election. In a letter to Noem and Barnett, City Clerk Tom Greco cited several reasons for postponing the election, including disinfecting polling places and poll workers who tend to skew older. Older people have been a key demographic facing serious complications from the Covid-19 pandemic. Greco wrote that 80% of his poll workers are 60 and above.\n\nMunicipal elections scheduled for April 14 across the state face similar dilemmas.\n\nUnemployment office scrambling to keep up with surge in claims\n\nMore than 1,700 people in South Dakota filed for unemployment benefits last week as businesses across the state send workers home amid COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nThe new figures released Thursday morning by the U.S. Department of Labor show the rise in South Dakota claims as well as the surge in claims in unemployment offices nationwide.\n\nIn South Dakota, the 1,703 claims received by the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation was a 907% increase from the 169 claims filed the week prior.\n\nAnd the spike is forcing the department to add staff and phone lines to its call center.\n\nVisiting loved ones in a nursing home during coronavirus\n\nThree times a week Janis Hoogestraat would visit her 92-year-old mother who is in assisted living. During these visits, she would take her mom, Marie DeBoer, to the salon room down the hall and wash her hair. As she rolled her fine, silver hair into curlers, she would tell her mom about what her grandchildren have been up to. They would spend time together looking at photos and reminiscing on the past.\n\nHer visits look a little different now because of the coronavirus. Hoogestraat can no longer paint her mom’s nails but now has to talk to her through the window in her room at Edgewood Assisted Living.\n\nRead more\n\nWednesday, March 25\n\nSen. John Thune falls ill, flown home to South Dakota\n\nSen. John Thune returned to South Dakota after falling ill Wednesday, according to an announcement from his spokesman.\n\nThe decision comes as Congress debates a stimulus package worth $2 trillion that would assist businesses and unemployed workers amid the COVID-19 global pandemic.\n\nThune, 59, is South Dakota's senior senator and the second-ranking Republican in the Senate.\n\nS.D. recruits retired doctors, nurses to volunteer in COVID-19 outbreak\n\nSouth Dakota health officials are recruiting retired doctors and healthcare professionals to help address the statewide COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe state is using its State Emergency Registry of Volunteers for South Dakota (SERV SD) to register local, regional and statewide volunteers to help public health and healthcare systems during the pandemic. As of March 25, there are 41 confirmed cases of coronavirus in South Dakota pressuring healthcare systems in the region.\n\nWhile officials are encouraging everyone to volunteer, an emphasis is placed on licensed medical and healthcare volunteers that can work in clinics and respond to emergencies, including retired healthcare professionals.\n\nSpecial legislative session likely needed to redo state budget\n\nThe South Dakota Legislature will likely hold a special session by the end of June to address financial uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and to potentially remake the coming year’s spending plan passed earlier this month, legislative fiscal leaders say.\n\nMembers of the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee told South Dakota News Watch that economic uncertainty now hangs over South Dakota as businesses continue to shut their doors, layoffs accelerate around the state and tourists stay away.\n\nThe increasingly dire economic news has led legislators to anticipate that drastic changes may be needed to the state budget lawmakers just passed for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, which begins July 1. Adjustments to the budget could include revision or elimination of the 2% pay increase for teachers, state employees and Medicaid providers originally included in the spending plan.\n\nTenHaken says city going 'as far as we can' to prevent COVID-19 spread\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken addressed reporters and the public Wednesday afternoon to address the advent of community spread of the novel coronavirus in both Minnehaha and Lincoln County.\n\nBecause of substantial community in Minnehaha, meaning five or more confirmed cases whose origin cannot be traced, TenHaken wanted to reiterate the measures his administration is taking to slow the spread.\n\nLincoln County has now seen a moderate level of community spread, TenHaken added.\n\nIn response, TenHaken is recommending that the city board of health enact an ordinance to limit businesses to having fewer than 10 patrons at one time.\n\n\"It's a very strict ordinance,\" TenHaken said. \"It will be enforceable by a Class 2 misdemeanor\"\n\nConfirmed coronavirus cases jump to 13 in Minnehaha County, 'substantial' community spread\n\nEleven more people have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus — eight of them in Minnehaha County, where the South Dakota Department of Health says there is now \"substantial\" community spread.\n\nThe updated numbers from the South Dakota Department of Health say that there are now 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, with 268 tests still pending at the South Dakota Public Health Lab. That doesn't include the number of tests pending in commercial labs.\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said Tuesday that he'd heard community spread was likely occurring in the city.\n\nThe increase in Minnehaha County brings the total number of confirmed cases up to 13, the same number as Beadle County where community spread was also confirmed as \"substantial.\" Those two counties have the highest rate of confirmed cases in the state.\n\nTenHaken to recommend mandating businesses limit patrons amid coronavirus spread\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken is recommending the Board of Health and City Council force select businesses not let more than 10 people occupy their buildings at the same time, an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in Sioux Falls.\n\nThe types of businesses that would be affected if the recommendation is adopted will be those listed in an executive order signed by Gov. Kristi Noem earlier this week. Those include bars, restaurants, breweries, cafes, casinos, recreation or athletic facilities, health clubs and entertainment venues.\n\nBusinesses can remain open, but they must comply by allowing no more than 10 people at one time, under the mayor's recommendation. A Class 2 misdemeanor is punishable by a $500 fine and/or up to 30 days in jail.\n\nLawmakers to meet via teleconference on Veto Day due to coronavirus\n\nThe South Dakota Legislature will meet via teleconference for the final scheduled day of this year's legislative session.\n\nLawmakers were scheduled to convene on Monday in Pierre to consider action on any vetoes from Gov. Kristi Noem, but decided to hold the meeting remotely due to the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nThe meeting may also be used to consider emergency actions like budget adjustments or legislative action in light of the global pandemic. The public will still be able to listen to the meeting.\n\nSurgeries continue at S.F. Specialty Hospital\n\nThe Sioux Falls Specialty Hospital continues to perform surgeries for patients who are in pain, but those surgeries comply with Gov. Kristi Noem’s order for providers to cease elective surgeries, the hospital’s chief executive officer said Tuesday.\n\nNoem’s executive order said health providers should postpone “all non-essential elective surgeries to conserve (and thereby maximize) supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).”\n\nHospital CEO Dr. Blake Curd said that the facility has been taking steps for weeks to prepare for the pandemic and that the facility is following guidelines set by federal and state officials.\n\nTuesday, March 24\n\nTenHaken: COVID-19 community spread has likely hit county, which would prompt further action\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said Tuesday afternoon that he's received updates from contacts in the medical community that community spread of the novel coronavirus has hit Minnehaha County.\n\nAnd if it's confirmed, recommendations to limit the movement of people in Sioux Falls will be coming.\n\nTenHaken relayed the information to the Sioux Falls Board of Health during a meeting at Carnegie Town Hall where the seven-member panel got a briefing on the status of COVID-19 in the community.\n\n\"Even in the last hour, I have received phone calls and information ... that there is likely some confirmed cases of community spread in our county,\" he said during the portion of the meeting when the board received general input from the public. \"If that is confirmed, that raises our response.\"\n\nSchool District staff member tests positive\n\nA staff member at Laura Wilder Elementary has tested positive for COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, Tuesday afternoon, according to a statement released by the Sioux Falls School District.\n\n\"All parents and staff members at Laura Wilder were notified of this confirmed case minutes ago,\" the statement read. \"We have provided guidance from the South Dakota Department of Health to families and staff.\"\n\nIt's unclear if this case is one of the 30 confirmed in South Dakota as of Tuesday, or if this is a new case in the state.\n\nPublic universities to hold remainder of classes online\n\nNow that South Dakota has instances of COVID-19 cases occurring through community spread, classes for South Dakota's six public universities and two special schools will be delivered remotely for the rest of the spring semester.\n\nThe South Dakota Board of Regents made the announcement in a press release Tuesday afternoon. The decision is effective immediately, and the spring semester is scheduled to end May 8, the release states.\n\nGraduations at each university have also been postponed.\n\nNoem: Escaped female inmates from same unit as inmate with COVID-19\n\nEight female inmates left a minimum-security unit in Pierre on Monday, the Department of Corrections said.\n\nThe inmates left the Pierre Community Work Center without authorization at 8:43 p.m. Monday by exiting an exterior door, according to a release from the DOC.\n\nWomen’s prison staff began escape procedures, and law enforcement was notified, according to the news release. The South Dakota Highway Patrol aircraft was used to assist ground operations to search for the inmates.\n\nThe walk-off occurred the same day the South Dakota Department of Health announced one case of COVID-19 at the Pierre Women's Prison, one of seven new cases on Monday. Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday confirmed those who escaped were from the same unit as the inmate who tested positive, but didn't know how close in proximity the women had been.\n\nSouth Dakota schools to remain closed until May; two more cases reported\n\nSouth Dakota schools will remain closed until May 1, Gov. Kristi Noem announced Tuesday.\n\nThe governor said state employees will also continue to work remotely until May 2.\n\nShe added that the state will reevaluate in the coming weeks to see if students will return to school buildings before the end of the school year.\n\n\"With a virus that we're still learning about ... we're making sure that we're making the right decision and keeping kids out of school,\" Noem said.\n\nThe state saw two more positive COVID-19 test results as of Thursday afternoon, bringing the total confirmed positive cases to 30 with hundreds more test results pending.\n\nNoem said Tuesday that an additional two people have recovered from the virus.\n\nThe new cases are in Beadle and Brookings Counties.\n\nNoem also said she's still planning on holding veto day later this month. She's working to find ways to do that remotely, if possible.\n\nTenHaken: Health board and city council won't be taking actions on business closures today\n\nSioux Falls mayor Paul TenHaken says the city's health board and city council will not be taking actions today on whether non-essential businesses can stay open in the city.\n\nThe meeting at 2 p.m. is informational, he said, and the board will be discussing options.\n\n\"Businesses can stay open, but we are really going to be pinging you to operate in the most appropriate fashion,\" TenHaken said.\n\nOn Monday, Governor Kristi Noem issued an executive order that didn't mandate that businesses close, but that they must take actions to frequently clean and limit the number of patrons who are inside the building at a time.\n\nThat puts the onus on business owners, TenHaken said.\n\nSioux Falls police opt for citations, not arrests to prevent coronavirus spread\n\nSome offenses that typically merit a trip to the jail are meriting only citations and an ordered court appearance in light of COVID-19.\n\nBoth the Sioux Falls Police Department and the Minnehaha County Sheriff's Office have shifted priorities over the last couple of weeks to focus on keeping both officers and the community safe.\n\nThe police department last week announced changes to the reporting process for some crimes, urging the public to use online resources to alert police of offenses when a suspect or suspects are not present.\n\nAnd Monday, Police Chief Matt Burns told the Argus Leader that officers have been directed to issue summons and citations \"in lieu of some arrests\" to minimize exposure to the general public while the novel coronavirus continues to be a health threat for the community.\n\nAvera Health closing doors to most to visitors\n\nAvera Health is closing its hospitals to nearly all visitors to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, the Sioux Falls-based health care system announced Tuesday.\n\nThe only exceptions will be for births, pediatric cases, NICU and end-of-life care. Those visitors will be limited, according to Avera's announcement.\n\n“We understand that these restrictions will be difficult for patients, family members, friends and loved ones,\" Chief Medical and Innovation Officer Dr. David Erickson said in an emailed statement. \"Top priority is the protection of everyone, especially those who are most vulnerable.\n\nMonday, March 23\n\nCoronavirus cases could swamp South Dakota hospitals if projections hold\n\nGov. Kristi Noem estimated Monday that 30% of the state’s population is expected to get infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\nThat estimate – which could be optimistic – would likely overrun the state’s medical capacity if cases are not spread out over a period of months. And it underscores why medical leaders have been stressing the need to space out infections over time – the “flatten the curve” approach to managing the disease.\n\nA 30% infection rate in South Dakota would lead to about 265,000 infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that about 20% of people who get infected are ill enough to require hospitalization. The most severe cases require intensive care unit treatment.\n\nThat rate would see about 53,000 hospitalizations.\n\nBut South Dakota doesn’t have nearly enough hospital beds to serve that level of hospitalizations. The South Dakota Department of Health currently licenses 11 hospitals statewide that have a capacity of 2,006 beds.\n\nNoem signs executive order after community spread found in 'several' counties\n\nGov. Kristi Noem signed an executive order on Monday setting a baseline for decision-making related to the novel coronavirus in South Dakota.\n\n\"We are doing this now because we do have community spread in South Dakota in several counties,\" Noem said. \"This is what South Dakotans should do. It is direction on doing the right thing.\"\n\nThe order is intended to set a baseline of guidance for businesses, community owners and health care providers. It recommends businesses limit groups to 10 or fewer and that health care providers stop doing elective surgeries.\n\nLyman, Hughes and Beadle County have seen community spread, Noem said. The Hughes County case is an inmate in the women's prison, Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon confirmed.\n\nRead the full executive order.\n\nRemote learning will continue in Sioux Falls schools 'until further notice'\n\nSioux Falls Superintendent Brian Maher says his district is prepared for the possibility of a long-term closure, and that starting Tuesday, students will participate in remote learning until further notice in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMaher made the announcement during a briefing with the press Monday, before the district holds its first school board meeting since Gov. Kristi Noem recommended South Dakota schools be closed this week to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that's affected hundreds worldwide.\n\nAs of Monday, South Dakota had 28 cases, including one death, across the state as well as hundreds of pending tests. Noem announced the state also had its first cases of community spread in multiple areas after an increase in confirmed cases over the weekend.\n\nMinnehaha County, which includes Sioux Falls, currently has five confirmed cases, per state data. The state also closed schools the week prior as a precautionary measure to give school districts a chance to clean facilities and plan for the possibility of an extended closure.\n\nAvera, Sanford labs to begin coronavirus test processing\n\nBoth Avera and Sanford Health announced Monday that they will begin processing tests for coronavirus after winning regulatory approval from the government.\n\nAvera said it would have capacity to process about 200 tests daily, and Sanford said in a separate announcement that it would process 400 tests, with plans to double that capacity in coming weeks.\n\nTests will be processed at both of the systems' Sioux Falls laboratories.\n\nSen. Thune rebukes Democrats for 'dillydallying' over coronavirus bill\n\nU.S. Sen. John Thune accused Democrats of holding up the Senate's coronavirus bill during a partisan debate on the Senate floor on Monday.\n\nThune raised his voice at Democrats in frustration during a debate on the Senate floor that devolved into screaming matches over the $1.8 trillion bill after Senate Democrats blocked the passage of the bill on Sunday. Thune's comments came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had a tense exchange with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., in which Manchin said the bill helps big businesses and Wall Street instead of health care workers and smaller businesses.\n\n\"Really?\" Thune responded. \"Are we going to do that again? Are we going to do this again, you guys coming over here to block votes and use the line that this is a bailout for big corporations?\"\n\nTenHaken recommends closure of non-essential businesses in Sioux Falls\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken said Monday he will recommend that the city health board close non-essential businesses.\n\nWithout a mandate from the state, TenHaken said, he's asked the board to consider closing businesses if the data provided supports that, and it does.\n\n\"We're at that point,\" TenHaken said, citing community spread of the novel coronavirus in Beadle County.\n\nThe health board will meet at 2 p.m. Tuesday. Public Health Director Jill Franken said their discussions will depend on a planned executive order from Gov. Kristi Noem, which is expected to provide clarity to businesses and municipalities across the state.\n\nSeven more cases reported, bringing state's total to 28\n\nGov. Kristi Noem said Monday that 30% of South Dakotans could get sick, according to projections.\n\n\"That is literally tens of thousands of people in our state,\" she said.\n\nThe state saw an increase of seven cases between Sunday and Monday, she added. That brings the state's total to 28. Positive cases of COVID-19 will continue to increase until May or early June, Noem said.\n\nAs the number of cases increase, the governor said she won't be able to specifically address each new case. She encouraged the public to rely on the data from the Department of Health website: http://covid.sd.gov/.\n\nRep. Bob Glanzer of Huron tests positive for coronavirus\n\nRep. Bob Glanzer, a Republican from Huron, has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nHe said he's had a fever that kept ramping up. He received the positive test result on Sunday. He's been self-isolating for about a week and doesn't believe he's had contact with any of the 10 people who have tested positive in Beadle County, he said.\n\nGlanzer, in his second term, represents Beadle and Kingsbury counties in the South Dakota House. He said he's not planning to attend the Legislature's final day on March 30.\n\nSunday, March 22\n\nNoem: Coronavirus won't peak in S.D. until at least May\n\nCoronavirus cases will continue to increase in South Dakota until at least May, according to projections Gov. Kristi Noem shared Sunday.\n\nNoem, in a Facebook live video Sunday afternoon, advised residents that the virus is \"not a short-term thing\" in the state.\n\n\"We will in June, July, August still be watching this trend going through South Dakota,\" Noem said. \"This isn't going to be over in two weeks.\"\n\nNoem also said we will have community spread in South Dakota, likely within days. Seven more cases were reported Sunday, bringing the state's total to 21.\n\nSioux Falls City Council asking governor to postpone election\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken, all eight city councilors and the City Clerk are urging Gov. Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Steve Barnett to take emergency action to postpone Sioux Falls' April 14 election.\n\n\"As Chair of the Sioux Falls City Council, I am writing to you on behalf of my colleagues and Mayor Paul TenHaken. We urgently request that you delay our local election until the June 2, 2020 Primary Election,\" wrote Sioux Falls City Council chairman Marshall Selberg in a letter sent to Pierre Sunday.\n\nIn a separate letter sent to the governor, City Clerk Tom Greco said the novel coronavirus and the response its compelled across the country could hinder Election Day in Sioux Falls, drive down voter turn out and cause voter confusion due to the necessity to change precinct polling places if the election is held next month.\n\nHuron closing restaurants, bars, other businesses\n\nHuron and Beadle County officials closed restaurants, bars and other businesses Sunday afternoon just hours after Gov. Kristi Noem announced that Beadle County had become the nexus for coronavirus cases in the state.\n\nNoem said Sunday morning that Beadle County had six additional cases and the county was on the verge of reaching the stage where coronavirus was being spread throughout the community. Noem called on officials in Beadle County to take action to curtail the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe closures included all recreation facilities, theaters and schools beginning at 12 a.m., as well as the public landfill. It did not apply to groceries or businesses serving off-site food. The closures were until further notice.\n\nWill Sioux Falls shut down businesses? That's up to city council\n\nThe Sioux Falls Board of Health will meet Tuesday to review next steps to combat the spread of COVID-19, which could include asking councilors to OK closing bars and restaurants in the city, the mayor's office said Sunday.\n\nThe development comes just minutes after the mayor of Rapid City on Sunday announced an emergency meeting of the City Council there, in which they will consider an ordinance to enact emergency measures that include the closure of restaurants, bars, coffee houses, clubs, cafes, casinos and recreation facilities.\n\nIn Sioux Falls, Mayor Paul TenHaken has said repeatedly that he can't force private business closures through executive action. His deputy chief of staff, T.J. Nelson, told the Argus Leader Sunday that enforcing that sort of action can only be done through ordinance.\n\nAnd while there's no immediate plans to ask the City Council to do that, Nelson said it will be discussed by the Sioux Falls Board of Health, which will ultimately make any recommendations on further action to be taken up by councilors.\n\nHuron, Beadle County officials hold emergency meeting after more cases announced\n\nHuron and Beadle County officials are in an emergency meeting this afternoon after Gov. Kristi Noem called on local officials to take more measures to halt the spread of coronavirus.\n\nNoem on Sunday announced that six new cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Beadle County and that community spread was likely just days away. The county has the most cases in the state with 10 of the 21 announced.\n\nA joint city/county commission meeting was not open to the public. During the meeting, Huron Police Capt. Mark Johnson said Mayor Paul Aylward had been on the phone with Noem to discuss available options and what legal authority local officials have to enact more stringent measures.\n\n“Right now we want the public to know we are on top of this,” Johnson said.\n\nSeven more cases reported in South Dakota\n\nGov. Kristi Noem released more details on the confirmed positive novel coronavirus cases in South Dakota. Six of the seven new cases were in Beadle County. Here's the breakdown of the demographics of those cases:\n\nMale, age 60-69\n\nFemale, age 50-59\n\nFemale, age 20-29\n\nMale, age 20-29\n\nFemale, age 10-19\n\nMale, age 10-19\n\nThe seventh new case is a 60-69 year old man from Brown County. His case was related to travel.\n\nNoem said the new cases in Beadle County were related to the existing cases. After initial conversations\n\n\"Beadle County could be in a community spread situation within a manner of days,\" she said.\n\nSaturday, March 21\n\nLatest data from state shows little change, unclear how many tests run\n\nThe latest coronavirus data from the South Dakota Department of Health showed little change Saturday.\n\nNo new positive COVID-19 test results were reported, leaving the number of confirmed cases at 14. It is unclear both how many pending tests were run since the latest results Friday and how many new tests have been received by the state in the same time period.\n\nThe number of negative cases saw a decrease, but that number no longer shows a clear picture of the state's results. Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said that commercial labs processing tests from South Dakota were not sending the number of negative results, only the positives.\n\nFriday, March 20\n\nNoem to Trump: State had to get 'pushy' for chemical to run coronavirus tests\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem expressed her frustration at not being able to get a chemical to process coronavirus tests to the president and his leadership team during a call with governors on Thursday.\n\nSouth Dakota’s backlog of unprocessed kits grew to 385 after the state ran out of reagents earlier this week. The state lab in Pierre, where the processing is done, was able to resume on Thursday after getting some of the processing chemical.\n\nOn the call with President Trump, Noem said the state had to get “a little pushy with a few people” in order to get the supplies. She questioned how the testing agents were being triaged by the Centers for Disease Control.\n\n“I just don’t want to not be a priority area because we’re a smaller state and less populated,” Noem said.\n\nTrump responded: “That will never happen to you, and it will never happen to your state.”\n\nSouth Dakota moves to cancel standardized testing amid coronavirus concerns\n\nSouth Dakota Secretary of Education Ben Jones is asking the federal Department of Education to cancel annual standardized tests for K-12 students.\n\nJones announced Friday that he'll be applying for a waiver with the department.\n\nThe waiver would allow the state to complete the school year without state assessments and standardized tests for third through eighth grade and 11th grade students.\n\nWith the school closures brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic, Jones said any testing done this year wouldn't provide useful data.\n\nNumbers unchanged from Thursday\n\nSouth Dakota reported no additional testing of COVID-19 Friday morning, a day after about 100 tests were completed after needed testing resources were delivered to the state.\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced on Thursday three additional presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. According to an update on the South Dakota Department of Health website, that number didn't change as of noon Friday because the state did an update Thursday night. The total reported positive cases in the state remained at 14.\n\nThe state announced on Wednesday that it had run out of supplies to test the samples collected from patients on Monday. The state lab resumed testing Thursday on what they called high-priority cases after receiving reagent, a substance or mixture used in chemical analysis or other reactions.\n\nSioux Falls officials plead with residents to practice 'social distancing' this weekend\n\nSioux Falls officials have an important message for residents heading into the weekend: Don't give up on practicing social distancing.\n\n\"I can't stress this enough,\" Sioux Falls Public Health Director Jill Franken said. \"With the weekend coming, continue to practice social distancing for the entire health of the community.\"\n\nEven though there has been no reported community spread, Franken said people need to remain diligent.\n\n\"We do not have a vaccine to protect people in our community,\" Franken said. \"Our only course of action is to follow recommended community mitigation efforts. ... Given that our cases have remained steady, what we are doing is working, but we can't get into a false sense of security because we don't have community spread yet.\"\n\nThursday, March 19\n\nThree more cases reported in state\n\nGov. Kristi Noem said the state tested 94 high-priority COVID-19 tests on Thursday. Three of those came back positive, all from Beadle County. The infectious disease team is working to determine if any of those cases indicate community spread.\n\nNone of those cases required hospitalization, Noem said. Ages ranged from 30 to 60, and the cases were two men and one woman, though more specific information wasn't available.\n\nThat brings the total number of positive tests to 14, with 663 negative and 270 pending.\n\nNoem says testing will resume today\n\nThe number of pending COVID-19 tests in South Dakota continues to rise after the state public health lab ran out of supplies to run the tests, though Governor Kristi Noem said some high-risk tests would be processed Thursday.\n\nThere are now 385 pending tests for the new coronavirus, according to the South Dakota Department of Health. No new deaths have been reported, and the number of positive cases remains at 11 and the number of negative cases remains at 551.\n\nTenHaken closing all non-essential city buildings\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken is closing the few city-owned buildings in Sioux Falls that remained open after the city's COVID-19 response already shut the majority of them down.\n\nTenHaken said during a morning news briefing Thursday the closure of the City Center administration building and City Hall, as governments across the country continue to respond to the novel coronavirus. The closures are effective as of noon on Thursday.\n\nScheduled public meetings will continue at Carnegie Town Hall, though that building will also be closed when those proceedings are not in session.\n\nSioux Falls police urge online crime reporting to limit officers' exposure to public\n\nSioux Falls police are modifying the way they respond to certain calls, by asking the public to file online reports when possible in an effort to limit officers' exposure to others in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSpokesman Sam Clemens said if someone wants to file a police report, and the suspect is present, to call police right away. For everything else, online reports are encouraged.\n\nAvera announces postponement of some elective surgeries\n\nAvera Health announced Thursday that it will suspend some of its elective surgeries amid concerns over coronavius response.\n\n“Our physicians are working to balance patient safety and quality with the resources available. These resources include protective equipment like gowns and masks and intensive care beds,” said Dr. Kevin Post, MD, Chief Medical Officer for Avera Medical Group. “We emphasize that we are looking to postpone procedures, rather than canceling them altogether.”\n\nThe decision comes as hospitals across the country ramp up for an expected wave of coronavirus patients.\n\nHow the state plans to move forward with COVID-19 testing\n\nState lab officials were relieved Wednesday to receive \"critical\" supplies to test a hundreds-deep backlog of COVID-19 kits, and they're looking ahead to get more testing capabilities.\n\nGov. Kristi Noem on Thursday announced that the state had received testing supplies and could begin testing the most critical samples immediately.\n\nThe state, Noem said, received a shipment of reagent a substance or mixture for use in chemical analysis or other reactions.\n\nIn statewide situation update conference calls Thursday morning, state public health lab leaders advised healthcare providers to send the lab samples from the most critical patients.\n\nWhitney: Will social distancing tear us apart? Not on your life.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 10, there was little indication that our world was changing forever.\n\nMy biggest concern was finding a parking spot to cover the Summit League women’s basketball finals at the Denny Sanford Premier Center, where nearly 8,000 fans turned out to watch South Dakota defeat South Dakota State for a berth in the NCAA tournament.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this is a magical time of year. March Madness is tipping off, spring break finds its footing, baseball is around the corner and outdoor wonders await. People are ready to expand their daily experience amid the lingering woes of winter.\n\nThat Tuesday night, I returned to watch the Summit League men’s finals with my son, greeting familiar faces in the concourse. As we took in the action, commenting on the players, there was no way to know that it would be the last stretch of normalcy we’d experience for a while.\n\nWednesday, March 18\n\nAirport taking hit as outgoing travel plummets\n\nTraffic at the Sioux Falls Regional Airport is down dramatically as travelers respond to coronavirus concerns, causing a significant drop in revenue.\n\nIncreasingly strict guidelines for travel and social gathering have already created what will be a lasting financial impact for Sioux Falls' airport and its airlines, which are likely just days away from announcing significant schedule reductions, said Dan Letellier, the airport's executive director.\n\nThe bulk of the decrease so far is a drop in outgoing travelers as people look to cancel their trips, though the Sioux Falls airport is still seeing travelers returning earlier from trips.\n\n\"The people you're seeing are those trying to get home,\" Letellier said.\n\nTenHaken urges businesses to adhere to 'no more than 10' gathering guidelines\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken says there are no plans to mandate the closure of bars or restaurants in Sioux Falls.\n\nTenHaken said he doesn't have the authority to do so, but he is strongly recommending that restaurants, bars and other businesses where people gather adhere \"religiously\" to the recommendation that no more than 10 people gather in one place at one time.\n\nSen. John Thune says coronavirus needs 'swift and bold response' from federal government\n\nU.S. Sen. John Thune said the federal government needs to restore confidence in the U.S. economy and provide a \"swift and bold response\" to the coronavirus.\n\nThe stock market's drop in recent weeks due to the coronavirus is \"very concerning,\" Thune said in a media call on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think what's important right now is to calm the markets and to restore the confidence, is to demonstrate that our leadership in this country understands what's at stake and is prepared to go big and go bold and take the decisive action that's necessary to restore confidence,\" Thune said.\n\nWhat you need to know about collecting unemployment amid COVID-19 fallout\n\nThe country's response to the novel coronavirus is expected to put thousands, if not millions, out of work, with those in the food service industry heavily affected.\n\nUndoubtedly, many South Dakotans will fall into that category. That's why various funds are being set up to help soften the blow of the economic fallout from forced quarantines and closures.\n\nFor those who find themselves left without a job entirely, the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation offers unemployment benefits for those who qualify.\n\nSouth Dakota's public health lab lacking COVID-19 test supplies\n\nThe South Dakota public health lab hasn't had the supplies needed to run COVID-19 tests since Monday, according to a state update.\n\nThe state didn't receive the supplies it needed and there isn't a time frame for when the supplies will be available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or commercial suppliers, according to an update emailed by state epidemiologist Josh Clayton. He noted that there's a nationwide shortage of the supplies needed to run the tests.\n\nTuesday, March 17\n\nS.D. will not have school next week, Noem says\n\nSouth Dakota schools will not be in session again next week, Gov. Kristi Noem announced Tuesday afternoon.\n\nNoem was in Sioux Falls this afternoon to meet with medical providers about COVID-19 after meeting with her Cabinet this morning.\n\n\"We will not be holding school next week in the state of South Dakota,\" Noem told reporters during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nCancelling school will give the state time to ensure adequate lab testing and supplies are in place for \"whatever may come our direction,\" the governor said.\n\nMayor wants $250K for 'One Sioux Falls' fund\n\nThe mayor's office is asking Sioux Falls City Councilors to set aside $250,000 for a new fund to help those who lose paychecks over COVID-19 quarantines and closures.\n\nAs proper safety guidelines change by the day, Sioux Falls businesses, owners and workers face uncertain times with financial hits as the only certainty. That's why a fund has been established to help people in Sioux Falls negatively impacted by the novel coronavirus and the quarantines in place.\n\nThe fund is set up in collaboration with the Sioux Falls Area Community Foundation, which will benefit residents in the greater Sioux Falls area and help avoid evictions and financial hardships if they are unable to work while closures and work restrictions last. It would also help them if they are unable to qualify for federal or state assistance.\n\nMinnehaha County reports new case, bringing state's total to 11\n\nOne positive COVID-19 case was reported in Minnehaha County on Tuesday, bringing the county's total to five cases.\n\nThe case was the only new positive case in South Dakota. The state as a total 11 positive COVID-19 cases and 551 negative tests as of Tuesday, according to the state Department of Health. The state had 35 pending cases on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe new case in Minnehaha County is a woman in her 50s, according to the health department.\n\nAvera, Sanford joining forces on coronavirus testing\n\nThe laboratories of Avera Health and Sanford Health will work together to begin processing coronavirus test results, the chief executive officers of the two regional health systems said Tuesday.\n\n“We’re made for this,” Avera CEO Bob Sutton said. “This is a calling we all have.”\n\nSanford CEO Kelby Krabbenhoft said the systems hope to be able to process hundreds of tests by the end of week to speed up results. The goal, he added, is to manage the disease as it works through the community.\n\n“It’s going to take its toll,” Krabbenhoft said. “It’s not going to be avoidable.”\n\nTesting is a key to monitoring and detecting the disease, and Avera Chief Medical Officer David Erickson said health officials want to do more. The two health entities working together can speed up getting those results to patients.\n\nSioux Falls to limit limit public gatherings at city-owned buildings to 10 people\n\nSioux Falls officials are asking the city council to limit the number of people who can gather at city-owned buildings at 10 people.\n\nThe Sioux Falls City Council will consider the regulations Tuesday night during its weekly meeting.\n\nThe new recommendation comes a day after the city proposed limiting public gatherings to 50 people. CDC and President Trump revised that guidance to 10 people Monday morning, and Sioux Falls is following suit.\n\nRestaurants and bars are not being forced to close, but Mayor Paul TenHaken says he is encouraging restaurants to offer delivery or drive-up service for food. He said bars and restaurants do not have to close, but they should limit how many people can be in the same proximity.\n\nHere's what we know about COVID-19 testing in state\n\nSouth Dakota now has COVID-19 tests for about 3,200 people after state officials said they requested more last week.\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health will continue to request additional testing supplies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as needed, according to department spokesman Derrick Haskins.\n\n\"This is a very rapidly evolving area of South Dakota's response to COVID-19,\" he said.\n\nSouth Dakota's public health lab in Pierre is still able to provide test results to the requesting medical provider on the same day that it's tested at the lab, according to Haskins. The CDC has stopped requiring states to send tests to the federal agency for confirmation and has also stopped requiring two tests per person. A nasal swab is now only taken for the test. The decrease in per-person tests means providers can conserve the specimen collection supplies, he said.\n\nMonday, March 16\n\nNoem confirms one death in S.D. related to COVID-19\n\nGov. Kristi Noem confirmed Monday that one death in South Dakota can be directly linked to the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe governor addressed media and the public Monday afternoon after the state saw one additional positive case bringing the total number of positive tests to 10. The state has 494 negative tests and none pending, as of noon Monday.\n\nShe said her heart goes out to the family during this difficult time. The person who died was a resident of Pennington County but had not been in that county for two weeks prior to his death. He was in Davison County at the time of his death. His death had previously been announced last week, but Noem said at the time it wasn't clear if the coronavirus was the direct cause of death.\n\nMeanwhile, the state lab had up until this point been able to get test results back to patients within 24 hours, but due to lack of supplies to run the tests, results may take up to 48 hours. High- and medium-risk tests will be prioritized, Noem said, and she expects the delayed test results to be a very short-term situation.\n\nPublic universities moving classes online\n\nBeginning March 23, all classes at all public universities in South Dakota will be moved online temporarily, according to a press release Monday from the South Dakota Board of Regents.\n\nOn-campus and in-person classes are currently scheduled to resume April 6, the release states.\n\nThe regents are expected to revisit the situation and communicate any potential additional changes March 27.\n\nWhat's next for Sioux Falls schools?\n\nSuperintendent Brian Maher said it's too early to tell what the next steps could be, but he answered as many questions as he could during a media briefing with the Mayor Paul TenHaken, and Sioux Falls Public Health officials Monday.\n\n\"Our chief role is the development of students,\" Maher said. \"Almost always that development is academic in nature, but our role has changed from an academic responsibility to a social responsibility. Part of that responsibility is closing down our schools this week, and then who knows. That may be the beginning of this interruption.\"\n\nClick here for what schools are doing.\n\nSDHSAA cancels spring high school sports through April 5\n\nThe spring sports season has been canceled through April 5 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to a South Dakota Activities Association memo to member schools obtained by the Argus Leader.\n\nPractice for spring sports/activities is a \"local decision,\" the email reads, with schools asked to make the decision based on CDC guidance, state entity guidance, local information, the number of participants involved, the nature of the activity and local control.\n\nAdditionally, state basketball tournaments remain \"suspended/postponed\" at this time, as do all-state band and region music contests.\n\nOne new coronavirus case reported in Minnehaha County\n\nOne new positive COVID-19 case was reported in South Dakota on Monday after a weekend of no new cases.\n\nThe new case is a man in his 20s in Minnehaha County, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThe new case brings the state to 10 positive COVID-19 cases. The number of negative tests is at 494, as of Monday.\n\nAll 10 cases resulted from travel out of state, the Department of Health said.\n\nSioux Falls planning to restrict gatherings to 50 people at city-owned buildings\n\nThe city of Sioux Falls is moving forward with a plan restricting public gatherings to 50 people or less in city-owned facilities based on CDC guidance.\n\nJill Franken, Public Health Director for the City of Sioux Falls, said the City Council will be discussing the plan to limit gatherings at city-owned facilities to 50 people at it's next city council meeting. The CDC guidance was for eight weeks, but it's unclear how long the restrictions will be for Sioux Falls.\n\nA state of emergency issued last week limited gatherings to 250 people at city-owned facilities.\n\nFranken is urging business owners and residents to also restrict gatherings to 50 people or less.\n\nAmerican Red Cross closes physical locations in South Dakota\n\nBoth chapters of the American Red Cross in South Dakota have closed their physical locations in response to the spread of the new coronavirus in the state.\n\nGretchen Hjelmstad, Regional Communications Officer and Marketing Director for the American Red Cross' Dakotas Region, said that non-essential staff will work remotely \"for the foreseeable future,\" but the organization will otherwise be operating as normal.\n\nNot many staff members work in the offices, Hjelmstad said, but the buildings can get a lot of foot traffic at times.\n\nAnyone in need of service should use the region's website or call the appropriate chapter's office number, Hjelmstad said. The 24/7 disaster hotline will also remain staffed.\n\nHere's what South Dakota daycares should be doing amid coronavirus concerns\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Social Services is urging childcare providers to take precautions to ensure the health and safety of children and families amid concerns about COVID-19.\n\nGov. Noem has asked the department to work closely with childcare providers across the state to institute commonsense practices to assist families in need, while also safeguarding the health of all South Dakotans.\n\nThose practices include:\n\nCovering coughs, staying home when sick and enhancing already required hand washing and sanitizing practices\n\nLimiting entry into the facility or home by putting into practice child drop off at the front door\n\nAssessing potential risk with staff and parents from travel to affected areas\n\nEnsuring that employees and children are not admitted when ill. Those showing signs of illness should be sent home and advised to call their primary healthcare provider for further screening and testing, if necessary\n\nReducing, postponing or cancelling events and gatherings, especially those involving large groups or exposure to the public\n\nUsing spring break or temporary closures while children are away to deep clean and disinfect the facilities, especially surfaces and items in high-touch areas. The CDC provides guidance regarding cleaning and disinfection\n\nImplementing regular deep-clean practices in addition to daily cleaning\n\nCoordinating with DSS licensing specialists, local public health officials and emergency management\n\nNoem working to activate business loan program amid coronavirus\n\nGov. Noem announced on Monday that she's working with the U.S. Small Business Administration to help South Dakota businesses affected by COVID-19.\n\nThe Governor's Office is working with the SBA to activate the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program in South Dakota to help eligible small businesses and nonprofits impacted by COVID-19, according to the announcement.\n\nAffected small businesses and nonprofits need to download, complete and submit the EIDL worksheet.

Kay Ivey on Tuesday extended a state health order that limits the number of people in restaurants and stores but didn’t follow other states that have issued new restrictions as the pandemic worsens. The Republican extended the state’s “safer at home order,” set to expire Friday, through the end of July. In a press conference at the Capitol, Ivey said she believed a statewide mask order would be unenforceable and was hesitant to issue new closure orders, saying that “you can’t have a life without a livelihood,” but pleaded with people to voluntarily wear masks and take other precautions. “Let me urge you, in the strongest manner I can, to incorporate COVID-19 precautions into your daily routine,” Ivey said. Health officials have expressed alarm about the state’s recent virus numbers. State Health Officer Scott Harris said the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive is at its highest point, at just under 11%.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The city’s fireworks show has been canceled after assembly members failed to agree on a masking requirement for spectators. The assembly previously agreed to allow the show, scheduled to begin Friday at 11:59 p.m. to celebrate Independence Day. But that vote was with the understanding the city would require attendees to wear masks, KTOO Public Media reports. A mask mandate required passage of an ordinance, and the assembly on Monday did not have the votes needed. The proposed ordinance said those who didn’t wear a mask while outside to watch the show would be subject to a $25 fine. The city released a statement Tuesday apologizing for any confusion after saying last week that the show would take place. Assembly member Maria Gladizewski voted last week to hold the fireworks show but voted against the mask order Monday, saying she’d changed her mind about encouraging the public to gather while the coronavirus remains a concern.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Hospitals are hiring out-of-state nurses, squeezing in more beds and preparing for the possibility of making life-and-death decisions about how to ration care as they get ready for an expected surge of coronavirus patients in one of the nation’s worst hot spots. Parents, teachers, businesses and their customers also are hunkering down for at least a month of new closures imposed by the state in a belated effort to slow the spread of the virus and limit overcrowding at hospitals. Arizona and several other states that were reopening their economies have clamped back down over the past week as they eclipsed records for infections and hospitalizations. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, however, went further than others by ordering gyms and movie theaters to close and postponing the start of school until mid-August. In another sign of upheaval, more cities are canceling Fourth of July fireworks shows, among them Peoria, Chandler and Marana.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor on Tuesday said the state will end the fiscal year with $360 million more than expected, allowing it to avoid budget cuts planned for public schools and higher education because of the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the state is revising its forecast for the fiscal year that ends Tuesday to $5.6 billion. The move means the state can restore $121 million in expected cuts to the public school fund and another $42.4 million to higher education, Hutchinson said. The move also means the state will be able to restore $72.2 million to the Medicaid Trust Fund, which had been reduced throughout the year. Hutchinson in March announced the state faced a $353 million shortfall because of the pandemic. The state has had at least 20,777 confirmed cases of the virus, and 270 people have died since the pandemic began in March.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalexico: A farming region on the state’s border with Mexico has sent hundreds of patients to hospitals outside the area, an official said Tuesday, as its leaders accepted Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recommendation to backpedal on reopening its battered economy. The Imperial County board of supervisors unveiled a plan late Monday that includes closing businesses deemed nonessential, except for curbside pickup, and shuttering county parks. The plan would take effect if approved by Newsom, who said Friday that the county should reverse itself on reopening. It comes as California grapples with increasing infections across the state. Imperial, with a population of about 180,000, has had about 6,200 cases among 30,700 tested, a positive rate of about 20%. Health experts largely agree cross-border traffic with Mexicali is at least partly to blame for a surge since the middle of May.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state will rein in previously set rules for bars and nightlife because of the potential for spreading coronavirus, Gov. Jared Polis said at a news conference Tuesday. “We simply aren’t ready to safely have the level of mixing and socializing that is inherent in a bar and nightclub environment,” Polis said. After speaking with the governors of Texas and Arizona, which have seen spikes in new cases, Polis said they believe bars and nightclubs have been major sources of outbreaks, especially among young people. “They wish that they had been able to act earlier and had the foresight. And we’re gonna learn from this,” Polis said. Previous rules announced June 18 under the state’s “Protect Our Neighbors” program allowed for reduced capacity at 25% or 50 people. Under the new modifications, bars will be closed for in-person service. But those with dining options may continue to serve customers and sell takeout alcohol.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state plans to expand a year-round employment program for youths to include opportunities in the COVID-19 age, including work as social distancing ambassadors and promoters of safer health practices. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Tuesday that he has authorized releasing $2 million from federal coronavirus relief funds to broaden the Connecticut Youth Employment Program to include employment with community-based agencies throughout the state. The funding will be added to the $4.5 million the state previously allocated for the program, for a total of $7.1 million this year. Some of the job opportunities will include virtual outreach through social media to promote safer health practices; delivering educational materials to community and other organizations; providing help to homebound families; and reaching out to young people and acting as social distancing ambassadors.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Gov. John Carney announced Tuesday afternoon that bars in beach towns will be ordered to close Friday ahead of the holiday weekend, as the state has seen a spike in COVID-19 cases in the area. Customers will no longer be able to sit or stand at a bar, according to the new guidance. Instead, beachgoers will have to sit at a table and be served by a server. This will affect taprooms and bar service in Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach, Long Neck, Bethany Beach, South Bethany, Fenwick Island, West Fenwick Island, Ocean View and Millville, according to the order, which begins at 8 a.m. Friday and lasts indefinitely. Restaurants will need to close their bar service and continue to follow phase two guidelines. The city of Rehoboth Beach announced Tuesday that it will require people over age 12 to wear a face covering in all public places. Face coverings are not required when in the ocean.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Donald Trump’s July Fourth celebration on the National Mall will feature one of the largest fireworks displays ever, and as many as 300,000 face masks will be given away to those who want them – but despite health concerns from D.C.’s mayor, no one apparently will be required to wear them. Trump made no mention of the masks or of the pandemic overall in a tweet Wednesday on his Independence Day pIans. He thanked corporate donors for supporting “what will, without question, be a special evening.” Interior Secretary David Bernhardt outlined a second year of military-focused events in the nation’s capital on July Fourth, including Defense Department flyovers for a “one-of-a-kind air show.” “President Trump’s 2020 Salute to America will be a patriotic tribute to our men and women in uniform,” Bernhardt said in a statement. A mile-long firing of 10,000 fireworks will be “the largest in recent memory,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: As the state enters the height of summer tourist season, its largest cities and counties are closing beaches, mandating masks and halting business reopenings, hoping the measures will slow a steep resurgence of coronavirus cases. But an epidemiologist and medical professor at the University of Florida is warning that things are likely to get worse before they get better. “Any time you have these reopenings, you’re depending on people do to the right things, to follow the rules. I think that’s where the weak spots come in,” Dr. Cindy Prins said. “We’re a couple of weeks late to the game of really being able to get this under control.” New confirmed cases have spiked significantly over the past week. Florida’s health department reported more than 6,012 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday. More than 8,000 new cases were tallied each of three days late last week. The state now has more than 152,434 confirmed cases and more than 3,500 deaths.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp says he has not yet weighed whether the state will take legal action against local governments that try to impose mask requirements, as Georgia faces a spike in confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. The Republican held a news conference Wednesday before departing on a statewide tour to promote wearing a mask but said he will not mandate it. At the same time Kemp spoke, Savannah became one of the first cities in the state to require people to wear a mask inside public places or face a fine. “I wouldn’t be able to speak to any state action because I haven’t had time to discuss the matter with our legal team,” Kemp said. “But regardless of what legal action may or may not happen, we shouldn’t get to that. … We shouldn’t need a mask mandate for people to do the right thing.” A series of executive orders from Kemp has barred local governments from setting coronavirus restrictions that go beyond those imposed by the state.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A legislative committee has approved a bill to allow state land to be used for emergency homeless camps during the coronavirus pandemic. The bill passed by House Finance Committee members Monday would allow month-to-month revocable permits to be used for temporary shelters to accommodate people experiencing homelessness, West Hawaii Today reports. Scott Morshige, homelessness coordinator for Democratic Gov. David Ige, said there is concern about community and privately supported camps on public land without authorization that may not have access to basic hygiene or present other hazards like location in a flood zone. The measure would provide a mechanism for the state to temporarily regulate encampments while the virus outbreak continues, Morshige said. The bill, which passed the House Committee on Housing last week, will move to the House floor for a vote.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two federal court rulings involving the state’s ballot initiative process are “judicial activism,” Republican Gov. Brad Little said, and he has appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. State officials late Tuesday appealed an order from earlier in the day forcing the state to allow online signatures that could put an education funding initiative on the November ballot. The order means Idaho would have to extend signature gathering about seven weeks and allow electronic signatures – something the state has never before allowed for ballot initiatives. The filing also appeals an order from last week that went against the state’s request to throw out the lawsuit. Reclaim Idaho, a group that backs citizen initiatives, in the lawsuit filed last month said that Little’s statewide stay-at-home order in late March due to the coronavirus pandemic didn’t include exceptions for ballot initiative signature gathering.\n\nIllinois\n\nQuincy: Providers of fast money, pawn shops throughout the region have taken on an enhanced profile in an economy turned upside down by the coronavirus. “We were an essential business because we have loans,” Mike Pigg, owner Mike’s Jewelry and Loan, told the Herald-Whig newspaper. But instead of being busy providing loans, Pigg and West Quincy Pawn Shop owner Lionel Hammond said the shops have been swamped with customers coming in buying guns, jewelry, electronics and other goods. “Right now, we are still seeing people coming in with their stimulus checks, and they are in a buying mood. Never in all of my years have I seen anything like this,” Hammond said. “This is the time of the year that people borrow money because they are going to go and do fun things, take vacations, weekend trips or just do something fun with their family. Because of the pandemic and not being able to work, many people are not going to do those fun things.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A newly assembled coalition has been tapped to help downtown Indianapolis recover from the recession caused by the coronavirus crisis and increase the number of Black-owned businesses in and around the Mile Square. The Downtown Indy Rebuilding and Recovery Committee comprises nearly two dozen entrepreneurs, executives, and government, community and religious stakeholders who will devise ways to generate economic sustainability and inclusive community support. More people could be added to the committee at a later date. The committee will begin meeting the week of July 13. It will eventually draft a blueprint for downtown’s economic recovery that builds upon existing conversations about affordability, safety and security, homelessness and livability. Its immediate focus, according to a statement, will be building consumer confidence and enticing equitable investment downtown.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The state’s executive branch is getting a grim gift from a company that has long made garments for meatpacking workers: a free supply of 500 body bags. Dickson Industries is donating the body bags as the state prepares for a worst-case scenario in which the coronavirus or another health emergency would overwhelm hospitals and medical examiners. The Des Moines-based company makes garments and products for the food processing, medical and other industries, including coats and insulated jackets for meatpacking workers. Like the 500 ventilators the state is purchasing, the body bags will be kept in a state stockpile “to support possible medical surge operations within the state,” Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management spokesman John Benson said. In that event, state officials would move resources to locations with high volumes of patients.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Gov. Laura Kelly’s planned order requiring residents to wear masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus could be toothless in many parts of the state because counties can exempt themselves, and even those that don’t might not enforce it. Officials in some counties already were signaling Tuesday that they planned to opt out of Kelly’s mandate. The order, which Kelly is expected to issue Thursday ahead of it taking effect Friday, was to make masks mandatory in stores, restaurants and in any situation where social distancing of 6 feet cannot be maintained, including outside. In Sedgwick County, home to Wichita, County Commissioner Jim Howell said he has been inundated with emails since Kelly announced the mask requirement Monday. “In our state we love our freedom,” Howell said. “In practice we can encourage and educate. And then we have to trust them to make the best decision for themselves and their family.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Looking to end a backlog of unemployment claims filed this spring, Gov. Andy Beshear said the state has hired an outside company to shore up staffing to process the requests for assistance. The goal is to process all unresolved jobless claims pending from March through May by the end of July, the governor said Tuesday in announcing the contract with Ernst & Young. About 56,000 initial claims from March, April and May haven’t been processed, he said. “The purpose is to get us caught up and get us caught up quickly,” Beshear said. The plight of Kentuckians still in limbo in seeking unemployment benefits has become a political headache for the Democratic governor, who has drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers. House GOP leaders recently said the backlog was a “massive failure of leadership” by Beshear’s administration, leaving people who have gone months without a paycheck as “collateral damage.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In their special session that ended Tuesday, state lawmakers agreed to expand and extend business tax credits, exemptions and incentive programs, bills that were pitched as a coronavirus recovery tactic and are estimated to siphon millions from the treasury each year. Supporters said the measures would help businesses struggling with closures and restrictions mandated by Gov. John Bel Edwards in response to the virus outbreak. “We have to take care of the businesses that employ people that provides them the income to be able to move forward,” said Sen. Barry Milligan, a Republican from Shreveport. “The more businesses we lose, the more paychecks we lose, the more of our tax base we lose.” Critics said the approach was haphazard, involved too little study and could worsen the state’s budget problems from the virus.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The University of Maine System has adopted a set of principles to guide campuses in welcoming back students Aug. 31, officials said Wednesday. The UMS chancellor, seven campus presidents and the dean of Maine Law adopted the principles that call for screening strategies to identify and isolate infections. Students will complete the final two weeks of the semester at home after the Thanksgiving break. The announcement came on the day the state began its third phase of reopening, including movie theaters, bowling alleys and other venues. Bars, tasting rooms and breweries, however, will not be allowed to reopen for indoor service, and a 50-person limit remains on shared spaces. Meanwhile, the state’s hospitality industry could lose one-third of its revenue and shed tens of thousands of jobs this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, University of Maine economists said in a report issued Tuesday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan has outlined $190 million in federal COVID-19 relief for small businesses, higher education and nonprofit organizations. Hogan announced Tuesday that $45 million will be allocated to expand a program to help small businesses. It awards grants of up to $10,000 to businesses of 50 or fewer employees. The Hogan administration says the program already has provided more than $40 million to 4,073 applicants. Another $5 million will be allocated to the Maryland Small Business Development Financing Authority to provide financing to businesses owned by economically and socially disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Another $50 million will create the Maryland Nonprofit Recovery Initiative to help organizations address revenue reductions and expenses. Up to $90 million will be used to reimburse state-supported universities for expenses related to COVID-19.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Travelers from seven nearby states that have worked to curb the spread of the coronavirus will no longer be told to self-quarantine for 14 days when arriving in Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Tuesday. The new rules apply to visitors from Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, New York and New Jersey. Workers designated by the federal government as essential critical infrastructure workers are also exempt. “These surrounding states, like Massachusetts, are seeing a significant decline in cases and new hospitalizations,” Baker said. Meanwhile, the 2020 Big E, a multistate fair in Massachusetts that drew more than 1.6 million visitors last year, has been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers announced Monday. The event was scheduled for Sept. 18 through Oct. 4 in West Springfield.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The governor unveiled her plans Tuesday to return students to the classroom this fall for the first time since schools were closed in March in favor of remote learning to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Safe Start plan requires districts to make safety plans in preparation for the upcoming school year and includes $256 million from the state to support those efforts, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told reporters in Lansing. The plan lays out requirements and makes recommendations for districts to follow. Different stages are tied to Whitmer’s six-phase regional approach to economically reopening the state. School district plans should show how students, teachers and staff will be protected from the virus under each of those phases. “Getting back to classroom learning and remaining in school buildings will require us to make changes to how school usually looks,” said Whitmer, a Democrat.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The University of Minnesota said Tuesday that seven athletes from “multiple sports” have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Gopher Athletics Department conducted 170 COVID-19 tests during June, and seven athletes tested positive. The school said students who test positive are entered into a protocol and asked to self-isolate. Those students will have access to all necessary resources and food and will be in daily communication with the university’s athletic medical staff. Those students will have to undergo additional testing and screening before they can participate in team activities. A team physician also must clear the student. The university said contact tracing was conducted, and any person who was potentially exposed was asked to quarantine to help prevent spread of the virus.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The mayor has mandated the wearing of face masks in the city, making it a requirement in all public places whether indoors or outdoors. Those who don’t abide by the new policy will face a possible fine of $300, and businesses could be shut down. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba stood with members of the city’s Coronavirus Task Force to explain the new measures at a press briefing Tuesday. The order goes in effect Thursday. Most who took the podium said the new order was “not punitive” but rather in response to a record week of new coronavirus cases that don’t appear to be slowing down. While the new order is in effect for all residents, the mayor said the city is looking primarily at businesses who have allowed face masks to be optional in areas where social distancing is difficult or impossible. The potential punishment for these businesses if owners don’t follow the order could be a 24-hour shutdown by the city.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state reached a grim new milestone in its battle with the coronavirus Tuesday, surpassing 1,000 deaths amid a resurgence of the disease that has seen cases skyrocket in recent weeks. “That’s 1,000 people that lost their lives due to COVID-19,” Gov. Mike Parson said. “I think we all need to remember that.” The state health department raised the death toll by 17, to 1,015, and added more than 500 confirmed cases to the statewide tally, raising it to 21,551 since the pandemic started. The number of confirmed cases has quickly increased since the state reopened for business June 16, swelling by 10.9% in just the past seven days, health officials said. There are no statewide rules on social distancing in place in Missouri. Still, health department Director Randall Williams urged people to continue hand-washing and social distancing or wearing masks, especially for July Fourth.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State officials reported another 50 cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, pushing the state’s total over the 1,000 mark. The new cases, including 15 in Yellowstone County, were confirmed from more than 2,400 tests. Fourteen people are hospitalized, and 22 people have died. Montana has reported 155 cases in the past three days, compared to 61 in the three days before that, state officials said. The state reported 498 cases of COVID-19 in June compared to 66 in May. Montana entered the second phase of reopening June 1, eliminating the 14-day quarantine mandate for out-of-state travelers and allowing groups of up to 50 people to meet. In a statement, Gov. Steve Bullock urged people to wear masks and take other precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus. He noted Montana still has the lowest per capita positive cases and deaths in the country but said it is evident people have let their guard down.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: The Nebraska State Fair is still a go but will be scaled back considerably to protect people from the coronavirus, organizers said Tuesday. The fair’s board approved a slimmed-down schedule for this year’s event, which is scheduled from Aug. 28 through Sept. 7. Executive Director Bill Ogg said the first weekend of the fair will feature 4-H events, while the second weekend would offer FFA events. Other activities such as the Raising Nebraska Experience and Nebraska Game and Parks Display will be available during the week in between. Fair officials said they may add other events if the fair nears. That could include the regular carnival, motor sports and other events if public health restrictions are relaxed. All large concerts have been canceled. Fairgoers won’t have to pay an admission fee this year. The fair is in Grand Island, one of the areas of the state hit hardest by the coronavirus.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state isn’t doing as many coronavirus tests as some health researchers would like, but state officials remain “comfortable and confident” they can meet testing benchmarks put forward by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies. A Tuesday report from NPR found Nevada, like most other states, wasn’t doing enough testing to subdue or even suppress the virus. The report, based on research from the Harvard Global Health Institute, said the Silver State needs to nearly quadruple its average weekly testing numbers to defeat the deadly disease. COVID-19 Response Director Caleb Cage said officials are making progress toward several government-recommended testing metrics but did not directly answer questions about whether the state had reopened too early without conducting enough tests.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state will begin resuming jury trials in August with a pilot program in Cheshire County months after putting them on hold because of the coronavirus. A committee of judges, clerks and judicial system staff has been meeting weekly since March to develop guidelines to balance the right to a trial with efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The detailed instructions will be implemented for the first time in late July to convene a jury in Cheshire County, with the first trial planned for mid-August. Meanwhile, state workers who keep Hampton Beach clean are getting a temporary pay raise because of the coronavirus. An emergency order issued by Gov. Chris Sununu calls for an increase of $3 per hour for state parks and recreation workers whose duties include restroom cleaning and trash disposal at Hampton Beach State Park. The increase is retroactive to June 19 and expires Oct. 23.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Workers who exhausted unemployment benefits are now eligible for 20 additional weeks of state unemployment starting this week, the state Labor Department announced Wednesday. Previously, workers would run out after 39 weeks. The expansion was announced the same day the state’s work leave programs began offering more benefits as the result of a 2019 law. Changes effective Wednesday include increasing weekly payment amounts and doubling to 12 weeks the amount of time workers can collect family leave benefits. Workers do not need to reapply or talk to an agent to receive the expanded unemployment benefits. They will be enrolled automatically, the labor department said. “New Jersey went from being at almost full employment last winter to double-digit unemployment almost overnight,” Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo said. “These triggers are put in place for just such eventualities.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state has passed the 12,000 mark. State health officials on Tuesday reported an additional 168 cases, raising the toll since the outbreak began to 12,147. They also reported four additional deaths, bringing the total of people in New Mexico who are known to have died from the coronavirus to 497. Department of Health officials said 36 of the 168 additional COVID-19 cases were reported in Bernalillo County, the state’s most populous that includes the Albuquerque metro area. They also said 5,393 people in New Mexico who had COVID-19 have recovered.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday that he was delaying the planned resumption of indoor dining at restaurants in the city out of fear it would cause a spike in coronavirus infections. The mayor, a Democrat, said he was concerned that if the city welcomed diners back into the enclosed spaces of its restaurants, it might experience the same surge in illness now being seen in other states. Outdoor dining at restaurants, which started about two weeks ago, can continue, de Blasio said. He said 6,600 restaurants in the city have applied for permits to serve patrons outdoors, and he expects more to follow suit. “Outdoor dining unquestionably has been a great hit,” the mayor said. “And I think the bottom line is that outdoors is working, period. This is one of the things we’ve learned. Outdoors is where we need to be to the maximum extent possible this summer as we fight back this disease.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFort Bragg: The U.S. Army has quarantined 90 soldiers and instructors who tested positive for the coronavirus during a survival course at Fort Bragg. A total of 110 people participated in the course, which was cut short after a single soldier tested positive. Subsequent tests then showed that 82 students and eight instructors had COVID-19, Army spokeswoman Janice Burton said Wednesday. Now all 110 are quarantined, although the 20 people who did not test positive were separated from the rest, she said. Their course, called Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape, is naturally isolated from Fort Bragg’s other special warfare courses, the Army said. Guidelines were implemented at Fort Bragg to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and some classes were shifted online. Portions of classes that could not be taught online were closely monitored. Students taking the survival course were tested prior to training and received daily welfare checks.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: While the state’s most populous city and COVID-19 hot spot is making progress in controlling spread of the coronavirus, a litmus test awaits with the July Fourth holiday, the mayor said. Many residents in Cass County, where Fargo is located, spend the holiday congregating in the lakes country of northwestern Minnesota. Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said social distancing and other prevention practices could be a challenge. “We are heading in the right direction, with the occasional hump here and there,” Mahoney said, referring to active cases in the county. “Everybody is a little nervous now as more and more people are getting out and about. We’ll find some things out after the Fourth.” The message from Mahoney, a doctor, is the same as most other leaders around the country: Wear a mask. “I get a little flustered sometimes to be in public places and people are not wearing masks,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of confirmed and probable coronavirus cases reported to the Ohio Health Department has risen slightly, while the number of reported deaths sharply increased, officials said Tuesday. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said the increase in the number of cases reported Tuesday can’t be explained simply by an increase in testing. Ohio now has nearly 52,000 confirmed and probable cases, with a one-day reported increase of 743 compared to 737 on Monday. Results typically reflect tests conducted in the past 36 hours but could involve people showing symptoms for up to two weeks. The Health Department reported a one-day spike of 45 deaths, more than twice the 21-day average of 21 daily deaths. DeWine has pleaded with Ohioans to continue diligently with hand-washing, socially distancing and mask wearing. Some of the strongest opposition has come from DeWine’s own party.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials in the state on Wednesday reported 355 more confirmed coronavirus cases and two additional deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the illness. There are at least 14,112 cases and 389 deaths statewide, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, up from 13,757 cases and 387 deaths reported Tuesday. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher, but many people haven’t been tested, and some who get the disease don’t show symptoms. The health department reported that there are 374 people hospitalized either with the illness or under investigation for it, an increase from 315 hospitalizations Tuesday. The state says 10,605 people have recovered.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown has extended the COVID-19 state of emergency for 60 days. She said as of Tuesday there had been more than 8,600 coronavirus cases in the state, with over a quarter of those cases identified in the past two weeks. The Oregon Health Authority said Tuesday that 207 people in Oregon have died from the disease. “In the months since those first cases were discovered, we have shored up our supplies of personal protective equipment, worked with counties to hire contact tracers, and – despite the failures of the federal government to supply Oregon with an equitable amount of testing materials – we have expanded our statewide testing capability,” she said. She said the choices made by individual Oregonians, especially this weekend, will decide whether the state flattens the curve of new infections or sees a spike that could overwhelm hospital capacity in the next month.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Federal emergency aid for renters hit hard financially during the pandemic is still in the pipeline as Gov. Tom Wolf’s ban on foreclosures and evictions nears an expiration. The application period for aid begins Monday to the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency. Five days later, Wolf’s moratorium expires. Robin Wiessman, the agency’s CEO, said Wednesday that it will take a few days to verify the information that must be submitted to qualify for aid. Wolf and state lawmakers are devoting at least $150 million in federal coronavirus emergency relief money for rental assistance of $750 per month for up to six months. Assistance is contingent on the renter losing their job after March 1 or seeing their income drop by at least 30% due to the pandemic. Landlords can apply as well.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The mayor has announced $1 million in rental assistance and legal aid for families struggling to pay their rent amid the coronavirus pandemic that has caused massive job losses. “Even before COVID, we knew people were having trouble living here in the city,” Mayor Jorge Elorza said in a virtual news conference Tuesday. The initiative funded with federal stimulus money is a collaboration among the city, Crossroads Rhode Island, Rhode Island Legal Services and the Rhode Island Center for Justice. It was announced the day before the state’s moratorium on eviction proceedings related to the pandemic is expected to lift. About 49% of Providence renters put more than one-third of their income toward housing, according to the city’s statistics. The city has also been one of the hardest-hit communities by the pandemic in the state. The assistance will be prioritized based on need, said Jennifer Wood, executive director of the Center for Justice.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Prisma Health, the state’s largest health care system, warned Wednesday that the coronavirus surge in South Carolina is now leading to more younger patients being treated in its hospitals and that the number of COVID-19 patients Prisma is treating has more than tripled in the past month. Prisma hospitals in the Upstate and the Midlands have gone from treating 65 patients May 28 to treating 204 patients June 30, said Dr. Scott Sasser, incident commander for Prisma Health’s COVID-19 response. Of those, the number of younger patients being hospitalized has more than doubled from 4.1% to 11.2% of all hospitalized patients within Prisma’s system, Sasser said. The upward trend in younger people hospitalized matches a trend upward among younger people testing positive overall, Sasser said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said despite health experts’ concerns about a large gathering amid the coronavirus pandemic, people will “not be social distancing” during Friday’s celebration at Mount Rushmore that will be attended by President Donald Trump. In an interview with the Republican governor Monday, Fox News host Laura Ingraham decried the cancellation of other Independence Day celebrations and asked Noem for her response to those citing health concerns “as the reason to cancel all of these patriotic displays?” “You know Laura, in South Dakota, we’ve told people to focus on personal responsibility. Every one of them has the opportunity to make a decision that they’re comfortable with. So we will be having celebrations of American independence,” Noem said. “We told those folks that have concerns that they can stay home. But those who want to come and join us, we’ll be giving out free face masks, if they choose to wear one. But we won’t be social distancing.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nearly 800 child care agencies in the state have received grants to help them stay afloat during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a news release from ChildcareTennessee. That group and the Tennessee Department of Human Services have worked together to ensure kids will still have child care to return to as Tennessee gradually begins reopening. The agencies have distributed COVID-19 Loss of Income Grants to 799 child care agencies across 70 counties in Tennessee, according to the release. Grants for up to 60 days of lost income are still available, including retroactively back to March. There are also grant opportunities to support agencies experiencing reduced attendance and increased operating costs due to the pandemic. Licensed child care agencies interested in applying for the grants should visit www.childcaretennessee.com.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: As confirmed coronavirus case levels in the state continue surging to record highs, Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick says the nation’s top infectious disease expert “doesn’t know what he’s talking about” in saying some states are reopening too quickly. He also claimed without offering evidence that Dr. Anthony Fauci “has been wrong every time on every issue” during an interview Tuesday night on Fox News. Hours earlier, Texas reported that new infections skyrocketed to a single-day high of nearly 7,000 new cases and that hospitalizations continued soaring. Patrick, who chairs President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign in Texas, is a conservative firebrand who has staunchly defended Texas’ reopening that was among the fastest in the nation. He drew national attention in March for saying that people over the age of 70, who the Centers for Disease Control says are at higher risk for severe illness from the coronavirus, will “take care of ourselves.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The coronavirus outbreak has disproportionately affected Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians living in Utah, state data indicates. The groups make up 1.6% of Utah’s population but account for 3.8% of reported cases of COVID-19, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. State analysis indicates Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians have experienced the highest hospitalization rate among ethnic groups in Utah of 124.7 per 1,000 cases. The groups also have the second-highest rate of confirmed cases, behind Hispanic residents.Jacob Fitisemanu Jr., co-founder of the Utah Pacific Islander Health Coalition, said some of the reasons why the Pacific Islander and Native Hawaiian communities have been so hard hit are not unique to them. Fitisemanu said among the groups are many people in essential jobs who are not able to work from home or practice social distancing during the pandemic.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is set to begin a campaign to encourage people to wear masks to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, Gov. Phil Scott said Wednesday. The governor said the goal of the program is to get people in Vermont to wear masks willingly. In other parts of the country, efforts to require masks have not always been successful, and those efforts have caused friction between people. “I would rather educate, lead and inspire people to do the right thing,” the governor said during his regular virus briefing. “Right now this is a good thing to do when you can, when you can’t physically distance yourself from someone else.” Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said the program is beginning now and will accelerate in the coming days and include social media, signs and paid messages. “We’ll have Vermonters talking to Vermonters about why they think it’s important to wear a mask,” Smith said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam is taking a late step to keep people from gathering at bars as the state prepares to enter Phase 3 of its reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic. The governor said the state’s restaurants will not be allowed to fully reopen their bars as previously planned. He announced the decision Tuesday afternoon, a day before the state was set to allow people to congregate at bars as long as they practiced social distancing. Instead, restaurants can continue to operate under Phase 2 restrictions, which allow limited table service in bar areas but generally prohibit sitting at bar counters. Virginia does not allow establishments to serve only alcohol; they all must serve food. Northam’s office said the decision to keep stricter rules on bars was made because of a spike in virus cases in other states that have reopened earlier than Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nPasco: Gov. Jay Inslee was heckled and had to cut short his speech Tuesday on battling the coronavirus pandemic in Eastern Washington. Speaking outdoors at Columbia Basin College in Pasco, Inslee was repeatedly interrupted by hecklers as he urged residents to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus. “Open it up,” one heckler shouted in an apparent reference to widespread business closures in the Tri-Cities of Richland, Pasco and Kennewick. The community is still in Stage I of the pandemic, which is largely a shutdown. The heckling continued as a masked Inslee spoke. Finally the Democratic governor, who used to represent the Tri-Cities in the U.S. House, had had enough. “We’re going to go inside,” he said. The Tri-Cities, in southeastern Washington, is one of the state’s COVID-19 hot spots. Inslee recently ordered that state residents must wear masks when in public, and that has drawn intense criticism from some people.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: The West Virginia University Health System has temporarily reopened portions of a hospital shut down by its former owner. WVU Medicine held a ceremony Tuesday at Fairmont Medical Center, news outlets report. The hospital will be WVU Medicine’s temporary home in Marion County until it constructs another facility a couple of miles away within a few years. Fairmont Medical Center will serve as an emergency department with 12 emergency beds and 10 inpatient beds. The WVU Health System operates more than a dozen hospitals and is the state’s largest health system. Former owner Alecto Healthcare closed the medical center in March, saying it had lost $19 million over three years and could not find a suitable buyer. At the time the hospital had more than 600 employees. Alecto also closed hospitals last year in Wheeling, West Virginia, and Martins Ferry, Ohio.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Public health officials are closing indoor service at bars in Madison as the Fourth of July weekend approaches and as the number of reported coronavirus cases accelerate, many involving young people in Wisconsin’s largest college community. The order from Public Health Madison & Dane County effective Thursday allows bars that have patios to keep them open, and it limits the number of people who may eat inside restaurants to 25% capacity. Since June 13, 614 people have tested positive for coronavirus, and half of them were between the ages of 18 and 29. “For the past week, Dane County has seen a sustained, high number of cases. After consultation with our contact tracing team, gatherings and visits to bars and restaurants continue to be implicated in interviews with cases,” Janel Heinrich, the agency’s director, said in a statement. Bar owners are weighing a legal challenge.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Health officials in a northwestern Wyoming county busy with visitors to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks want to require people to wear masks indoors to limit spread of the coronavirus. A rise in reported cases prompted Teton County Health Officer Dr. Travis Riddell to announce Tuesday that he will seek permission from state officials to impose the local order. The order would also require people to wear masks while waiting in lines outdoors. Exceptions indoors would include instances when mask-wearing is impractical, such as while eating at a restaurant. It wasn’t clear when State Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist might approve the request. Such reviews typically occur quickly, Wyoming Department of Health spokeswoman Kim Deti said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/wellness/health/2020/03/03/coronavirus-what-know-covid-19-kentucky/4939264002/", "title": "Kentucky coronavirus updates: State's COVID-19 cases exceeds 1,900", "text": "Louisville Courier Journal\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Kentucky is up to 2,291 confirmed cases of COVID-19, Kentucky Gov.

Mike DeWine and Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, both Republicans.\n\nIn Indiana, Holcomb stressed that he’d make the decision to end the stay-at-home order based on what’s happening throughout the state. But he also indicated he’s thinking about the decision regionally and expects more clarity on a timeline within the next week or so.\n\n“It’s been shown that the Great Lakes region has done a fairly good job of mitigating our connections and our travel,” he said at his daily news conference Tuesday, “and that’s had a significant positive impact, unlike in some other places.

For the first time, though, Kentucky had two drive-thru testing sites up, with the second being in Kenton County. The Kenton County site opened Wednesday and tested 201 people, Beshear said.\n\n\"And there are significant signups going all the way through (Kenton County) for days so I believe that partnership is going well,\" Beshear said.\n\nThe state plans to open more drive-thru testing sites, with the hopes of announcing two new locations on Thursday.\n\nKentucky partnership to test health workers for COVID-19 immunity\n\nBeshear announced on Wednesday a new partnership to test health care workers to see if they've built up immunity to the coronavirus.\n\nThe partnership is between the state, Louisville Metro Government, Christina Lee Brown Environmental Institute and the University of Louisville. It is meant to test front line health care workers for immunity, which may also open up more plasman donors, Beshear said.\n\nClick here to read more.\n\nLatest update for Jefferson County COVID-19 cases\n\nJefferson County is now up to 687 positive cases of the coronavirus, an increase of 84 from Tuesday's press conference, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced. The county also saw six additional deaths, pushing the total to 55.\n\nThe people who died include a 65-year-old male, 68-year-old female, 81-year-old female, 88-year-old female, 89-year-old female and a 93-year old female.\n\nCOVID-19 deaths for Louisville African Americans dramatically increase\n\nAfrican Americans now make up more than one-third of COVID-19 deaths in Louisville, according to data released by Fischer on Wednesday.\n\nThe new statistics show an alarming jump since the first time Fischer revealed the figures to The Courier Journal earlier this month.\n\nWith 81% of the demographical data accounted for, black residents make up 31% of the city's coronavirus patients while making up 34% of the deaths. That is up significantly compared to last week when the mayor's office showed about 27% of the positive cases and 20% of the deaths were African Americans.\n\nBlack people make up 23.5% of the city's population in 2019, according to U.S. Census data.

The city announced the hires Tuesday, but Washington and Card started in their new roles earlier this month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing restrictions that would hinder plans for a copper and gold mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, the latest in a long-running dispute over efforts by developers to advance a mine in a region known for its salmon runs. The EPA said the proposal would bar discharges of dredged or fill material into the waters of the U.S. within the mine site footprint proposed by the developer, the Pebble Limited Partnership. The federal agency said it took into account information that has become available since it previously proposed restricting development in 2014, including new scientific analyses and a mine plan from the Pebble partnership that was submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of a permit application.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Arizona’s clemency board has declined to recommend to Gov. Doug Ducey that the death sentence of a man convicted in the 1984 kidnapping and killing of an 8-year-old girl be reduced to a lesser punishment, rejecting his claims that he is innocent of the crimes. The decision by the Arizona Board of Executive Clemency on Tuesday at the state prison in Florence marked one of the last steps before Frank Atwood’s execution in the 1984 killing of Vicki Hoskinson. Atwood is scheduled to be executed June 8 with an injection of pentobarbital.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Voters approved two continued sales tax increases that will support the fire, parks and police departments, and consent decree projects.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBakersfield: Some residents are concerned about potential explosions after a state agency found six idle oil wells near homes were leaking methane in the past several days. State and regional inspectors found concentrations of methane in the air around some of the wells at levels considered potentially explosive and environmental activists in the region are worried other chemicals might also be leaking from the wells that could pose a threat to public health. Uduak-Joe Ntuk, head of the California Geologic Energy Management division of the California Department of Conservation, the agency that oversees wells and confirmed they were leaking, said in a statement the leaks were “minor in nature and do not pose an immediate threat to public health or safety.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two wildfires burning in southern and western Colorado have been fully contained. A fire that burned more than 1,500 acres near the former mining town of Cripple Creek was fully contained Tuesday, nearly two weeks after it started, the Teller County Sheriff’s Office said.

Police said the alleged assault happened inside Ballou High School in southeast DC in mid-March. But school families said they only were notified days later after a parent posted about in a Facebook video. Carlene Reid, who represents Ward 8 on the State Board of Education, drafted a resolution on \"sexual assault in schools\" in response after she saw in the video. Reid said she hopes to get a vote on the resolution in the June 15 board meeting, but because the school board cannot pass policy, it’s now up to the DC Council to make this issue a priority.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Wildlife officials working to prevent threatened Florida manatees from starving to death said they’re encouraged that some of the marine mammals’ favorite food is growing naturally in a key area. Seagrasses have been found growing recently in small areas of the Indian River Lagoon along Florida’s east coast, where chronic pollution has wiped out much of it, officials said. “We take it as a positive there is seagrass growing, ”said Ron Mezich of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “What that means long-term, we have no idea.” The lack of seagrass forage during winter months has triggered an unprecedented die-off of manatees, including a record of more than 1,100 last year. The deaths recorded so far in 2022 are at 551, according to commission statistics. The FWC and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in March completed an experimental program that fed manatees more than 202,000 pounds of donated lettuce near a power plant where the animals gather during colder months. Officials said a similar program is in the works for the coming winter.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group that works to protect Georgia’s waterways has released a free Georgia River Guide mobile app. The Georgia River Guide app seeks to help people experience the recreation on Georgia’s network of more than 30 water trails, according to the Georgia River Network.

Eric Holcomb’s veto of a bill banning transgender females from competing in girls school sports, allowing Indiana to join about more than a dozen other states adopting similar laws in the past two years. State senators voted 32-15 in favor of overriding Holcomb following the same action in a 67-28 vote by the House earlier in the day. Holcomb had said in his veto message that the bill did not provide a consistent policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports” when he unexpectedly vetoed it in March.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Deer hunters would be able to use semi-automatic rifles during a newly created antlerless season in January under a bill approved by lawmakers Tuesday and sent to Gov.

Andy Beshear and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine have asked the federal government to spend $2 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure deal to build a new Ohio River bridge and fix an existing, outdated span that has long been the source of frustration for commuters and politicians. Overhauling the Brent Spence Bridge, which connects Cincinnati with northern Kentucky, was a big selling point for President Joe Biden during the debate over the federal infrastructure legislation. He touted the project last July at a CNN town hall in Cincinnati, vowing his administration would “fix that damn bridge of yours” if the legislation passed. Just before signing the bill in November, Biden said he expected the bridge would finally get funding. Governors from both states announced Tuesday they jointly submitted an application asking for $1.66 billion in federal funding to make the needed improvements.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Two Confederate holidays would be erased from Louisiana law under legislation approved 4-2 by a state Senate committee. The House-passed bill by Rep. Matthew Willard, a New Orleans Democrat, goes next to the full Senate. Neither Confederate Memorial Day nor the day honoring Gen. Robert E. Lee have been observed in Louisiana for years. They are among a list of holidays a governor can proclaim in addition to other, permanent holidays that include Christmas and Independence Day. The governor is limited in the number he can proclaim in a year. As amended by the Senate Judiciary Committee A on Tuesday, the list of optional holidays still would include President’s Day, National Memorial Day and a day honoring Huey P. Long, the former Louisiana governor and U.S. senator. Committee chairman Barrow Peacock, a Republican from the Shreveport-Bossier area, was among the bill’s opponents. He said the holidays should be seen as memorials and markers of history that should be remembered.\n\nMaine\n\nAlfred: Three FedEx delivery vehicles traveling single file crashed into each other, sending one driver to the hospital and tying up traffic, officials said. The delivery vehicles collided with each other when traffic slowed in front of them late Tuesday morning on busy Route 111, said Shannon Moss, spokesperson for the Maine Department of Public Safety. All of the trucks suffered damage, and one of them was pushed off the highway into a tree, Moss said. One FedEx driver was taken to a hospital with nonlife-threatening injuries, Moss said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Maryland man has pleaded guilty to making threats against the National Security Agency and its employees, prosecutors said Tuesday.

Barron said. U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher sentenced Conlon to six months of home detention as part of three years’ probation. The NSA headquarters office is based at Fort Meade.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts has sued more than a dozen companies involved in the manufacture or marketing of forever chemicals, alleging they knowingly polluted the environment and endangered public health, state Attorney General Maura Healey said. The companies have known about the dangers of PFAS chemicals – found in firefighting foam and consumer products – for years and violated federal and state environmental laws, she said at a news conference. The chemicals have polluted more than 126 public drinking water systems in 86 Massachusetts communities, the state said. Those communities now face multimillion-dollar price tags to clean up the chemicals, Healey said. In addition, the chemicals have contaminated lakes, streams, rivers, and coastal zones including Cape Cod – areas critical for marine life, the suit said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Michigan Court of Appeals opened the door Wednesday to abortion opponents who are trying to overturn a recent decision that suspended the state’s long-dormant ban on the procedure. The court set a briefing schedule that runs through July 5. A judge at the Court of Claims last week issued a preliminary injunction that freezes a 1931 ban on abortion in most instances. If the injunction stands, it means abortion would not be illegal in Michigan if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the landmark Roe v. Wade decision by summer. Right to Life of Michigan, the Michigan Catholic Conference and two county prosecutors are asking the appeals court to throw out the injunction granted by Judge Elizabeth Gleicher, who said the law likely violates the state constitution. They said there was no reason for Gleicher to act because abortion remains legal in Michigan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two administrative law judges said Minnesota natural gas utilities should be allowed to pass on an extra $660 million in costs related to storm damage to their customers. The state Department of Commerce and Attorney General’s Office alleged the utilities made critical mistakes in their gas procurement procedures during the February 2021 storm and because of the mismanagement, customers should not pay for the extra costs. In a decision released Tuesday, the judges rejected the state agencies’ contentions. The judges’ decisions are not binding, but they can influence the state Public Utilities Commission, which has the final say. The commission is expected to decide the matter this summer. It will also consider the positions of the Commerce Department, the Attorney General’s Office and other parties, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A convicted killer’s effort to get his execution quickly scheduled has been dismissed by the state’s Supreme Court, weeks after the condemned man changed his mind. Blayde Nathaniel Grayson, 46, filed a handwritten letter to the high court in December requesting that his execution for a 1996 killing be set immediately. Days later, Grayson’s attorney moved to withdraw that request, noting that Grayson still had a federal appeal pending. The Supreme Court ordered a state district court to get a statement from Grayson as to whether he wanted to waive appeals and have his execution date set. In April, Grayson told a judge, under oath, that he wanted to continue his appeals. In a ruling dated Friday, the Supreme Court formally dismissed his motion for a quick execution. Grayson was convicted of capital murder in 1997 for the stabbing death the previous year of 78-year-old Minnie Smith during a home burglary in south Mississippi’s George County.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A Missouri man will be laid to rest Saturday, more than 80 years after he died in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Navy returned the remains of Seaman 1st Class Wilbur Francis Newton to Kansas City International Airport on Tuesday. Newton was among more than 400 crewman killed on the USS Oklahoma during the Pearl Harbor attack. His remains were identified as part of a project by the Department of Defense agency known as The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Researchers needed maternal DNA to get a match, and reached the last living relative on Newton’s mother’s side before she died in 2012. Robin Deeds, a child of one of Newton’s cousins, said Newton will be buried Saturday at Mount Hope Cemetery in Mound City. He said more than 50 cousins plan to attend the service, KCTV-TV reported. Newton will be laid to rest in a burial plot with a grave marker that his parents bought for him before they died in the late 1940s.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently announced that five central Montana community development organizations will receive a combined total of $9.7 million in federal funding to redevelop environmentally contaminated sites across 20 counties. The windfall came as $21 billion in funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act begin to become available. The money is earmarked to address legacy pollution in the United States, allocated to clean up Superfund and Brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine land and cap orphaned oil and gas wells. Near the top of the list of revitalization packages are plans to clean up the Crowley Block, a century-old storefront property on Main Street in Lewistown.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A man with a long history of mental illness when he killed the grandfather of two Nebraska football players more than two decades ago has died in prison. Russell Harms died in the Nebraska prison system’s Reception and Treatment Center in Lincoln on Monday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said. in a news release. Harms was 64. Harms had been in prison 22 years for gunning down 84-year-old Tennyson Kelsay in the parking lot of an Auburn shopping center in 1999. Kelsay was the grandfather of then-Nebraska rush end Chris Kelsay and former Nebraska and Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Chad Kelsay. Harms was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison after his trial judge rejected his insanity defense, despite Harms having been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic with a long history of failed medications and hospitalizations. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld Harms’ conviction and sentence.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A 20-year-old Elko County man convicted of sexually assaulting and killing a Spring Creek teenager two years ago has been sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 20 years. A jury deliberated for two hours Monday before settling on Bryce Dickey’s sentence on a first-degree murder charge in the death of 16-year-old Gabrielle “Britney” Ujlaky. Her parents had provided emotional testimony about how her death has turned their world upside down, the Elko Daily Free Press reported. Police originally treated Ujlaky’s disappearance as a runaway case after Dickey told investigators he saw her get into a green pickup truck with a tall man wearing a cowboy hat outside Spring Creek High School on March 8, 2020. Her mother, Alisha, told Dickey on Monday that she had waited for two years to confront him. “I believed your ridiculous lies and your story about the green truck, and you let me come try and comfort you, knowing that you had raped and murdered my daughter,” she said. Judge Mason Simons will sentence Dickey later on the sexual assault charge, to be added to the murder sentence.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A man who was allegedly killed by a female coworker’s husband who discovered they had been texting, had other gunshot wounds, cuts and bruises before he died of a bullet to the head, the state’s chief medical examiner testified. “It’s very likely he was immediately unconscious at this point and would have died within minutes,” Jennie Duval said about the last bullet that went into Jonathan Amerault, 25, who was killed in September 2020 and later beheaded. His other injuries had caused a lot of bleeding and pain, she said. Amerault’s head was cut off using two weapons, likely a saw and a knife, Duval testified during the first-degree murder trial of Armando Barron, 32, in Keene. Prosecutors alleged Barron assaulted his wife and used her cellphone to lure Amerault to a park just north of the Massachusetts state line the night he discovered the texts, beat and kicked Amerault, and tried to force his wife to shoot him. She refused, and he forced Amerault into the victim’s car and shot him three times, prosecutors said. His wife, Britany Barron, testified last week that she was then forced to drive the car 200 miles north to a remote campsite. There, she said, she was forced to behead Amerault and dispose of his body.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres implored graduating college students on Tuesday to reject jobs at companies that fund the fossil fuel industry he described as “killing our planet.” Guterres made his remarks to graduating seniors at Seton Hall University. Guterres told the class at Newark’s Prudential Center that they are entering a world “brimming with peril” from conflict and strife and the effects of climate change – but that they can reverse the errors of previous generations by not working for financial institutions that profit off fossil fuels. Guterres’s remarks came a week after he announced a five-point plan to encourage use of renewable energy around the globe, in the wake of a World Meteorological Organization report that said the last seven years were the seven-hottest on record.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A BNSF train stalled in the middle of Las Cruces on Tuesday afternoon, blocking vehicles and pedestrians from seven crossings for about 3 hours, including at Picacho and Amador avenues.

According to drivers in the area, the train stalled on the tracks at about 4 p.m.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: An outbreak of Legionnaires’ Disease in a Bronx neighborhood has sickened 19 people since the beginning of the month, with one person dying, city health officials said Wednesday. The Health Department said cooling towers in the borough’s Highbridge section had been tested for the presence of the bacteria Legionella, which causes the disease, a form of pneumonia. The bacteria was found in four of the towers, which the department ordered to be disinfected. In addition to the person who died, eight people have been hospitalized, the department said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nManteo: Debris from two houses that collapsed into the surf on North Carolina’s Outer Banks are washing ashore, prompting the National Park Service to issue warnings to visitors walking along the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The park service said in a news release Wednesday that some of the debris is covered by sand and some of it is fully exposed. Officials advised visitors to wear hard-soled footwear on the beach between Rodanthe and Salvo, although sharp debris might also be found in areas south of Salvo. The unoccupied homes were located along Ocean Drive in the Outer Banks community of Rodanthe. A third house in Rodanthe collapsed in February.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Secretary of State Al Jaeger denied a move by a group that wants to change the voter threshold for amending the state constitution. Jaeger said in a letter to the sponsoring committee that nearly 6,000 of the signatures were invalid. The committee last month delivered 910 petitions with a claimed 33,624 signatures, just above the 31,000 that must be approved to get the proposed measure on the November ballot. Jaeger said the final count of accepted signatures was 25,884. Ten petitions were thrown out because they were not circulated in their entirety and petitions turned in by three circulators were rejected for numerous errors, Jaeger said. Some of the petitions included signatures from residents of other states.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine ended Ohio’s participation in a federal pandemic unemployment aid program ahead of a government deadline for stopping the payments. Attorneys for the Republican governor argued he had the legal authority to do so. People who lost out on additional benefits said DeWine didn’t, and should have continued them. The Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments from both sides Wednesday. A decision isn’t expected for weeks. At issue before the court is a weekly $300 federal payment for Ohioans to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government ended that program Sept. 6, but DeWine stopped the payments June 26, 2021, saying the need for the payments was over.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:A proposal to end free curbside parking in Midtown is facing some opposition from a handful of business owners who worry about losing employees and customers. Jason Ferbrache, director at EMBARK, unveiled a proposal Tuesday to the Oklahoma City Council that proposed installing parking meters in Midtown and Automobile Alley. The money made from new metered spaces would be split, with 60% going to the city and 40% going to new Midtown and Automobile Alley parking districts. Proponents argued the parking meters will turn over to visitors parking spaces otherwise taken up by area employees. Owners of Hall’s Pizza Kitchen, Harvey Street Bakery, 405 Yoga, Ludivine, and R&J Lounge and Supper Club said the plan could hurt them at a time when they’re still recovering from the pandemic.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A state commission has adopted three temporary rules that could significantly impact future housing developments, prioritizing dense communities and walkability while deemphasizing automobiles. The temporary rules augment three areas of state law: housing development, transportation planning and metropolitan greenhouse gas reduction targets. The rules apply to the eight largest metropolitan areas in Oregon: Albany, Bend, Corvallis, Eugene/Springfield, Grants Pass, Medford/Ashland, Portland metro and Salem/Keizer. One aspect of the new rules is these metro areas would need to designate \"climate-friendly areas,\" which would become central to future developments as cities look to expand. These zones would contain higher-density housing, jobs, businesses and services and include \"high-quality\" pedestrian, bicycle and transit infrastructure.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMount Joy: Harold Billow, 99, the last known survivor of a World War II POW massacre during the Battle of the Bulge, will be laid to rest Thursday in Pennsylvania. Billow, who died May 17, was attached to the Army’s 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion when his unit surrendered and he was taken prisoner by Waffen SS soldiers as German forces launched an offensive in Belgium to try to change the war’s tide in December 1944. According to various accounts, the Germans opened fire on the unarmed prisoners in a field, killing more than 80 in what came to be known as the Malmedy Massacre. “As soon as the machine gun started firing, I went facedown in the snow,” Billow told Lancaster Online in 2019. He played dead as the Germans checked for survivors. “Anybody that showed signs of life, they would point-blank shoot them in the head to finish them off,” Billow said. Billow said he stayed there for several hours before he and other survivors bolted. He made his way through hedgerows before reaching the safety of American lines. After the war, he was called to testify at a war crimes trial in which 43 German soldiers were sentenced to death for the Malmedy Massacre. However, they were released after investigators determined U.S. guards had coerced confessions.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic Gov. Dan McKee signed legislation Wednesday to legalize and regulate recreational marijuana in the state. McKee scheduled a bill signing ceremony at the State House for Wednesday afternoon after Rhode Island’s General Assembly overwhelming voted in favor of the legislation Tuesday night. His office said the legislation accomplishes the priorities of making sure legalization is equitable, controlled and safe. It will legalize the sale and possession of up to 1 ounce of cannabis for adults, ages 21 and older, with no more than 10 ounces for personal use kept at a person’s home. It will also allow residents to grow a small amount at home.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nChester: A magistrate who has been reprimanded and whose husband is a former sheriff awaiting sentencing for stealing money from government programs has been suspended from the bench for six months, the South Carolina Supreme Court said. Chester County Magistrate Angel Underwood used her official judicial email account to help her husband write a disciplinary order on a sheriff’s office employee and to recommend a student for a scholarship on behalf of deputies, the justices wrote in their order. Underwood also pulled private crime tips from the sheriff’s office Facebook page and emailed to deputies on her judicial account, according to court records. Underwood’s actions “served to erode public confidence in the judiciary” because they “blurred the boundaries between her role as an independent and impartial magistrate and someone acting on behalf of the Sheriff’s Department,” the order said. The state Supreme Court publicly reprimanded Underwood in 2016 for failing to point out her husband was the sheriff each time she started to hear a case involving the Chester County Sheriff’s Office. Underwood pointed out there were no complaints on how she handled those cases.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The Sioux Falls School District’s nutrition trucks with the iconic 1980s apple logo will no longer be on the streets, but a more colorful, designer logo will take the apple’s place. Local artist Megan Jansick with MJ Designs came up with the new look at the beginning of 2022, for the trucks that take food from the district’s central kitchen to elementary school sites, and are on the roads in Sioux Falls for miles and miles each day. With the district’s recent branding and website changes, we “really wanted to define who we are as a Sioux Falls School District,” spokeswoman DeeAnn Konrad said at the school board meeting Monday night. Fruit and vegetable characters, trees made of broccoli, a milk waterfall and homes made of bread cover the new trucks. Some Sioux Falls landmarks are also visible, such as Levitt at the Falls. Some characters will be used in other ways to promote the lunch service, Konrad said. Five of the district’s 10 trucks have been wrapped with the new designs, at a cost of $2,400 per truck, spokeswoman Carly Uthe said. The remaining five will be wrapped in the next fiscal year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee agriculture officials said work has begun to clean up debris at Natchez Trace State Forest after a December tornado damaged the park. A tornado that tore through Henderson County on Dec. 10 made a path about 6 miles long through the forest, causing heavy damage to about 1,400 acres, the state Agriculture Department said. The goal of the operation is to rehabilitate the forest by clearing tree debris to allow public access and improve forest health, officials said. Crews have started harvesting logs of pine and hardwood trees, department spokesman Tim R. Phelps said. Work is expected to last until December.\n\nTexas\n\nRichmond: A Texas man has been arrested for what authorities said was his role in an online romance scam in which women were cheated out of a total of nearly $1 million by someone pretending to be an Army general, federal prosecutors in Rhode Island said. Fola Alabi, also known as Folayemi Alabi, 51, was arrested at his Richmond home Tuesday and charged with wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha. No defense attorney was listed in online court records. Alabi or an alleged accomplice pretending to be a general stationed overseas befriended women on social media on various dates last year, gradually gaining their trust by feigning romantic or personal interest, prosecutors said. The women were asked to send money to the fake general to help ship his belongings back to the U.S., according to court documents. They were asked to send the money to companies in Texas controlled by Alabi or someone associated with him, at his home address, prosecutors said. Many of the women were in their 70s and 80s and either widowed or divorced, according to an affidavit in the case. They were from Rhode Island, Tennessee, North Carolina, California, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Texas, Idaho and South Dakota.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale: Zion National Park officials expect a busy Memorial Day weekend and for the crowds to bleed into the weekdays, as well. In 2021, an estimated 100,000 visitors were at the park on Memorial Day weekend from Friday through Monday, according to a release from the National Park Service. Park officials said they anticipate long waits at the entrances, trailheads, and visitor centers. Springdale, the gateway town located just outside the park's main entrance, will be heavy with traffic throughout the week and visitors should expect long lines getting into the park. They can also expect long wait times for shuttles and intermittent closures at the park's east and south vehicle entrances. To keep up with any changes or closures to the park visit www.nps.gov/zion.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A former Chittenden County man has been arraigned on charges accusing him of threatening to kill a state court judge, a defense attorney, and a state prosecutor and to sexually assault the prosecutor, according to the Vermont U.S. attorney’s office. The 35-year-old man pleaded not guilty Monday and was ordered held pending trial. He is accused of calling a Vermont Department of Corrections reporting line, saying when he was released from jail he would use violence and kill and maim those state officials as well as to harm and kill other members of the legal community, federal prosecutors said. The calls were recorded. The man was recently ordered hospitalized by the state court for mental health considerations, prosecutors said. The Federal Public Defender Office for Vermont, which is representing him, declined to comment on the charges.\n\nVirginia\n\nSimplicity: A 69-year-old Virginia woman who went missing last week was found alive Monday in a dense pine forest less than a mile from her home, the local sheriff announced. The search for Aletha Gee Walton began May 17, when her family discovered she was missing and alerted authorities, Prince Edward County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement posted online. Walton was last seen at her home in the Simplicity area two days earlier, officials said. Search-and-rescue organizations and agencies from across the state joined the search for Walton and she was found about eight-tenths of a mile from her home in a densely wooded pine forest with a thick underbrush on Monday morning, eight days after she was last seen, the sheriff’s office said. Walton was assessed by medical personnel immediately and taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Authorities did not give additional details about her condition or say why she was in the woods in the first place.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A large black bear that evaded capture in western Washington for more than two years was trapped and killed near Issaquah last week. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife said the 5-year-old bear was captured in the Squak Mountain area, where he had been seen in garbage containers, bird feeders and fruit trees dozens of times over nearly three years, The Seattle Times reported. The capture had taken on greater urgency because he was frequently seen in residential areas and was wearing a collar that had grown too tight. The state made the decision to “lethally remove” the bear because he was so overweight at 352 pounds – the normal weight for a similar-aged bear is about 200 pounds – and because of his habit of getting into human-provided food sources.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Attorneys for the state and two remaining pharmaceutical manufacturers have reached a tentative $161.5 million settlement just as closing arguments were set to begin in a seven-week trial over the opioid epidemic, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said Wednesday. Morrisey announced the development in court in the state’s lawsuit against Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies. The judge agreed to put the trial on hold to give the parties the opportunity to reach a full settlement agreement in the upcoming weeks. No financial terms were announced. The trial started April 4. The lawsuit accused the defendants of downplaying the risks of addiction associated with opioid use while overstating the benefits. West Virginia reached a $99 million settlement with Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. last month over the drugmaker’s role in perpetuating the opioid crisis in the state that has long led the nation in drug overdose deaths. Before the trial started, Morrisey’s office announced the state settled part of the lawsuit involving another defendant, Endo Health Solutions, for $26 million.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: All of the $2.3 million stolen from the Wisconsin Republican Party by hackers just before the 2020 presidential election has been recovered, including nearly $600,000 obtained by the FBI and given back to the party last month, the state party executive director said Tuesday. The state GOP noticed suspicious activity on Oct. 22, 2020, and contacted the FBI a day later, less than two weeks before Election Day. The party determined the money had been taken from the account it was using to help try to reelect President Donald Trump. He went on to lose Wisconsin to President Joe Biden by less than 21,000 votes. The investigation into the theft is ongoing, Wisconsin party executive director Mark Jefferson said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: An abortion clinic set to open next month in Wyoming was damaged in a fire early Wednesday that police believe was deliberately set – possibly by someone seen running away from the building carrying what appeared to be a gas can and a bag. The blaze damaged the inside of the building under renovation to house the clinic in Casper, the second-largest city in a state where opposition to abortion is widespread. The clinic, which also planned to provide other health care services for women, had been set to open in June as only the second place in the state to offer abortions. Wyoming’s other location for women to get abortions is at a hospital in Jackson, 281 miles away. Wyoming is one of 13 states with a trigger law that would immediately outlaw abortion if the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized it nationwide is overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. A leaked draft of a ruling suggests that will happen soon.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-death-toll-rises-cases-testing/5053816002/", "title": "Coronavirus live updates: Restrictions could last months; Canada ...", "text": "This live blog was published March 16. For the latest updates from USA TODAY, click here.\n\nWASHINGTON – In a significant increase in measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people and to limit discretionary travel.\n\nThough he stopped short of imposing a national quarantine or curfew, Trump said the country may be dealing with a number of restrictions through July or August as a result of the virus. He acknowledged the economy may be heading into a recession.\n\n“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration all together,’’ Trump said in the closest he came to displaying levity in a somber news conference that underscored the seriousness of the situation.\n\nJust the previous day, Trump had sounded gleeful over news that the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates to near zero, though that did not stop the stock market from tanking again on Monday.\n\nThe new guidelines, which are recommendations and not mandates, call on Americans to avoid social gatherings involving groups of more than 10 for the next 15 days. They also suggest that school-age students take classes from home when possible.\n\nTrump called for governors in states with evidence of community transmission to close schools in affected and surrounding areas. Bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and other venues where groups of people congregate should also be closed in states with evidence of community transmission.\n\n“Each and every one of us has a critical role to play,” Trump said, surrounded by members of his coronavirus task force.\n\nAmong the other guidelines:\n\n-- If someone in your house has testified positive, keep the entire household at home. Do not go to work or school.\n\n-- If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.\n\n-- If you have a serious underlying health condition, stay home and away from others.\n\n-- Avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits.\n\n-- Avoid eating or drinking in restaurants bars and food courts. Use drive-through, pickup and delivery options.\n\n-- Do not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless you are there to provide critical assistance.\n\n-- Practice good hygiene such as washing your hands, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces. Avoid touching your face.\n\nEarlier Monday, the White House pushed back on news reports that it is considering imposing curfews and a national quarantine in the wake of the spread of the epidemic.\n\n\"This is not correct,\" tweeted Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the task force.\n\nTrump confirmed he's not ready at this point to impose a national quarantine.\n\nIn the morning, markets halted trading for 15 minutes moments after opening when stocks immediately fell more than 7%. When trading resumed the drop continued. For the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,997 points, its biggest drop of all time, eclipsing the 2,352-point fall it had on Thursday.\n\nThere were slivers of light in the darkness – U.S. health officials on Sunday pledged to ramp up testing efforts by the tens of thousands. And testing began on a vaccine.\n\nBut the U.S. death toll rose to 85, with more than 4,600 known cases as of Monday afternoon. The global deaths surged past 7,100.\n\nIn an attempt to slow the virus, more than 30 states ordered the shuttering of all schools.\n\nOther important headlines on coronavirus:\n\nMost of S.F. Bay Area told to shelter in place\n\nIn the most restrictive measure yet by local governments, officials in six San Francisco Bay Area counties on Monday issued a shelter-in-place mandate affecting nearly 7 million people.\n\nThe order, effective Tuesday, says residents must stay inside for three weeks and venture out only for necessities. The order affects the counties of San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa, as well as the city of Berkeley.\n\nPeople should work from home unless they provide essential services such as public safety, sanitation and health care.\n\n“The most important thing you can do is remain home as much as possible,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed posted on Twitter. “There is no need to rush out for food or supplies, as these stores will remain open.”\n\nResidents can still go outside to perform essential functions, such as obtaining services or supplies for the household, and they're also allowed to go exercise and take pets out as long as they maintain a social distance of at least six feet.\n\nThe other three Bay Area counties of Napa, Solano and Sonoma were not included in the order, at least for now.\n\nSome courts in the California, including the Bay Area, are delaying trials and even temporarily closing their doors in hopes of helping prevent the virus from spreading further.\n\nFitness chains announce closures throughout U.S.\n\nPopular fitness clubs — from Orangetheory, SoulCycle, Gold's Gym and Equinox — announced closures Monday.\n\nBoca Raton, Florida-based Orangetheory announced it was closing its franchise-owned high-intensity training locations nationwide at end of classes Monday, and asking independent owners to follow suit. In a letter, CEO David Long stated a March 31 goal to re-open. Orangetheory Fitness franchisees have opened over 1,300 studios in all 50 U.S. states and over 23 countries, per a news release.\n\nSoulCycle stationary-bike studios announced a closure around the world for its clubs on Monday. Interim CEO Sunder Reddy did specify a re-opening date. Soulcycle has nearly 100 locations, most of them in the United States, according to its website.\n\nGold's Gym announced on Instagram that the franchise-owned gyms would close nationwide Monday at 8 p.m. through March 31. Gold's Gym has over 400 US locations, according to its website.\n\nIn announcing the closure of Equinox Clubs to members on Monday, starting at 8 p.m., chairman Harvey Spevak wrote, \"The COVID-19 health crisis is presenting challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetime.\" Equinox has 106 clubs, according to its website.\n\nLife Time Clubs also announced the closure of all locations Monday. The company has more than 150 locations in 41 markets across the U.S. and Canada, according to its website.\n\n-- Jordan Culver, Bryan Alexander and Bill Keveney\n\nCBS, ABC reporters test positive for coronavirus\n\nSix people at CBS News have tested positive for coronavirus, including a correspondent stationed in Italy, as media organizations fought Monday against the same epidemic they’re charged with covering.\n\nFive employees with the virus work in CBS’ New York offices, where most of its journalists were ordered to stay away as a result.\n\nABC News said Monday that a journalist who worked on the network’s coverage team of the outbreak in Seattle had tested positive for coronavirus. The person, who works in ABC’s Los Angeles bureau, has been isolated since last week and has suffered only mild symptoms.\n\nThe network said it has told its entire Seattle coverage team to stay home and has closed its Los Angeles bureau for a thorough cleaning.\n\nAt NBC, an employee who worked on the “Today” show tested positive, forcing the show’s anchors Craig Melvin and Al Roker and others who came into contact with the person to be ordered to isolate in their homes as a result.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nKentucky Derby postponed\n\nFor the first time in 75 years, the Kentucky Derby will not be a part of the first Saturday in May.\n\nAmid growing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, Churchill Downs will postpone the Derby from May 2 to Sept. 5, according to a source, the Louisville (Kentucky) Courier Journal reported.\n\nThe last time the Kentucky Derby wasn’t held on the first Saturday in May was in 1945, when the government issued a ban on horse racing because of World War II. The ban was lifted on V-E Day (May 8), and the Derby was held on June 9. The only other year the Derby wasn’t held in May was in 1901, when it was raced on April 29.\n\n-- Jason Frakes, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nMcDonald's to close seating, play areas\n\nThe McDonald's fast-food chain will shut down seating areas at all of its company-owned outlets throughout the U.S., limiting sales to walk-in takeout, drive-thru and delivery service. Play areas will also be closed.\n\nThough the move only currently applies to restaurants McDonald's corporately owns, the company expects many of its franchisees to follow suit. That is likely to mean large swaths of McDonald's restaurants - of which there are roughly 13,800 in the U.S. - will operate as drive-thru only.\n\n\"Franchisees are strongly encouraged to adopt similar operations procedures while keeping the needs of their people and communities at the center of their decisions,'' McDonald's said.\n\n-- Charisse Jones\n\nAmtrak to cut Northeast Corridor trains by 60%, cancels Canada routes\n\nAmtrak is cutting its frequency on the Northeast Corridor by 60% of its typical weekday schedules between Boston, New York and Washington Monday in response to plummeting demand due to the coronavirus.\n\nAmtrak said Sunday that its Acela Express and Northeast Regional trains would continue to operate but at significantly lower frequencies. The railroad said in an email to employees last week that bookings had dropped 50% while cancellations had soared 300%.\n\nCanada on Monday closed its borders to non-citizens. The new restriction does not apply to U.S citizens. Still, on Monday Amtrak canceled its Cascades service north of Seattle to Vancouver, British Columbia. Starting Tuesday, Amtrak trains in New York that usually operate to Canada will no longer do so.\n\n-- Curtis Tate\n\nLos Angeles schools, Red Cross to open 60 food centers\n\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District, which announced it would shut down for two weeks starting Monday, won't be able to open 40 Family Resource Centers to provide childcare, district Superintendent Austin Beutner said in a statement.\n\nInstead, the district, along with the Red Cross, will open 60 \"grab-and-go\" food centers that'll be open for three hours on weekdays (7 a.m. until 10 a.m.). Students will be able to take home two meals at a time from the stations.\n\n\"At this time, state and local health and public safety officials cannot assure us it will be safe for the children and adults at the Family Centers for us to provide care for children at these sites,\" Beutner said in his statement, which was posted to social media. He added the district is \"deeply disappointed.\"\n\nThe food centers are set to open Wednesday.\n\n-- Jordan Culver\n\nN.Y. college dorms may serve as hospitals\n\nCollege dormitories, former nursing homes and other buildings could be converted into medical facilities to help treat the wave of coronavirus infections expected to hit New York state's hospital system in coming weeks and months.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo called on local governments to identify existing buildings that could most easily be renovated to handle the thousands of additional beds needed to treat New Yorkers with the illness COVID-19, as well as other unrelated medical conditions.\n\nThe plan includes deploying the National Guard as well as partnering with private developers and construction unions to complete the emergency project.\n\nIt would create an additional 2,000 beds in Westchester County alone. New York City would need another 5,000 beds and Long Island needs 2,000 beds based on the current rate of infections in New York and prior outbreaks in China, South Korea and Italy, Cuomo said.\n\nWithout adding new beds at temporary facilities, the state’s existing hospital capacity cannot handle the projected surge in COVID-19 patients, he said.\n\n“The wave is going to break, and the wave is going to break on the hospital system,” Cuomo said.\n\n-- David Robinson, The Journal News\n\nActors Idris Elba, Kristofer Hivju have the virus\n\nActor Idris Elba, known for his role in the HBO series \"The Wire'' and his movie portrayal of South African icon Nelson Mandela, revealed on Twitter that he has tested positive for coronavirus.\n\n\"I feel OK, I have no symptoms so far but have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus,\" the actor said in a video announcement. \"Stay home people and be pragmatic.''\n\nMonday evening, Kristofer Hivju, 41, the actor best known for embodying the renowned warrior (and admirer of Brienne of Tarth) Tormund Giantsbane on Game of Thrones, wrote on an Instagram post from Norway, \"Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus.\"\n\nLast week, fellow actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson revealed they have tested positive as well.\n\nCould US see high mortality rate if Americans don't follow guidelines?\n\nThe United States will end up with as high a coronavirus mortality rate as Italy without an aggressive response that includes Americans following the federal government’s guidance, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on “Fox & Friends” Monday.\n\n“When you look at the projections, there's every chance that we could be Italy,” Adams said. Actual mortality rates are difficult to determine because not everyone who becomes infected is tested. But about 7% of Italy's confirmed cases have resulted in fatalities. South Korea, which tested and acted aggressively against the outbreak, has seen a death rate of less than 1%.\n\n“There's every hope that we will be South Korea if people actually listen, if people actually social distance, if people do the basic public health measures that we've all been talking about as doctors all along, such as washing your hands, such as covering your cough, and cleaning surfaces,\" Adams said.\n\nIn Washington state, where the virus' death toll has been heaviest, health officials reported that six more people have perished, bringing the total there to 48. By comparison, 71 deaths have been confirmed nationwide.\n\nKing County officials said the latest victims ranged in age from 50 to a woman in her 90s who lived in a nursing home in Redmond. None was identified as being a resident of the Life Care Center in Kirkland, which has been the epicenter of the virus in the state.\n\nUpdates from Washington:White House says coronavirus curfews not under consideration\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSeventh TSA officer tests positive\n\nA Transportation Security Administration officer at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the nationwide total to seven, according to the agency.\n\nOn Sunday, TSA said two officers in Florida had tested positive, one at Orlando International Airport and the other at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nLast week, three TSA officers at Norman Mineta San Jose International Airport tested positive, followed by a fourth one.\n\n-- Curtis Tate\n\nStocks plunge again\n\nStocks plunged at the opening bell despite the Federal Reserve's emergency action to cushion the economy from a pandemic that is shutting down global business and travel.\n\nMonday’s 12% drop for the S&P 500 means it has plummeted nearly 30% since setting a record less than a month ago, and it’s at its lowest point since the end of 2018. Losses accelerated in the last half hour of trading after Trump said the economy may be headed for a recession.\n\n“Investors aren’t happy because these rate cuts won’t stimulate the economy in the near term. You can’t stimulate demand if everyone is stuck in their house,” says Shana Sissel, a senior portfolio manager at CLS Investments.\n\n– Jessica Menton\n\nNJ, NY, Conn., Md. tighten rules for restaurants, other businesses\n\nNew York, New Jersey and Connecticut will limit all bars and restaurants to takeout and delivery services, part of a series of steps the states are taking collectively and separately to fight the spread of coronavirus. The states will also shut down all casinos, gyms and movie theaters, their governors said in a joint announcement. Grocery stores will remain open.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy went further, urging state residents not to leave their homes from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. daily.\n\n\"The #Coronavirus doesn't care about state borders, so this agreement with @GovNedLamont & @GovMurphy will help protect the entire Tri-State Area,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted. 'These temporary closures will last as long as is necessary to protect the public health.\" Maryland, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Washington state, Indiana and New York City are among places that have ordered bars to close and restaurants to stop dine-in service. Takeout and delivery will still be allowed.\n\n– Ashley Balcerzak, Joseph Spector and Jon Campbell\n\nSchools go dark across most of USA\n\nNew York City closed its 1,900 public schools, a difficult decision made by dozens of states and big cities as the coronavirus crisis swept through the nation's educational system. Mayor Bill de Blasio had balked at the move affecting more than 1 million students, in part due to meal plans that keep hundreds of thousands of low-income kids fed. The city was providing \"grab and go\" breakfast and lunch at all schools.\n\n\"We made the painful decision to suspend classes,\" de Blasio said. \"We’re going to begin remote digital learning on Monday, March 23, and we’ll do everything in our power to help our kids through this.\"\n\nLos Angeles, Houston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are among a long list of big cities that shuttered their schools. Disadvantaged families that rely the most on schools for stable services, such as meals and access to learning materials, will be some of the most negatively affected, experts said.\n\n“Wide-scale learning loss could be among the biggest impacts coronavirus has on children,” said Betsy Zorio, vice president of U.S. programs at Save the Children, an international children's charity.\n\n– Erin Richards\n\nCoronavirus news: What to know\n\nA roundup of additional important coronavirus news you need to know today:\n\nCurbside voting, a lack of poll workers: How coronavirus is affecting Tuesday's election\n\n'We're not being quarantined.

The National Institutes of Health is funding the trial, which is taking place at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.\n\nThe study’s first participant was an operations manager at a small tech company.

I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.”\n\nBankman-Fried was scheduled Tuesday to appear virtually before the US House Financial Services Committee, which is demanding answers about how the company came crashing down, ricocheting throughout the digital asset ecosystem. Several crypto companies have halted operations, freezing customer accounts and in some cases filing for bankruptcy themselves because of their exposure to FTX.\n\nAfter his arrest, Rep. Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the committee, said Bankman-Fried would no longer give testimony as scheduled Tuesday. The hearing was set to move ahead, however, beginning with testimony from FTX’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, who took over for Bankman-Fried on November 11 and is tasked with shepherding it through the bankruptcy process.\n\n“While I am disappointed that we will not be able to hear from Mr. Bankman-Fried tomorrow, we remain committed to getting to the bottom of what happened,” Waters said in a statement Monday night.\n\nRay has so far painted a picture of a crypto empire with virtually no corporate controls and a shocking lack of financial and other record-keeping.\n\n“The scope of the investigation underway is enormous,” Ray said in prepared remarks released Monday ahead of his testimony.\n\nWhile the probe isn’t completed, Ray said, FTX’s collapse appears to stem from the concentration of power “in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals” who failed to implement virtually any corporate controls.\n\nRay also states as fact that “customer assets from FTX.com were commingled with assets from the Alameda trading platform.” That’s a key issue for investigators, as FTX and Alameda were, on paper, separate entities.\n\nSBF’s denials\n\nBankman-Fried has denied knowingly commingling funds and sought to distance himself from the day-to-day management of Alameda, which made a number of high-risk trading strategies such as arbitrage and “yield farming,” aka investing in digital tokens that pay interest-rate-like rewards, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHe has admitted to mismanaging FTX and not paying enough attention to risk.\n\n“Look, I screwed up,” he said at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit late last month. “I was CEO of FTX…I had a responsibility.”\n\nBankman-Fried also acknowledged the lack of corporate controls and risk management within the businesses he oversaw.\n\n“There was no person who was chiefly in charge of positional risk of customers on FTX,” Bankman-Fried told DealBook. “And that feels pretty embarrassing in retrospect.”\n\nOne of the key questions about FTX’s collapse stems from a Reuters report last month that says Bankman-Fried built a “backdoor” into FTX’s accounting system, allowing him to alter the company’s financial records without tripping accounting red flags. The report said Bankman-Fried used this “backdoor” to transfer $10 billion in FTX customer funds to Alameda, the hedge fund, and at least $1 billion is now missing.\n\nBankman-Fried has denied knowledge of any such backdoor. “I don’t even know how to code,” he told cryptocurrency vlogger Tiffany Fong in an interview last month.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/12/13/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrest-indictment/10888749002/", "title": "FTX founder arrested in Bahamas: How Sam Bankman-Fried's ...", "text": "Earlier this year, Sam Bankman-Fried was a leader in the crypto industry sitting atop a $32 billion empire.\n\nHis cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, was one of the largest in the world and considered highly reputable.

Bankman-Fried’s hearing is expected to be among the first of the day.\n\nBankman-Fried, the 30-year-old former crypto celebrity, was arrested a week ago at his luxury residence in the Bahamas. Federal prosecutors in New York charged with defrauding customers and investors in FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange he founded in 2019.\n\nIn a series of media interviews and tweets since FTX filed for bankruptcy last month, Bankman-Fried has admitted to managerial mistakes while denying that he knowingly defrauded customers or investors.\n\nRoberts told the journalist on Monday afternoon that there’s a possibility Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, could be extradited the very same day as his next court appearance.\n\nRoberts wanted to emphasize that “Bankman-Fried wishes to put the customers right and that is what has driven his decision to be voluntarily extradited to the United States.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, extradition proceedings for Bankman-Fried appeared to be stalled as his Bahamian attorney and local prosecutors argued bitterly in court.\n\nProsecutors indicated there had been an agreement with Bankman-Fried’s US attorneys to allow his extradition to the United States to face federal charges. But Bankman-Fried’s Bahamian attorney, Roberts, said he himself had not been part of that agreement.\n\nRoberts claimed prosecutors wouldn’t share the US indictment with him, and he should not have to “fish on the internet” for it. In response, prosecutor Franklyn Williams dismissed Roberts’ accusation, saying that it was “not to be believed.”\n\nBankman-Fried — who wore the same navy-blue suit he wore last week when he was arrested — was expected to drop his extradition fight, clearing a significant hurdle to return him to US soil to be prosecuted on multiple charges of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nBut Monday’s hearing left observers in the dark about what happens next.\n\nThe courtroom was packed during the hearing, mostly with US Embassy officials and members of the crypto community who want to see Bankman-Fried continue to be held in the Bahamas for punishment, rather than be sent to the United States.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the frustrated magistrate overseeing the case cleared the courtroom so that Bankman-Fried could call his US attorneys with his Bahamian attorney present.\n\nBankman-Fried was then returned to the Bahamian prison where he has been held for the past week.\n\nHis US legal team didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Earlier in the day, a representative for his lawyers declined to give specifics about the timeline, saying it was “tough to give specifics while relying on the Bahamian courts.”\n\nBankman-Fried had initially planned to fight efforts to return him to the United States.

The report criticized the prison for its overcrowding, poor nutrition and inadequate sanitation and medical care. Crowded cells often lack mattresses and were “infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” according to the report.\n\nBankman-Fried is expected to again request bail once he is in US custody. If denied bail, he would be held at a federal detention center in Brooklyn, New York.

Bankman-Fried also allegedly defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing them misleading information about the hedge fund’s financial condition.\n\nThe 14-page indictment also alleges that Bankman-Fried conspired with others to violate federal election laws by making political donations to candidates and fundraising committees between 2020 and November 2022, in excess of federal legal limits and in the names of other people.\n\nRisky bets, lavish spending\n\nFTX achieved a $32 billion valuation by raising more than $1.8 billion since launching in May 2019, including from sophisticated investors such as BlackRock, Sequoia Capital and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. Star athletes and celebrities who backed FTX also reportedly received a stake in the company, including Tom Brady and Gisele.\n\nThe SEC alleges that Bankman-Fried duped those investors who backed FTX by promoting it as a “safe, responsible” crypto trading firm that used “sophisticated, automated” risk measures to protect customer funds.\n\nIn reality, the SEC alleges, Bankman-Fried internally directed software code to be written in a way that allowed Alameda, to function with a negative balance in its the customer account at FTX.\n\nThis allegedly happened in August of 2019, just about four months after operations at FTX began.\n\nThis effectively gave Alameda a limitless line of credit funded by customer assets, according to the SEC. That meant there was no meaningful distinction between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s funds that Bankman-Fried used as his “personal piggy bank,” the complaint says. He hid from investors and customers that he used the funds to buy luxury condos, support political campaigns, and make private investments, according to the SEC.\n\nBetween March 2020 and September 2022, Bankman-Fried executed loans from Alameda totaling more than $1.338 billion, including two instances in which he was both the borrower in his individual capacity and the lender in his capacity as CEO of Alameda, the SEC says in its civil complaint.\n\nBankman-Fried used funds from Alameda to purchase tens of millions of dollars in Bahamian real estate for himself, his parents, and other FTX executives, according to the filing.\n\nAlameda co-founders Nishad Singh and Gary Wang also borrowed $554 million and $224.7 million, respectively, by similarly executing promissory notes with Alameda in 2021 and 2022, the filing says.\n\nSingh and Wang have not been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe loans to Bankman-Fried and others were “poorly documented, and at times not documented at all,” the lawsuit says.\n\nWhen prices of crypto assets plummeted in May 2022, Bankman-Fried paid back Alameda’s demanding third-party lenders from its FTX “line of credit,” further growing the multi-billion-dollar liability and then concealed it in the Alameda balance sheet to avoid alarming investors, the complaint alleges.\n\nThe FTX chief executive continued to leverage the companies for his personal benefit, loaning himself $136 million in late July 2022 — one month after offering crypto financial services company BlockFi a $250 million revolving line of credit to ease its own liquidity issues, according to the filing. Meanwhile, throughout the summer, he presented a “false and misleading positive account” of the company to investors, despite its “tenuous financial condition”, the SEC alleges.\n\n“FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr. Bankman-Fried created by, among other things, touting its best-in-class controls, including a proprietary ‘risk engine,’ and FTX’s adherence to specific investor protection principles and detailed terms of service,” Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, said in a statement. “But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent.”\n\n‘I screwed up’\n\nIn the four weeks since FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried has sought to cast himself as a somewhat hapless chief executive who got out over his skis, denying accusations that he defrauded FTX’s customers.\n\n“I didn’t knowingly commit fraud,” he told the BBC over the weekend. “I didn’t want any of this to happen.

Lawyers who aren’t involved with the case suggested the quick turnaround signals that former FTX employees may be aiding prosecutors.\n\n“Given Bankman-Fried’s apparent inability to stop talking, the smart move by former employees would be to rush to become a cooperator in exchange for more lenient treatment, and it would not be surprising to learn that one or more of them had done so,” said Howard A.

Today, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, has been arrested. Plus how Arizona prisons sell undocumented workers to private companies. And we'll hear about a major update to diabetes care.\n\n♦\n\nThe founder of the failed cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, has been arrested in the Bahamas and indicted in the US. Specific charges surrounding Samuel Bankman-Fried were not revealed, but the Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a news release that he was arrested for various financial offenses against the United States. He'll appear in local court later today. FTX was a global company with more than 130 affiliates that allowed individual investors to trade cryptocurrencies. It eventually grew to be the third largest exchange by volume. But Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO last month. And the company filed for bankruptcy when it was unable to pay all of the customers on the exchange who wanted their money back. The company said in bankruptcy filings that more than a million people may have been affected. Sam Bankman-Fried was also scheduled to testify remotely today before the House Committee on Financial Services, but that now won't happen. And chair of that committee, Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, said the arrest was curiously timed and goes against the public interest.\n\n♦\n\nLaws require that private companies verify that their employees are legally allowed to work in the United States. But despite that, an Arizona Republic investigation found that some companies in that state have exploited a loophole, hiring undocumented workers with the help of prisons. For more, I'm now joined by Arizona Republic Investigative Reporter Joseph Darius Jaafari. Joseph, thanks for being here.\n\nJoseph Darius Jaafari:\n\nThank you for inviting me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo your investigation found that some companies in Arizona are hiring prisoners who have ICE detainers and are not eligible to work legally in the US. Let's start with the basics, Joseph, what is an ICE detainer, and how do these companies get around this with the help of prisons?\n\nJoseph Darius Jaafari:\n\nSo I think to first answer that we have to understand how prison labor in Arizona, and really across America, works. So in Arizona, it is in law that if you are a prisoner of any kind, you are required to work. So we house at any given moment, around 2,000 to 3,000 people who are here without work authorization, meaning they are here - either they came on a tourist visa or they crossed the border illegally or they have a residency, but then they committed some crime where they have lost their work authorization.\n\nWhen that happens, what typically is supposed to happen is when you go into prison and you have this detainer put on you by ICE, that essentially means that at the end of your term, or sometimes in the middle of your prison sentence, you will be given to ICE custody to be deported. That's what's supposed to happen, but we know that doesn't always happen. We see that on the end of people's sentences, ICE comes in and says, \"Oh, these people are eligible for deportation, put a detainer on them.\" And then they take them maybe sometimes days before the end of their sentence or the middle of their sentence.\n\nThere is a small select group of people who work for a for-profit state-run company called Arizona Correctional Industries, and that agency, which is a part of the Department of Corrections, has one edict, which is to lease out prisoners to private companies and to make sure that private companies can also get products made for their stores, for their bars, for their houses, their dormitories. Whatever you can think of, these prisoners can make them for the private sector.\n\nOut of the years of data that we have - it's a very small sliver, but it's still a sliver - there is about 26 people who had ICE detainers placed on them at some point during their incarceration and were placed to work with private companies despite the fact that Arizona has incredibly strict laws that if you are a private company or really any company, even state organizations, you are not allowed to hire people who are not allowed to be here legally.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo obviously, the focus here is on Arizona, but could you shed some light on the national scope of this story?\n\nJoseph Darius Jaafari:\n\nIt's a national story because, so the US Constitution, through the 13th Amendment, abolished slavery except in the instances of imprisonment. So we do have a legal mechanism for states to use prisoners as slaves, essentially. Arizona is unique in a couple of different ways in the fact that surprisingly, where a number of these correctional industries that exist across the nation, they are losing money. Arizona has been an outlier in the fact that they've been gaining money over the use of their prison labor, and that's because of this mechanism that they've been able to use to essentially lease out prisoners to private companies and sell them to private companies.\n\nBut this issue is not unique to Arizona. That's why we've seen four different states in the past midterms abolish the use of prison labor. That's why we've also seen a number of stories across the US talking about how many states don't pay their prisoners at all. And it's slowly becoming news a bit above the folder, at least on the front page, of the cost of living inside of prisons, that it's not free. We charge our prisoners room and board as well. So you, obviously, have to pay for that. So it's not unique to Arizona, but we do have a few unique things here that make it a bit, I won't say nefarious, but a bit more strategic.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nArizona Republic Investigative Reporter Joseph Darius Jaafari, thanks so much for making the time.\n\nJoseph Darius Jaafari:\n\nThank you very much. I appreciate it.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can read the full story with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nData on hate crimes is flawed. Despite growing domestic terrorism in the US and concerns around bias motivated crimes, even fewer law enforcement agencies reported data on hate crimes to the FBI last year. An annual FBI report out yesterday found that there were more than 7,000 hate crimes last year. But according to experts, that's just a fraction of the true number. Brian Levin is the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino. He said, \"The FBI's hate crime data release is so severely hampered by a decline in participating agencies. It is simply not representative of the actual hate crime trend, which is up.\" It's not mandatory for state, local, and tribal agencies to report data on hate crimes. And while 93% of agencies nationwide participated in 2020, that number dropped to 65% last year. The FBI said this week, that means it's currently impossible to draw meaningful conclusions about hate crime trends year to year. According to FBI reporting, the country's two largest cities, New York and Los Angeles, did not provide data.\n\nMeanwhile, other groups have reported record levels of hate crimes. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found that hate crimes rose 21% to the highest levels since 2001. That data found a particular spike in anti-Asian crimes. The Anti-Defamation League said anti-Semitic incidents reached their highest number since the group began tracking in 1979.\n\n♦\n\nThe American Diabetes Association released new disease management standards yesterday. Producer, PJ Elliott, spoke to USA TODAY Health Reporter Karen Weintraub to find out what that means for those suffering with the disease.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nKaren, thanks so much for joining 5 Things today.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nOver the past few weeks, and probably months at this point, you and I have talked a lot about diabetes and weight loss. But now you have a story about diabetes care getting a major update. What's the latest?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nRight, so the American Diabetes Association issues guidelines for treatment every year or so, and they've just issued a new version with about 100 different changes, mostly designed to improve the quality of life for people with diabetes. And among the things they're recommending is more aggressive weight management. So using some of those medications we've talked about to help reduce somebody's weight by 15%. Before, the guideline was 5%, but these medications are so effective that they think they can go down to 15%. Also recommending more aggressive treatment for blood pressure, lowering that to 130 over 80 and lowering LDL cholesterol, which is the bad kind, down to 70 for people with heart disease. It had been 155 for those with established heart disease.\n\nSo being more aggressive about those chronic illnesses that can compound the problems of diabetes. Also, things like kidney disease and amputations. So particularly, among African Americans, amputations are a huge issue for people with diabetes. Black Americans are three to four times more likely to suffer amputations than a white person with diabetes, and the rate is getting worse rather than better, unfortunately. So the new guidelines call for more careful screening for things like foot ulcers and peripheral arterial disease, which can lead to amputations.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nKaren, in your story, you mention addressing social issues, what can be done there?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nYeah. So there are a lot of social issues that get in the way of somebody living a healthy lifestyle. If you live in a neighborhood that's not safe, it's going to be hard for you to go for a walk. If you live in a food swamp where there's only junk food available, it's going to be very hard for you to eat healthy. So this American Diabetes Association guidelines now talk about that and tell the care professionals to ask patients about these issues.\n\nThings like sleep and diet and exercise and what's going on in their lives, did they just lose their job? What other issues are happening in their lives that might affect their diabetes care? And also the value of community health workers, somebody who could go out and check on you every week or two weeks and say, \"Hey, what are you facing this week? What can I do to help?\" kind of thing.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nAre the changes that you mentioned enough?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo I spoke with one gentleman who founded the African American Diabetes Association. He said in response, he didn't feel the ADA, American Diabetes Association, was doing enough for African Americans. Diabetes is a tremendous problem among African Americans, and he says we all need to be doing more. So this is a step in the right direction, but not enough.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nKaren, thanks so much. Appreciate it as always.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nAnytime.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can follow along with more of Karen's great work on Twitter at KWeintraub.\n\n♦\n\nScientists have made a major breakthrough on nuclear fusion. The long-sought energy system could make clean, carbon-free and non-radioactive electricity production in the decades to come. A Department of Energy news conference is set for this morning with details on new developments to the science. The Financial Times and Washington Post reported that the agency will announce that scientists have, for the first time, created a nuclear fusion reaction that produced more energy than it took to create. That reportedly happened at the federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n\nFusion is the opposite of the fission process that powers nuclear plants. Fusion creates power by fusing two atoms together, while fission power comes from splitting them apart. Researchers are able to create fusion reactions, but so far, they've always taken more energy to create than is released by fusing the atoms, making it a net energy loss. Using fusion, only a few pounds of matter would be enough to power entire countries for years.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us every morning wherever you get your audio.

But the Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a news release that Bankman-Fried was arrested in reference to \"various Financial Offences against laws of the United States, which are also offences against laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.\" Bankman-Fried will appear in local court on Tuesday, the release said.\n\nFTX was a global company with more than 130 affiliates that allowed individual investors to trade cryptocurrencies, growing to be the third-largest exchange by volume. The company's commercials featured prominent celebrities, and its logo appeared on an NBA stadium and on MLB umpire uniforms.\n\nThe New York Times and Coindesk first reported this story.\n\nBankman-Fried had been scheduled to appear before Congress Tuesday morning but that appearance won't happen, according to Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nWaters questioned the timing of the arrest.\n\n“I am surprised to hear that Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas at the direction of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York,\" Waters said. \"It’s about time the process to bring Mr. Bankman-Fried to justice has begun. However, as the public knows, my staff and I have been working diligently for the past month to secure Mr. Bankman-Fried’s testimony.\"\n\nShe added: “Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many. The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity.\"\n\nBankman-Fried said in a recent tweet that he would try to shed light on what led to the crypto exchange's crash and his own failings as the former CEO.\n\n“I still do not have access to much of my data – professional or personal. So there is a limit to what I will be able to say, and I won't be as helpful as I'd like,” Bankman-Fried said on Twitter. “I will try to be helpful during the hearing.”\n\nUSA TODAY's inquiry to Bankman-Fried's spokesman, Mark Botnick, was not immediately returned. Botnick confirmed earlier in the day the FTX founder was being represented by white-collar criminal defense attorney Mark S. Cohen, who did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's inquiry.\n\nBahamian Attorney General Ryan Pinder said in a news release that Bankman-Fried was arrested around 6 p.m. local time and is being held in custody \"pursuant to our nation's Extradition Act.\"\n\nBahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis said the two countries \"have a shared interest in holding accountable all individuals associated with FTX who may have betrayed the public trust and broken the law.\"\n\n\"While the United States is pursuing criminal charges against SBF individually, The Bahamas will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX, with the continued cooperation of its law enforcement and regulatory partners in the United States and elsewhere,\" he said.\n\nMultiple news outlets had already reported that FTX is the subject of investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which enforces civil regulations, and the U.S. Department of Justice, which can bring criminal charges. State and international regulators have also raised concerns about the company.\n\nBankman-Fried resigned as CEO of FTX in early November, and the company filed for bankruptcy when it was unable to pay all of the customers on the exchange who wanted their money back. The company said in bankruptcy filings there could be more than 1 million people affected.\n\nYesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, said FTX grew because it attracted average people who wanted to invest in cryptocurrency but didn’t want to deal with the complex process that often accompanies a cryptocurrency trade.\n\nA decade ago, Yadav said, crypto traders would need to download specific software and then find someone willing to sell their cryptocurrency. On an exchange like FTX, a user would place an order an essentially be given an IOU for the crypto they bought, she said. “From the user experience, that’s awesome,” she said.\n\n“The reason it was so well regarded was because it promised safety,” Yadav said. “It promised consumer protection it promised cutting-edge products without some of the kind of riskier aspects of crypto attaching to it.”\n\nJohn J. Ray III, an insolvency expert with 40 years of experience who also oversaw Enron during its bankruptcy due to accounting fraud, has been serving as the CEO of the company since Bankman-Fried's resignation.\n\nIn written testimony prepared for the House Committee on Financial Services Tuesday, he wrote that cases involving corporate failures and allegations of criminal activity have a lot in common, \"ranging from gross mismanagement, excessive leverage, failures of internal controls, failures of external checks as a result of audit firm failures, or insufficient board governance.\n\nHe added: \"But never in my career have I seen such an utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization, from the lack of financial statements to a complete failure of any internal controls or governance whatsoever.\"\n\nRay is still expected to testify Tuesday morning in front of the House Financial Services Committee.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/business/bankman-fried-parents/index.html", "title": "Parents of Sam Bankman-Fried face scrutiny over their roles in FTX ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nSam Bankman-Fried’s multibillion-dollar crypto empire was run primarily by “grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals” who failed to institute basic corporate controls and even relied on QuickBooks to do their accounting, according to investigators.\n\nBut standing by Bankman-Fried as his companies FTX and Alameda grew (and subsequently collapsed) were two respected Ivy-League trained lawyers who, potentially, should have spotted the red flags.\n\nNow, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, the FTX founder’s parents, may face legal troubles of their own.\n\nBankman-Fried, his parents and other employees “used FTX customer funds for a variety of personal expenditures, including luxury real estate purchases, private jets, documented and undocumented personal loans and personal political donations,” according to a civil lawsuit filed this week by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US derivatives market regulator.\n\nA representative for Bankman and Fried didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Bankman-Fried’s lawyer declined to comment when asked about scrutiny of his parents.\n\nBarbara Fried and Joseph Bankman From Stanford University\n\nBankman-Fried, who was arrested on Monday night at his luxury residence in the Bahamas on eight federal criminal counts, told the New York Times before his arrest that his parents “weren’t involved in any of the relevant parts” of the business.\n\nBankman and Fried, both Stanford University law professors, weren’t identified by name in the CFTC suit, and haven’t been charged in their son’s case, which prosecutors are calling one of the biggest financial frauds in US history.\n\nBut now their role in their son’s crypto business is under investigation by FTX’s new management, which is working closely with federal prosecutors and US markets regulators.\n\nBankman is a Yale-educated scholar in the field of tax law, as well as a clinical psychologist who writes on the intersection of law and psychology. That expertise could become a liability if he is eventually charged with wrongdoing.\n\n“He is a highly knowledgeable and deeply expert person in areas that concern the set-up and operation of complex companies,” said Yesha Yadav, professor of law at Vanderbilt University. “Arguably, his qualifications and academic stature can work against him as part of any legal case, because the argument may be made that he really should have spotted problems.”\n\nFried, whose “scholarly interests lie at the intersection of law, economics, and philosophy,” according to her Stanford bio, earned her law degree from Harvard.\n\n“I can’t imagine a world where Bankman-Fried’s parents were not his financial and legal advisers,” said Matthew Barhoma, a criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles, who is not involved in the case.\n\nThe new CEO of FTX is John Ray III, a restructuring expert tasked with shepherding the company through its complex bankruptcy.

By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out.\n\nBased on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”\n\nFTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.\n\nThe 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed civil complaints.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nCFTC: Bankman-Fried hurt integrity of digital asset market\n\nGretchen Lowe, acting enforcement division director for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s alleged crimes hurt the entire world of cryptocurrency by undermining faith in the system.\n\n“The rippling consequences of defendant’s fraud are vast and have done significant damage to the integrity of the evolving digital asset market,” Lowe said.\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nBankman-Fried and campaign contributions\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Bankman-Fried caused \"tens of millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions to be made to candidates and committees associated with both Democrats and Republicans.\"\n\nThe contributions were \"disguised to look like they were coming from wealthy co-conspirators, when in fact, the contributions were funded by Alameda Research, with stolen customer money,\" Williams said .\n\nThe strategy behind the contributions was simple, he added. \"All of this dirty money was used in service of Bankman-Fried's desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington.\n\nWilliams declined to identify any of the candidates and committees.\n\n-- Kevin McCoy\n\nSEC: Bankman-Fried about investor safety ‘bogus’\n\nGurbir Grewal, SEC director of enforcement, said former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried repeatedly touted to investors his company’s automated risk controls that he claimed protected customer assets, which he said were “safe, segregated and secure.”\n\n“Bankman-Fried’s claims about sophisticated risk controls and other customer protections were simply bogus,” Grewal said.\n\nGrewal accused Bankman-Fried of secretly and improperly diverting FTX customer funds to the hedge fund Alameda Research. The money was used to make venture investments, lavish real-estate investments and large political donations, Grewal said.\n\n“Bankman-Fried’s entire house of cards started to crumble as crypto asset prices plummeted in May 2022 and as Alameda’s lenders demanded repayment on billions of dollars in loans,” Grewal said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nFraud of historic proportions\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, along with representatives of the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said the agencies are continuing to investigate other potential suspects who might have worked with Bankman-Fried.\n\n“If you have not reached out to us, I would encourage you to do so,” said Williams.\n\nWhen asked if investigators are targeting specific suspects, he said: “All I can say is we’re not done.”\n\nWilliams also said investigators are pursuing efforts to extradite Bankman-Fried from the Bahamas.\n\n-- Kevin McCoy\n\nFBI: Bankman-Fried preyed on customers\n\nMichael Driscoll, FBI Assistant Director in charge of the New York office, said former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is charged with diverting customer funds to pay corporate and personal expenses and investments through another company.\n\n“He preyed on his customers, the victims of this case, abusing the trust placed not only in his company, but in himself as the lead of that company,” Driscoll said. “This case is about fraud. Fraud is fraud. It does not matter the complexity.”\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nProsecutor: One of biggest frauds in history\n\nDamian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the investigation is continuing after the arrest of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nBankman-Fried was indicted on eight charges, including defrauding customers of FTX cryptocurrency exchange, lenders at Alameda Research hedge fund and investors in FTX, and violating campaign finance laws. Authorities are pursuing other suspects.\n\n“This investigation is very much ongoing and it is moving very quickly,” Williams said.\n\nLosses from the alleged fraud total $8 billion, according to authorities.\n\n“It’s so hard to compare these things, but I think it is fair to say that by anyone’s lights, this is one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,” Williams said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nPreviously:FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried arrested in Bahamas, indicted in New York, prosecutors say\n\nSecond part of hearing to be held next year\n\nRanking member Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., said in his closing statement that part two of the hearing will be held in 2023.\n\n“We know there will be ongoing conversations in the new year,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nReport:Former billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried says he's down to $100,000 in bank account\n\nWill FTX users get their money back?\n\nThe committee asked the Ray if he believes Bankman-Fried was correct in saying FTX users will receive a dollar-on-dollar return of funds at the end of bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n“That’s speculative at this point,” Ray responded.\n\nRay said his job is to find the assets and get customers their money back as quickly as possible.\n\n“It’s a mining exercise at this point,” he said. “At the end of the day, we're not going to be able to recover all the losses here. Money was spent that we'll never get back.”\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is the FTX scandal?:How the celebrity-endorsed crypto giant collapsed into chaos\n\nWhat does it mean to ‘commingle funds?’\n\nCommingling refers to mixing funds between two separate parties, according to Cornell University’s Legal Information Institute.\n\nDuring his testimony, Ray said customer assets from FTX.com were commingled with assets from the Alameda trading platform.\n\nAccording to the SEC documents, Alameda did not segregate customer funds, but instead mixed them with other assets and used them to fund trading operations and Bankman-Fried's other ventures.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is a crypto wallet?\n\nThe phrase “crypto wallet” has been thrown around like the spending of a drunken sailor after the collapse of FTX, but it’s not a leather billfold.\n\nBecause crypto currencies exist in the digital realm, a “wallet” for that currency is a metaphor for how to retrieve your own currency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nThe “wallet” basically holds the digital keys to the assets, typically through a phone app or a desktop computer. The keys are long strings of numbers and letters that are unique to the asset and match the asset.\n\nAnother distinction is that there are “hot” and “cold” wallets. Hot wallets are connected to the internet and cold wallets aren’t, which protects them from hackers.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nCrypto 101:Here are 10 cryptocurrency terms people use every day from blockchain to NFT\n\nCFTC: How the alleged scam worked\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Tuesday that FTX characterized itself as “the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto.” The financial monitor, which filed a civil lawsuit Tuesday against FTX Trading Ltd, Alameda Research LLC and Samuel Bankman-Fried, the alleged mastermind behind the companies, said the claims belied the real operations.\n\n“To the contrary, FTX customer assets were routinely accepted and held by Alameda and commingled with Alameda’s funds. Alameda, Bankman-Fried, and others also appropriated customer funds for their own operations and activities, including luxury real estate purchases, political contributions, and high-risk, illiquid digital asset industry investments, said the CFTC.\n\nThe CFTC also said its lawsuit also alleges that, acting on Bankman-Fried’s instructions, FTX employees created features in the company’s electronic code that “favored Alameda and allowed it to execute transactions even when it did not have sufficient funds available, including an … effectively limitless line of credit that allowed Alameda to withdraw billions of dollars in customer assets from FTX.”\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nCEO: FTX is 'virtually void of any internal controls'\n\nWhen asked what documents Ray has identified with respect to internal controls and governance, Ray responded: There are none.\n\n“The company is virtually void of any internal controls or documentation,” he said.\n\nRay said he has not seen any resolutions or authorizations approving massive loans taken by the company.\n\n“When Sam Bankman-Freed signs on behalf of the company, and then he signs his own loan, that should tell you a lot right there,” Ray said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nFTX CEO: Cyber experts, law enforcement tracking theft of assets\n\nFTX CEO John Ray told lawmakers the company is relying on financial experts to track where assets have gone rather than relying on the former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nRep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., asked about a Nov. 12 hack of the company that resulted in the theft of $477 million in tokens. Bankman-Fried gave an interview Nov. 29 saying he had narrowed the suspects to eight.\n\n“We’re relying on forensic and cyber security experts who are tracking the crypto,” Ray said. “You can ultimately find where the crypto ends up. We’ve got law enforcement involved. So we’re tracking it. We’ve got all the help we need on that front.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat is the FTX scandal?:How the celebrity-endorsed crypto giant collapsed into chaos\n\nCFTC court complaint alleges more than $8B in FTX customer losses\n\nCustomers of FTX lost more than $8 billion in deposits from the alleged scam engineered by Samuel Bankman-Fried and others, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleged in the civil lawsuit the financial monitor filed on Tuesday.\n\nThe complaint named Bankman-Fried, FTX Trading Ltd. and Alameda Research LLC, two of his companies. It accuses all three defendants of fraud and material misrepresentations involving the sale of digital commodities in interstate commerce. CFTC chairman issued a statement warning that “digital commodity asset markets continue to present risks for investors dur to the lack of basic protections.”\n\nAs the defendants touted FTX.com as a “model digital commodity asset platform,” they “were committing fraud to the detriment of U.S. investors and to the credibility of the digital asset markets,” said Gretchen Lowe, acting director of CFTC Enforcement.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nStatement from Mark S. Cohen – Counsel to Sam Bankman-Fried\n\n“Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nFTX CEO: FTX was ‘uniquely positioned to fail’\n\nRay said FTX’s wallets, where crypto assets are stored, were vulnerable to hacking. He said the way the company stored passwords, allowed multiple users to set up accounts, store keys in non-centralized locations and a lack of discipline for storage of wallets made it challenging to have a complete company inventory.\n\n“This company was uniquely positioned to fail,” Ray said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nCEO: FTX recovered $1B after bankruptcy\n\nFTX CEO John Ray told lawmakers the company had recovered $1 billion after losing an estimated $7 billion.\n\n“We’ve recovered over $1 billion in crypto assets,” Ray said of “coins of various nature” and securing bank accounts that had been frozen with new authorized users. “Our main goal is to secure the cash and secure the crypto assets.”\n\nRep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, asked what role Sam Bankman-Fried is playing at the company today.\n\n“The role he’s currently playing: zero,” Ray said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nFTX CEO points to “unlimited ability” to take customer funds\n\nRep. Michael San Nicholas, D-Guam, asked Ray to pinpoint a “singular cause” or “single trigger point” that led to the collapse of FTX.\n\n“It’s just the unlimited ability of those in control positions to borrow customer funds or take customer funds and then deploy them for their own use,” John J. Ray said.\n\n“That use involved margin trading, which is inherently risky, and of course they spent enormous amounts of money beyond that. It’s really the misuse of funds, and it’s as simple as that.”\n\nRay said the company has lost “in excess of $7 billion.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nRay: FTX example of ‘old-fashioned embezzlement’\n\nRay dubbed the acts of FTX as “plain old” embezzlement. He said it is only sophisticated in the way that FTX was able to hide it from people in front of their eyes.\n\n“This is really old-fashioned embezzlement,” Ray said. “This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose.”\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nReport:Former billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried says he's down to $100,000 in bank account\n\nThink like a federal prosecutor?\n\nSome members of the House committee asked John J. Ray III, the new chief executive of FTX, whether money laundering might have occurred before the company’s abrupt collapse.\n\n“There’s a lot more questions than answers, and it certainly is highly irregular and that’s certainly what’s gotten out attention,” said Ray.\n\nThe criminal indictment unsealed Tuesday against disgraced FTX executive Samuel Bankman-Fried specifically charges him with conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nRay: ‘I don’t trust a single piece of paper in this organization’\n\nWhen Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., asked Ray to elaborate on why he does not believe audited FTX financial statements are reliable, Ray emphasized the $8 billion in customer money lost.\n\n“By definition, I don’t trust a single piece of paper in this organization,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nRay: 'very few' rules at FTX\n\nWhen asked about FTX loaning out customer assets, Ray highlighted the lack of corporate controls and lack an independent board.\n\n“The owners of the business, the senior management, had virtual control of the accounts via the silos and could move money or assets around as they desired undetected by customers,” Ray said.\n\n“To the extent there were rules, and there were very few, obviously they were made to be broken,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nFTX CEO: 'Every day we are out looking for wallets'\n\nJohn J. Ray told Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, that his team continues to look for customer money in wallets and get access to those wallets.\n\n“We are securing our assets every day,” Ray said. “Every day we are out looking for wallets and keys to those wallets to maximize the recovery of value, so that’s an ongoing process. We’ve secured all the cash in the bank accounts to the extent that we can at this point.”\n\nHe said finding out how many users have lost money and when they’ll get that money back, is “a question of months.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nRay: Investigation may look into Bankman-Fried's parents\n\nRep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., asked Ray if there was any evidence of Bankman-Fried's parents’ involvement with the FTX collapse. Huizenga referenced a meeting he had in his office with Bankman-Fried in 2020 and in which his father attended.\n\n“We're investigating that as well as any other players,” Ray said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nCongressman: Change the name of crypto to 'creepy dough'\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Missouri, joked with John J. Ray that Congress should change the term “cryptocurrency” to “creepy dough currency.”\n\n“I just want to know whether you’d support changing it to ‘creepy dough,’” Cleaver asked.\n\nRay said he would leave that skill set to Congress.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nThe future of crypto:After fall of bitcoin prices, is cryptocurrency a good investment?\n\nRay: ‘More questions than answers’\n\nThe committee asked Ray if it could be possible that money laundering was occurring within FTX.\n\n“There’s a lot more questions than answers and it certainly is highly irregular and that’s certainly what’s gotten out attention,” Ray said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nCFTC files court complaint\n\nA separate civil lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said daily trading volume on FTC.com was more than $20 billion, and the company had amassed a $32 billion valuation. The company had paid sponsorships, including naming rights to a Miami sports arena, celebrity endorsements and a 2022 Super Bowl commercial that characterized FTX as “the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto.”\n\nBelying that image, FTX collapsed in November, and its customers and the world “discovered that FTX, through its sister-company Alameda, had been surreptitiously siphoning off customer funds for its own use—and over $8 billion in customer deposits were now missing,” the CFTC court complaint alleges.\n\n\"At Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives created features in the underlying code for FTX that allowed Alameda to maintain an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX,” the court complaint alleges. “FTX Trading executives also created other exceptions to FTX’s standard processes that allowed Alameda to have an unfair advantage when transacting on the platform, including quicker execution times.”\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nAccountants looking at whether IRS forms properly filed\n\nAccountants from the firm Ernst & Young are looking into whether FTX properly filled out forms such as tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service, CEO John J. Ray told Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.\n\n“They are taking a comprehensive review,” Ray said. “They’re going backwards and starting with the earlier years. We’re reviewing the return that was filed in 2020, 2021, and of course they’re looking at all of the transactions within 2022, so that review is ongoing.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nPreviously:Report: Former billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried says he's down to $100,000 in bank account\n\nRep: Cleaver: Bankman-Fried's testimony ‘disrespectful’\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., referenced Bankman-Fried's testimony, calling it “so disrespectful” and a “mess.”\n\n“There's not a person up here who would like to show this to their children,” he said.\n\nCleaver began to read one specific line from Bankman-Fried's testimony, but said he can’t read it publicly.\n\n“It makes two words. Absolutely insulting,” Cleaver said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nCongressman: 'We have to send a message' to bad actors\n\nRep. Al Green, D-Texas, questioned whether Sam Bankman-Fried could have harmed so many people by accident, saying that he thinks there must have been “malfeasance” at play that should not happen again.\n\n“They just don’t emanate from ignorance and stupidity,” Green said of FTX’s actions, “and a lot of people have been hurt.\n\n“And aside from the civil actions, I think that we have to send a message to the others who would take advantage of people that this is not going to be tolerated,” he said.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nRay: FTX unprecedented in lack of documentation\n\nWhen asked how his experience handling other bankruptcies compares to the FTX situation, Ray said FTX is unprecedented in terms of lack of documentation.\n\nRay said even the most failed companies had a roadmap as to what happened.\n\n“We're dealing with literally a paperless bankruptcy in terms of how they created this company,” he said. “It makes it very difficult to trace and track assets and particularly, as I've said, in the crypto world.”\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nRay: Bankman-Fried calling fund transfers 'mistake’ not credible\n\nRay said he doesn’t find statements made by Bankman-Fried that FTX customer funds transferred to Alameda was done by mistake.\n\n“I don't find any such statements to be credible,” Ray said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is the FTX scandal?:How the celebrity-endorsed crypto giant collapsed into chaos\n\nMore indictment details\n\nOne part of the alleged conspiracy allegedly involved an effort in which Bankman-Fried and others made illegal campaign contributions to candidates for federal office, joint fundraising committees and independent expenditure committees while using the names of other persons as the contributors, the indictment charges.\n\nThe indictment also accuses Bankman-Fried and other conspirators of making illegal contributions from corporations while disguising the actual source under the names of other people. The indictment seeks forfeiture of all gains from the alleged conspiracy.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nRay says FTX employees communicated over Slack, used Quickbooks\n\nRay said the FTX group is unusual compared to other bankruptcies he handled because FTX had no record keeping.\n\nHe said employees communicated invoices and expenses via Slack and the multi-billion dollar company used Quickbooks, an accounting software package.\n\n“We had one person really controlling this,\" he said, referencing Bankman-Fried. \"No independent board-- that's highly unusual for the size company this is and it's made all more complex because we're not dealing with widgets or something that's tangible, we're dealing with crypto.”\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nIn case you missed it:FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried arrested in Bahamas, indicted in New York, prosecutors say\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry criticizes SEC chief\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., called for regulations that spell out “clear rules of the road” for the cryptocurrency industry, and criticized the performance of Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n“We know the Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gensler’s regulation by enforcement approach is not going to stop bad actors,” McHenry said. “Next year, I look forward to hearing from Mr. Gensler early and often. And we’ll hear from him and how we can provide clarity on the application of our security platforms to trading platforms, which he has failed to do.”\n\nMcHenry is the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee and is expected to become chair at the beginning of 2023.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nRay: Bankman-Fried's loans undocumented\n\nRay said Bankman-Fried received numerous loans – some documented by individual promissory notes, others with no description of the purpose. In one case, Bankman-Fried received a $1 billion loan which he claimed he did not know the terms of the repayment, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said.\n\nRay said in one instance, Bankman-Fried signed a loan as both the issuer and recipient.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nFTX CEO: Senior managers had access to customer assets\n\nJohn J. Ray III, the CEO of FTX seeking to recover customer funds as he guides the company through bankruptcy, detailed at the House hearing Tuesday the lack of security that the firm had for controlling customer money.\n\nRay said the company’s computer infrastructure gave senior managers access to “systems that stored customer assets, without security controls to prevent them from redirecting those assets.”\n\nHe also said the company stored “certain private keys to access hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto assets without effective security controls or encryption.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nSam Bankman-Fried indicted on 8 criminal counts, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and violating campaign finance laws\n\nFederal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York on Tuesday unsealed an eight-count criminal indictment that accuses Bankman-Fried of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers and lenders, as well as conspiracy to commit commodities fraud and securities fraud.\n\nThe indictment also charges him with a money laundering conspiracy and a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and violate campaign finance laws with contributions that exceeded giving limits.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nSBF schemed with others, indictment says\n\nThe criminal indictment alleges Sam Bankman-Fried schemed with others from at least 2019 through November 2022.\n\nHe and several people not identified in the indictment allegedly agreed to defraud customers of FTX.com by misappropriating their deposits and using those funds to pay expenses and debts of Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's proprietary crypto hedge fund.\n\nThe indictment also accuses Bankman-Fried of providing misleading information to lenders about the true financial condition of Alameda Research.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nSEC alleges Bankman-Fried ran 'massive years-long fraud'\n\nInstead of running a secure crypto trading platform, Samuel Bankman-Fried \"engaged in a scheme to defraud equity investors\" from at least May 2019 until November 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges in a civil complaint filed Tuesday in the federal court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nHe raised more than $1.8 billion from investors who believed his FTX Trading Ltd. platform had appropriate controls and risk management measures, the SEC said.\n\n\"Unbeknownst to those investors (and to FTX’s trading customers), Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire,\" the complaint alleges.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nSBF spent investors' money on 'lavish real estate', political donations, SEC says\n\nInvestors in the U.S. and worldwide sent billions of dollars to Bankman-Fried's FTX platform with the belief that their assets would be secure.\n\n\"But from the start, Bankman-Fried improperly diverted customer assets to his privately-held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC, and then used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations,\" the SEC complaint alleges.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nSam Bankman-Fried's 'house of cards'\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan are expected to file a parallel criminal action against Bankman-Fried later on Tuesday.\n\n\"We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement issued with the agency's complaint. \"The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.\"\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nSEC: Alleged scheme unraveled when crypto values crashed and lenders wanted money back\n\nThe SEC court complaint said the alleged scheme began crumbling in May 2022, when cryptocurrency values plummeted.\n\nThe plunge prompted lenders to Bankman-Fried's privately-held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC, sought repayment on billions of dollars of loans. Alameda had already received billions of dollars in FTX investor assets by that point, but nonetheless was unable to meet the repayment demands, the court complaint said.\n\nTrying to stave off a collapse, \"Bankman-Fried directed FTX to divert billions more in customer assets to Alameda to ensure that Alameda maintained its lending relationships, and that money could continue to flow in from lenders and other investors,\" the SEC court complaint alleged.\n\nSBF made 'misleading' statements to investors, SEC says\n\nBankman-Fried continued the shifting of investor assets during the summer of 2022 even as it became increasingly clear that FTX and Alameda would not be able to fully repay investors and lenders, the SEC complaint said.\n\n\"He directed hundreds of millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for additional venture investments and for 'loans' to himself and other FTX executives,\" the court complaint alleged. \"All the while, he continued to make misleading statements to investors about FTX’s financial condition and risk management.\"\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nSBF built web of more than 100 companies, SEC says\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, assisted by a few associates, built an interconnected web of companies that ultimately comprised more than 100 different entities, the SEC court complaint said.\n\nThe web had Bankman-Fried at its top, and Alameda Research, his cryptocurrency hedge fund, at its center. In multiple public statements, he branded himself and his companies as \"honest stewards of crypto,\" the court complaint said. But the reality was different.\n\n\"From the start, contrary to what FTX investors and trading customers were told, Bankman-Fried continually diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda and then used those funds to continue to grow his empire, using billions of dollars to make undisclosed private venture investments, political contributions, and real estate purchases,\" the SEC court complaint alleges.\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nWho is Sam Bankman-Fried, former FTX CEO?\n\nBankman-Fried, the 30-year-old former billionaire turned political donor who started FTX, is listed on the committee's website as a witness. He was scheduled to testify before Congress for the first time since the collapse of FTX, but canceled after being arrested in the Bahamas Monday night.\n\nFTX attracted average people, promised safety, expert says\n\nFTX attracted average people who wanted to invest in cryptocurrency but didn’t want to deal with the complex processes that often comes with buying cryptocurrency, said Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.\n\nA decade ago, Yadav said, cryptocurrency traders would need to download specific software and then find someone willing to sell their cryptocurrency. On an exchange like FTX, a user would place an order and essentially be given an IOU for the crypto they bought, she said.\n\n“From the user experience, that’s awesome,” she said. On top of that, she said, “The reason it was so well regarded was because it promised safety. It promised consumer protection it promised cutting-edge products without some of the kind of riskier aspects of crypto attaching to it.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWho is new FTX CEO John J. Ray?\n\nJohn J. Ray, who replaced Bankman-Fried, is scheduled to testify. Ray previously oversaw Enron during its bankruptcy and is performing a similar service for FTX, including responding to inquiries from the Department of Justice and Securities Exchange Commission.\n\nHe told a federal bankruptcy court in November the company \"did not keep appropriate books and records,\" and used software \"to conceal the misuse of customer funds.\"\n\nHe wrote in the same filing, \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\"\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nMore:Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of FTX crypto exchange, says he will testify before Congress\n\nWhat is FTX?\n\nFTX was a tool that investors all over the world used to buy cryptocurrency and other financial instruments.

The leaders of the panel are outgoing chair Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and the expected incoming chair Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C.\n\nThe committee held hearings on the impact of the accounting fraud scandal at Enron on financial markets, and how financial regulation could be improved in light of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried has been on a media tour about FTX\n\nSince stepping down from his post in November, Bankman-Fried has appeared in interviews with news organizations like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, expressing regret over mismanagement of the company but denying any intentional wrongdoing.\n\n\"I had a duty to all of our stakeholders, to our customers, our stakeholders and to the regulators and the world to do right by them, to make sure the right things happened at the company. Clearly I didn't do a good job at that. Clearly I made a lot of mistakes that are things I would give anything to be able to do over again.\n\n\"I didn't ever try to commit fraud on anyone,\" Bankman-Fried, who goes by SBF, told the New York Times. \"I was excited about the prospects of FTX a month ago. I saw it as a thriving, growing business. I was shocked by what happened this month, and reconstructing it, there were some things I wish I had done differently.\"\n\nBankman-Fried: ‘I basically have nothing left’\n\nBankman-Fried told Good Morning America’s George Stephanopoulos that he is down to $100,00 in his bank account – a significant difference from the estimated $20 billion he said he had over the summer.\n\n“To my knowledge, I basically have nothing left,” he said. “Basically everything I had was invested in the business.”\n\nThe former FTX CEO said he took out a $1 billion loan to reinvest into the company, not for consumption.

He received a law degree the year before from Pepperdine, but it wasn't until he linked up with Hal Mumme at Iowa Wesleyan where the fruits of the Air Raid offense began.\n\nLeach went to Valdosta State and Kentucky with Mumme and, in 1998, Kentucky's offense made quarterback Tim Couch into a superstar and led to Couch being selected by the Cleveland Browns as the No. 1 overall draft pick in 1999. Leach joined Bob Stoops' staff at Oklahoma in 1999 becoming the school's offensive coordinator before taking the Texas Tech job in 2000.\n\nHow long was Mike Leach at Mississippi State?\n\nDuring Leach's three seasons at Mississippi State, the Bulldogs went 19-17, including 8-4 in 2022. His passing offense threw the ball more than any team in college football this season, averaging nearly 50 attempts and 314 yards through the air per game.\n\nWhere else has Mike Leach coached?\n\nLeach coached at Texas Tech for 10 seasons, producing some of the highest-scoring offenses during that time. His best season came in 2008 when the Red Raiders ascended to the No. 1 ranking and finished 11-2. He was fired on Dec. 30, 2009 after a player claimed mistreatment following a concussion. That player was Adam James, son of former ESPN broadcaster Craig James, who told Texas Tech then that Leach punished his son for having a concussion by having him locked in an electrical closet for hours. The claim was refuted by Leach and contradicted by witnesses. Leach eventually sued the school for wrongful termination.\n\nHis next stop was at Washington State in 2012, leading to an instant turnaround. In his eight seasons he had a 55–47 record and led the Cougars to six bowl appearances.\n\nLeach agreed to become Mississippi State's head coach on Jan. 9, 2020, with his contract reported to pay him $5 million annually.\n\nWhat is the \"Air Raid\" offense?\n\nWhile the Air Raid offense has been around for decades, perhaps its popularity can be traced to Mumme and Leach. At each of his stops, Leach's teams threw the ball nearly every play, spreading out defenses with four and sometimes five wide receivers, and taking advantage of receivers making plays in space.\n\nThe offense combined elements of a no-huddle scheme, where the quarterback is exclusively in the shotgun formation, with the offensive lineman spread out, sometimes nearly two yards apart. This allows the quarterback to make quick decisions and avoid the pass rush. Sometimes, the short passing game was an extension of the running game, which was used more infrequently over the years. Nine times in the past decade, Leach's teams were in the top ten in passes attempted.\n\nMike Leach's coaching tree\n\nSome of college football best coaches have served under Leach.\n\nSonny Dykes coached wide receivers and was the co-offensive coordinator under Leach from 2000 through 2006. He is now the head coach at TCU.\n\nDave Aranda was a graduate assistant coach under Leach from 2000 to 2002 at Texas Tech. Aranda is the current head coach at Baylor.\n\nLincoln Riley played under Leach at Texas Tech, then joined the staff and worked his way to becoming a wide receivers coach. Riley is the head coach at Southern Cal.\n\nDana Holgorson coached with Leach at Valdosta State and was Leach's offensive coordinator at Texas Tech from 2000 to 2007. Holgorson now is the head coach at Houston.\n\nKliff Kingsbury played quarterback for Leach from 2000 to 2002, throwing for 11,937 yards and 91 touchdowns during those three seasons. Kingsbury is the head coach of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals.\n\nWas Mike Leach married?\n\nLeach is survived by his wife, Sharon, and children Janeen, Kim, Cody and Kiersten.\n\nWhat were some of Mike Leach's most memorable quotes?\n\nOn pirates: \"Pirates function as a team. There were a lot of castes and classes in England at the time. But with pirates, it didn't matter if you were black, white, rich or poor. The object was to get a treasure. If the captain did a bad job, you could just overthrow him.\"\n\nOn candy corn: \"I've never liked candy corn. I think it's just awful,\" Leach said as documented by Pac-12 Network cameras. \"I think candy corn is awful. You know, it's like fruitcake. There's a reason they serve fruitcake once a year, because it's awful. There's a reason they only serve mint julips once a year, because they're awful. And there's a reason they only serve candy corn once a year, because it's awful. Now that does beg the question why they serve it at all, but, anyway, that's my opinion.\"\n\nOn hot dogs: I don’t like hot dogs. I’ve never liked hot dogs even when I was a kid,” Leach said at the 2017 Pac-12 media days. “I think some of that started when I was a really young kid. You know, I’ve had bologna sandwich after bologna sandwich, so anything that even remotely resembled bologna, I hated. And you know, everyone always says, ‘Go to the ball game. Or, eat a hot dog.’ Not me. And no, it’s not a sandwich. I’m not into hot dogs.\"\n\nOn Big Foot: \"We found bones of dinosaurs and everything else, but we haven't found bones that I've heard of, of Bigfoot. It would be fun if there's Bigfoot. I hope there's Bigfoot. But my guess would be there's not.\"\n\nWas Mike Leach on 'Friday Night Lights'?\n\nDuring the fourth season of \"Friday Night Lights\", Leach portrayed a \"random loon\" at a gas station who implores coach Eric Taylor to \"swing your sword\" and \"find your inner pirate.\"\n\nWhat's next for Mississippi State?\n\nThe Bulldogs are slated to play Illinois in the ReliaQuest Bowl on Jan. 2 in Tampa, Florida. When Leach was hospitalized, the school announced that defensive coordinator Zach Arnett was placed in charge of the football team. Bulldogs interim athletic director Bracky Brett told ESPN that Mississippi State will play in the bowl game and Arnett will coach the team.\n\n\"The players are 100% behind playing this bowl game and doing what Coach Leach would expect them to do,\" Brett said. \"We all know that's what Coach Leach would want, and it's what we should do.\"\n\nThe ReliaQuest Bowl will be played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. Leach was know to have an affinity for pirates and the stadium has a 100-foot long pirate ship located in the north end zone.\n\n\"It's only fitting that we play this game and honor Coach Leach in a stadium that has a pirate ship,\" Brett said.\n\nThe Clarion Ledger (Mississippi) contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/sport/mike-leach-death-mississippi-state-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Mike Leach: Mississippi State head football coach has died at 61 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMississippi State head football coach Mike Leach died Monday night from heart condition complications, the university announced on Tuesday.

He led the Bulldogs to an 8-4 record this season.\n\nLeach compiled a 158-107 overall record in 21 seasons – 10 at Texas Tech, eight at Washington State and three at Mississippi State.\n\nTexas Tech said in a statement, “Texas Tech Athletics joins the countless others across the game of football who mourn the passing of Mike Leach.”\n\n“Coach Leach will be forever remembered as one of the most innovative offensive minds in college football history. His impact on Texas Tech Football alone will live on in history as one of the greatest tenures in the history of our program.”\n\nSimilarly, Washington State remembered the man who “changed the game of football.”\n\nWSU Director of Athletics Pat Chun said, “We were fortunate to have Coach Leach lead the WSU Football program for 8 years.

On Friday, the conflict also spilled into an online court hearing that spanned more than three hours.\n\nBoth sides dug in. An attorney for Tech said in the hearing that Leach's hired guns were “game-playing” and accused them of making “constant misrepresentations.\"\n\nBut Leach has said it's the opposite and is prepared for a long battle.\n\n\"Mike will go to his death demanding the truth and demanding they pay him what they owe him,\" Leach’s investigator, Wayne Dolcefino, told USA TODAY Sports. \"I’ve got no indication that coach Leach isn’t prepared to fight the war until he dies.\"\n\nFollow every game: Latest NCAA College Football Scores and Schedules\n\nLeach hired Dolcefino in 2017, enlisting his services as an attack dog that has sued Tech to obtain public documents related to Leach’s termination there in December 2009. Tech fired Leach for cause, saying he mistreated a player suffering from a concussion. That player was Adam James, son of former ESPN broadcaster Craig James. Craig James told Tech then that Leach punished his son for having a concussion by having him locked in an electrical closet for hours, a narrative that Leach said is false and contradicted by witnesses.\n\nTo keep fighting this fight, Leach, arguably Tech's best coach in history, is bankrolling Dolcefino's lawsuit but not participating in it directly and did not appear in Friday's hearing.\n\nIn his view, this is a battle for truth and unpaid bills. He said Tech still owes him about $2.4 million for his final season there in 2009, when the Red Raiders finished 9-4. His quest for documents also is designed to expose what happened to him at Tech and any other shenanigans he might find.\n\nIn response, Tech has said it has paid Leach what it owed him and complied with the Texas public-records law. Tech then drew its own line in the sand with a statement on Sept. 1.\n\n“In no possible conclusion of this lawsuit will the university pay any money to its former employee coach Mike Leach. Not even $1,” attorneys from the Texas Attorney General's office wrote in a court filing on behalf of Tech.\n\nNCAA RE-RANK 1-76:Louisiana-Lafayette up, Florida State down in latest\n\nThe same attorneys also recently described the situation as harassment and a “circus.”\n\n“This lawsuit is not about obtaining documents, but instead it is just a vehicle to harass the university and its officials over the decision to terminate coach Mike Leach in 2009,” they said in court documents Aug. 31.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit in 2010, Leach accused Tech of breach of contract but never got his day in court. He lost his bid for monetary damages on the basis that Tech had sovereign immunity that protected it from being successfully sued for damages as a state institution.\n\nThis time, the lawsuit is about the Texas Public Information Act and whether Leach's investigator is getting public documents he's entitled to get from Tech. Dolcefino's firm in Houston, Dolcefino Consulting, filed suit against Tech in January 2018, seeking to compel Tech to produce those records associated with Leach's termination.\n\nTwo attorneys in Dallas, Julie Pettit and Michael Hurst, are litigating the battle in court on behalf of Dolcefino Consulting, which is working on behalf of Leach.\n\nLeach, 59, declined comment, deferring to Dolcefino and the attorneys. Tech spokesman Chris Cook also declined comment, deferring to comments made by Tech’s attorneys in court proceedings.\n\n“He is furious about this,” Dolcefino said of Leach. “Mike rarely tells me how to do what I’m doing. He’s just so pissed. I’ve never seen anyone who’s been screwed for 11 years who’s still so pissed.”\n\nRecent drama\n\nThe case – and its participants – have taken some strange turns since it started.\n\n►In late June, Dolcefino, a former television reporter, was arrested for contempt of court in an unrelated case after allegedly interrupting a court proceeding in Houston to try to interview a judge. Dolcefino’s attorney in that case has disputed the charge, but Dolcefino does have a flair for confrontation.\n\nHis website has posted provocative video commentaries on the Tech case, including a video posted July 28 in which Leach rips Tech.\n\n“My records aren’t the only ones Texas Tech is covering up,” Leach said in the video. “They’re covering up any records they feel like covering up.”\n\n►Last year, a legal assistant in the Attorney General’s Office working on behalf of Tech “mistakenly” made 6,000 pages of Tech documents available to one of Dolcefino’s attorneys. Tech is now trying to claw back those records through the court, saying they were privileged records and that all copies should be destroyed.\n\n“Good luck getting them back,” Dolcefino said in the video July 28. Dolcefino told USA TODAY that evidence in these documents “sort of proves that they altered the reports to make it look like Mike Leach did something worse” than what happened in 2009.\n\nDolcefino also said Tech tried to drastically overcharge him for record production, withheld documents responsive to his requests and even destroyed such records. Tech has said it released some documents as requested and advised Dolcefino that it was withholding others pursuant to the law.\n\n“It is time for (Dolcefino’s) circus to end,” Tech’s attorneys said in the filing Aug. 31. “The time for sideshows and distractions and is over. The university rightfully fired coach Leach when he punished an athlete for having a concussion and rightfully withheld documents from disclosure under various TPIA exceptions.”\n\n►The court case is based in Tech’s home of Lubbock but now is being overseen by its third judge, Paul Davis, who is based in Austin, more than 350 miles away. Davis has conducted hearings via Zoom conference during the pandemic. “We’ve run out of judges in West Texas who are not conflicted,” Dolcefino said, suggesting Tech has heavy influence in the region.\n\nDavis retired from the district court in Austin in late 2004 but still presides as a visiting judge by assignment. Dolcefino eventually wants a jury trial in Lubbock.\n\n“My hands are tied behind my back a little bit in that I’m the third judge on the case,” Davis said in the hearing Friday.\n\n►In the hearing Friday, attorney Hurst argued that the office of the state’s top cop –Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton – should be disqualified from representing Tech because it has a conflict of interest. Paxton’s office is supposed to enforce the Texas Public Information Act on behalf of the public, including Dolcefino, but attorneys from Paxton’s office also are defending Tech in this case because Tech is a state institution.\n\n\"Ray Charles could see that (conflict), and not only is he blind, but he’s dead,\" Hurst said Friday, referring to the late blind singer. Hurst said Tech should be represented by outside counsel instead of the Attorney General's Office.\n\nAn attorney for Paxton’s office, Cynthia Akatugba, said there is no conflict. She said Friday the Attorney General’s Office essentially has separate walled-off divisions that work in public-records enforcement and general litigation.\n\nThe judge said he would rule on the matter in coming weeks. Dolcefino plans to keep fighting the fight in meantime.\n\n“If those weasels don’t want to pay the guy for the football season, you can’t make people do the right thing,” Dolcefino said. “But you can expose them, and you can follow them around, and you can know things about their business practices and their personal relationships. Look, I have chosen not to get ugly other than fight for the records, but I know all kinds of stuff now. And I’ve chosen not to do that because I kind of really expected them at some point to say, 'Here are the records. Go away.’ But now it’s a war.”\n\nLeach spent 10 seasons at Tech before his firing. He then coached at Washington State for eight seasons until his hiring at Mississippi State in January. Leach’s Bulldogs are scheduled to open the season Sept. 26 at LSU.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

His boundless curiosity and fascination for people, places and things made him famous beyond the field, a unique character in sports.\n\nLeach, who helped revolutionize football from high school to the NFL with the Air Raid offense, died Monday night following complications from a heart condition, the school said Tuesday. He was 61.\n\nLeach fell ill Sunday at his home in Starkville, Mississippi, near the university. He was treated at a local hospital before being airlifted to University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) away.\n\n“Mike was a giving and attentive husband, father and grandfather. He was able to participate in organ donation at UMMC as a final act of charity,” the family said in a statement issued by Mississippi State. “We are supported and uplifted by the outpouring of love and prayers from family, friends, Mississippi State University, the hospital staff, and football fans around the world. Thank you for sharing in the joy of our beloved husband and father’s life.”\n\nIn 21 seasons as a head coach at Texas Tech, Washington State and Mississippi State, Leach went 158-107 after taking an unusual path to the profession.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NCAA College Football Scores and Schedules\n\nLeach fought through a bout with pneumonia late in this season, coughing uncontrollably at times during news conferences, but seemed to be improving, according to those who worked with him.\n\nNews of him falling gravely ill swept through college football the past few days and left many who knew him stunned, hoping and praying for a recovery.\n\n“It’s hard to put into words the impact that Mike Leach had on the players he coached, the game of football and me personally,” TCU coach Sonny Dykes posted on Twitter. “He was a unique personality and independent thinker and a great friend. No one had a greater influence on my life other than my father.”\n\nIn Starkville, under gray skies, the videoboard at Davis Wade Stadium showed an image of a smiling Leach and the message: “In loving memory.” Black ribbons were tied to the stadium gates and flowers were left there to honor the coach.\n\n“Mike’s keen intellect and unvarnished candor made him one of the nation’s true coaching legends,” Mississippi State President Mark Keenum said. “His passing brings great sadness to our university, to the Southeastern Conference, and to all who loved college football. I will miss Mike’s profound curiosity, his honesty and his wide-open approach to pursuing excellence in all things.”\n\nAt Martin Stadium in Pullman, Washington, a similar tribute was on the videoboard above a snow-covered field.\n\nLeach was known for his pass-happy offense, wide-ranging interests — he wrote a book about Native American leader Geronimo, had a passion for pirates and taught a class about insurgent warfare — and rambling, off-the-cuff news conferences.\n\nAn interview with Leach was as likely to veer into politics, wedding planning or hypothetical mascot fights as it was to stick to football. He considered Donald Trump a friend before the billionaire businessman ran for president and then campaigned for him in 2016.\n\nHe traveled all over the world and most appreciated those who stepped outside of their expertise.\n\n“One of the biggest things I admire about Michael Jordan, he got condemned a lot for playing baseball. I completely admired that,” Leach told The Associated Press last spring. “I mean, you’re gonna be dead in 100 years anyway. You’ve mastered basketball and you’re gonna go try to master something else, and stick your neck out and you’re not afraid to do it, and know that a lot of people are gonna be watching you while you do it. I thought it was awesome.”\n\nLeach’s teams were consistent winners at programs where success did not come easily. His quarterbacks put up massive passing statistics, running a relatively simple offense called the Air Raid that he did not invent but certainly mastered.\n\nSix of the 20 best passing seasons in major college football history were by quarterbacks who played for Leach, including four of the top six.\n\nCalling plays from a folded piece of paper smaller than an index card, Leach turned passers such as B.J. Symons (448.7 yards per game), Graham Harrell (438.8), Connor Halliday (430.3) and Anthony Gordon (429.2) into record-setters and Heisman Trophy contenders.\n\n“You have to make choices and limit what you’re going to teach and what you’re going to do. That’s the hard part,” Leach told The AP about the Air Raid’s economical playbook.\n\nLeach also had a penchant for butting heads with authority, and he wasn’t shy about criticizing players he felt were not playing with enough toughness.\n\nA convergence of those traits cost Leach his first head coaching job. He went 84-43 with the Red Raiders, never having a losing season at the Big 12 school and reaching No. 2 in the country in 2008 with a team that went 11-2 and matched a school record for victories.\n\nHe was fired by Texas Tech in December 2009 after being accused of mistreating a player, Adam James — the son of former ESPN announcer and NFL player Craig James — who had suffered a concussion.\n\nHe refused to apologize for the conflict, and eventually sued Texas Tech for wrongful termination. The school was protected by state law, but Leach never stopped trying to fight that case. He also filed a lawsuit against ESPN and Craig James that was later dismissed.\n\nWhile out of coaching for two seasons, Leach and his wife, Sharon, retreated to their home in Key West, Florida, where he rode his bike around town and knocked back drinks at the bars.\n\nHe returned to coaching in the Pac-12, but never gave up that beloved home in the Keys.\n\nLeach landed at Washington State in 2012. After three losing seasons, the Cougars soon looked very much like his Texas Tech teams. In 2018, Washington State went 11-2, setting a school record for victories, and was ranked as high as No. 7 in the country.\n\nLeach moved to the SEC in 2020, taking over at Mississippi State. After years of questions about whether Leach’s spread offense could be successful in the nation’s most talented football conference, the Bulldogs set an SEC record for yards passing in his very first game against defending national champion LSU.\n\nBorn March 9, 1961, in tiny Susanville, California, Leach grew up in even smaller Cody, Wyoming. Raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he attended BYU and got a law degree from Pepperdine.\n\nLeach didn’t play college football — rugby was his sport — but watching the innovative passing attack used by then-BYU coach LaVell Edwards at a time when most teams were still run-heavy piqued his interest in drawing up plays.\n\nIn 1987, he broke into college coaching at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, and spent a year coaching football in Finland, but it was at Iowa Wesleyan where he found his muse. Head coach Hal Mumme had invented the Air Raid while coaching high school in Texas. At Iowa Wesleyan, with Leach as offensive coordinator, it began to take hold and fundamentally change the way football was played.\n\nMumme also recalled spending hours with Leach in the car, driving to see recruits and learn as much about offense as they could. The conversations ranged from the existence of aliens and Bigfoot to Civil War history to the best fast-food burgers.\n\n“I mean, we probably covered it all,” Mumme told The AP.\n\nLeach followed Mumme to Valdosta State and then to the SEC at Kentucky, smashing passing records along the way. He spent one season as Oklahoma’s offensive coordinator in 1999 before getting his own program at Texas Tech.\n\nFrom there, the Air Raid spread like wild and became the predominant way offense was run in the Big 12 Conference and beyond.\n\nLeach’s extensive coaching tree includes Dykes, USC’s Lincoln Riley, Houston’s Dana Holgorsen and Kliff Kingsbury of the Arizona Cardinals.\n\n“Coach — You will certainly be missed, but your impact on so many will live on — Thankful for every moment. You changed my life and so many others,” Riley posted on Twitter.\n\nThis past season, Leach’s Mississippi State team finished 8-4, including a 24-22 victory Thanksgiving night over Mississippi in the intense rivalry known as the Egg Bowl. It was his final game.\n\nLeach is survived by his wife and four children, Janeen, Kimberly, Cody and Kiersten.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Gary B.

He had served as a college football head coach for 21 seasons, with previous stops at Texas Tech (2000-09) and Washington State (2012-19).\n\nFollow every game: Latest NCAA College Football Scores and Schedules\n\nLeach's most memorable, and perhaps most polarizing, coaching stint came during his decade coaching Texas Tech. He was fired from Texas Tech on Dec. 30, 2009 for cause, with the university saying he mistreated a player suffering from a concussion. That player was Adam James, son of former ESPN broadcaster Craig James. Craig James told Texas Tech then that Leach punished his son for having a concussion by having him locked in an electrical closet for hours, a narrative that Leach said is false and contradicted by witnesses. Leach eventually sued the school for wrongful termination.\n\nLeach posted a 158-107 record and 16 winning seasons during his time as a coach. He led his programs to 18 bowl games, winning eight of those.\n\nKnown as an offensive strategist who is credited as being one of the originators of the high-powered \"Air Raid\" passing offense, Leach was also known for his often eccentric responses to questions asked at news conferences. Of the 50 most productive individual seasons for passing yards in FBS history, 10 of them are by players who were on teams that Leach coached.\n\nIn 2018, after leading Washington State to its first 11-win season in program history, Leach won the American Football Coaches Association National Coach of the Year award. He was also honored in 2008 with three national coach of the year awards, following Texas Tech's 11-2 campaign.\n\nOn Sunday, Mississippi State President Mark E. Keenum and interim athletic director Bracky Brett said in a statement that defensive coordinator Zach Arnett would be \"in charge of the MSU football team\" during Leach's absence.\n\nThe Bulldogs (8-4, 4-4 SEC) still plan to face Illinois (8-4, 5-4 Big 10) in the ReliaQuest Bowl on Jan. 2 (11 a.m. ET, ESPN) in Tampa, Florida. It is unclear if the game will be played.\n\nBrett told ESPN's Chris Low: \"The players are 100 percent behind playing this bowl game and doing what Coach Leach would expect them to do.\"\n\nTributes for Leach\n\nThe news of Leach's death prompted a quick and emotional reaction on social media, including many whom coached or played with him.\n\nArizona Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury had a historic college football career at Texas Tech, including three seasons under the tutelage of Leach. He graduated with a slew of NCAA records, including single-season and career passing attempts, single-season and career passing completions and highest single-game completion percentage.\n\nKingsbury remembered Leach fondly with a statement saying he wouldn't \"be where I am today if not for Mike Leach and everything he taught me about the game.\"\n\nLane Kiffin, who coaches Mississippi State in-state rival Ole Miss, told ESPN, \"You can have great rivalries and passion and still love each other. I loved (Coach Leach).\"\n\nCollege football radio and TV analyst Paul Finebaum called Leach \"the smartest coach I've ever been around.\"\n\nEven actor Matthew McConaughey took to social media to honor his friend.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Scooby Axson and The Clarion Ledger (Miss.) also contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2022/12/13/mike-leach-mississippi-state-football-coach-bob-stoops/10887386002/", "title": "'Nobody like him': Mike Leach was one of a kind – take it from Bob ...", "text": "Mike Leach did not do brief phone calls. Bob Stoops learned this years ago.\n\nWhen Leach called, inevitably late at night, Stoops knew what awaited on the other end of that line: Answer the phone, and be entertained into the wee hours with conversation about who knows what.\n\nAnswer that phone, and Leach would talk … and talk some more – about anything.\n\n\"Buddies that know him and love him, he’ll call you at midnight, and sometimes you answer, you don’t get off the phone until 1:30 in the morning,\" Stoops, the former longtime Oklahoma coach, said Monday, before Leach died at age 61, “and then, sometimes, if you’re too tired, you don’t answer, because you know it’s going to be 1:30 or 2. It’s going to be an hour and a half conversation.\"\n\nLEACH'S BEST QUOTES, FUNNIEST MOMENTS:From candy corn to Bigfoot to wedding advice\n\nFollow every game: Latest NCAA College Football Scores and Schedules\n\nSTAY UP-TO-DATE: Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now!\n\nAnd the conversation might have stray into any direction, when talking to this man of many interests.\n\nStoops recalled stopping by Leach’s office after Stoops had hired Leach to be Oklahoma’s offensive coordinator ahead of the 1999 season.\n\nA photo of Geronimo hung in Leach’s office, and Stoops tumbled into a chat with Leach about the Apache leader and medicine man. An hour later, and Leach was still discussing Geronimo.\n\n\"Obsessed with Geronimo,\" Stoops said of Leach.\n\nUnique is the word Stoops kept returning to as he shared a few Leach stories with me on Monday, while his friend remained hospitalized. Leach, Mississippi State's third-year coach, died Monday night following complications from a heart condition, MSU announced. He was 61.\n\nLeach coached from Pori, Finland, to Pullman, Washington, amid a fascinating career.\n\nStoops hired Leach to his inaugural Sooners staff because he knew firsthand how much of a pain it was to defend a Leach offense.\n\nStoops had been Florida’s defensive coordinator while Leach coordinated Kentucky’s offense under Hal Mumme.\n\nStoops knew Mumme wouldn’t leave an SEC coaching position to run Oklahoma’s offense, so he inquired about Leach, Mumme’s protégé.\n\nCould Leach run the offense on his own, for Stoops at Oklahoma?\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Mumme told Stoops.\n\nLeach was at OU for just one season – he left to become Texas Tech’s coach – but his impact was profound in helping Stoops jumpstart a program that had been a snoozing giant.\n\nNot only did Leach bring Mumme's air raid offense to OU, he helped secure quarterback talent that would aid the Sooners for years. In that lone offseason with Leach on staff, Oklahoma signed Josh Heupel as a junior college transfer, inked Jason White out of high school and added Nate Hybl as a transfer from Georgia.\n\nLeach – and his offense – were instrumental in the recruiting haul.\n\n\"He was the guy. That’s why they came with us,\" Stoops said of OU’s quarterback class that year.\n\nHeupel became a Heisman Trophy runner-up in 2000, and the Sooners won the national championship that season. Hybl became a Rose Bowl MVP. White would win the Heisman in 2003.\n\nHeupel, in particular, was Leach's prized recruit, out of Snow College in Utah.\n\n\"Josh was not highly recruited whatsoever, at all, but Mike loved him,\" Stoops recalled. \"He said, ‘This is our guy,’ and I trusted Mike. I liked watching Josh on tape, and I said, ‘I’m going to trust you. If that’s what you want, we’re going to do it.’\"\n\nHeupel connected with Leach while they watched game film seated on Leach's office floor in OU's new football complex.\n\n\"We didn’t have furniture yet, because we were just moving into the Switzer Center,\" Leach told the USA TODAY Network's Vols Wire in 2021. \"We sat on the floor watching film after film – that was when it was VHS still – and talked offense.\"\n\nAfter Leach left OU, he made a career out of winning at places where wins don't come easily – Texas Tech, Washington State and Mississippi State. His pass-happy offense traveled with him. Sixteen winning seasons in 21 years as a coach, including an 8-4 mark this season.\n\nLeach's successful 10-year tenure at Texas Tech created a ripple effect throughout high school offenses in Texas.\n\nOklahoma, then Texas Tech, had provided Leach a bigger platform to showcase the air raid. It caught on.\n\n\"You look around the state of Texas, about every high school, for the most part, probably 80% of them, had some forms of his offense,\" Stoops said. \"He had a huge influence from his time at Tech and with us.\"\n\nLeach's coaching tree is far-reaching, too. Just look at this year's Heisman Trophy balloting.\n\nThree of the top five vote-getters for the Heisman (winner Caleb Williams, Southern Cal; second-place Max Duggan, TCU; and fifth-place Hendon Hooker, Tennessee) play for coaches who either played for Leach or coached under him.\n\nUSC's Lincoln Riley and TCU's Sonny Dykes coached for Leach at Texas Tech. Heupel is in his second season coaching Tennessee.\n\nBut to label Leach as a master of offense is to pigeonhole a coach of broad interests.\n\nThe year Leach worked on Stoops' staff, Oklahoma's coaches sometimes would gather at Mark Mangino's apartment after work. Coaches would tap out as the hours wore on, while Leach forged ahead, ever the night owl, ever curious.\n\n\"Mangino would be going to bed, and Mike would be sitting on the end of the bed, still watching ‘Howard Stern,'\" Stoops said.\n\nUnique,\" Stoops added. \"There’s nobody like him, I promise you.”\n\nBlake Toppmeyer is an SEC Columnist for the USA TODAY Network.

He says they cheated him and stole his money.\n\nAnd he’s not letting this go. After his controversial firing by Tech in 2009, the former Red Raiders football coach still wants the school to pay him what he says he’s owed for that year, when Tech had one of its best seasons ever at 9-4.\n\nBy his calculations, he’s owed about $2.5 million, including $1.6 million in guaranteed income from his television and radio shows and other marketing deals.\n\n“This thing won’t really go away,” Leach told USA TODAY Sports. “And it’ll never go away until this thing is settled. And it should be settled, because why should the future generation bear the black eye and the cloud that their university cheated their most successful coach in history? And why should I bear that, some of the 10 most productive years of my career? I was cheated out of my salary, and all the great memories that I, fans, players and coaches had, are diminished.”\n\nMORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL\n\nFollow every game: Latest NCAA College Football Scores and Schedules\n\nFootball never really died at UAB, even after it was killed, and now Blazers are back\n\nNCAA proposal would stop schools, coaches from holding transfers hostage\n\nNew Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley inherits plenty of talent, big expectations\n\nLeach, now entering his sixth season as the head coach at Washington State, previously sued Tech for monetary damages but lost when the Texas Supreme Court rejected his appeal in 2012. He lost on the basis that Tech, as a state institution in Texas, had sovereign immunity that protected it from being successfully sued for damages.\n\nAnd that’s what really gets him steamed, even now, years after that and other related grievances were dismissed in state court. So why not just let it go?\n\nLeach has a few reasons.\n\nLeach’s legacy\n\nLeach says he never got his day in court to air out the details of his firing, denying him justice in his view because of Tech’s immunity to his lawsuit. And because there’s been a change in leadership at Tech, he’s gained hope that current school administrators would reconsider out of fairness.\n\nHe’s also proud of what he accomplished in Lubbock, with a legacy that includes one of his former Red Raiders quarterbacks — Kliff Kingsbury — now leading the program as head coach. Leach won more games (84) than any other coach in Tech history and wants the school, his former players and himself to be able to celebrate that legacy instead of having this dispute tarnishing it and making it awkward.\n\nNext year, for example, will be the 10th anniversary of Tech’s 11-2 season of 2008. If the school wanted to take advantage of that anniversary to boost fan pride, would it honor the players, but avoid mentioning Leach? When Leach retires someday, will Tech ever want to bring Leach back to Lubbock to honor that era and rekindle all the good feelings that came with it?\n\nTech hasn’t won more than eight games in a season since he left, and his popularity has strong staying power among Red Raiders fans.\n\n“I had a great time at Texas Tech,” said Leach, who coached at Tech for 10 seasons. “Texas Tech is a fantastic place with fantastic people, with a few notable exceptions. Texas Tech should be allowed to celebrate their legacy, and so should I. Any way you slice it, it was the winningest period in the history of Tech. We went to more bowl games than any other time in history … And then for 2009, to not pay me? Think about how egregious that is.”\n\nTech has disputed Leach’s assertions and has said it paid Leach what he was owed according to his contract.\n\n“The courts have ruled on this matter,\" the school said in a statement Thursday. \"We have resolved this issue and have moved forward.”\n\n`There hasn’t been justice’\n\nAfter beating him in court, the school doesn’t have to pay him another dime unless it can be persuaded otherwise.\n\nThe controversy stems from events in December 2009, when Tech fired Leach for legal cause over his alleged mistreatment of a player suffering from a concussion. That player was Adam James, son of former ESPN broadcaster Craig James. Craig James told then-Tech chancellor Kent Hance in an e-mail that his son was punished by Leach for having a concussion and was locked in an electrical closet for hours — a story that Leach denies and was contradicted by witness statements.\n\nWhat to like about the preseason top 25 college football teams\n\n10 college football coaches on the hot seat entering the 2017 season\n\nESPN reveals college football schedule for Week 1 and other prime time games\n\n“I didn’t lock Adam James anywhere. I didn’t tell Adam James to go anywhere,” Leach said. “I told the trainer to get him off the field.”\n\nLeach’s 2009 contract with Tech says that if he were fired “for cause,” then the university’s “sole obligation” is to pay him his base pay of $300,000 and other performance incentives. Tech officials say he was fired for cause, but Leach says that cause wasn’t proven in court and was false.\n\nLeach says he got the $300,000 in base pay but not the $1.6 million in “guaranteed” income, or the $800,000 retention bonus that was due to him if he was the school’s coach on Dec. 31, 2009.\n\nTech fired him a day earlier, avoiding that expense, but Leach says that bonus was “six years in the making” and due that year.\n\nIn addition to the concussion issue, Hance also indicated Leach cursed at him at one point, which Leach says is a lie.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports reached out to Hance and got a response from Dicky Grigg, an attorney who represented Tech in the Leach litigation.\n\n\"Before Coach Leach was terminated, Texas Tech officials worked with him to try to resolve an extremely volatile situation,\" Grigg said in a statement. \"Coach Leach’s response: Cuss out his boss, sue his employer, and demanding millions and millions of dollars.\n\n\"Ultimately, Leach’s mistreatment of a student-athlete with a brain concussion, coupled with his subsequent insubordinate behavior, left the university with no choice but to fire him. Coach Leach was justifiably terminated for cause in conformity with his contract.\"\n\nGrigg said Tech should not pay Leach.\n\n\"Even after Coach Leach sued Texas Tech, we actively participated in trying to settle the case, but the Leach team was totally unreasonable,\" Grigg said. \"The courts determined Texas Tech does not owe Leach any money. Although I do not speak for the University, in my opinion, given the courts’ rulings, it would be improper for Texas Tech to pay Coach Leach. This matter is over.\"\n\nHance retired as Tech chancellor in 2014. Leach still has particular ire for him and the sovereign immunity protection that Tech used to shield itself from his lawsuit — a concept he says undermines the credibility of contracts with public entities in Texas. “You’d be hard-pressed to name any first-world country that does business that way,” Leach said of the Texas law.\n\nAnd he’s not ready to bury the issue. To him, it’s about principle and pride, not just money. In 2014, an anonymous party of “alumni and fans of Texas Tech” took out a full-page advertisement in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, asking Tech to “do the right thing,” pay Leach and not hide behind sovereign immunity. It didn’t work. After this story was published, Leach further criticized Tech on Twitter.\n\n“There hasn’t been justice on this,” Leach said. “I think that there needs to be. How is this justified? I mean, it’s not justified any way you slice it. If they think it’s justified, let’s go to court. You prove your case in court. They don’t want to go near a court room because they know what will happen, because they flat-out cheated me. And they lied, and they stole. And they know that’s what they did, and they wouldn’t be so resistant to go to trial if they were confident in their case. And they haven’t refuted any of the facts because they can’t.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2017/08/16/washington-states-mike-leach-worlds-most-interesting-weighs-anything-everything-even-college-footbal/573438001/", "title": "Mike Leach: Washington State football coach covers it all in Q&A", "text": "PULLMAN, Wash. -- Washington State head coach Mike Leach was winding down in his office after football practice this week when a reporter posed questions about a number of potentially squeamish subjects, including North Korean nukes and the Bible.\n\nAlmost any other major-college football coach likely would dodge and deflect.

The interview is edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nWhat about North Korea?\n\n“The answer lies in China,” Leach said, meaning the Chinese must play a big role in taming their neighbor’s threats of missile attacks against the United States. He said the international community let the North Korea problem fester for decades because it was easier to just not deal with it. “The whole world wanted to go about their life, and live a happy life, and tend to their families and things like that.

If there’s an emergency thing, fine, you can convene on something. We have too many knee-jerk reactions. If you get placed on a committee, you have too many people thinking `I have to do something. I have to make a difference.’ Well maybe the best difference is not doing anything because nothing needs to be fixed. Rather than create a ripple effect and put a wrench in the works, the best thing is to do nothing.”\n\nWhat about more money for college players?\n\n“I’m not against it as long as it’s the same (spending for schools). Don’t get in a bidding war. But this notion of making them professionals, well then what? You’re going to have a draft (for players)? If the walk-on player plays and you don’t (as the paid player), are we going to take your money and give it to him (the walk-on player)?\n\n“Here’s what I’d love (in a professional-player culture): If you don’t go to class, all right fine, I’ll fine you. If you’re late, you get a fine. And the No. 1 running back in the country wants to go to all these big-name schools? Well guess what? Molly Putz has the first pick in the draft.”\n\nWhen’s the last time you turned on a computer?\n\n“Does my phone count?”\n\nWhat about that desktop computer on your desk over there?\n\n“Never. Not one time.”\n\nWhy not?\n\n“I’m more interested in people than machines. Then as time went on, as I started working with younger people, virtually everyone in the room was better at it than I am. Why have the amateur do it? It’s a combination of lack of interest and the availability of better people to do it.”\n\nHow many times have you read the Bible? (Leach is a Mormon who went to Brigham Young but is known to enjoy coffee and tea. He also has been known to say not-so-holy words sometimes with his players.)\n\n“Four. I read the entire Old Testament and New Testament. I’m on my fifth. Despite some of my bad habits along with those four times, I read the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. Yeah, I’ve got bad habits, and I’m sure I’ve got a red dot next my name.”\n\nWhen and how do you do this?\n\nLeach says he reads the King James version of the Bible chronologically and often reads it in church. He also says he reads about 10 pages the night before games and other times throughout the year. It’s not exactly light reading.\n\n“I’m not going to tell you sometimes I’m not kind of pushing and forcing, thinking I’ll be glad when I get to the end of the 10 pages. It’s a shame to say that, but, you know.”\n\nWhat do you get out of it?\n\n“Really, I would describe it as kind of a relaxation, a calmness and clarity to your thoughts. There’s enough conflict to be aware of in the Bible, but then also, just kind of the biggest point of all, which is that there’s more to this, and life’s a process. You keep working through it, and there’s going to be ups and downs. And it’s not like `Oh goodie, I get a big reward at the end.’ I don’t view it that way.

Never say never. Both are good. Both are fantastic. What’s fantastic here in college is it’s such an exciting time in a person’s life. What’s good about the NFL is it’s all football.

You have picture of you and him together in your office here.\n\nWhen’s the last time you talked to him?\n\n“It would have been at that campaign event.”\n\nWhat do you think of his term so far?\n\n“It’s still unfolding. There’s still going to be more sparks fly. It’s going to happen in both parties, too.”\n\nLeach declined to get into detail about specific controversies. He said he respects Trump and wants a more dynamic federal legislature, whose members, he says, should have limited terms.\n\n“What me and an awful lot of Americans wanted was something more dynamic,” he said of last year’s election. “The right and left wanted this, and that’s why this thing has shaped up in the fashion that it did.”\n\nHe’s also big supporter of free speech and wants better civil discourse in this country in general — in which it’s OK to attack ideas but not the people expressing those ideas.\n\n“First of all, there needs to be mandatory civics classes. If you’re going to be educated in this country, you should be required to know and understand your government: how it’s set up, what your constitution says, what your rights are, how the government works and how to create and affect change. You should be required to study it. Freedom of speech should be wide open as long as it doesn’t incite violence.”\n\nWhat’s your favorite TV show?\n\n“Gunsmoke.”\n\nDo you like the eccentric TV show Twin Peaks. There’s an old version and a new one on Showtime.\n\n“The old one’s good. The new one, I don’t like very much. His whole thing is like the dude’s on acid. I’ve seen some good episodes, but have your fast-forward ready. There are scenes where the guy just wanders.”\n\nIs that a photo of Billy Martin (the late baseball manager) on your wall here?\n\n“I loved Billy Martin. Growing up my favorite coach was Billy Martin. I started coaching baseball when I was 15. I had a picture of Bart Starr (the former Green Bay Packers quarterback) over my bed.

She was 64.\n\nThe legendary coach who never had a losing record in 38 seasons, shocked the sports world in May 2011 when she announced she would continue at the University of Tennessee despite the diagnosis. It was as if she were staring down her disease with the same icy glare she made famous while winning eight national championships and the respect of a nation that didn’t pay much attention to women’s sports when she was growing up.\n\n“It is with tremendous sadness that I announce the passing of my mother, Patricia Sue Head Summitt,\" her son Tyler Summitt said in a statement on Tuesday. \"She died peacefully this morning at Sherrill Hill Senior Living in Knoxville surrounded by those who loved her most.\"\n\nA public celebration of life services for Summitt has been scheduled for 7 p.m. ET July 14 at Thompson-Boling Arena on the Tennessee campus.\n\nThe life of Tennessee coach Pat Summitt at a glance\n\nFollow every game: Latest NCAA Women's College Basketball Scores and Schedules\n\nSummit coached that one last season with great help from her assistants, and ended her career winning an astonishing 84% of her games (1,098-208). President Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012, recognized, with the Congressional Gold Medal, as the nation’s highest civilian awards.\n\n\"She’ll be remembered as the all-time winningest D-1 basketball coach in NCAA history,\" Tyler Summitt said in the statement, \"but she was more than a coach to so many – she was a hero and a mentor, especially to me, her family, her friends, her Tennessee Lady Volunteer staff and the 161 Lady Vol student-athletes she coached during her 38-year tenure.\"\n\n“Pat Summitt is our John Wooden,” Baylor women’s coach Kim Mulkey said in comparing Summitt to the legendary men’s basketball coach at UCLA. “No matter how many national championships (other coaches) win, there will never be another Pat.”\n\nSummit had begun to worry about her health during the 2010-11 season when she drew a blank on an offensive set during a game, then sought a diagnosis at the renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\nWashington Post columnist Sally Jenkins — who wrote biographies with Summitt and considered Summitt her best friend — wrote that the coach almost punched the first doctor who told her she was beginning to experience dementia. When a second advised her to retire immediately, Summitt said, “Do you know who you’re dealing with?”\n\nRivalry, resentment, respect\n\nGeno Auriemma did. The Connecticut coach was Summitt’s chief rival, their feud so bitter over time that the programs no longer play in the regular season.\n\nSummitt addressed her contentious relationship with Auriemma in her 2013 book Sum it Up: 1,098 Victories, a Couple of Irrelevant Losses, and a Life in Perspective, written with Jenkins.\n\nThe relationship was friendly at first. In the fall of 1998, while Summitt was in Hartford for a book tour, Auriemma sent a bouquet with a note: “Congratulations. I hope your next visit is not nearly so successful.”\n\nWhen Summitt got a fish tank for the basketball offices at Tennessee and two of the fish tried to devour one another, she named them Pat and Geno. “I’d walk into the office,” Summitt wrote, “and check the tank and ask our secretaries cheerfully, ‘Did Pat eat Geno yet?’ ”\n\nPat Summitt's most memorable quotes\n\nSometimes the coaches compared details of their contracts so they could help one another win raises in their salaries.\n\n“For all of that,” Summitt wrote, “Geno and I didn’t socialize much; in all the years we competed, we had dinner just once, whereas I shared meals with other coaches regularly. … Geno always liked to make barbed remarks, but it seemed to me that from 2000 on, they had an ungenerous edge. Oddly, the more success UConn had, the more Geno seemed to resent Tennessee.”\n\nSummitt ultimately ended the series because of what she felt were UConn’s unfair recruiting tactics. “I didn’t itemize my complaints publicly then,” she wrote, “and I’m not going to now.”\n\nIn the intervening years “the anger and suspicion have dissipated, replaced by the original bond,” Summitt wrote. “Shortly before I announced my diagnosis, a note came in the mail. It was from Geno, saying he’d heard I had health issues, and he was thinking about me.”\n\nWhen she went public, and formed a foundation to fight Alzheimer’s, a Summitt friend who was associate commissioner of the Big East asked Auriemma if he wanted to be the first contributor: “He wrote out a check on the spot — for $10,000.”\n\nQ&A: What is early onset Alzheimer's disease?\n\nAuriemma released a statement on the day Summitt’s diagnosis was announced, which said in part: “There is no doubt in my mind that Pat will take on this challenge as she has all others during her Hall of Fame career — head on. I wish her all the best.”\n\nWomen’s sports pioneer\n\nSummitt, a Tennessee native, drew upon her early experiences of learning to expect the most out of herself as a guidepost to her coaching career.\n\nAfter her last national championship, in 2008, she talked of a story she would tell often about a day when she was 12 and her father, a dairy and tobacco farmer, left her off in a hayfield, pointed toward a tractor and said, “When I come back, this work better be done.”\n\nNo instructions for work she had never done. No sympathy from her father, Richard Head.\n\nHis daughter just figured it out and completed the grueling task, learning to overcome, as she would for years in the uphill battle of elevating women’s sports while juggling motherhood and an all-encompassing career.\n\nShe learned to shoot hoops in a barn loft with her brothers, became an All-America basketball player at the University of Tennessee-Martin and won a silver medal on the 1976 U.S. Olympic team. When Summitt coached the USA to gold at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, she became the first in U.S. Olympic basketball history to play on and coach medal-winning teams.\n\nA look back at Pat Summitt's championships\n\nShe married banker R.B. Summitt in 1980, had a son a decade later and got divorced in 2007. Their child, Tyler, played as a walk-on on the men’s team at Tennessee, was an assistant women’s basketball coach at Marquette, became the head coach at Louisiana Tech and resigned this year after admitting to an inappropriate relationship with a player.\n\n“It seems like she teaches me something new every day,” Tyler Summitt said in a statement when his mother’s diagnosis was announced, “and she is currently giving me one of the best life lessons of all: to have the courage to be open, honest and face the truth.”\n\nSummitt’s eighth and final national championship, in 2008, came in a 64-48 victory against Stanford.\n\n“I stood under another soft, dense rain of confetti,” she wrote. “Had I known I’d never see another Final Four as a competitor, I might have taken more careful note of my thoughts. All I remember is feeling blaze-eyed with euphoria, and yet snow-blinded by all the colorful paper that drifted around me.\n\n“Those fluttering bits of brightness seemed so reflective of the countless inspired moments our players had given me, a great torrent of victories. More than three decades of potent emotions seemed to be cascading down on my head all at once.\n\n“Up on the rim of the arena, a huge rainbow-lit LED display read, ‘And then there was Tennessee.’ ”\n\nPHOTOS: Pat Summitt", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/28"}]}

While 31% want the former president to run, 61% prefer some other Republican nominee who would continue the policies Trump has pursued.\n\nThey have a name in mind: Two-thirds of Republicans and those inclined to vote Republican want Florida Gov.

But he has become increasingly embattled over his role in fueling the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, his alleged mishandling of sensitive documents when he left the White House, and investigations into efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nSome Republican strategists blame Trump and his influence for the GOP's failure to win control of the Senate in November. Candidates he helped recruit and support in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania lost races that independent analysts thought might have been won by more traditional candidates.\n\nPaging Elon Musk:Poll shows Americans back Twitter safeguards amid worry over hate speech\n\nThe poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone Wednesday through Sunday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

In October, that number had dipped to 56%. Now it has fallen to 47%, an almost-even split with the 45% who don't want him to run for a third time.\n\nThe polls taken in July and December were of registered voters. The poll in October was of likely midterm voters.\n\nTrump is viewed less favorably by his partisans as well. The percentage of Republicans who see him favorably has dropped from 75% in October to 64% in December. His unfavorable rating has risen to 23% from 18%.\n\nAmong all voters, Trump has fallen further behind President Joe Biden in a hypothetical head-to-head rematch. Now, Biden would win a general election matchup by 47% to 40%. (Because of the effects of rounding, Biden's margin is a bit wider than that indicates, at 7.8 points.) In October, Biden also led but by a narrower margin, 46%-42%.\n\nIn case you missed it:Donald Trump announces his 2024 presidential campaign as GOP debates future: recap\n\nBiden sees slippage among Democrats as DeSantis rides high in the GOP\n\nBiden hasn't seen his political standing get much worse, but it also hasn't gotten much better.\n\nSince October, his favorable rating has ticked up a percentage point, to 46%, and his unfavorable rating is down a point, to 50%. But support among Democrats for him to seek a second term has declined, to 40% from 45%. Among all voters, just 23% want him to run again.\n\nWhile Biden now leads Trump, he trails DeSantis in a head-to-head race, with DeSantis at 47% and Biden at 43%.\n\nThe Florida governor, who last month sailed to a second term in the Sunshine State, has significant standing nationwide. Two-thirds of Republican and Republican-leaning voters, 65%, want him to run for president in 2024. Just 24% hope he doesn't.\n\nDeSantis' success may depend on having a one-on-one contest with Trump, Paleologos cautioned. \"Add in a number of other Republican presidential candidates who would divide the anti-Trump vote and you have a recipe for a repeat of the 2016 Republican caucuses and primaries,\" he said, \"when Trump outlasted the rest of the divided field.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/02/biden-leads-trump-narrower-7-points-post-conventions-suffolk-poll/3446536001/", "title": "Biden leads Trump by narrower 7 points post-conventions: Suffolk poll", "text": "The political conventions over, Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in the race for the White House by 50%-43%, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds. That advantage narrowed from the 12-percentage-point edge he held in June.\n\nAs Labor Day looms, launching the campaign's final sprint, the survey finds significant skepticism about whether the election can be trusted. If their candidate loses, 1 in 4 voters say, they aren't prepared to accept the outcome as fair and accurate – a signal of potential trouble ahead for a nation engulfed in a deadly pandemic and riven over issues of racial justice.\n\n\"I'm definitely worried about it,\" says Curtis Saffi, 38, an independent from Hampton, Georgia, who plans to vote for Biden. \"Whether it's the post office or someone meddling in our elections, you really don't know.\"\n\nTwenty-eight percent of the former vice president's supporters say they aren't prepared to accept a Trump victory as fairly won; 19% of President Trump's supporters say they aren't prepared to accept a Biden victory as legitimate.\n\nAn overwhelming 83% of Republicans say they are at least somewhat concerned that mail-in voting will lead to voter fraud; 62% are very concerned. That's an assertion Trump has hammered without offering evidence, and one that's disputed by election experts and academic studies.\n\n\"It will be 100% botched for sure,\" predicts David Brockman, 38, a Trump supporter from Columbus, Indiana, who was among those polled. \"I have no doubt.\"\n\nA third of Democrats are concerned about mail-in voting being open to fraud.\n\n'War games':Experts role-played the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess\n\nThe poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Friday through Monday by landline and cellphone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 points.\n\nSuspicion over the count may be fueled by a divide over how Americans plan to cast their ballots. Republicans are more than twice as likely as Democrats to say they'll vote in person and on Election Day, 56% compared with 26%. Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to plan to vote absentee or by mail, 47% compared with 21%.\n\nFor many, a referendum on the incumbent\n\nTrump defines the contest.\n\nAmong the president's supporters, 83% say they are voting for him; just 11% are voting against his opponent.\n\n\"I love him to death because he's not a politician,\" says Greg Hogue, 60, from Aldo, Texas. \"He sticks foot in mouth, but you know what? He can get through all the bullcrap.\" Watching the Republican convention last week \"solidified\" his support of Trump, Hogue says.\n\nAmong Biden backers, 59% say they are voting for him, and 33% say they are voting against his opponent. In follow-up phone interviews, some describe the dangers of a second Trump term in grave terms.\n\n\"I think there's just something about Trump's rhetoric that is incredibly anti-democratic and worrying, beyond just the policies,\" says Antonio Gonzalez, 31, a Democrat from Portland, Oregon. \"I genuinely worry about what would happen with four more years of him in office.\"\n\nThe research and design consultant was \"heartened\" by Biden's performance at the Democratic convention, he says. \"He did a good job really articulating himself as a candidate and what he stood for,\" which Gonzalez calls particularly important given Trump's depiction beforehand of Biden as \"incoherent.\"\n\nThe competing conventions, both revamped on the fly because of COVID-19, had almost precisely the same impact in energizing partisans. Two-thirds of Democrats and two-thirds of Republicans say the conventions made them more likely to support their party's nominees.\n\nThe Democratic convention fared somewhat better in persuading independents. By a narrow 2 points, 33%-31%, independents say watching the conventions made them more likely rather than less likely to support Biden. By 9 points, 38%-29%, they say the events made them less likely rather than more likely to support Trump.\n\nBy some measures, Biden's situation is similar to that of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton four years ago. In a USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll taken in August 2016, Clinton led Trump by 7 points. (That ballot test included third-party candidates; Biden leads Trump by 5 points in a ballot that includes third-party options.)\n\nIn that election, Clinton won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Trump.\n\n\"I'd say Biden is no better off at this point,\" says David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center, though there are significant differences between the two contests. \"Hillary was more polarizing and less likable than Biden in terms of the favorable/unfavorable ratings. However, Clinton had more enthusiasm than Biden does today, which makes the analysis a bit dicey.\"\n\nA divide over protests and violence\n\nThe nation is more fraught than it was four years ago. The death toll among Americans from the coronavirus is climbing toward 200,000, and thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to protest police treatment of Blacks. Some cities have seen looting and arson.\n\nAbout half of those surveyed, 49%, say police shootings of Blacks reflect individual actions and misdeeds, and 41% say they reflect systemic racism in American society. There is a sharp partisan split: 83% of Republicans see individual misdeeds; 73% of Democrats see systemic racism.\n\nA solid majority of Americans, 57%, say peaceful demonstrations should continue, even though violence has followed in some cities. Thirty-six percent say peaceful demonstrations should stop for now, because violence has followed.\n\nKenosha:Trump claims credit for bringing calm to Kenosha in visit criticized as politicizing racial unrest\n\nProtests:Biden, Trump campaigns spar over blame for violent protests\n\nOn this, too, partisanship opens a deep divide. More than three-fourths of Democrats say the peaceful demonstrations should continue. Nearly six in 10 Republicans say they should stop.\n\n\"We need to get this situated – the violence, the looting, the rioting,\" says Brockman, the Trump voter from Indiana. \"I mean, we're going to be in a civil war within the next six months if something doesn't happen.\"\n\nDana Carbonell, 35, a Democrat from Weehawken, New Jersey, supports the demonstrations, though not the violence. \"I mean, the only way that change has happened in this country is by people taking it to the streets and making their voice be heard,\" she says.\n\nIn their interviews, Carbonell and Brockman are in accord on one thing. \"Honestly, it's really important,\" he says of the election in November.

Though Trump won the Electoral College – and the election – by 74 electoral votes, Clinton won the popular vote by 2.8 million.\n\nIowa opens presidential season\n\nThe Iowa caucuses open a rapid-fire presidential season Monday, followed by the New Hampshire primary eight days later and early contests in Nevada and South Carolina. Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign pitch has emphasized his strength in a general election, and Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders skirmished over “electability” in the last Democratic debate.\n\nWarren counts on a strong showing from her muscular grassroots organization in Iowa to stay in the top tier of candidates. Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar hopes to do well enough in her neighboring state to give her traction to stay in the race.\n\n\"I like Amy Klobuchar; I like Elizabeth Warren. I'm just not sure if they can beat (Trump),\" says Sharon O'Donnell, 69, a Democrat and retired math professor in Chicago who participated in the survey. She worries that voters have trouble conceptualizing a female president because it's unfamiliar. \"It's this idea, 'Oh, who would be the first lady if it was a woman?' That's part of it.\"\n\nThe survey found some qualms about the electoral appeal of candidates over 75 (including Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders), for those who are gay (Pete Buttigieg) and for those who are democratic socialists (Sanders).\n\nEven so, gender looms as a hurdle.\n\nSuffolk University/USA TODAY Poll:A week before the caucuses, Biden leads an unsettled Iowa race\n\nFifty percent of likely Democratic primary voters in the new poll predict that a woman would have a harder time than a man running against Trump.\n\nIn a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll this month, likely Democratic caucusgoers overwhelmingly chose \"defeating Donald Trump\" as the most important issue affecting their vote, more than health care, climate change or any other concerns.\n\nA 'perfect candidate' against Trump?\n\n“Our latest USA TODAY/Ipsos poll shows that Americans are more pessimistic about the country being ready for a woman president compared to six months ago,” says Cliff Young, president of research company Ipsos. “However, Democrats appear to be concerned about some facet of virtually all of the contenders as they search for a perfect candidate to take on President Trump.”\n\nThe online poll of 2,011 adults, taken Friday through Tuesday, has a credibility interval, akin to a margin of error, of plus or minus 2.5 points. The sample of 822 likely Democratic primary voters has a credibility interval of 3.9 points.\n\nLikely Democratic voters express concerns that the personal characteristics of some candidates might make them less favorable to the electorate.\n\nBy an overwhelming 14-1, both Americans in general and likely Democratic primary voters in particular say being older than 75 makes a candidate less appealing rather than more appealing. (About a third in each category say it doesn't make a difference.) Biden is 77, and Sanders is 78.\n\nBy nearly 5-1, Americans say being gay makes a candidate less appealing. Likely Democratic primary voters agree by 3-1. Being a gay man makes a candidate less appealing, according to 32% of Americans and 23% of Democratic voters. (Half of Americans and two-thirds of the Democratic voters say it doesn't make a difference.) Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is openly gay.\n\nBy 3-1, Americans say being a democratic socialist makes a candidate less appealing, although likely Democratic primary voters split about evenly; by 28%-24%, they call it less appealing. (Twenty-nine percent of Americans and 39% of the Democratic voters say it doesn't make a difference.) Sanders identifies himself as a democratic socialist.\n\nFor a candidate who is a democratic socialist, \"it depends on how far you want to go in spending other people's money,\" says Logan Hutchison, 65, a retiree in Fort Madison, Iowa, who is an independent. \"They don't want somebody to take 90% of their money and give it to somebody who isn't really trying. These freebies aren't free. The taxpayer is paying for it.\"\n\nMore than 6 in 10 of those surveyed say that being a woman doesn't affect the appeal of a candidate. For those who say it makes a difference, Americans split about evenly over whether it makes a contender more or less appealing. Likely Democratic primary voters say by 2-1 that it makes a candidate more appealing.\n\nWho can make hard decisions?\n\nThat said, likely Democratic primary voters rate Biden and Sanders more highly than Warren on some characteristics that many see as important in a president. Both men are seen as better able to stand up to Trump, better able to make hard decisions and more approachable.\n\nAsked which contender has the best chance to beat Trump, 29% say Biden, a drop of 8 points since the survey in August; 21% say Sanders, a rise of 1 point; and 16% say former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who wasn't a candidate when the previous poll was taken.

Trump (45%) led Ted Cruz (29%) and John Kasich (17%) among GOP primary and caucus voters, with 8% undecided, according to the poll. Trump’s loyal followers are collectively thumbing their noses at the D.C. establishment and party politics, which makes the job of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus all the more onerous.\n\nWhen Trump voters were asked whether a Trump convention loss would be fair and square or due to an unfairly stacked system, they said the process is unfairly stacked by a 36-point margin: 56% to 20%. A majority of Cruz voters would accept their candidate’s loss (21% unfairly stacked — 58% fair and square). Furthermore, 70% of Trump voters say that the candidate with the clear lead — even if not a majority — should be the Republican convention nominee, compared with 25% of Cruz and Kasich GOP primary/caucus voters who took that position. This poll finding sets up today’s Cruz-Kasich alliance to stop Trump at the convention.\n\nAlthough these Trump voters are a small subset of the larger poll and carry a higher margin of error, they are saying that if Trump loses the nomination in Cleveland and opts for an independent run, they would follow and vote for him (56%-28%). The bad blood isn’t contained with just Trump voters. If you combine Trump, Cruz, and Kasich voters, only 60% say that they will vote for the Republican nominee if their candidate doesn’t win the nomination. The remaining 40% say they will either vote for the Democratic nominee, seriously consider an independent candidate, stay home and not vote in November, or weren’t sure. Mass defection.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, Priebus has to figure out how to prevent an embarrassing general election visual like a convention walkout or worse, a riot.\n\nAbout the only thing Trump, Cruz and Kasich voters agree on, according to the poll, is that the eventual GOP nominee should be someone who ran for the nomination this time around. A clear majority of all three groups of voters agree on that. Apparently, so does House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nDemocratic primary and caucus voters are also split, with Hillary Clinton leading Bernie Sanders 50% to 45% nationally thanks to stronger majorities among minority and older voters. Fifty-two percent of Clinton voters said that Sanders should withdraw if she were to clinch the nomination, while 39% said he should not. Most Sanders voters (71%) said their candidate should continue to the Democratic National Convention no matter what, while 21% said he should not.\n\nIn a reverse image of the division on the Republican side, Clinton voters, by a tally of 51% to 24%, said that if she loses the nomination it would be fair and square whereas Sanders voters said that if he loses, it would be because the system was unfairly stacked against him (28% “fair and square” versus 53% “unfairly stacked against him”). The loyalty factor on the Democratic side is somewhat better than the 60% figure on the Republican side. When you combine Clinton and Sanders voters, 69% say that if their candidate were to lose the nomination they would still vote for the Democrat, while the remaining 31% will either vote Republican, independent, stay home in November, or weren’t sure.\n\nPoll: Trump, Clinton face divides in their parties even if they win nominations\n\nDespite their personal preference, 8% of Clinton voters believe that Donald Trump can defeat Clinton in the general election, but a considerable 33% of Sanders voters believe Trump could beat Clinton. This poll perception is already etched in the minds of a third of Sanders voters. And it’s an issue that Democratic National Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has to be mindful of when coordinating the logistics in Philadelphia.\n\nAnd speaking of the general election, there is the possibility of outright defections to the opposing party based on what voters say they would do right now if they had to choose. The poll tells us that 7% of Trump voters would support Hillary Clinton over Ted Cruz if he were the nominee. And 16% of Trump voters would select Bernie Sanders over Cruz.\n\nDon’t laugh — 13% of Sanders voters say they will vote for Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton. If Trump were to lose the nomination, 19% of Sanders voters would choose Cruz over Clinton; and if John Kasich were the nominee, 23% of Sanders voters would vote for the Ohio governor over the former secretary of State.\n\nDavid Paleologos is director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/11/13/iowa-poll-trump-leads-biden-possible-2024-matchup/8609852002/", "title": "Iowa Poll: Trump leads Biden in hypothetical 2024 matchup", "text": "© Copyright 2021, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa – In a hypothetical 2024 rematch, former President Donald Trump leads President Joe Biden in Iowa by 11 percentage points, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn 2020, Trump defeated Biden by about 8 percentage points, carrying the state 53% to 45%.\n\nIn the new survey, 51% of likely Iowa voters in the 2024 election would vote for Trump, a Republican, and 40% say they would vote for Biden, a Democrat. Another 4% say they would not vote for either candidate, and 5% say they are not sure.\n\nThe poll comes as Biden’s approval rating among Iowans sits near its lowest since he took office in January. Meanwhile, Iowans view Trump more favorably than they did while he was in office, according to a September Iowa Poll.\n\nMore:How critical race theory went from conservative battle cry to mainstream powder keg\n\nTrump’s 2024 lead among likely Iowa voters appears to be driven by support among independents.\n\nBiden wins support among 95% of Democrats – slightly better than the 91% Trump earns among Republicans. But independents favor Trump by 8 percentage points, 45% to 37%.\n\n“Trump won Iowa convincingly in 2020, and that’s reflected in these data,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co.\n\nSelzer & Co. conducted the poll of 810 Iowa adults, including 658 likely voters, Nov. 7 to 10. The questions of all Iowans have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points, and questions asked of likely voters have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.\n\nBut Selzer cautioned that the poll shows an opening for Republican caucus challengers.\n\n“If all you had in this poll was that Trump would defeat Joe Biden by 11 points, it might say everything is locked up,” she said.\n\nBut the poll found that among Iowans who identify as Republicans, 61% say they are more aligned with the party compared with 26% who say they are more aligned with Trump. The margin of error for that question is plus or minus 6 percentage points.\n\nJan. 6 riot:Trump said it was 'common sense' for Capitol rioters to chant 'Hang Mike Pence'\n\nThat preference for the party over Trump is shared by a majority of every demographic group among Republicans, including those in rural areas and evangelical Iowans – two of Trump’s strongholds.\n\n“It opens the door a bit for Iowa,” Selzer said.\n\nA parade of potential Republican presidential contenders already has made its way through the state during the past year, more than two years ahead of Iowa’s first-in-the-nation Republican caucuses.\n\n“If I had a choice between Gov. (Ron) DeSantis or Donald Trump, that right there would be a hard decision for me,” said Franklin Troy Hommer, a poll respondent from Marion County and political independent. “But if you’re telling me that my two choices are Joe Biden or Donald Trump, I’m picking Donald Trump.”\n\nTrump leads with rural, evangelical Iowans\n\nNeither Trump nor Biden has made a formal reelection announcement, though both have left the option open.\n\nTrump, 75, visited Des Moines in October, holding a rally that drew thousands to the Iowa State Fairgrounds amid speculation he was laying groundwork for another White House run.\n\nBiden, 78, is just ending the first year of his first term. At a news conference in March, Biden said he planned to run for reelection but also said he was a \"great respecter of fate\" and has never planned anything for certain. He has not returned to the state since campaigning there ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nIn the hypothetical matchup, Trump leads with huge margins among evangelical and rural Iowans. He carries evangelical likely voters 76% to 15%, and he carries rural likely voters 64% to 26%.\n\nJustin Lindsey, 36, a poll respondent from Sioux City, said he’d vote for Trump in a hypothetical rematch with Biden. He said Trump put in place policies that worked.\n\n“The reason is: He is more of a businessman than a politician,” said Lindsey, a carpenter and a registered Republican. “When he got into office, he actually ran the country like a business, and he’s had great success with businesses.”\n\nMore:Mike Pence sought advice from former VP Dan Quayle on how to deal with Trump, book says\n\nTrump also does well among likely voters without a college degree, earning support among 59% compared with Biden’s 31%.\n\nBiden does better with those who have earned a college degree, 53% to Trump’s 38%.\n\nBiden also does well among likely voters 65 and older – 52% to 41% – and those with no religious affiliation – 56% to 36%.\n\nElizabeth McRae, 22, a respondent from Cedar Falls, said she believes “four more years of Trump would destroy the country.”\n\nMcRae, a University of Northern Iowa student and a Democrat, said she approves of the job Biden is doing as president.\n\n“I feel like he is really holding the country steady at a point in time where we’re going to look back and think, ‘How the hell did anybody do that?’” she said.\n\nBut she wishes Biden and the Democratic majorities in Congress would go beyond the status quo.\n\n“I think it’s a little bit of a shame that we’re not pushing a little bit more of progressive policies while we have the power,” she said.\n\nBiden’s overall job approval stagnates, but COVID-19 approval ticks up\n\nBiden’s approval ratings have plummeted since taking office. Iowans disapprove of the job he's doing as president by about a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nBiden’s job approval has not been in net positive territory in Iowa since March. Then, 47% of Iowans approved of his performance and 44% disapproved.\n\nToday, one-third of all Iowa adults, 33%, say they approve of the job Biden is doing, up 2 percentage points from the Register’s last Iowa Poll, in September; 62% disapprove; and 6% are not sure.\n\n“This is not a good approval rating by any definition,” Selzer said.\n\nBiden is rated poorly for his handling of a range of issues. Fewer than one-third of all Iowans approve of his handling of immigration, criminal justice, the economy and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nOn those specific issues:\n\nTwenty-four percent of Iowans approve of the way Biden is handling immigration. Another 66% disapprove and 10% are not sure. Among Democrats, a minority approve, 47%.\n\nOn criminal justice, 28% of Iowans approve, 53% disapprove and 19% are not sure. Among Democrats, 60% approve.\n\nIowans continue to rate Biden poorly on his handling of Afghanistan after overseeing the U.S. military’s withdrawal from the country, relinquishing control to the Taliban. Today, 22% approve, 68% disapprove and 9% are not sure – his worst metric among issues tested. Among Democrats, a minority approve, 49%.\n\nThirty-two percent of Iowans approve of Biden’s handling of the economy and 61% disapprove. Another 7% are unsure. But Democrats give him a 77% approval rating on the economy.\n\nHommer, a truck driver, said he’s spending significantly more to fuel up when he goes to the pump. He blames Biden for rising fuel prices after the president halted construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and tried, unsuccessfully, to pause new oil and gas drilling on federal lands.\n\n“Everything’s gone up, so I almost can’t afford to live,” he said.\n\nThe one policy area where Biden’s approval has improved slightly is his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, 41% of Iowans say they approve, while 57% say they disapprove. In September, 36% approved and 60% disapproved.\n\nKathy Seward, 66, a Democratic poll respondent from West Des Moines, said she likes that Biden is “taking a stand” on COVID-19 and said his actions show he has backbone.\n\n“I like that he was trying to get all the employers to require vaccinations or testing,” said Seward, a retired clerical worker. “Again, it’s the only way we’re going to get this under control.”\n\nIowans broadly feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction. More than two-thirds, 69%, say things in the nation are on the wrong track. Twenty-three percent say things are headed in the right direction, a rise of 2 percentage points from September.\n\nAbout this poll\n\nThe Iowa Poll, conducted Nov. 7-10, 2021, for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 810 Iowans ages 18 and older. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cellphone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex, and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 810 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Questions based on the subsample of 658 likely voters in the 2024 presidential election have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.4 percentage points or 3.8 percentage points, respectively. Results based on smaller samples of respondents – such as by gender or age – have a larger margin of error.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/27/poor-economic-mood-u-s-means-ukraine-crucial-biden-democrats/6945848001/", "title": "David Paleologos: With voters sour on economy, Ukraine could ...", "text": "David Paleologos\n\nSuffolk University\n\nIn the early hours of February 24th, Russia initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, much to the dismay of the international community.\n\nOur Suffolk University/USA TODAY national poll of registered voters – taken just before the invasion began – suggests that the crisis in Ukraine could also be either a distraction from economic pessimism at home or the final proverbial “nail in the coffin” for the Biden Presidency and Democrats running in the 2022 midterms.\n\nAccording to the Suffolk/USA TODAY poll, more voters are pessimistic on the state of the U.S. economy today than they have been in the last 6 years. When voters were asked to describe the U.S. economy as either in “economic recovery”, “stagnation”, “recession”, or “depression”, a majority of respondents (51%) believe the United States is in a recession or depression.\n\nThis poll marks the first time a majority is negative on the U.S. economy in the last 18 Suffolk University/USA TODAY national polls, dating back to before the election of Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nThe poll signals a marked negative shift in perceptions of the economy.\n\nFrom the tail end of the Obama presidency through the Trump presidency, more respondents answered “economic recovery” than any other choice in 12 consecutive Suffolk/USA TODAY national polls. But since 2020, the number one choice has rotated from “economic recovery” to “stagnation” and now to “recession.” One wonders if “depression” will be the #1 response not so far in the future.\n\nEven more of a concern for Biden and Congressional Democrats is that the combined “recession” and “depression” responses were higher among some important demographics.\n\nMore:Inflation reaches a 40-year high with prices up 7.5% in last year, new CPI report shows\n\nDemocratic candidates usually win a majority of women, whose priority issues are healthcare and education, but 56% of women think we are in a recession or depression.

As of last week, gas was $3.62. An annualized inflation rate of 7.2% as of last month means that grocery bills are skyrocketing, real wages are being squeezed, and businesses are passing on higher costs to cash-strapped customers.\n\nMore:After bruising setbacks, can Democrats convince women to show up to the polls during the midterms?\n\nSure, views of the economy split along partisan lines, but Independents break the tie per usual.\n\nAmong Republicans, the top choice is “recession” (34%), but among Democrats the top choice is “economic recovery” (34%). Where the “rubber meets the road” is among Independents: 33% say the economy is in a “recession” while only 15% indicate “economic recovery”, and 20% say “depression.” Bad news in a midterm year.\n\nFurthermore, it doesn’t look like Russia’s invasion and the resulting sanctions and other punishments taken by the West will improve the U.S. economy.

When asked if Biden is a “strong leader”– something we would presumably want during a foreign policy crisis – almost two-thirds of registered voters (63%) say he is not a strong leader.\n\nEven before the invasion, 65% of registered voters say the country is already on the wrong track. That’s a lot of minds and hearts to change.\n\nMore:David Paleologos: The nation's mental health crisis crosses partisan lines\n\nBut Joe Biden has proven he can rise from the ashes.\n\nIn 2020, he finished dismally in the first three Democratic political tests: in the Iowa Caucus, fourth place behind Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Elizabeth Warren; in the New Hampshire Primary, fifth place; in the Nevada Caucus, he lost to Sanders by 27%. On February 28, 2020 he changed his fate by winning big in the South Carolina Primary, which set the stage for a Super Tuesday sweep.

Their enlistments have prompted a fierce domestic debate over whether it’s time to revise the country’s conscription system to expand exemptions to include prominent entertainers like BTS, or not to provide such benefits to anyone.\n\nWith lawmakers squabbling at Parliament and surveys showing sharply split public opinions over offering exemptions to BTS members, their management agency said in October that all BTS members would perform their compulsory military duties. Big Hit Music said that both the company and the members of BTS “are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment.”\n\nJin, who turned 30 earlier this month, entered the boot camp at Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, for five weeks of basic military training together with other new conscript soldiers, the Defense Ministry said. After the training involving rifle shooting, grenade throwing and marching practices, he and other conscripts would be assigned to army units across the country.\n\nPrevious:BTS to serve mandatory military duties in South Korea, will regroup as a band in 2025\n\nBTS takes on the White House:K-pop stars to meet Biden, discuss Asian representation\n\nAbout 20-30 fans — some holding Jin’s photos — and dozens of journalists gathered near the camp. But Jin didn’t meet them as a vehicle carrying him moved into the boot camp without getting him out.\n\nA couple dozen fans could be seen as a small turnout given Jin’s huge popularity. But Jin and his management agency had earlier asked fans not to visit the site and notified them there wouldn’t be any special event involving the singer, in order to prevent any issue caused by crowding.\n\nAuthorities still mobilized 300 police officers, soldiers, emergency workers and others to maintain order and guard against any accidents, according to the army. Strict safety steps were expected as South Korea is still reeling from the devastating Halloween crush in October in Seoul that killed 158 people.\n\nHours before entering the camp, Jin — whose real name is Kim Seok-jin — wrote on the online fan platform Weverse that “It’s time for a curtain call.” He posted a photo of himself Sunday with a military buzzcut and a message saying, “Ha ha ha. It’s cuter than I had expected.”\n\nBy law, all able-bodied South Korean men must serve in the military for 18-21 months under a conscription system established to deal with threats from North Korea. But the law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have won top prizes in certain competitions and enhance national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren’t given such benefits even if they gain worldwide fame and win big international awards.\n\n“Though BTS members have opted to go to the military, there are still some sort of regrets,” said Jung Duk-hyun, a pop culture commentator. “Those in the pop culture sector experience little bit of disadvantages and unfairness, compared with those in the pure art sector or athletes. This will likely continue to be an issue of controversy so I wonder if it must be discussed continuously.”\n\nExemptions or dodging of duties are a highly sensitive issue in South Korea, where the draft forces young men to suspend their studies or professional careers. Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup and Lee Ki Sik, head of South Korea’s enlistment office, previously said it would be “desirable” for BTS members to fulfill their military duties to ensure fairness in the country’s military service.\n\nChun In-bum, a retired lieutenant general who commanded South Korea’s special forces, said the government must move to repeal any exemptions as the military’s shrinking recruitment pool is “a very serious” problem amid the country’s declining fertility rate. He called a debate over BTS’s military service “unnecessary” as it wasn’t raised by BTS members, who have shown willingness in carrying out their duties.\n\nBTS on hiatus:South Korea leader says it's 'desirable' for BTS to serve military duties\n\nBTS was created in 2013 and has a legion of global supporters who call themselves the “Army.” Its other members are RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook, who is the youngest at 25. The group expanded its popularity in the West with its 2020 megahit “Dynamite,” the band’s first all-English song that made BTS the first K-pop act to top Billboard’s Hot 100. The band has performed in sold-out arenas around the world and was even invited to speak at United Nations meetings.\n\nHybe Corp., the parent company of Big Hit, said in October that each member of the band for the time being would focus on individual activities scheduled around their military service plans. In October, Jin released “The Astronaut,” a single co-written by Coldplay.\n\nJung, the commentator, said sold projects could give BTS members much-needed time to develop themselves after working together as a group for many years. But Cha Woo-jin, a K-pop commentator, said it’s unclear if BTS would enjoy the same popularity as a group when they get together again after finishing their military duties in a few years.\n\nIn August, Lee, the defense minister, said BTS members who are serving would likely be allowed to continue practicing and to join other non-serving BTS members in overseas group tours.\n\nCha said K-pop’s global influence wouldn’t be hurt much because of BTS members’ enlistments as they “appear to represent K-pop but aren’t everything of K-pop.” Chung agreed, saying that other K-pop groups like BLACKPINK, Stray Kids and aespa could rise further.\n\nMore:Elton John, more stars return to the White House under Biden.

These statues stand as symbols of racism in the US dating back to the Civil War, civil rights activists and some historians say.\n\nAlthough the 73 removals do not compare to the data from the previous year, the report’s authors say grassroots campaigns are steps in the right direction.\n\n“Destroying these monuments and these memorials will not erase the legacy of slavery,” said SPLC researcher Kimberly Probolus on Tuesday. “But abolishing these memorials is a first and essential step in combating the white supremacist values of the Confederacy …”\n\nAfter the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the SPLC reported that 157 memorials were removed in the US. A year of heightened awareness about police brutality, nationwide protests and calls for action sparked the most Confederate monument removals in one year, according to the SPLC.\n\nWorkers hoist a statue of Jefferson Davis after removing it from the the Kentucky state Capitol in Frankfort on June 13, 2020.

That did not account for the 741 roadways, 201 schools, 51 buildings, 38 parks and 22 holidays honoring the Confederacy, the group said.\n\nWith the remaining Confederate memorials that “we know of still publicly present across the US, there is still a lot of work to be done,” said Lecia Brooks, the chief of staff and culture for the SPLC and the SPLC Action Fund.\n\nThe fight to get Confederate monuments removed had been gaining steam before 2020, but the racial and political reckoning accelerated calls for the removals. Many civil rights activists argued that structures were racist and offensive because they honored leaders who promoted the enslavement of Black Americans.\n\nLast year, a towering statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee was removed in Richmond, Virginia, and added to the growing list of Confederate symbols that had been taken down across the country.

The monument will be kept in storage for now, said Taylor Schaffer, Hogsett's deputy chief of staff.\n\nThe complaint was filed by Wayne Sharp, an Indiana resident who the lawsuit says has been active in “the preservation of the monument for more than two decades.”\n\nFour other plaintiffs, identified as “John Doe,” say they want to protect the historical significance of the monument, according to the suit.\n\nIt says that in 2017, the Indy Parks and Recreation Board acknowledged that the U.S. government owns the monument. Neither Hogsett nor the city, the complaint argues, has the authority to destroy U.S. government property.\n\nAttorneys for the city typically don't comment on pending litigation. But Donald Morgan, corporation counsel for Indianapolis and Marion County, noted to IndyStar that the monument is being \"disassembled\" much as it was when it was moved to the park in 1928.\n\n\"If the federal government would like to retrieve the monument, it can come get it,\" he said via email. \"Some assembly will be required.\"\n\nCity officials have been trying to find a more fitting place for the monument, but \"no organization has stepped forward to assume that responsibility,\" Schaffer said.\n\nIndyStar Visuals Manager and RetroIndy writer Dawn Mitchell and IndyStar Pulliam Fellow Brooke Kemp contributed to this report.\n\nContact IndyStar reporter Vic Ryckaert at 317-444-2701 or vic.ryckaert@indystar.com.

Newby said withdrawing the bill enables the city to \"start the whole process over again.\"\n\n\"We're going to come up with a comprehensive plan to deal with all of the monuments here in Jacksonville,\" he said.\n\nHe said he wants to see a recommendation from those discussions before the end of his term as council president in June.\n\nChief Administrative Officer Brian Hughes told reporters after the vote that Curry \"made a very clear policy statement\" for a path to a resolution \"that ends this divisiveness and removes from city property something that some in our community see as an expression of racial hatred.\"\n\nHe said the council instead \"kicked the can down the road\" so the administration anticipates the council will \"take over the policy and do whatever they think they want to do.\"\n\nVoting for withdrawal were Newby, Gaffney, Aaron Bowman, Michael Boylan, LeAnna Cumber, Randy DeFoor, Terrance Freeman, Joyce Morgan, Ju'Coby Pittman, Brenda Priestly Jackson, Randy White and Kevin Carrico.\n\nVoting against withdrawal were Danny Becton, Matt Carlucci, Garrett Dennis, Rory Diamond, Al Ferraro and Kevin Carrico.\n\nThe votes on withdrawal didn't necessarily line up with how council members would have voted on the legislation.\n\nCarlucci, who supports moving the monument, tried unsuccessfully to win support for postponing a vote to March 22. He said that would give time for more conversations about the monument while marking a binding date for a future council vote, rather than withdraw the bill without any firm timeline for a final decision.\n\n\"Withdrawal has a way of sounding to our community that we're retreating,\" Carlucci said.\n\nDennis said Curry's legislation actually gave council members political cover to support moving the monument. He said the \"cowardly route\" is withdrawing the legislation.\n\n\"We are all going to be held accountable (by voters) and you know what they're going to say? That we could not make a decision,\" Dennis said.\n\nBut some supporters of withdrawal said it was a strategic move to keep pushing for moving the monument. Priestly Jackson, who tried unsuccessfully to postpone a vote until May, said she remains absolutely opposed to a Confederate monument being on a city park.\n\nShe noted that council rules require at least a year before a rejected piece of legislation can come back for another vote, but withdrawing the bill eliminates a waiting period so it can come back to council at any time.\n\nBased on non-binding votes last week in council committees, the legislation would have met defeat in an up-or-down vote Tuesday.\n\nGroups protest monument\n\nThe council meeting Tuesday once again drew organized groups of supporters and opponents of the Confederate monument.\n\nOn the front steps to City Hall, the Northside Coalition and other groups opposing the monument rallied before the council meeting, the latest in a string of demonstrations they've staged.\n\n\"Common sense says we should remove monuments of racial hatred from public property,\" Northside Coalition President Ben Frazier said.\n\nHe said protestors are prepared to launch non-violent civil disobedience actions, demonstrations at city-owned buildings and area shopping malls, and possibly boycotts.\n\nSupporters of keeping the monument in Springfield Park also turned out with dozens of them wearing red clothing.\n\nOne of the red shirt-wearing monument supporters briefly shouted \"leave it up\" as the Northside Coalition rally participants chanted \"take 'em down\" outside City Hall.\n\nSupporters of keeping the monument in the park said \"cancel culture\" was fueling the push to remove it and that's creating racial divisions.\n\n\"This bullying has got to stop,\" one woman told the council. \"The lame excuse the statue is hindering the growth of the city is a joke.\"\n\nThe monument's future has hung in the balance since Curry said in June 2020 after removing a bronze Confederate soldier statue from Hemming Park that the city would be \"removing others as well\" from city-owned land.\n\nThe Jacksonville Civic Council, a group of business executives and civic leaders, sent a letter Monday to Curry and City Council members that said council should withdraw the legislation or postpone a vote until the end of March so city leaders can work with \"community experts\" on a \"comprehensive action plan\" for all Confederate monuments and markers.\n\nThe removal of the Confederate soldier statue from Hemming Park, now called James Weldon Johnson Park, leaves two structures that have Confederate links: the \"Tribute to Women of the Southern Confederacy\" monument also known as \"Women of the Southland\" in Springfield Park, and the Confederate grandstand in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nCurry has not taken a position on the Confederate grandstand.\n\nAs for markers referring to the Confederacy and the Civil War, Hughes said Curry supports keeping them in place when they clearly point to historic events that happened at the sites.\n\n\"The mayor doesn't see those as divisive or worthy of a consideration because the process by which they're placed is history happened here, mark it,\" Hughes said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/09/jacksonville-florida-takes-down-confederate-monument-122-years/5330515002/", "title": "Jacksonville, Florida, takes down Confederate monument after 122 ...", "text": "John Reid, Andrew Pantazi, Christopher Hong, Emily Bloch and Nate Monroe\n\nFlorida Times-Union\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. — In the predawn darkness Tuesday, Mayor Lenny Curry ordered city workers to remove the bronze statue of a Confederate soldier in winter uniform that had hovered above Hemming Park in downtown Jacksonville for more than a century.\n\nThen, hours later, Curry, pledged to a crowd of peaceful protesters that he would order the removal of all remaining public Confederate monuments throughout the city.\n\nThe unannounced move was a remarkable pivot for the city’s Republican mayor who had previously avoided taking a position on the controversy. Just as remarkable is what seems to have played a role in changing Curry’s mind: The voices of NFL players from the Jacksonville Jaguars who have joined protesters in recent days to demand police reform and renewed efforts to tackle inequality in Florida's most populous city.\n\n“I’m happy to see black and whites out here together doing this, and it’s a wonderful thing,” said Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette, who led Tuesday's peaceful protest, joined by Sheriff Mike Williams. “The biggest thing is that I didn’t grow up being racist or my parents teaching me racism. We’ve got to stop that. ... That’s bad, man. It’s hard being black out here right now. It’s tough. I want to be that voice for people like George Floyd, you know Alton Sterling, guys like that.”\n\n'Symbols of white supremacy': Is this the end for other Confederate memorials?\n\nThe surprise dismantling of the Confederate monument in Hemming Park marked the beginning of an eventful — and historic — day in Jacksonville.\n\nIn the afternoon, State Attorney Melissa Nelson announced her office was working on updating its policy for releasing body camera footage in officer-involved shootings — a key demand of protesters in recent days. In the evening, the city council approved a law intended to protect the city’s LGBTQ residents from discrimination.\n\nProtesters welcomed removal of the monuments but some also voiced displeasure that Curry, the former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, has been actively campaigning to hold the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville. They also vowed to continue their demonstrations until their demands for the faster release of police body camera footage and other reform measures were taken up.\n\nLast week, Jaguars players and staff marched to Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office headquarters, where wide receiver Chris Conley made an impassioned speech that noted the presence of the Confederate monument in Hemming Park, just feet away from City Hall.\n\nName game:Army to consider changing names of forts named after Confederate generals\n\n“The confederate monument is gone. And the others in this city will be removed as well,” Curry said Tuesday morning. “We hear your voices. We have heard your voices.”\n\nAfter a man hit and killed a woman with a car during the 2017 white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, then-City Council President Anna Lopez Brosche called for confederate monuments to be removed from public property.\n\nAt the time, however, Curry said he wouldn’t use the bully pulpit of his office to weigh in on the issue, and the idea to remove the monuments failed to gain traction.\n\nBrosche, who eventually ran unsuccessfully against Curry, later proposed installing a memorial next to the monument to honor lynching victims, although the city council in 2018 formally rejected the idea.\n\n“I am grateful for this day in Jacksonville,” Brosche said in a statement. “It is my hope we may begin the process of healing and reconciliation that respects every single individual and sets a path for the realization of racial equity, including the promises made during consolidation.”\n\nThe removal of monument from Hemming Park was 'a long time coming'\n\nJacksonville did not play a prominent role in the Civil War, and it was occupied by Union soldiers on four separate occasions. But, like many southern cities, Jacksonville adopted public memorials to the failed insurrection in the decades after the war.\n\nThe 62-foot Vermont granite monument was installed in Hemming Park in 1898 after the park’s namesake, Civil War veteran Charles C. Hemming, donated the statue. Confederate Park sits on the edge of the Springfield neighborhood and also has a highly visible memorial to “Women of the Southland.”\n\nWells Todd, an activist with Take ’Em Down Jax, which has been calling for the removal of Confederate monuments for years, credited a movement of people calling for change.\n\n“It was a long time coming,” he said. “What those statues stand for and stood for is white supremacy.”\n\nN.V. Pharaoh, a 36-year-old Jacksonville native, said he was proud to be a part of history. He said he was the victim of brutality by corrections officers when he was incarcerated and vowed to fight for justice upon his release 4 1/2 years ago.\n\nHe questioned why the mayor and sheriff waited until now to march.\n\n“Why weren’t they part of a movement in the city? I think he [Curry] wants to listen. He’s not going to have a choice but to listen because the people aren’t going to accept injustice.”\n\nNFL's Jaguars take leading role in bringing change to Jacksonville\n\nThe Jaguars became the first professional sports franchise to have an organized protest last week, and team owner Shad Khan wrote an op-ed that decried racism and its impact on people, communities and dreams.\n\n“Kudos for Leonard for putting us together and knowing the resources that he has and for him to get with the mayor so people can shout their questions and shout their disgruntled things,” Jaguars defensive tackle Abry Jones said.\n\n“We’re trying to show them that we can get behind the city and do our part,” Jones added. “We’re just trying to stay in front and say that we agree with the same people that live in the city and the problem that’s going on and talked about Chris’ [Conley] great speech [during last week’s protest march] talking about voter registration and getting more people to vote.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/17/south-confederate-monuments-often-protected-hard-remove-state-laws/573226001/", "title": "In the South, Confederate monuments often protected, hard to ...", "text": "Calls to remove Confederate monuments have reached a cacophony across the country after the violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nBut actions like those in Baltimore, where statues were quietly removed under the shroud of night this week, remains much harder elsewhere in the South.\n\nMultiple states below the Mason-Dixon Line have put into place formal legal mechanisms that prevent historical monuments on public property from being taken down or altered without great difficulty.\n\nMore:Why removing Confederate monuments in Tennessee is not an easy process\n\nMore:County by county: Confederate memorials in Tennessee\n\nIn South Carolina, for instance, a two-thirds vote in the legislature is required to remove a monument.

Cities in their own right do not have the authority to remove them.\n\nProponents see the Confederate statues as representations of history, part of the culture of the past.\n\nBut opponents see them as divisive, a celebratory representation of a war defending slavery, and a lasting symbol of white supremacy.\n\n\"These laws are the Old South imposing its moral and its political views on us forever more,\" said Stan Deaton, senior historian at the Georgia Historical Society. \"This is what led to the Civil War, and it still divides us as a country. We have competing visions not only about the future but about the past.\"\n\nThe monuments and memorials, found throughout the South, are again at the forefront of public debate after white supremacists, neo-Nazis and other groups protested the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville.\n\nThose protests turned violent, and left one woman dead and more than a dozen others injured after a 20-year-old Ohio man, according to authorities, rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters.\n\nThere are more than 700 Confederate statues and monuments on public property across the nation, and the majority of those are in Southern states, according to a 2016 Southern Poverty Law Center study. This week, the SPLC encouraged the public to advocate for the removal of Confederate monuments in their communities.\n\n► More:Confederate monuments, more than 700 across USA, aren't budging\n\nVirginia, Georgia and North Carolina have the most, the study found.\n\nIn Georgia, a rapidly-spreading petition calls for the removal of the Lost Cause Confederate Memorial found in Decatur's downtown square.\n\n\"There is no place for hate in Decatur,\" the petition states. \"After the horrendous display of racism, bigotry, and white supremacy in Charlottesville, we, the citizens of Decatur and DeKalb County, want to take a stand against white nationalism by removing one of its symbols.\"\n\nBut Georgia law protects memorials and monuments that honor military service from being removed, relocated or altered. Those include \"the United States of America or the several states thereof, or the Confederate States of America.\"\n\nThe statute came as a compromise between lawmakers when Georgia redesigned its state flag in 2001, eventually removing the Confederate battle symbol.\n\nDebate intensified after South Carolina shooting\n\nElsewhere in the South, no known protests or rallies have been scheduled at any of the major Confederate monuments in the state of Mississippi, which has the only flag in the nation that still carries the Confederate emblem on it.\n\nIn 2004, Mississippi passed a law that prohibits the removal or alteration of statues or memorials honoring the military, including those dealing with the Civil War. It also prohibits the renaming of streets, schools or government buildings likewise named for Civil War or other military figures or events.\n\n► More: Robert E.

Efforts to penalize government entities that don't fly the flag on public property failed last year.\n\nIn South Carolina, Confederate monuments are similarly protected by the state's Heritage Act, which passed when the Confederate flag was moved in 2000 from the statehouse dome to a nearby Confederate memorial. The act requires a two-thirds vote by both chambers of the state legislature to remove or alter a monument.\n\nLawmakers met the two-thirds majority threshold in 2015 when they voted overwhelmingly to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds.\n\nTheir decision came after self-professed white supremacist Dylann Roof fatally shot nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Roof had posed for a photo with the Confederate flag.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Charleston shooting, calls for the removal of Confederate symbols from public places were renewed.\n\nIn Tennessee and elsewhere, strict rules in place\n\nThe removal of a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, from the Tennessee state Capitol became a rallying point in Tennessee. Those calls were renewed this week following the Charlottesville violence.\n\nBut the Tennessee General Assembly made it more difficult to remove historic monuments from any public property last year with the passage of the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act.\n\n► More:In wake of Charlottesville, protests take aim at Nathan Bedford Forrest bust in Tennessee Capitol\n\n► More:Tennessee GOP gubernatorial candidates stop short of calling for removal of Nathan Bedford Forrest bust\n\nThe law requires a two-thirds vote by the state historical commission.

After a lengthy process, the city government took down several statues — including one of Lee, the Confederate general.\n\nElsewhere in the state, the issue appears to be less volatile.

Robert E. Lee.\n\nAs far as Etter could tell, he was the only one who paid any attention to the thing.\n\n“They probably didn’t even know it was there,” he said of his neighbors.\n\nThey do now. In the past week, the stone memorial honoring the Confederate general has inspired a Change.org petition, a heated town hall meeting, a demonstration by Lee fans armed with guns and Confederate flags, and a late-night mission by the city’s public works department to haul the monument away under cover of darkness.\n\nIt’s been an eventful week for a memorial that was last in the news in the early 1980s, when a motorist took a turn too fast and crashed into it.\n\nBut after the racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and with calls to remove Confederate memorials growing louder, this tiny patch of ground in Franklin is now on the front lines of a cultural civil war that’s once again dividing America.\n\nOn its face, the fight in Franklin is over history and how to remember it, but it’s about more than that. It’s about what these symbols from the past mean to Americans today, and why so many will go to such lengths to defend them or tear them down.\n\n“I think the problems of the country are spreading to small towns all over the place,” said Sonny Lewis, Franklin’s city manager.\n\nPost-Charlottesville, Confederate monuments begin to fall across the U.S.\n\nKeep Confederate monuments, but put their horrific history on center stage\n\nBlack lawmakers push to get Confederate statues out of the U.S. Capitol\n\nThe dispute so far in this southern Ohio town, about 40 miles north of Cincinnati, has been free of violence but loaded with the kind of charged rhetoric that runs through much of the nation’s political discourse.\n\nA Change.org petition signed by 661 people described the Lee monument as a celebration of “slavery and hate.” Supporters of the monument showed up last week waving Confederate battle flags and shouting over a megaphone.\n\n“Don’t let them take our history away,” they said.\n\nLater, someone put up a sign where the monument once stood describing Black Lives Matter as a “terrorist organization.” The civil rights group appears to have no presence in Franklin, but some blamed it for the monument flap anyway.\n\nIf town hall meetings and informal surveys are any indication, the sentiment here favors bringing the monument back. But it’s complicated. Not everyone embraces the guys carrying battle flags and no one is openly championing the cause of white supremacy, as protesters did in Charlottesville.\n\nSome say the monument should return because it has historic value. Some embrace President Donald Trump’s controversial comments after Charlottesville and say they’re sick of “political correctness.” And some say they simply don’t want outsiders, like those who signed the petition, telling them what to do.\n\n“I think they should just leave things alone,” said Judy Vullen, who’s lived in Franklin for 45 years and didn’t know the monument existed until it was removed last weekend. “It’s wrong what they did.”\n\nEtter said he’d welcome the monument back, but not because he has sympathy for the Confederate cause. Mostly, he said, he just wants the protesters to stay off his lawn.\n\n“I think they were hoping someone would show up so they could fight them,” Etter said of the crowd that took over his yard last weekend. “I’m glad that didn’t happen.”\n\nHow did it get here?\n\nIt’s surprising to many in Franklin that the debate over Confederate monuments is happening here at all.\n\nNamed for Benjamin Franklin, the town was hundreds of miles from the nearest Confederate state during the Civil War and there’s no evidence Lee ever visited or had ties to anyone here.\n\nWhat’s more, Ohio was a major contributor to the Union effort, both in blood and treasure. The cemetery across the street from the site of the Lee monument is filled with the graves of men who fought Lee’s Confederate Army.\n\nYet there it sat for almost a century, a huge stone with a plaque depicting Lee on horseback. “In loving memory of Robert E. Lee,” the inscription reads. “And to mark the route of the Dixie Highway.”\n\nThat last bit is the first clue about how a Confederate general got a memorial in a Union town.\n\nThe Dixie Highway was a hodge-podge of connected roads running from the Midwest to the South. When a stretch of the highway in Franklin was dedicated in 1928, the United Daughters of the Confederacy proposed marking the occasion with a monument to Robert E. Lee.\n\nIt was a curious conflation of history and highway construction, but there’s no indication anyone questioned the logic at the time.\n\nThe dedication ceremony featured a quartet that sang Carry Me Back to Old Virginia, Lee’s home state, and a speech by the president of the Cincinnati chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy. The monument has stood at the same location ever since, the only one of Ohio’s four Confederate monuments not connected to a grave site.\n\nSo why was a town in a Union state OK with this in the first place? Much like today, the decision may have had more to do with the cultural attitudes of the time than with Civil War history.\n\n“We’re talking about a time when there was a sort of nostalgia for the Old South,” said Kevin Levin, a Boston-based author and historian who has written extensively on the war and its monuments.\n\nHe said monuments erected in the early 20th Century, particularly in the South, often went beyond honoring Confederate war dead and instead portrayed the Confederacy and its leaders as heroes of a noble cause. Sometimes, Levin said, the monuments reinforced the authority of whites over blacks, especially when they were displayed in public places such as parks and courthouses.\n\nThat’s not how the monument’s defenders see the Lee memorial in Franklin. They say Lee and the Dixie Highway, which didn’t exist during Lee’s lifetime, are historically important and it’s right to honor both with the monument.\n\nThey don’t see the monument as a defense of the Confederacy, but rather as a recognition of its place in American history.\n\n“I think it should be put back up there,” said Jo Ann Powell, owner of the Take-a-Look hair salon, just down the road from the site of the Lee monument. “You can’t erase history. Next thing you know, they’re going to be burning books.”\n\nPowell put up a sign during the protests last weekend that read, “Honk If All Lives Matter!” She blames outsiders, such as Black Lives Matter, for making a big deal of Confederate monuments and said she agrees with Trump’s recent defense of those monuments.\n\n“They say it reminds people of a time when there were slaves,” Powell said. “No, it doesn’t. No one alive today was a slave or owns a slave. What’s the big ordeal?”\n\n'We're not going anywhere'\n\nNo one is sure exactly when the monument became a big ordeal in Franklin, but it happened soon after the violence in Charlottesville.\n\nDays later, city officials received a Change.org petition seeking the monument’s removal. “We cannot come together as a country until we decide to stop celebrating these symbols of slavery and hate,” the petitioners wrote.\n\nLewis, the city manager, said he was on vacation in California when the decision to remove the monument was made, so he can’t say exactly what happened. But after doing some checking, he said, city officials determined the Lee monument posed a safety hazard because it was in a right-of-way.\n\nSo they took it down, sometime after midnight last Thursday.\n\n“When something like that is brought to our attention, we have to act on it,” Lewis said.\n\nSeveral residents used colorful language to describe the move. “That was chicken s--- to do it that way,” said a man leaving AmVets Post 120 in downtown Franklin. Teresa Bogie, a volunteer there, agreed. “It’s been there 90 years and it’s never bothered no one.”\n\nClarissa Walton moved to Franklin just one month ago, so she doesn’t know much about the Lee monument.

We’re not going anywhere,” he said. “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but your Confederate flag will never hurt me.”\n\nFor now, a small Confederate flag is all that marks the spot on the site of the Lee monument, which has been moved to an undisclosed location.\n\nCity officials say the monument technically belongs to Franklin Township, since the township owned the land when it was erected in 1928. But township officials, who will hold a public meeting Thursday night to discuss the matter, say it belongs to the city.\n\nEtter, who mowed around the monument for 55 years, said he’d be happy to take it off their hands. He said he doesn’t care about the Confederacy and he’d be fine if he never saw another Confederate battle flag.\n\nBut it seems strange to him to see a muddy hole where the monument sat for all those years on the edge of his yard.\n\n“I kind of got attached to it,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/20/confederate-monuments-receive-mixed-reactions-western-ky/104795018/", "title": "Confederate monuments receive mixed reactions in Western KY", "text": "Campaigns to remove Confederate monuments from public spaces emerged last week in the cities of Paducah and Owensboro, Kentucky.\n\nThe campaigns were launched after a crowd pulled down a Confederate monument in Durham, North Carolina on Monday.\n\nOfficials from Paducah and Owensboro could not be reached for comment. However, the Paducah City Commission posted a statement on the city’s Facebook page promising to have an “honest dialog about our own history, biases, and challenges.”\n\nThe “Commission stands against racial hatred and violence in all its forms,” the post read. “Hate and bigotry have no place in Paducah, and we owe a sacred duty to protect the rights of every citizen, no matter the color of their skin.”\n\nMore:Letter: Removing monuments not the right way to learn\n\nSunday afternoon, there were two petitions regarding the Paducah statue on the website Change.org.

Robert E. Lee statue, its last ...", "text": "Danny Monteverde\n\nWWL-TV, New Orleans\n\nNEW ORLEANS — The 16-foot-tall bronze statue of Robert E. Lee in New Orleans was removed Friday from its perch high above St. Charles Avenue where the Confederate general had stood watch for 133 years.\n\nThe removal of the last, and perhaps most iconic of the city’s four Confederate-era monuments drew dozens of people to Lee Circle, where it is located, late Thursday and early Friday.\n\nBy mid-morning, activity began at the site as cranes and backhoes were used.\n\nThe statue was lifted from its pedestal early Friday evening. The largely anti-monument crowd burst into cheers and song.\n\n\n\n“I cannot believe that it’s down,” said a choked up Rev. Marie Galatas, a civil rights leader who was instrumental in the movement to remove the monuments. “This is the one I was focused on ... there had been monumental obstacles against me from ’73 until now, but they are down now.”\n\nLee Circle has been a focal point for citizens of the city for more than 130 years, with many not paying attention to the historic significance or controversy of the monument to the general that led the Confederate Army against Union troops.\n\nThat history has become a focus for both pro and anti-monument groups.\n\nA crowd of perhaps 200 people were gathered at the circle Thursday night. There were several Confederate battle flags, some American flags and a small band of drummers who led the anti-monument people with a chant of “Take ‘Em Down.”\n\nWithout the barricades to separate the two groups, the drummers and dancers edged close to the pro-monument crowd, who remained stoic.\n\n“We want him to stay here,” said Robert Bonner, a supporter of the Lee statue. “We know he’s going to come down, but that’s not going to stop us. We want a voice.”\n\n“I wanted this to be seen with their own eyes,” said DeMirah Howard, who supports the monuments being removed. “It’s not good for our children to view it (the memorial).”\n\nRead more:\n\nConfederate Gen.

There was one arrest after a man went past the barricades and climbed atop the stairs leading to the column. Police tried to get the man to come down peacefully, but eventually they handcuffed him and removed him to some cheers and jeers.\n\nErected in 1884, Lee’s is the last of four monuments to Confederate-era figures to be removed in accordance with a 2015 City Council vote.\n\nThe most recent removal of a statue happened Wednesday morning, when the 102-year-old bronze statue of Confederate Gen. P.G.T Beauregard was removed from the entrance to City Park.\n\nThe statue of Confederate president Jefferson Davis was removed last week and a monument memorializing a deadly 1874 white-supremacist uprising was removed in April.\n\nUnlike the first three statues — which were removed under in the dark — city officials moved to take Lee’s statue down during the day.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said the change was made to ensure the safety of the workers because of its proximity to electrical wires and New Orleans' famous streetcar lines. It would be impossible to do the removal \"at dark and maintain the safety of the construction workers,\" he said.\n\nIn a news release obtained by The Associated Press, the city said the statues were “erected decades after the Civil War to celebrate the ‘Cult of the Lost Cause,’ a movement recognized across the South as celebrating and promoting white supremacy.”\n\nOf the four monuments, Lee's was easily the most prominent, with the bronze statue alone being close to 20 feet tall. It's an image of Lee standing tall in uniform, with his arms crossed defiantly, looking toward the northern horizon from atop a roughly 60-foot-tall column.\n\nIt towered over a traffic circle — Lee Circle — in an area between the office buildings of the city's business district and stately 19th-century mansions in the nearby Garden District.\n\nThe city has received offers from public and private institutions to take individual monuments, so it will solicit proposals on where they will go through an \"open and transparent selection.\" Only non-profits and government entities will be allowed to take part, and the city said the process will not include the Beauregard statue because of legal issues.\n\nThe city said those taking the statues cannot display them outdoors on public property in New Orleans.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

Who do you love? And will you be loyal to that person you love?” the president asked from the South Lawn. “It’s not more complicated than that.”\n\nBiden said the law he was about to sign recognizes that “everyone should have the right to answer those questions for themselves without the government interference,” and secures the federal “protections that come with marriage.”\n\n“For most of our nation’s history, we denied interracial couples and same sex couples from these protections,” Biden said. “It failed to treat them with equal dignity and respect. And now, this law requires an interracial marriage and same-sex marriage must be recognized as legal in every state in the nation.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Don Lemon and fiancé react to Biden signing same-sex marriage into law 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nThe new law officially voids the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. It mandates that states honor the validity of out-of-state marriage licenses, including same-sex and interracial unions.\n\nAs a senator, Biden voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. The bill signing Tuesday amounted to the culmination of his transformation on the issue. The bill passed in the House with 39 Republicans joining Democrats in support, after getting through the Senate with 12 Republican senators.\n\nSuch a bill had seemed improbable for many in Washington not that long ago, even as public opinion on same-sex marriage has continued to shift over the years: 68% of Americans supported same-sex marriage in 2021, up 14 percentage points from 2014, according to surveys from the nonprofit, nonpartisan Public Religious Research Institute.\n\nBut the public rallying and push to pass federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriage intensified this year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, sparking fresh fears that the nation’s highest court would also reconsider other existing rights around marriage equality.\n\nThe day the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling was issued in June, Biden warned that Justice Clarence Thomas “explicitly called to reconsider the right of marriage equality, the right of couples to make their choices on contraception. This is an extreme and dangerous path the Court is now taking us on.”\n\nHe would go on to give similar warnings on the campaign trail leading up to the midterms: “We want to make it clear: It’s not just about Roe and choice. It’s about – it’s about marriage – same-sex marriage. It’s about contraception. It’s about a whole range of things that are on the docket,” he said at a Democratic National Committee reception in August.\n\nFor Biden, Tuesday’s event bookended a moment a decade ago that helped spark a national political transformation on the issue. When he was serving a vice president, Biden shocked the country with an unexpected declaration delivered in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: He came out in public support of same-sex marriage for the first time.\n\n“I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties,” Biden said when asked whether he was comfortable with same-sex marriage.\n\nThose words – which Biden insisted in subsequent years were unplanned – marked a stunning personal evolution for the longtime creature of Washington, who as senator had voted to block federal recognition of same-sex marriages and previously insisted that marriage should only take place between a man and a woman.\n\nThe interview would also turn out to be a watershed moment in modern American politics, prompting then-President Barack Obama to stake out the same position several days later and giving permission to other national leaders to also follow suit.\n\n“That single interview was a transformative moment in Biden’s development as a politician. In the Senate, as a presidential candidate and as vice president, he always had been very cautious around LGBT issues, afraid of taking any position that opponents could use to portray him as a left-winger,” Sasha Issenberg, author of “The Engagement: America’s Quarter-Century Struggle Over Same-Sex Marriage,” told CNN. “But the reception to what he said on ‘Meet the Press’ was universal praise within his party, especially from LGBT advocates and donors who had previously been skeptical of him.”\n\nBasking in the hero-treatment from liberal activists, Biden would go on to aggressively associate himself with LGBT causes in the years to come, and has in particularly been “unusually bold” when it comes to transgender rights, Issenberg said.\n\nAmong the guests invited to the bill signing at the White House Tuesday were prominent members of the LGBTQ community and activists. They included Judith Kasen-Windsor, widow of gay rights activist Edie Windsor; Matthew Haynes, co-owner of Club Q, the LGBTQ club in Colorado Springs where a gunman last month killed five people in a mass shooting; Club Q shooting survivors James Slaugh and Michael Anderson; and a number of plaintiffs from cases that culminated in the landmark civil rights case Obergefell vs. Hodges, in which the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples can marry nationwide.\n\nPhilanthropist and Democratic donor David Bohnett, who has been an outspoken gay- and transgender-rights activist and longtime supporter of Biden, told CNN that Tuesday’s bill signing could not come at a more crucial moment.\n\n“[Biden] has demonstrated his support for decades for lesbian and gay civil rights, and Tuesday’s signing into law is a reaffirmation of that during this time when rights are under assault,” Bohnett said. “I think we’re here in response to the hateful and discriminatory actions and tactics by so many in the right-wing and so many that want to dismantle the rights that we fought so hard for for a long time.”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly reflect Judith Kasen-Windsor’s first name.", "authors": ["Mj Lee Betsy Klein Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee", "Betsy Klein", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/08/house-same-sex-marriage-vote/10839838002/", "title": "Same-sex marriage bill passes in House, heads to Biden - live ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The House passed historic legislation Thursday that would federally protect same-sex and interracial marriage rights in a major win for LGBTQ-rights advocates.\n\nBiden expected to sign the measure into law: Passage of the bill moves it to President Joe Biden, who is expected to sign it into law.\n\nPassage of the bill moves it to President Joe Biden, who is expected to sign it into law.

Dozens of past plaintiffs in lawsuits who fought for marriage equality watched the ceremony from the White House steps.\n\nLauper, who has advocated for LGBTQ rights, thanked the president and those who helped get the bill passed.\n\n“We can rest easy tonight because our families are validated,” Lauper said during a special appearance at the White House press briefing. “Now we’re allowed to love who we love.”\n\nMore:How Joe Biden became the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history\n\nFor Biden, his signature on the legislation strengthens a reputation as the most pro-LGBTQ president in U.S. history – a legacy that started when, as vice president in May 2012, Biden got ahead of his boss, President Barack Obama, by saying he was “absolutely comfortable” with men marrying men or women marrying women.\n\n\"What this is all about a simple proposition. Who do you love?\" Biden said at the time during an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nBiden recalled that moment during Tuesday's remarks – \"I got in trouble,\" he joked – and asked the same question from 10 years ago: \"Who do you love? And will you be loyal to that person you love?\"\n\nHe added: \"It's not more complicated than that. This law recognizes that everyone should have the right to answer those questions for themselves without the government interfering.\"\n\nThere were about 710,000 married same-sex couple households in the U.S. in 2021, and about 500,000 unmarried same-sex couple households, according to data from the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey.\n\nThe new law does not require that states issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples but that they accept the legitimacy of valid marriages performed elsewhere.\n\nMore:'We feel more secure': As Respect for Marriage Act passes, same-sex couples share tentative enthusiasm\n\nThe legislation cleared the House last week in a 258-169 vote, with 39 Republicans joining all Democrats, and passed the Senate 61-39, with 12 Republicans voting in favor.\n\nThe bipartisan votes reflect a rapid sea change in views about same-sex marriage, which even many Democrats were reluctant to support a decade ago.\n\nBiden concluded his remarks by pointing to more societal challenges ahead: \"When a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, this is still wrong,\" he said.\n\nBiden voiced his support for legislation that would expand federal civil rights laws to LGBTQ people and said \"we must stop the hate and violence\" on display in last month's shooting at an LGBTQ bar in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that left five dead and many more wounded. He also called out the \"hundreds of callous, cynical\" bills introduced in many states targeting transgender people.\n\n\"The antidote to hate is love,\" the president said. \"This law and the love it defends strikes a blow against hate in all its forms.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/respect-for-marriage-act-what-matters/index.html", "title": "The fine print of the Respect for Marriage Act | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story first ran in July. It also appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nLet’s start with the positive: Republicans and Democrats are coming together to protect same-sex marriage from the Supreme Court. The Respect for Marriage Act, which safeguards the right to same-sex marriage nationwide, passed the House with bipartisan support earlier this week and now awaits a Senate vote.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act codifies marriages and came about amid worries among Democrats that the same conservative majority on the Supreme Court that took away the right to abortion will target same-sex marriage in the future.\n\nThe version that overcame a filibuster in the Senate passed the Senate Tuesday. A dozen Republican senators from across the country voted with Democrats before Thanksgiving to limit debate and move toward a final vote.\n\nRELATED: Meet the 12 Republicans who voted to consider the Respect for Marriage Act\n\nIt next goes to the House for approval before President Joe Biden can sign it into law.\n\nBut there is a fair amount of fine print.\n\nFirst, the bill does not require all states to allow same-sex marriage, even though that is the current reality under the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Rather, if the Supreme Court overturned Obergefell and previous state prohibitions on same-sex marriage came back into effect, the Respect for Marriage Act would require states and the federal government to respect marriages conducted in places where it is legal.\n\nThere are religious exceptions. Republican supporters have emphasized the elements in this Senate version that protect nonprofit and religious organizations from having to provide support for same-sex marriages.\n\n“I will be supporting the substitute amendment because it will ensure our religious freedoms are upheld and protected, one of the bedrocks of our democracy,” said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito in a statement after helping break the filibuster.\n\nIt took months of behind-the-scenes effort to bring 10-plus Republicans on board.\n\nThis is all academic right now. The bill is only being passed in case the now-solidly conservative Supreme Court, which has taken delight in upending precedent, were to revisit the Obergefell v. Hodges decision that created a national right to marriage for same-sex couples.\n\nTwo of the justices who voted in favor of that ruling have been replaced by Republican-appointed conservatives, which means that if the case were heard today, there’s a real likelihood it would be decided differently.\n\nWhile Justice Samuel Alito seemed to want to wall off the abortion rights precedent upended by the Supreme Court earlier this year, CNN’s Ariane de Vogue has written about how the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization could affect issues like marriage. Read her story.\n\nA complete 180 in Congress\n\nHere’s a brief history of marriage equality playing a role in prior election years:\n\nToday, it’s Republicans and Democrats, along with a Democratic president, working together to protect same-sex marriage from a government institution.\n\nDuring that time, public support for same-sex marriage grew from about a quarter of the public in the year the Defense of Marriage Act was enacted to 71% in Gallup polling this year.\n\nThe issue has played a role in multiple US elections, including, arguably, the one that just took place.\n\nHere’s a brief history of marriage equality playing a role in prior election years:\n\n26 years ago, there was united opposition\n\nIn 1996, Republican majorities in the House and Senate sensed a political opening after then-President Bill Clinton failed to allow gay people to openly serve in the military.\n\nThey were also trying to get ahead of a Hawaii court decision that could have legalized same-sex marriage in that state. Fearing every state might have to recognize same-sex unions, Republicans pushed the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA.\n\nIt declared marriage as between one man and one woman and allowed states to refuse to recognize marriages. It also withheld federal benefits from married same-sex couples. In 2013, a part of DOMA was found to be unconstitutional.\n\nDOMA had broad approval. Democrats like then-Sen. Joe Biden voted for the bill. Current Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and many other Democrats whose names you’d recognize, were among the 342 who voted for the bill in the House.\n\nCurrent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was among the 67 members to vote “no,” along with Rep. Steve Gunderson, who at the time was the House’s only openly gay Republican.\n\n18 years ago, Republicans used opposing gay marriage to their advantage\n\nIn 2004, placing anti-gay-marriage amendments on ballots in key states like Ohio was smart politics. It helped George W. Bush win reelection to the White House and the GOP gain seats in the US Senate.\n\nBush endorsed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. The Democratic candidate, John Kerry, also opposed same-sex marriage at the time.\n\n14 years ago, Democrat Barack Obama opposed gay marriage\n\nIn 2008, even as more in his party began to publicly support marriage equality, Obama continued his opposition.\n\nHe has more recently said and written that he always personally supported same-sex marriage rights. His campaign aide David Axelrod has written that Obama made a calculated decision to oppose gay marriage.\n\n“He grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a ‘sacred union,’” Axelrod wrote in a memoir.\n\n10 years ago, Obama made the political calculation to support gay marriage\n\nIn 2012, following the lead of then-Vice President Biden, Obama officially evolved on the issue and said he now supported marriage equality. It was a big moment.\n\nA few years later, in 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\n5 years ago, Donald Trump was the first Republican presidential nominee to publicly support marriage equality\n\n“I’m fine with it,” Trump said in 2016 during an interview with “60 Minutes.”\n\nHe’d go on to brag about being a champion for gay rights, although many LGBTQ activists would disagree.\n\nNow, completing the transformation\n\nThe politicians of the ’90s have largely evolved with the country.\n\nBut one of the Supreme Court’s relics from the ’90s, Justice Clarence Thomas, recently questioned the 2015 marriage decision he opposed. As a result, Republicans and Democrats are coming together again, in less than a generation, to undo what they did in 1996, and try to guarantee marriage as a right for all Americans.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

The children killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012, should have spent this year thinking about college, taking their SATs and getting their driver’s licenses.

Marriage bill\n\nThe House is expected to vote and pass legislation today that would protect same-sex and interracial marriage. The Respect for Marriage Act, which the Senate passed last week in a bipartisan vote, needs to be approved by the House before sending it to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. The bill would not set a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage, but it would require individual states to recognize another state’s legal marriage. In a sign of how much support has grown in recent years for same-sex marriage, the bill found backing from 12 Republican senators last week, including those in deeply red states.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine is “going to take a while,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday as he warned of the “increasing” threat of nuclear war. Putin said he viewed the Russian nuclear arsenal as a deterrent rather than a provocation – but has not dismissed the idea of using nuclear weapons outright. “We have not gone crazy. We are aware of what nuclear weapons are,” Putin said. “We have these means… but we are not going to brandish these weapons like a razor, running around the world.” His comments come as the Biden administration is weighing Ukrainian requests for access to the US stockpile of controversial cluster munitions. These types of scatter weapons are imprecise by design and are banned by more than 100 countries. Still, Russia is using them to devastating effect inside Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Mud, blood, trenches': Ukrainian soldier compares Bakhmut battle to World Wars 03:21 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Power grid attacks\n\nElectricity for thousands of residents in North Carolina has been restored after a dayslong outage caused by targeted gun attacks on power substations. Police say the motive behind the attacks in Moore County remains unknown and no suspects have been announced. However, investigators are zeroing in on two possible threads centered around extremist behavior: writings by extremists on online forums encouraging attacks on critical infrastructure, and a series of recent disruptions of LGBTQ events across the nation by domestic extremists. Approximately 45,000 homes and businesses initially lost power when the outages occurred on Saturday, leaving residents without heat, running refrigerators or traffic lights for about four days.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police find new evidence in North Carolina power grid attack 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Immigration\n\nThe Biden administration has appealed a federal court decision that blocked the use of Title 42 – a controversial Trump-era policy allowing for the swift removal of migrants at the US-Mexico border. The authority has been heavily criticized by public health experts and immigrant advocates, and has largely barred asylum at the US-Mexico border. While its origins were in the Trump administration, Title 42 has become a key tool for the Biden administration as it faces mass migration in the Western hemisphere. Officials have been bracing for an influx of migrants when the authority lifts on December 21. The Department of Homeland Security is projecting up to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border per day when the policy is lifted.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN visits US-Mexico border where migrants wait to cross into US 04:00 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Covid-19\n\nCovid-19 hospitalizations are on the rise in the US, with more than 34,000 new admissions last week – but millions of vaccine doses and antiviral treatments remain unused. The federal government has spent more than $30 billion so far on Covid-19 vaccines and the Biden administration has said it cannot afford to continue this level of spending unless Congress provides it with more funds. As a result, the administration has started to prepare for the transition of the vaccines to the commercial market. Pfizer and Moderna have already announced that the commercial prices of their Covid-19 vaccines will likely be between $82 and $130 per dose – or about three to four times what the federal government has paid.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nHarry and Meghan Netflix documentary released today\n\nEveryone has been waiting for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to spill the royal tea.

It now heads to the House where it's expected to pass as early as next week.\n\nWisconsin Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay person to serve in the Senate, said its passage should allay the concerns of same-sex and interracial couples worried their civil marriage could be stripped away.\n\n“The Senate has the opportunity to put those fears to rest and give millions of people in same sex and interracial marriages the certainty, dignity and respect that they need and deserve,” she said before the vote.\n\nSenators approved the bill in response to concerns the Supreme Court – with a 6-3 conservative majority – would reverse its 2015 decision recognizing the legitimacy of gay marriage just as it overturned in June the Roe v.

But bipartisan sponsors of the bill said the religious freedom language inserted in the measure would protect those entities from such infringements.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act would guarantee federal recognition of any marriage between two people if the union was valid in the state where they married.\n\nIt now moves to the House, which approved a similar bill earlier this year with nearly 50 Republicans in support. A vote in the House could take place as early as next Tuesday.\n\nThe bill was drafted in response to the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v.

Collins: List of religious groups back amended legislation\n\nIn an effort to show the bill would not destroy religious liberty as some Republicans content, GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said the Respect for Marriage Act listed several faith-based organizations who have endorsed the amended measure including: the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Seventh Day Adventist Church, the National Association of Evangelicals, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish congregations.\n\n“The leader of one religious group recently wrote that our legislation as amended sends a strong bipartisan message to Congress, the administration and the public that LGTBQ rights can coexist with religious protections,” she said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nSen.

Utah Sen. Mike Lee introduced one amendment to minimize threats to religious organizations and individuals.\n\nLee said religious organizations, schools and small businesses would be harmed by the bill which requires states that do not recognize the legitimacy of gay marriage to accept same-sex couples who have legally wedded in another state. He said his amendment would prohibit the federal government from discrimination against these entities based on religious beliefs.\n\n“Rabbis, Imans, pastors should never be forced to perform a marriage contrary to their beliefs,” Lee said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nSame-sex vote will be personal for Sen. Chuck Schumer\n\nFor Chuck Schumer, today’s vote in the Senate to enshrine gay marriage is more than just a legislative victory, it’s a personal triumph as well.\n\nThe Senate majority leader’s youngest daughter, Allison, married her wife in 2018 – a union that once seemed ironclad but that came into this summer when the U.S. Supreme Court reversed precedent on abortion access when it overturned Roe. v. Wade. Other precedents, including the court’s 2015 decision recognizing gay marriage, suddenly seemed at risk as well, Schumer said.\n\n“It’s a scary but necessary acknowledgement that, despite all the progress we’ve made, the constitutional right to same-sex marriage is not even a decade old, and exists only by the virtue of a very narrow 5-4 Supreme Court decision,” he said on the Senate floor Tuesday. “And we all know the court has changed since that decision. As we have already seen this year, what the court has decided in the past can be easily taken away in the future.”\n\nSchumer, sporting the same purple tie he wore at his daughter's wedding, said the first call he'll make once the bill passes will be to Allison, who is expecting a baby this spring.\n\n“I want them to raise their child with all the love and security that every child deserves,” he said, choking up. “And the bill we are passing today will ensure their rights won’t be trampled upon simply because they’re in a same-sex marriage.”\n\n– Ledge King\n\nWhat's happening in Congress this week?:Is a government shutdown coming?

My husband and I were among the lucky guests invited to witness this historic signing held in the vastness of the White House’s South Lawn.\n\nThe festive gathering certainly felt like a real nuptial. The atmosphere was electric. People came in from all over the country. We flew in from Los Angeles on a redeye. We reconnected with friends whom we hadn’t seen in person for years, heard great music, courtesy of Cyndi Lauper and Sam Smith and strained our necks to see the VIPs who had shown up. Most importantly, hope for a better future was in the air. All were there to celebrate (yes, they even played Kool & The Gang’s wedding staple).\n\nStanding in the cold and listening to the President discuss his own journey on the issue of same-sex marriage made me reflect on what Jeff and I have been through in our relationship. Like all couples, we’ve had our share of ups and downs (dealing with finances and family, figuring out where to live, even establishing the timeline for when we first met). While we’ve done our best to navigate these common struggles, as a queer couple, we’ve faced additional challenges imposed by our own government.\n\nThe first came in 2008. During that election cycle, I was so busy serving on Barack Obama’s Presidential campaign to help elect our nation’s first bi-racial president that I didn’t pay enough attention to Proposition 8, an initiative to limit the definition of marriage in the California constitution to heterosexual couples, especially since the polling looked like it was going to fail. Then in the fall, when proponents began scaring suburban moms with ads about the threat to their children, suddenly, we began to fear what if.\n\nOut of growing concern, Jeff and I held a shotgun wedding at the office of a public official we knew, attended only by his sister and young nephew and one of our closest friends. While we were happy to be able to tie the knot, we weren’t celebratory. We didn’t even go out for lunch.\n\nWhen Prop 8 narrowly passed the following week, out of respect for our friends and community who had suddenly lost that right, we cancelled any thought of having a more public reception or ceremony. No big Chinese wedding banquets for us.\n\nOutside of our immediate family and circle of friends, we told very few people about our changed relationship status. As our marriage stayed hidden in the closet, we still had to navigate a whole bunch of other things affected by government policy like hospital visits, taxes, and inheritance. Things came to head when we began exploring starting a family through the foster care and adoption system, only to face hurdles and disapproving judgment from a government case worker assigned to us. (I will save those gory details for another essay.)\n\nWhen the US Supreme Court decided the landmark case of Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 guaranteeing the right to marriage for same-sex couples, we cheered. Finally, our government was being held accountable about the full meaning of justice for all. We were safe because we, our friends and the rest of the community now had court precedence on our side. And we became confident enough to come out as husbands. So many people were surprised to hear that we were legally wed. Still no gifts, but hey, we were happy just for the warm smiles.\n\nLife was good. Our families steadily grew to accept our marriage. We even sorted out the issue of how to present ourselves in tax returns.\n\nBut, this summer, when the US Supreme Court ‘s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision overturned Roe v. Wade, it threw the concept of precedent out the door, immediately threatening rights that had been considered settled by the Court decades ago as well as ones more recently established. The longest-serving member of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas, made this crystal clear in his concurring opinion, stating that in “future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence and Obergefell.”\n\nWe were left unsettled. We started to wonder again, what if.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThankfully, the Respect for Marriage Act that Biden signed gives Jeff and me, and others like us who are already married or live in states where same-sex marriage is politically relatively safe, security from people who have no business in our relationship, those who are trying to deny us the benefits that they take for granted. As we get older, this law gives us peace of mind to focus on the things that matter: preparing for our future and retirement, taking care of parents, thinking about our nieces’ and nephews’ futures and so on.\n\nBut, while this law is important, we – once again – can’t quite fully celebrate. Like most weddings, after the celebration, the hard part of the relationship begins. This bill protects us at the federal level and for federal benefits, but if Thomas and the court’s far-right majority do “reconsider” the cases that establish rights to privacy, contraception and same-sex marriage, individual states (some of which have leaders who have expressed a clear interest in doing so) could be able to discriminate in how they define marriage, forcing residents who want to recognize their same-sex relationship through marriage to turn to states that don’t discriminate. Just like women now have to do for their reproductive choices because of Dobbs. Only once we have firmly guaranteed that every American has the right to marry whom they choose – regardless of sexual orientation – can we fully celebrate.

Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., said in an interview with The Arizona Republic.\n\nThe revised version of the bill that bypassed a potential filibuster with the help of 12 Republican Senators and has been backed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, would repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act signed into law by former President Bill Clinton.\n\nIt would mandate the federal government to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages while ensuring that non-profit religious organizations are exempt from providing “any services, facilities, or goods for the solemnization or celebration of a marriage,” according to the bill’s summary. Lawmakers have made clear that the bill does not recognize polygamous unions.\n\nWhile same-sex marriage has been legal in Arizona since 2014 when U.S. District Judge John W. Sedwick ordered the state to “permanently cease” its ban on gay marriage, it didn’t become legal across all 50 states until 2015 when the Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage constitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\nBut some advocates now fear Obergefell could too be at risk of being overturned following the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson earlier in the summer which returned the issue of abortion rights to the states.\n\nIn a concurring opinion to the Dobbs decision, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the court “should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.”\n\n“What we’re learning now is that the Supreme Court was never going to be enough to protect us as a community,” said Jeanne Woodbury, the interim executive director for Equality Arizona, a political nonprofit that advocates for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nDespite efforts by Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh to rebuke Thomas’ assertion, Democratic lawmakers were motivated to enshrine same-sex marriage as a backstop for the conservative-leaning court.\n\n“We began working together in a bipartisan coalition immediately to make sure that we could take action to protect these loving families and protect their rights and privileges in marriage,” said Sinema, who was an original co-sponsor of the legislation and helped shore up GOP support for its passage in the Senate.\n\nWhile Woodbury acknowledged the importance of the bipartisan legislation to preserve marriage equality for the LGBTQ+ community, she remained concerned that the legislation doesn’t go far enough to protect the rights enshrined by Obergefell.\n\nThe proposed legislation would require states to recognize valid legal marriages, but it stops short of requiring states to issue marriage licenses contrary to a state’s law.\n\n“It’d be nice to have federal law that protects people from state governments that don’t have our best interest in mind,” Woodbury said. “That’s what we have with Obergefell now, and it’s not exactly what we would have with the Respect for Marriage Act.”\n\nOnce the legislation gets to the House for final passage it is likely to pass along bipartisan lines.

You hear that sound, Elon? That’s the sound of pending civil unrest.”\n\nAfter more jeers, Chappelle ended his show with a reprimand and a prayer.\n\n“Booing is not the best thing you can do,” he said. “I wish everybody in this auditorium the joy of feeling free and may your pursuit of happiness set you free. Amen.”\n\nMusk on Monday appeared to nod to the incident in response to a user tweeting at him about “a crowd full of boos.” Musk claimed that it “was 90% cheers & 10% boos (except during quiet periods), but, still, that’s a lot of boos, which is a first for me in real life (frequent on Twitter).”\n\nAccording to several people who tweeted videos of the incident, Chappelle gave Musk several opportunities to address the crowd, but Musk stood on stage without much reaction.\n\nAfter Musk’s $44 billion Twitter takeover, the billionaire owner enacted a number of cost-cutting measures. He has laid off around half of the company’s staff, resulting in a group of former employees suing, alleging the mass layoffs involved multiple labor rights violations.\n\nThe remaining staff had to agree to “extremely hardcore” work that appears to have left some people sleeping at Twitter’s headquarters. San Francisco is investigating reports that Musk converted several areas of the office building into makeshift bedrooms.\n\nThis incident at the Chase Center capped off a weekend in which Musk, who has a history of erratic behavior and incendiary remarks, waded fully into the culture wars. Musk tweeted that Anthony Fauci, the outgoing director of the National Institutes of Health and Infectious Diseases, should be prosecuted, writing that his “pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.” Musk has been vocal of Fauci’s response to the Covid pandemic, including lockdowns that have affected his Tesla plants.\n\nMusk also repeated a trope of the QAnon conspiracy theory movement by falsely suggesting that Twitter’s former trust and safety executive Yoel Roth’s doctoral dissertation made him an advocate for child sexualization. Those tweets subjected Roth to online abuse and abusive behavior.\n\nMusk continued his culture war campaign on Monday, once again warning about the thread of what he calls “the woke mind virus.”", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}]}

In it, the companies will test bidirectional charging technology to see whether it can safely power the essential needs of a properly equipped home.\n\nBidirectional charging allows EVs to both receive power from the grid to charge the vehicle and send power from the vehicle to power a home, business, another vehicle or even back into the grid, said Phil Lienert, GM spokesman.\n\n\"Imagine a future where everyone is driving an electric vehicle — and where that EV serves as a backup power option at home and more broadly as a resource for the grid,\" PG&E CEO Patti Poppe said in a statement. \"Not only is this a huge advancement for electric reliability and climate resiliency, it’s yet another advantage of clean-powered EVs.\"\n\nThe latest conspiracy theory:Is Biden driving up gas prices to get you to buy an EV?

The results were validated by a third party using a vehicle dynamometer. Ijaz said he could not name the firm that validated the results due to ONE's agreement with it but said it was a global company in metro Detroit that does EPA certification for automakers.\n\nThe retrofitted Tesla is currently parked in Las Vegas, where the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is being held. Ijaz plans to meet with investors there.\n\nA 30-year veteran of auto companies (having worked at Ford and Apple), he left 18 months ago to join the ranks of entrepreneurs when he launched ONE.\n\nHe moved his headquarters from Silicon Valley to metro Detroit last year and already gained investments to the tune of millions from Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and BMW to name a few.\n\nFinding a way to allow a vehicle to go 752 miles on a single charge represents the Holy Grail of EV’s future. Right now, the range for a single charge for most EVs on the road is roughly half that.\n\nThe global race now among battery makers is to create technology that will resolve the range anxiety issue drivers have and make EVs a practical vehicle for more consumers.\n\n\"This is very impressive,\" said John McElroy, longtime host of Autoline and auto analyst at WWJ Newsradio 950, when asked about ONE’s test drive results. \"It’s pretty good for a battery still under development. But, unless they do the EPA driving test, going 55 mph like others under same conditions, it's hard to stack them up.\"\n\nI asked Ijaz why ONE didn’t do the EPA test and he explained, “When reviewing what Tesla did to originally certify range of the Model S, it took six days of testing in a special procedure. We did not have time to run that test and decided a 55 mph run would suffice as a proof that we did not game the real world road test.\"\n\nGlenn Stevens, executive director of MICHAuto, who has been involved with the industry for decades, said of ONE’s test drive results: “This is great news. We are seeing a revolution right now in EV battery technology and it's great to see it taking place in Michigan.\"\n\nStevens, who hails from Marquette, test drove a Ford Mach-E across Michigan last summer and said he opted against going to the U.P. as there were scant charging stations.\n\n\"As this revolution unfolds, it will be great to see who leads in this battery space as that really is the Holy Grail of convincing people to buy electric,” Stevens added.\n\nI’ve talked to many in recent months — folks like actor William Shatner, auto icon Bob Lutz and students at Oakland University — about what it will take to encourage people to own EVs as part of a recent TV special for CBS 62 called \"Our Electric Future.\" It talked about EVs and highlighted concerns over range anxiety.\n\nMore:What 8 famous people with ties to Michigan shared with me in 2021\n\nMore:EVs are new to you but have a long history in the Motor City\n\n“To reach the full market potential for electric cars, we need to eliminate the barriers holding back the market,” Ijaz said. “We want an electric car to become an obvious choice as your only car needed. This demonstration marks the beginning of a new era making that possible.\"\n\nThe solution to range issues currently focuses on adding more charging stations —something municipalities and companies in Michigan and elsewhere have been doing.\n\nIjaz said relying on charging stations, even fast charging ones, still presents challenges like waiting in lines and not recharging as fast as advertised. The solution is a battery with more firepower that will take a vehicle longer distances on a single charge.\n\nONE has created two EV batteries. The first, called Aries, uses a material called Lithium Iron Phosphate. Ten years ago, this technology could offer 150 miles of range for an electric vehicle. What Aries has done is improve upon that and offers 350 miles in the same vehicle without additional costs or safety, Ijaz said. The company has a contract with a commercial truck maker to provide it the Aries battery later this year.\n\nHis second battery, Gemini, uses a dual battery technology that works together as one chemistry, as one is designed to use everyday for 150 miles, then the other extends the range another 600 miles in extender architecture that uses no cobalt or nickel and can power an EV 750 miles on a single charge. Lithium Iron Phosphate is always powering the vehicle.\n\nONE plans to begin production of Aries later this year, with a goal of producing the Gemini prototype batteries in 2023, as it is still in the research phase.\n\nIjaz chose a Tesla for his test drive because, “it was easy to convert by having a large battery volume (over 400 liters of space), was readily available on the market, and a had a well engineered efficient electric drive and aerodynamic platform.”\n\nHe also explained why ONE decided to do its test drive in Michigan versus warmer states.\n\n“We studied going south where the climate was not freezing but decided that ONE is proud to be a Michigan battery company and what better way to celebrate innovations born in Detroit than to make the destination for our range run the Upper Peninsula,” he said. “Also it’s a tribute to the clean air and water we seek to protect as we transition away from fossil fuels.”\n\nContact Carol Cain: 313-222-6732 or clcain@cbs.com.

Lincoln didn’t say anything about the range of power outputs and battery sizes that its upcoming EVs will offer.\n\nThe interior features a single pedal for the one-pedal driving many EV owners choose to maximize regenerative braking. Other features include video screens the width of the dashboard, rear video and lattice accents of 3D-printed metal.\n\nThe front trunk is made of electrochromic glass that’s clear when the vehicle is moving, which allows more light into the cabin.\n\nThe panels of the front trunk would become opaque when the Star isn’t moving to avoid displaying its contents to passersby.\n\n\"Interior and exterior lighting are very important,” Lincoln interior design chief Robert Gelardi said.\n\nThe concept was designed and built in Lincoln’s Dearborn studios, with input from around the world, particularly China, where the company had planned to unveil it this week, before the Beijing auto show was canceled because of COVID-19.

Many studies show the opposite to be true.\n\nMore:Study compares electric vehicle charge costs vs. gas — and results were surprising\n\nStill, no single study can account for every scenario in car ownership.\n\nThere are differences in: personal driving habits, the local cost of gasoline, access to public charging, personal charging habits, fuel economy of the ICE car versus driving range of the EV model ... to name a few.\n\nThe consensus is that most EV owners charge predominantly at home, but the public infrastructure required to support widespread EV adoption still needs work.\n\nAs interest in EVs grows among buyers, here are some top-of-mind questions and answers inspired by readers.\n\nMore: 4 things to know before you buy an electric vehicle\n\nWhich is cheaper to own: An EV or internal combustion engine car?\n\nThe consensus is an EV.\n\nThat's factoring in tax credits at time of purchase of a new EV and lower maintenance costs because EVs have fewer parts and don't need regular care such as oil changes or antifreeze. Many EV owners also say there is a time savings to not waiting in service lounges for routine vehicle maintenance.\n\nMany local utilities offer discounts to charge at home during nighttime off-peak hours.\n\nLast year, Consumer Reports did a 45-page cost comparison and found the savings advantage to total ownership costs for an EV is significant the first few years and continues to improve the longer a person owns the car. It compared the nine most popular EVs priced less than $50,000 with the \"best-selling, top-rated, and most efficient vehicles in their class.\"\n\nFor the EVs analyzed, the study found that fuel savings can be at least $4,700 over the first seven years. The lifetime ownership cost savings were estimated at $6,000 to $10,000.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the cost to insure an EV will be slightly higher than that of a gasoline car because it generally costs more to do major repairs on EVs than on a gasoline car.\n\nHow long does an EV battery last and how much is it to replace?\n\nBatteries are one of the more expensive components in an EV. If you need to replace one after the warranty expires, the average cost is about $5,500, according to vehicle shopping website TrueCar. The federal government requires an eight-year warranty on EV batteries. Most automakers offer eight or 10 years.\n\nThe good news is EV batteries tend to last a long time, though they lose range as they age. The average EV battery will lose about 2.3% of its initial range annually, TrueCar wrote.\n\nWhich is cheaper to power: An EV or internal combustion car?\n\nThis is a hot topic and depends on a lot of variables.\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy's eGallon.com, it costs about half as much to drive an EV compared with a gasoline car. Based on the average price for regular gasoline in March of $2.85, the comparable eGallon cost is $1.16. The Department of Energy defines an eGallon as the cost of fueling a vehicle with electricity compared with a similar vehicle that runs on gasoline.\n\nAn independent 36-page study released last week by Anderson Economic Group found higher costs when factoring in the cost of the residential charger, cost of commercial electricity and the cost of \"deadhead miles\" driven to find a fast charger. There are no other surveys citing so-called \"deadhead miles\" as a significant cost. Most EV owners charge primarily at home and use smart phone apps to find available chargers when that's not possible.\n\nMichigan assesses an EV tax of $100 a year for vehicles weighing less than 8,000 pounds to offset the decrease in gasoline tax income. A $200 annual tax will be assessed for EVs weighing more than 8,000 pounds. The upcoming GMC Hummer EV pickup is likely to be the first personal use vehicle subject to that tax.\n\nMore:Study compares electric vehicle charge costs vs. gas — and results were surprising\n\nThe Anderson study said a mid-priced internal combustion car that gets 33 miles per gallon would cost $8.58 in overall costs to drive 100 miles at $2.81 a gallon. But a mid-priced EV, such as Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf or a Tesla Model 3, would cost $12.95 to drive 100 miles in terms of costs that include recharging the vehicle using mostly a commercial charger.\n\nHow much does it cost to install at-home chargers?\n\nEV drivers do most of their charging at home, during off-peak hours at a considerable savings.\n\nA Level 1 charger is a cord or charging system that usually comes with the vehicle during purchase. It can be plugged into a standard 120 Volt, 20 amp circuit wall outlet, according to Evocharge website. EvoCharge is a hardware provider of EV charging stations and cable management.\n\nA Level 2 system provides a 240-volt current for faster charging and requires a 208-240 Volt, 40 amp circuit.\n\nThe average cost of an L2 charger is $500-$2,200, according to website EV Love, a website created by women for women who want to own EVs. PlugStar shopping site lists L2 home chargers for as low as $174.\n\nHiring an electrician to install an L2 charger can cost from $250 to over $1,000 depending on the home and charger wall mounting, various reports say.\n\nA Level 2 home charger operates at about the same voltage used to power household appliances like dryers or electric range stoves, so there is usually no need for additional insurance coverage for a Level 2 charger in the home, according to a report by Kelley Blue Book. KBB wrote that some underwriters may require photographs or documentation that the home-charging unit has been properly and professionally installed.\n\nWhat is the actual charging time involved in driving an EV?\n\nMost electric owners have access to Level 2 240v chargers at home, work or both.\n\nAn L2 charger will get an average of 32 miles of driving range per hour of charge.\n\nArt Causin, who lives on Long Island, New York, owns a 2018 Tesla Model 3 with a range of 300 miles. He recharges it fully overnight using a Level 2 charger.\n\n\"The charger is programmed to start at 11 p.m. and stop at 7 a.m.,\" Causin said. \"My electric company, PSEG LI, provides me with a 25% reduction for charging at night. My home charging setup was essentially free, as the IRS gave me a $500 rebate on my home charging setup.\"\n\nCausin said the only time he uses a commercial charging station is when he travels.\n\n\"The Tesla navigation system plans your trip to route you to a Tesla Supercharger,\" Causin said. \"A 250-mile charge takes 20 minutes. All Supercharging stations are located near a Starbucks or similar establishment. So on a trip, after four hours of driving, I charge my car, stretch my legs, get a cup of coffee, go to the bathroom and I'm on my way.\"\n\nOther automakers and independent companies also offer apps to help with route-planning to commercial chargers.\n\nConsumers Energy is addressing the “charging inconvenience” issue, said Brian Wheeler, media relations manager.\n\nIt has installed 30 Level 3 fast-charging stations around the state that can fully power an EV battery in less than an hour, he said. The current plan is for Consumers to install 200 public fast-charging stations — plus 2,000 Level 2 chargers at homes and businesses across Michigan through charger rebates and lower electrical rates — over the next three years.\n\nDC fast-chargers, sometimes called Level 3, provide faster charging than Level 2. Wider availability of DC fast-charging is widely considered a key to expanded EV use.\n\nAdditionally, Consumers Energy recently introduced the Bring Your Own Charger program that offers special charging rates for customers who buy a home EV charging system, or use one that comes with an EV, like the Ford F-150 Lightning.\n\nWill the current power grid support widespread EV use?\n\nGeneral Motors will spend $35 billion by 2025 on EVs, bringing 30 new EVs to market in that time. It aspires for its entire light-duty vehicle lineup to be zero emissions by 2035 and it plans to double revenues by 2030 largely with new EVs.\n\nFord Motor Co. has said it will invest more than $11 billion in manufacturing a strong, dependable supply of essential parts for electric vehicles, creating nearly 11,000 jobs along the way.\n\nMore: Can Michigan's power grid handle future electric vehicles? Yes -- to a point.\n\nWith more electric cars planned, a bigger and better charging infrastructure is needed.\n\nIn April, GM introduced Ultium Charge 360 for its retail car buyers. In June, GM expanded the technology to fleet customers. Ultium Charge 360 is technology that ties GM's vehicle mobile apps to other products and services that make it easier for drivers to find charging stations and pay to charge their vehicles.\n\nBut many worry there is still a need for greater electric-grid capacity.\n\nA 2018 Department of Energy study found that increased electrification across all sectors of the economy will increase power consumption by up to 38% by 2050 and EVs would account for the bulk of it. So the environmental benefit of EVs depends on the electricity being generated by renewable energy sources.\n\nThat means utilities and power generators must invest billions of dollars creating additional capacity while also finding a way to replace fossil fuels with renewables. Then, there is factoring in extreme weather events to up the challenge. Take the winter storms in Texas earlier this year that caused failure of the power grid there.\n\nA Reuters report in March said a model utility with 2 to 3 million customers would need to invest $1,700 and $5,800 in grid upgrades per EV through 2030 to meet expected demands. Reuters cited Boston Consulting Group, adding that if there are 40 million EVs on the road, that investment could reach $200 billion.\n\nBut there are others that say transitioning to EVs does not pose a threat to the power grid or electricity supply.\n\nIn a March opinion piece written for Energy News Network by Charlie Michel, a retired petroleum engineer, he said, \"If managed strategically, electric vehicles can make our grid more robust and resilient.\"\n\nMichel wrote that states with excess power capacity can export it to other states.\n\n\"What’s more, electric vehicles can help make our grid more stable by storing power and functioning as a backup power source when necessary,\" Michel wrote. \"Vehicle-to-grid technology that would allow electric vehicles to provide energy to the grid during times of high demand is being piloted in North Carolina and the United Kingdom.\"\n\nVehicle-to-grid technology is the process of feeding the energy stored in an EV's battery back into the national grid to boost the energy supply during peak demand.\n\nMore:Tesla deal with Hertz is 'huge embarrassment for traditional automakers'\n\nContact Jamie L.

And the drop in value of Ford’s investment in Argo caused it to take a $2.7 billion charge in the just-completed third quarter. That resulted in an $827 million loss in the period.\n\nEven excluding the special charges for Argo and other items, Ford reported adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents, a slide from the 51 cents it earned on that basis a year ago, but a slight improvement over the 27 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nFord reported automotive revenue of $37.2 billion, a jump of $4 billion from a year ago and $1 billion more than the analysts’ forecasts. The revenue was helped by a $3.4 billion from higher pricing on vehicles.\n\nFord did have some problems in the quarter beyond the charge it took for closing down Argo. It said supply shortages left it with about 40,000 vehicles in its inventory at the end of the quarter that were built but awaiting needed parts before they can be shipped to dealers.\n\nIt also was hit with $1 billion in higher-than-expected supplier payments, and a $1.5 billion increase in commodity costs.\n\nAnd it had a smaller profit and profit margin in its core North American market due to those higher commodity costs, and a loss in China, due to costs associated with the development of electric vehicles.\n\nWhile higher pricing on vehicles helped its European unit post a narrow profit in the quarter compared to a narrow loss a year ago, CEO Jim Farley did concede, “Our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we’d like it to be.”\n\nBut, in good news, Ford raised its goal for full-year cash that will be generated by the business to be between $9.5 billion and $10 billion — up from $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion — on strength in the company’s automotive operations.\n\nShares of Ford (F) were down 1% in after-hours trading following the earnings news.\n\nBut in the end, the big news of the earnings report was a major change in direction on self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe company insists it still expects to offer full self-driving vehicles in the future, just not soon enough to make the investment such technology will require today. It said it decided it is better to invest in driver assistance technology that is closer to being implemented on vehicles today, and that customers want from their new cars, rather than a fleet of robo-taxis with no drivers at all aboard.\n\n“We’re optimistic about a future for L4 ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems], but profitable, fully autonomous vehicles at scale are a long way off and we won’t necessarily have to create that technology ourselves,” said Farley.\n\nFarley said he expects to be able to find jobs for many of the Argo employees at Ford, having them switch gears to develop L3 driver assistance features.\n\n“That’s really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we’re doing here at Argo… we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief advanced product development and technology officer.\n\nHe said there is only so much talent available to develop the different driver assistance and self-driving features.\n\n“So this is the way we want to use that talent,” he said.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Mcfarland Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Mcfarland", "Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/michigan/2015/10/22/nexthome-house-future/74038688/", "title": "Home of the future? Here's one vision", "text": "Frank Witsil\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nJim Saber stood in the space between the kitchen and living room and cradled a computer tablet that showed how everything using power in the 399-square-foot residence was interconnected.\n\nAmericans have been imagining what the home of the future looks like for decades, exploring how they will look and work, and building exhibits for World's Fairs and theme parks.\n\nBut here in this small house, sitting on the NextEnergy campus in Detroit, Saber and others are focused on energy — its generation, storage, management, current conversion and conservation.\n\nYour guide to an energy efficient life\n\nThey're looking for ways to save energy and money, such as converting household electricity so it can be more easily stored in special batteries, or maximizing the efficiency of rooftop solar panels, or using your plug-in electric vehicle to help power your home.\n\n\"It's a compilation of things that could be in your house in the next 5 to 10 years,\" Saber said. \"These are the things that are going to be in the market, and we're trying to help industry figure out how quickly they can get there and ... the value proposition.\"\n\nSaber, NextEnergy's vice president of business and technology development, has been developing and then giving tours of the home — dubbed the NextHome — to various groups for two years as scientists and entrepreneurs test ideas and tinker with products, many of them with a Michigan connection, in it that they hope to become ubiquitous in homes throughout the nation.\n\nNextEnergy, a nonprofit organization founded in 2002, works with companies and policy makers to study, develop and commercialize advanced technology to create jobs and spur innovation.\n\nThe house — which is about a fifth the size of the average-size home and cost about $125,000 to build and outfit — is hardly glamorous. It's more like a cabin, with essentially two rooms -- a living room/dining room/kitchen, and a bedroom/office — and a tiny bathroom.\n\nNo one lives in it. But someone could.\n\nIt's part lab, part exhibit and shows what is possible.\n\n\"It's not as far away as we think, and it's not going to be as complicated as we think,\" Saber said of the various technologies on display. At the same time, he said, there has to be changes in the industry and in consumer behaviors: \"If this were easy, it already would have been done by now.\"\n\nHere are five technologies you'll find in the NextHome:\n\nDC connected\n\nThis technology is the biggest innovation for the home, and a key to the future of how homes are built and operate in the future.\n\nTo understand it, you have to go back to the 1880s when Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla were debating whether direct current — current that runs in a single direction — or alternating current — current that reverses direction a certain number of times per second —- should be the standard.\n\nEdison argued for DC, which tends to be more stable and can be stored in batteries; and Tesla, AC, which is more easily converted to higher and lower voltages.\n\nAC won.\n\nBut many devices such as computers, solar cells and electric vehicles still run on DC. So now, in most homes power comes into the home as AC, but is converted to DC (this is why computer power cords have that block connected to it that often gets hot) to power each device.\n\nWith each conversion, energy is wasted. Another problem is that AC power is difficult to store.\n\nWhat if, Saber's team wanted to know, AC was converted just once before it came into your house, so everything in the home was run by DC power?\n\nHomeowners could save energy — and money — and they could store energy for the home in a battery.\n\nLet your plug-in car power your home\n\nRight now, when you charge an electric car, the power flows from the house to the car. It's a one-way street.\n\nBut, in the NextHome — since the house runs on DC — it has been set up so energy also can flow from a car back to the home. Doing so helps homeowners conserve power, makes better uses of the car batteries — and opens a variety of possibilities in how homeowners manage power and how cars and homes connect.\n\nSo, for example, when demand on grid power is highest — and most expensive — in this home, you can power your home from the energy stored in the home or car batteries. When the power demand is lower — and less expensive — you can recharge your car, saving money and putting less pressure on the grid.\n\nRoof-top solar cells\n\nSolar cells are not new technology.\n\nBut one of the problems with it is while homeowners need power at all hours, solar cells only generate electricity when the sun is out.\n\nTo get around this, many homes with solar cells sell energy to the utility company grid — which has much greater demand than a single home. When power is not being generated by the solar cells, the homeowner draws power from the grid.\n\nIn addition, power generated by the cells is in DC, but has to be converted to AC to power the home, and then is converted back to DC to run electronic devices such as a computer.\n\nIn this home, solar cells power the home directly with DC and can be stored in a Bosch energy unit, or battery. This eliminates wasted energy and hardware needed to convert currents. It also gives homeowners a way to use power generated in electric car batteries in their homes.\n\nInternet of things\n\nThe Internet of Things refers to a network in your home of devices embedded with microchips that can communicate, collect data and make money and energy-saving decisions, such as cycling your heat pump or refrigerator on and off.\n\nAs the devices in your home collect data about usage patterns, they can be programmed to automate decisions.\n\nIn the NextHome, sensors are constantly operating, and feeding information into a network that can be programmed with the tablet. It helps manage energy and make decisions.\n\nSaber expects this sort of automation, which is already happening in some homes, to continue to advance.\n\nEnergy-efficient systems\n\nThe NextHome is outfitted with DC appliances, which operate more efficiently compared to AC counterparts, including the furnace, water heater and radiant heating. In addition, if produced on a large scale, they'd be cheaper to manufacture because they'd require fewer parts.\n\nThe home has ceiling fans to help with cooling and heating. The floor heating can be powered directly by solar cells and a home battery.\n\nIn addition, the home has super efficient windows, that self-tint as the sun gets brighter — to help cut cooling costs.\n\nAnd it uses low-energy LED lights that last longer and run off DC power, which eliminates the AC/DC conversion waste.\n\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com\n\nWhat's plugged in?\n\nHere's a snapshot of the average household in Michigan, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration:\n\nSize: 1,954 square feet, a little smaller than the national average of 1,971 square feet.\n\nEnergy usage: 123 million BTUs of energy, about 38% more than the national average.\n\nWindows: 70% have double or triple-pane windows, 2% more than the national average.\n\nCar: Half of all households could park a car within 20 feet of an electric outlet, 40% could not, and the remaining households did not have a car.\n\nRefrigeration: 23% have more than one refrigerator, 37% also had a separate freezer.\n\nWashing machines: 69% have top-loaders, 12% have energy-efficient front loaders, 18% have no washer.\n\nTVs: 19% of households had just one, 35% have two, 24% had three, and 22% had four or more.

The plant is now the home for the Bolt and the slightly larger Bolt EUV. And no new location for the Bolt was included in Tuesday’s announcement.\n\n“Production of the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV will continue during the plant’s conversion activities to prepare the facility for production of the Silverado EV and Sierra EV pickups,” said GM spokesperson Dan Flores. “We are not disclosing any additional information at this time about Bolt EV or Bolt EUV production.”\n\nBolt production already halted\n\nAlthough GM (GM) said it will continue the Bolt’s production, the truth is that it hasn’t built a new Bolt since mid-November, and has barely built any since late August, selling only 25 in the United States during the last three months of 2021.\n\nThe problem is a recall of virtually all existing Bolts due to the risk of fire when the cars are parked and recharging, which will require new batteries for 143,000 recalled Bolts. That has left GM without the batteries needed to build new Bolts.\n\n“Orion is currently down through February, so we can continue focusing LG battery pack production on recall repairs,” said Flores. Last month, GM was only planning to keep production down through January. As to when production may finally resume, Flores said, “GM has not yet made a decision beyond February.”\n\nOnce a breakthrough car\n\nThe Bolt was the first pure electric vehicle offered by GM since it sold a limited-production Chevy EV1 in California in 1996. It debuted to good reviews in late 2016, including winning Green Car of the Year and Motor Trend Car of the Year honors.\n\nIt was essentially the only EV that GM sold in North American until this month when the GMC Hummer EV pickup went on sale. GM sold only one of those pickups before closing the books on 2021.\n\nGM aims to convert half of its North American assembly capacity to EV production by 2030, and shift to offering only EVs by 2035. The company has a number of other electric vehicles scheduled to hit US dealerships within the next year, including the GMC Hummer pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq, due to start production in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThose new vehicles — and all GM’s EVs going forward — have a different battery from the Bolt, dubbed Ultium, which promises superior performance. On Tuesday, GM and LG Energy Solutions also announced plans for a $2.6 billion battery plant in Lansing, Michigan, not far from Orion Township. But that will make it difficult for GM to sell Bolts with an inferior battery, even if the fire problem is fixed.\n\nAnd the Bolt is tiny — even the slightly larger Bolt EUV is a little more than 14 feet, or 170 inches, long. While that’s a few inches longer than the original, it’s about a foot shorter than a compact Toyota Corolla, even if it has somewhat more interior space and cargo capacity because it lacks an engine.\n\nOther GM EVs cost far more\n\nIts next generation of EVs are aimed at a wealthier demographic. The Hummer EVs have a starting price of between $80,000 and $110,000, while the Lyriq starts at $59,000. Pricing for the Silverado EV has yet to be announced but it will probably be in that range.\n\nAnd GM is facing more competition for the lower priced Bolt. Ford (F) is tripling its own output of its electric Mustang Mach E SUV to meet strong demand.\n\nIt helps GM to have a lower-priced EV to go with the higher-priced models it will soon be selling, especially with rivals such as Ford (F), Volkswagen (VLKAF) and Tesla (TSLA) offering EVs for less than a $45,000 starting price.\n\nBut the Bolt has a pricing disadvantage when competing with Ford and Volkswagen, as those companies’ EVs come with a $7,500 federal tax credit for buyers. GM’s hopes of getting that tax credit back for its EVs appears to have died with the apparent failure of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better legislation.\n\nThe Bolt was originally positioned as the first mass-market car from any automaker, rather than a luxury car, capable of going more than 200 miles on a single charge.\n\nGM characterized customer reaction for the Bolt as good. The company said it had better than 90% customer satisfaction in early 2021 — albeit before the recall. Since then, GM had to repurchase some Bolts from customers who were concerned that the vehicles would catch fire and who didn’t have a safe place to park them.\n\nThe Bolt also had the highest “conquest rate” of any Chevrolet car, with about 70% of the Bolt buyers switching to GM from other automakers. And GM recently redesigned the Bolt, introducing the slightly larger Bolt EUV, indicating that it plans to keep the car in its lineup for five or more years.\n\nThose plans now seem unlikely.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2022/01/25/gm-investment-michigan-lansing-orion-electric-vehicles/6619862001/", "title": "GM to invest $7B in 4 facilities across Michigan, creating 4,000 jobs", "text": "In a big win for Michigan, General Motors will invest $7 billion in four manufacturing facilities, making the state the \"hub\" of electric vehicle development and manufacturing.\n\nGM said Tuesday it will spend $2.6 billion to build a new battery factory in the Lansing area and $4 billion to convert its existing factory in Orion Township to make electric pickups. It will also spend about half a billion dollars to make upgrades to its two existing vehicle assembly plants in Lansing.\n\nGM calls it the \"single largest investment announcement in GM history,\" saying the move will create 4,000 jobs and retain 1,000 others.\n\nEconomists say that, in turn, will create thousands more ancillary jobs. GM currently employs 50,631 people in Michigan.\n\n“We are building on the positive consumer response and reservations for our recent EV launches and debuts, including GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Equinox EV and Chevrolet Silverado EV,\" said GM CEO Mary Barra in a statement. \"Our plan creates the broadest EV portfolio of any automaker and further solidifies our path toward U.S. EV leadership by mid-decade.”\n\nAs part of Tuesday's announcement, GM said Orion Assembly, along with Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck, will manufacture the 2024 Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV pickups.\n\nGM also said it is working to build a new, more reliable supply chain through strategic supplier agreements for batteries and EV components. It is expected to be scalable, more resilient, more sustainable and more North American-focused. Global supply chain issues have hampered GM and other automakers throughout the pandemic.\n\nMichigan wins\n\nOrion Assembly and the new battery cell plant will support total production of 600,000 full-size electric pickups when both Factory ZERO and Orion are fully producing in a few years, said GM President Mark Reuss, adding there will be \"operational upside at both plants. Look for us to keep growing the capacity at Factory ZERO as well.\"\n\nThat's huge, considering the state recently lost out on Ford Motor Co.'s $11 billion investment to build several new plants, including battery factories and an EV assembly plant, in Kentucky and Tennessee. That investment will create 11,000 jobs.\n\nReuss said GM's investment in Michigan made sense because GM has many long-standing partnerships with suppliers based in the state and GM worked with local governments for various financial incentives.\n\nThe announcement from GM came on the same day the Michigan Strategic Fund approved a series of incentives that total about $824 million to build the battery plant and expand Orion Assembly plant.\n\n\"This news is great for us and for Michigan, the epicenter of where we’re developing EVs,\" Reuss said. \"Michigan will be the recognized hub of innovation in the U.S. for EV development and EV manufacturing.”\n\nBarra said the investment would not have been possible without support from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the state Legislature, Orion Township, the city of Lansing, Delta Township and \"our collaboration with the UAW and LG Energy Solution.\"\n\nGM will save tens of millions of dollars by integrating its battery assembly into its EV production and converting existing assembly plants, Reuss said.\n\nGM aims to have more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of 2025 and to convert half of its North American assembly capacity to EV production by 2030.\n\nUltium Cells Lansing\n\nUltium Cells LLC, GM's joint-venture with battery maker LG Energy Solution, will spend $2.6 billion to build a new battery cell plant in Lansing on 590 acres adjacent to GM's Lansing Delta Township Assembly plant.\n\nThe acreage is inside the boundaries of Delta Township but would be conditionally transferred to the city of Lansing because only the city, and not the township, can offer GM a tax-exempt renaissance zone, Bob Trezise, president and CEO of the Lansing Economic Area Partnership, told the Free Press in a previous interview.\n\nThe plant, to be called Ultium Cells Lansing, will create more than 1,700 new Ultium Cells jobs when it is fully operational, Reuss said. Site preparations will begin this summer and battery cell production is scheduled to begin in late 2024.\n\nIt will supply battery cells to Orion Assembly and other GM assembly plants, Reuss said.\n\nUltium Cells is currently finishing construction on a new EV battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that will start running this year and create 1,100 new jobs in the area where GM closed its former Lordstown Assembly plant in 2019.\n\nUltium Cells is building another battery plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to open next year. Each plant costs about $2.3 billion. The company plans to build a fourth battery plant in the U.S. but the location has yet to be announced. Reuss said as EV adoption grows, more battery plants could be added.\n\n“If you look at where we put other cell plants, Lordstown and Spring Hill, of course, we look at other states where we have assembly plants,\" Reuss said. \"But we have a vested interest here in Michigan.”\n\nBecause the Ultium plants are a joint venture, the UAW will have to organize the plants and negotiate a separate contract from the national agreement it has with GM at GM's assembly, parts and engine facilities.\n\nA joint statement from UAW President Ray Curry and Terry Dittes, UAW vice president and director of the UAW GM Department, said GM’s commitment creates a strong future for UAW members, their families and communities.\n\n“For UAW Local 5960 Lake Orion the planned new products and advanced electric vehicle retooling builds on their plant's history as a cutting edge manufacturing facility with a highly skilled and experienced EV workforce,” the statement said. “For UAW members at the GM Lansing Delta Township and Lansing Grand River Assembly plants the investments are commitments to continue and expand into new technologies as the industry transitions.”\n\nIn regard to the new Ultium factory, Curry and Dittes said the union “stands ready to welcome new members as Michigan becomes a center of electric vehicle manufacturing.”\n\nOrion Assembly\n\nGM will also convert Orion Assembly to build the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV, which GM revealed earlier this month, and the electric GMC Sierra pickup, which GM has yet to reveal.\n\nOrion Assembly will be GM's second assembly plant tagged to build full-size electric pickups. Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck started building the 2022 GMC Hummer pickup late last year.\n\nHere are the plants GM has designated to build EVs to date:\n\nFactory ZERO to build GMC Hummer EV pickup, Hummer SUV, Silverado EV, Sierra EV and Cruise Origin self-driving EV.\n\nto build GMC Hummer EV pickup, Hummer SUV, Silverado EV, Sierra EV and Cruise Origin self-driving EV. Spring Hill Assembly in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to build 2023 Cadillac Lyriq SUV.\n\nto build 2023 Cadillac Lyriq SUV. Orion Assembly to build the Bolt, Bolt EUV, Silverado EV and Sierra EV pickups.\n\nto build the Bolt, Bolt EUV, Silverado EV and Sierra EV pickups. Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico , to build 2023 model year EVs.\n\n, to build 2023 model year EVs. CAMI in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada, for commercial electric vans.\n\nMore:'Slap in the face' UAW says of GM's move to build EVs in Mexico\n\nThe Orion expansion will create 2,350 jobs and retain 1,000 jobs, Reuss said.\n\nOne week ago, GM got a big tax break in Orion Township, located about 40 miles north of Detroit, to expand the assembly plant where GM presently makes the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV.\n\nA property tax abatement is basically a subsidy that lowers the cost of owning property by reducing or eliminating the taxes a company pays on it.\n\nGM said it plans to start the Orion plant expansion in July and finish the construction by December 2025.\n\nGM employs about 1,200 people at Orion Assembly, most of whom are hourly union members. The plant has been mostly idle since last summer and it will remain down through February as GM addresses a global recall on 2017-22 model year Bolts that may contain defective batteries that could start a fire.\n\nGreater Lansing economy\n\nIn addition to the EV-related investments, GM is investing $510 million in Lansing Delta Township Assembly and Lansing Grand River Assembly plants to upgrade their production capabilities.\n\nThe investments and new GM plant will be a welcome respite to Lansing-area businesses, which last year were hit hard when GM had to idle its facilities for months at Lansing Delta Assembly and Lansing Regional Stamping plants because of the global semiconductor chip shortage that continues to disrupt new car production across the industry.\n\nDelta Assembly builds the Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse SUVs and the new investment will retool the facility for production of the next-generation Traverse and Enclave.\n\nThe plants' workforce of 2,700 people was laid off starting July 19 and did not resume work until the week of Oct. 4. The impact was felt in nearby businesses, especially Tony M's restaurant, less than a mile from the plant, where workers would regularly eat breakfast, lunch or dinner at the eatery. It even delivered meals to the plants.\n\n\"Our revenue is down 40%,\" Stefan Farrell, owner of Tony M’s, said last September. He was forced to lay off 20 of his 39 employees and reduce his business hours.\n\nGM's Lansing Grand River, where about 1,600 workers make the Chevy Camaro, Cadillac CT4 and CT5 sports cars, experienced periodic production disruptions starting in mid-March through early October. GM's investment there will pay for various plant upgrades, GM said.\n\nJobs, jobs, jobs\n\nThe new battery plant and the Orion expansion are key to Michigan's economic growth across all sectors, said Patrick Anderson, CEO of East Lansing-based Anderson Economic Group.\n\n\"The majority of jobs are from small businesses and entrepreneurs making decisions where there is no state government policy and local government tax incentive available,\" Anderson said. \"For those, we need to have a good business climate and a culture that encourages people to live and work in Michigan.\"\n\nFor each new full-time job created at a factory, typically two more jobs are created elsewhere in the state in relation to the plant, Anderson said.\n\n\"It is a big multiplier effect that is related to those bona fide, new full-time jobs,\" Anderson said.\n\nThen building the plants requires jobs in construction, where there is presently a shortage of workers, meaning high wages, Anderson said.\n\n\"It’ll be overtime work and extra pay and importing workers from other states to get that work done,\" Anderson said. \"That’s a positive because some of these workers will stay here.\"\n\nThey will also spend money at local restaurants and other businesses while working here.\n\nWhy Michigan?\n\nLast month, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and state lawmakers enacted a new $1 billion fund to attract new plants, which Anderson said helped make an attractive business case for GM.\n\nBeyond that, there are three reasons why Michigan had a better shot at a major EV investment from GM than it did for Ford, Anderson said.\n\nFirst, GM already has three big plants able to adjust to EV production, including battery assembly: Orion, Delta Township and Factory ZERO.\n\nSecond, the Delta plant has the large adjacent land area, and the logistics connections by rail and highway, necessary for this kind of investment, Anderson said.\n\nFinally, putting EV-oriented manufacturing capacity at Delta Township proves GM is serious about putting electric drivetrains into a wide range of vehicles, Anderson said. He noted that about 80% of EVs sold in America are luxury sedans, but the majority of gasoline-powered vehicles sold are SUVs, pickups, sports cars and non-luxury sedans and coupes.\n\n\"Obviously, if EVs are going to be successful, they have to be at the price point and functionality that most Americans want,\" Anderson said. \"The investments by GM and Ford are huge, and the risks involved are high. Tax incentives might help attract a plant, but the value proposition has to be there for the investment itself.“\n\nWin some, lose some...\n\nGM's investment in Orion Township and Lansing is also significant because Michigan almost lost another plant.\n\nIn November, President Joe Biden came to GM's grand opening of Factory ZERO where GM spent $2.2 billion to retool it to build the electric Hummer. It will also build in the future: the 2023 Hummer SUV EV, the Cruise Origin all-electric self-driving car and the 2024 Silverado EV. It currently employs about 360 people, but GM has said it will eventually employ 2,200 workers.\n\nFactory ZERO, previously called Detroit Hamtramck Assembly, almost didn't exist.\n\nIn 2018, GM said it would permanently idle five factories in North America. Detroit Hamtramck was one of them, but in its 2019 labor negotiations with the UAW amid a 40-day national strike, GM agreed to retool the plant to make EVs.\n\nWarren Transmission plant, located at Mound and Nine Mile roads, wasn't so lucky. The plant's last regular production day was in 2019, although it reopened the following year to make medical face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLast month, GM sold the 117-acre property that once housed Warren Transmission plant, to Kansas City-based Northpoint Development. Northpoint looks to build 2 million square feet of new facility there that could result in $152 million in new development and up to 600 new jobs.\n\nGM is also spending $2 billion to convert its Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee to make the 2023 Cadillac Lyriq SUV. GM builds the Cadillac XT5 and XT6 SUVs and the GMC Acadia SUV at Spring Hill. It also makes a variety of engines used across GM's lineup.\n\nSpring Hill Assembly will continue to make the XT5 and XT6 plus the electric Lyriq, but the GMC Acadia production moves to Lansing Delta Township Assembly.\n\nMore:Why the White House picked UAW member to introduce Biden at GM's Factory ZERO\n\nMore:GM plant shutdowns force Michigan businesses to lay off workers\n\nMore:GM CEO Barra talks Tesla, more EVs and Michigan's shot at a new factory\n\nContact Jamie L.

{"question_id": "20221216_18", "search_time": "2022/12/20/06:48", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/politics/jfk-assassination-documents/index.html", "title": "National Archives releases thousands of JFK assassination ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe National Archives on Thursday released thousands of previously classified documents collected as part of the government review into the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe cache of over 13,000 documents is the second of two JFK assassination-related document dumps that President Joe Biden ordered last year when the White House postponed a public release because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“[T]he profound national tragedy of President Kennedy’s assassination continues to resonate in American history and in the memories of so many Americans who were alive on that terrible day; meanwhile, the need to protect records concerning the assassination has weakened with the passage of time,” the White House said in a memorandum Thursday.\n\n“It is therefore critical to ensure that the United States Government maximizes transparency by disclosing all information in records concerning the assassination, except when the strongest possible reasons counsel otherwise.”\n\nBiden said in the memo that the National Archives and other agencies have until May 2023 to review the remaining private documents. After that, “any information withheld from public discourse that agencies do not recommend for continued postponement” will be released before June 30, 2023.\n\nKennedy’s assassination prompted a whirlwind of questions from the public and researchers, plenty of conspiracy theories and reflexive secrecy from the government.\n\nResearchers have cautioned that it will likely take days to go through the thousands of documents with a fine-toothed comb to ensure there are no new clues surrounding the assassination or novel pieces of historical information about CIA and FBI operations in the 60’s.\n\nBut for many lawmakers and transparency advocates, releasing all of the remaining documents is about restoring faith in the functioning of government. Public polling has long shown that a majority of Americans do not believe the Warren Commission’s official finding that Kennedy was killed by a single man, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone.\n\nLarry Sabato, author of the “The Kennedy Half Century: The Presidency, Assassination, and Lasting Legacy of John F. Kennedy,” told CNN that while there may be some hidden gems throughout the document release, there won’t be anything that changes what happened that day in 1963.\n\n“It’s not going to change the story,” he said of the newly declassified documents. “It’s not. I guarantee you.”\n\nHe added that if people are looking for proof to back up conspiracy theories that Oswald didn’t act alone in killing Kennedy, or that the CIA was somehow involved, they won’t find that here.\n\n“The truth is not that Oswald was part of a conspiracy to kill Kennedy,” he said. “The truth is that this assassination was preventable and could have been prevented and should have been prevented if the CIA and FBI were doing their jobs. Really, that’s it. Now that’s serious, but you’re not going to find the names of other conspirators in here.”\n\nThe CIA said in a series of statements on Thursday that many of its records released in the latest batch post-date Kennedy’s assassination and do “not change the historical record and has no bearing on the assassination or the investigation itself.”\n\n“Likewise, we are not aware of any documents known to be directly related to [Lee Harvey Oswald] that have not already been made part of the Collection,” an agency spokesperson said.\n\nWhile there may not be any earth-shattering revelations about what happened on November 22, 1963, Sabato, who is the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, did note a document discussing Oswald’s time in Mexico City, which says the US was running a “highly secret” telephone tap center with the president of Mexico not even known to Mexican law enforcement.\n\nA briefing summary prepared in December 1963 said that the CIA’s Mexico City station intercepted a phone call Oswald made on October 1 to the Soviet Embassy while he was in Mexico. He used his own name, the document says, and spoke to an embassy guard in “broken Russian.” Oswald told the guard that he’d been at the embassy the previous Saturday, where he’d met a consul who’d promised to send a telegram for him to Washington.\n\nThe document explains that the call was discovered through a “telephone tap center which we operate jointly with the office of the President of Mexico.”\n\n“It is highly secret,” the CIA document says, “and not known to Mexican security and law enforcement officials, who have their own center.”\n\nThe joint tap center “very often” produced information on US citizens contacting the Soviet Embassy, the summary says, which is frequently “extremely incriminating.” They wrote that on a couple of occasions, they’d even apprehended US troops who were attempting to defect.\n\nWhile it is not news that the US got information about Oswald’s call to the Soviety Embassy, Sabato said, it has not been previously disclosed that the wire tapping was a joint operation with the Mexican president. This, according to Sabato, shows that the US and the Mexican president had a “very close, cooperative relationship.” While this was not necessarily surprising, Sabato said, it was still notable that the Mexican leader “didn’t even trust his own security people to know about” the tapping center.\n\n“Back in the 60s, the critics of the one-party system in Mexico used to say frequently that Mexico was just a client state of the United States and the US controlled a series of Mexican presidents,” Sabato said. “Well, it turns out that Mexican president and his successor, who was his interior minister … were both deeply involved with the CIA.”\n\nThe CIA spokesperson said in the statement Thursday that information regarding Oswald’s visit to Mexico City “was included in prior releases. There is no new information on this topic in the 2022 release.”\n\nHe also identified a document from the National Archives and Records Administration that said as of this month, 28 records in the JFK collection remain “not located.”\n\nAdmissions like the latter are what fuel conspiracy theories, Sabato said.\n\n“If you are of a conspiratorial mind, you go, ‘Aha! There were important documents with key information in there and they’ve conveniently ‘lost’ them.’ Now, it’s possible that’s true. But I would say the odds are enormous they just got lost. I mean, there’s so much paper,” he said.\n\nWith Thursday’s release, the CIA has released “all of its information known to be directly related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963,” its statement said, with about 95% of the CIA documents within the JFK Assassination Records Collection now public in their entirety.\n\nWhile no documents remain fully redacted or withheld, according to the agency, the small percentage of information that remains blacked out “would currently do identifiable harm to intelligence operations,” according to the spokesperson. Those records, they said, consist primarily of internal administrative records collected to provide the JFK review board with background on the CIA, to help the board “understand, for example, CIA sources, methods, terminology, cover, and tradecraft.”\n\nOver the years, millions of documents have become public, offering researchers an opportunity to pore over not only records related to the Kennedy assassination, but also a variety of other topics, from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s life and slaying to pivotal moments in the Cold War.\n\nIn 1992, Congress passed the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, in part prompted by furor caused by the conspiratorial Oliver Stone film “JFK.”\n\nThe act dictated that all assassination records should be publicly disclosed by October 2017, but former President Donald Trump and now Biden have allowed multiple postponements on the advice of the FBI, the CIA and other national security agencies. Trump ultimately released tens of thousands of documents, the majority of which include at least some redactions.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc Haley Britzky", "Paul Leblanc", "Haley Britzky"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/15/jfk-files-national-archives-releases-secret-assassination-documents/8912211002/", "title": "JFK files: National Archives releases secret assassination documents", "text": "The National Archives released nearly 1,500 documents on the JFK assassination.\n\nThe Biden administration ordered the release of the records under a memorandum signed in October.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Biden administration Wednesday released never-before-seen documents that could help answer lingering questions surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe National Archives released nearly 1,500 documents as part of a memorandum signed by President Joe Biden in October. The tranche is the latest made publicly available over the years under The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, or the \"JFK Act.\"\n\nThe full records collection contains approximately 5 million pages of documents.\n\nThat's why Jefferson Morley, a veteran journalist and author of three books on the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1960s, called the new release a \"sham.\"\n\n\"According to the law, all JFK records were supposed to be made available within 25 years, no exception,\" Morley told USA TODAY.\n\nBut the law also allows for postponement at the discretion of the president.\n\nIn 2018, former President Donald Trump acquiesced to requests from national archivists not to release some new documents because of national safety concerns. The Biden administration followed suit until recently, according to Morley.\n\n\"They blew the deadline twice and that indicates that the CIA does not want to obey this law,\" Morley said. \"The question is: why?\"\n\nThe Warren Commission, established by Kennedy's successor Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the assassination, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation determined U.S. Marine veteran Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK in the head while the former president rode in a motorcade through Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. Oswald was assassinated by Jack Ruby two days later while being transferred from police headquarters to a county jail.\n\nSome historians and conspiracy theorists have often challenged the result of the investigation, and doubts about the findings of the Warren Commission persist decades later.\n\n\"The Warren Commission was told the CIA knew very little about Lee Harvey Oswald,\" Morley said. \"We learned in the last 20 years they had monitored his movements for four years.\"\n\nFiles released in 2017 under the JFK Act showed the agency followed Oswald's travels prior to the assassination but agents did not consider him a threat.\n\nMorley said only about 10% of redacted records were released Wednesday.\n\n\"The government's never offered a credible explanation for the assassination,\" he said. \"People don’t believe what they’re hearing. And when they’re holding 90% of the documents that are required by law, they continue 50 years of deception and deceit.\"\n\nRedacted records are permitted by the JFK Act. Most of the collection has been made available to the public without restrictions since the late 1990s, but agencies appealed to Biden to continue postponement of certain information beyond Oct. 22.\n\nThe president, in turn, provided agencies with a temporary certification until Dec. 15, 2022, to allow for the review of all withheld documents while disclosing all information \"except when the strongest possible reasons counsel otherwise,\" according to a press release. Any withheld documentation – over 14,000 records, according to the National Archives – not proposed for continued postponement will be released on that date.\n\nReach out to Chelsey Cox on Twitter at @therealco.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/12/16/guilty-verdict-atatiana-jefferson-death-avatar-sequel-5-things-podcast/10908632002/", "title": "Guilty verdict in Atatiana Jefferson death, 'Avatar' sequel: 5 Things ...", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Former Texas officer guilty of manslaughter in Atatiana Jefferson's death\n\nA former Forth Worth police officer shot Atatiana Jefferson through a window in her home in 2019.

Today, an officer has been found guilty in the shooting death of Atatiana Jefferson. Plus, how to stay healthy this holiday season, and we look at the decline of the Miss America Pageant.\n\n♦\n\nA former Texas police officer has been found guilty of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson in 2019. White former officer Aaron Dean, shot Jefferson, who was Black, through a window in her home while responding to a non-emergency call. She was playing video games with her nephew, who testified that she grabbed a gun after hearing noises outside. The jury deliberated for 13 hours, after six days of testimony and arguments centered on whether Dean saw that Jefferson was armed before he shot her. Dean was charged with murder, but the judge told the jury, which reportedly had no Black jurors, that they could also consider a charge of manslaughter. Dean faces up to 20 years in prison and is scheduled for sentencing later today.\n\n♦\n\nThe holidays are nearly here, meaning time with friends and family and maybe some travel. But with all kinds of contagious illnesses spreading around right now, how do you keep yourself healthy so you don't miss out on time with loved ones? Producer Shannon Rae Green, and Health Reporter Adrianna Rodriguez discuss.\n\nShannon Rae Green:\n\nI'm joined in the studio by USA TODAY Health Reporter Adrianna Rodriguez. Thanks so much for being here.\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nShannon Rae Green:\n\nWell, I will tell you that last year I had a not great Christmas.\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nOh, no.\n\nShannon Rae Green:\n\nI wasn't able to see family because someone was sick. So I hope you can tell me what you're hearing from health experts about what I can do this year to avoid being worried about someone being sick, and avoid sickening other people that I care about. How do we stay safe this holiday when it comes to parties, when it comes to other gatherings?\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nTotally. Well, to be fair, and if it makes you feel any better, you were not alone last year. There was a lot of people in that same situation and a lot of people with the same questions this year. The difference from this year and last year though, is that most people have some sort of prior immunity from COVID-19, whether it was a previous infection or whether it's from the vaccine, multiple vaccines, boosters and whatnot. So that's the biggest difference this year versus last year, that health experts say is what's benefiting us this year against COVID.\n\nWhat is not though, is now this emergence of flu, RSV, colds, that we really didn't see last year or the year before, because we had been stunting that transmission with staying at home and with not going to family gatherings. And so that's also what's a concern this year.\n\nSo safety with family gatherings. I know last year we sort of focused a lot on transmission, we focused a lot on numbers. We focused a lot on local health departments, looking at hospitalizations and looking at cases, looking at percent positivity rates. But now with the emergence of home testing, health experts say that's not that reliable anymore. Looking at your local community or looking at whatever community you're going to, those percent positivity rates or those cases aren't going to be as reliable as before because a lot of people are testing at home and not reporting their results.\n\nRight now, they're saying to really focus on mitigation measures that will reduce the risk of transmission, which we've been learning about this entire time during the pandemic. It's your masking, it's your hand-washing, it's your testing. It's making sure you know that you're protecting those who are vulnerable to the severe disease, whether it's the elderly or those who are immunocompromised.\n\nShannon Rae Green:\n\nShould people who are vulnerable, whether they're younger or older, or whether they have medicine that compromises their immune system that they take, should they spend less time with others this holiday season? What do you think?\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nWhat health experts will not tell me is whether you should stay home or not, unless you are sick. That's like the basic. If you are symptomatic and you're sick, please stay home. Do not infect others. But it's really hard to tell somebody, especially when it's been two years of not being able to see your loved ones, of being able to see the little ones, of grandma and grandpas being able to meet those little ones at some point. It's hard for them to say, \"Sorry, you can't come,\" or \"We can't go over there anymore.\" And so what health experts saying is it's all about mitigating risk. It's if you are willing to take that risk and you feel that it is important to take on that risk to be able to see your loved ones, you can do so and try to do so as safely as possible.\n\nAnd what that can do, Grandma and Grandpa can wear a mask while they're with them. One way mask use is still protective, wear a mask when you're traveling because there's a lot of people from different households that are going to be in that car. Also, maybe opt for a smaller gathering so it's less households in that one gathering. So instead of having five different households, maybe you'll have three different households in that gathering. And then the most important, which should have been said at the top of this, is get vaccinated. And a lot of people actually are not getting that bivalent booster right now. One, honestly, is because they don't know if they're eligible for it. They don't know that they can go and get it.\n\nShannon Rae Green:\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez, USA TODAY Health Reporter, thank you so much for being on the show today.\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPresident Joe Biden yesterday released once-classified files on JFK's assassination. The National Archives released nearly 13,000 documents this week on top of more than a thousand already released a year ago. For decades, conspiracy theories have surrounded former President John F. Kennedy's death, but new files could bring some clarity.\n\nPolitico reports that the main focus of yesterday's document drop is on the CIA's personality file for Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who assassinated Kennedy. It includes information on a trip Oswald made to Mexico. Politico writes that several of the newly declassified documents will refer to activities by undercover CIA operatives in the agency's Mexico City station, who led an aggressive surveillance operation against Oswald when he visited Mexico in September of 1963. Kennedy was killed later that fall in November.\n\nPreviously released files show that Oswald made contact in Mexico with Soviet and Cuban spies. Those documents suggested that the CIA mishandled evidence that could have saved Kennedy's life. White House officials have indicated that no conspiracy theories, like a different gunman or a broader conspiracy to kill Kennedy, were released this week. President Joe Biden, though, has ordered a review of the remaining redacted records. Hundreds of documents are still being withheld by the archives.\n\n♦\n\nLast night, Miss Wisconsin was crowned Miss America, but if you missed it, you aren't the only one, because it wasn't televised.

Producer PJ Elliott spoke to Amy Argetsinger, author of the book There She Was, the Secret History of Miss America, to find out more on the decline of the pageant that once captivated the American television audience.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nAmy, thank you so much for joining the podcast.\n\nAmy Argetsinger:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo this is the 101st Miss America Pageant. I want to talk a little bit about how the event has changed over the years.\n\nAmy Argetsinger:\n\nWell, I mean it started off very inauspiciously. It was just a little publicity stunt, to try to get people in 1921 to come to Atlantic City and keep the summer season going a little bit past Labor Day. And it took off in a big way. It became a runaway hit and it became even bigger when it landed on television in 1954. And for a couple of decades, it was literally one of the biggest shows on TV. It was the Super Bowl, the Academy Awards and Miss America. Some people like to say it was the first reality TV show.\n\nBut now it's been through a lot of challenges. The rise of the women's movement really posed a big challenge to the organization. Fifty years ago, they started to ask for the first time, \"Is this good for women or are we objectifying women? What are we doing here?\" A huge debate erupted over the swimsuit competition, which was one of the biggest draws for the public, but really became very controversial and unsustainable.\n\nIt all kind of came to a head though, about five years ago when there was a big leadership upheaval. A decision was made to get rid of the swimsuit competition, led to a huge feud breaking out within the Miss America community and it never really recovered.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nYou talked about TV there, and this is the first year that it's going to be streamed. What does that say about how we view the pageant now?\n\nAmy Argetsinger:\n\nIt says that people have lost interest. It used to be on TV because people wanted to watch it. You had TV networks and sponsors, big corporate sponsors, vying for the right to air Miss America, to have their advertisements with it. It was able to actually deliver on the promise of providing scholarships for its winners. That's all dried up now.\n\nI mean, in some ways it's amazing that it lasted as long as it did. I mean, how often does any TV show last for 10 years even? And this had a good long run on television for more than 60 years. But at the end of the day, Miss America faced too much competition from other shows. It was a big hit in the three channel era.\n\nI really sort of marked the decline, in terms of public interest in it, to around 20 years ago, when you had things like \"American Idol,\" \"The Bachelor,\" shows that in some ways were... they had longer story arcs. \"Survivor,\" viewers could get invested over several months in one contestant or another. There were million dollar prizes at stake. Miss America kind of inspired those shows, but it couldn't keep up in the end.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nWinning the pageant carried this stigma in years past and also came with some financial benefits. What about now? Are these contestants getting anything this year?\n\nAmy Argetsinger:\n\nWell, I think that remains to be seen. There's still the promise of a $50,000 scholarship for the winner and smaller scholarships for the runners-up. You keep hearing rumblings though, out of this community though, that some of the women, who have won state scholarships or national scholarships, are having a hard time collecting them. And whether that speaks to the disorganization of this group or a shortfall of money, I have to think money is an issue.\n\nYou don't have networks paying millions of dollars for the rights to air this. You don't have Campbell's Soup and Gillette and Oldsmobile signing up to sponsor it. So it always promised to be the largest scholarship provider for women, but at the end of the day, the money isn't coming in.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nAmy, it was a pleasure to have you on. I really appreciate your time.\n\nAmy Argetsinger:\n\nMy pleasure. Thank you so much.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIt's been 13 years since \"Avatar\" wowed audiences with its special effects and became the highest grossing film of all time. Now, its sequel is finally here.\n\n\"Avatar: The Way of Water\" trailer:\n\nI'm a warrior like you, I'm supposed to fight.\n\nProtect the people.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\n\"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" hits theaters today. And while Sigourney Weaver and other cast members are back from the first movie, Kate Winslet makes her debut in the franchise, and a reunion with director James Cameron, who she worked with on \"Titanic.\" USA TODAY Entertainment Reporter Patrick Ryan caught up with Kate about working with James again, holding her breath underwater and more.\n\nPatrick Ryan:\n\nYou and James Cameron had been trying to figure out a way to work together again after Titanic. So when he first reached out to you about \"Avatar,\" were you immediately on board or were you just like, why are you thinking of me for this?\n\nKate Winslet:\n\nI was immediately on board, and actually in a funny way, I could understand why he was thinking of me for this. Because over the years, obviously I've changed a lot, he's changed a lot, but also I'm a mother now and he knows who I am as a parent as well as an actor. And he certainly has always known how far I can be pushed and the challenges that I'm happy to meet and also the determination that I have.\n\nIt sort of made sense to me why he would consider that I might be interested in Ronal. Because that's who she is, a mother, a leader living with integrity and truth, and also physically very robust and resilient, because \"Avatar\" is Jim, it's all those incredible actors and this wonderful world they created 13 years ago.\n\nPatrick Ryan:\n\nSo I mean, I know you've spoken at length about holding your breath underwater. Have you heard at all from Tom Cruise about breaking his record or what would you say to him about that?\n\nKate Winslet:\n\nI haven't heard from Tom, poor Tom. I mean, I don't know Tom at all, I've never met him in my life, but I'm sure he's getting very fed up of hearing this story of how I broke his record. Yeah, I loved it though. I mean, I loved breath holding, I loved learning how to do it. I was amazed at how good I was at it.\n\nPatrick Ryan:\n\nAnd I mean, why do you think it's necessary to actually do all that training and shoot these long sequences underwater? Because with modern visual effects, it seems like something, it might be very easy to cheat, but do you think audiences will see the difference and just how much more realistic that these look?\n\nKate Winslet:\n\nThe reason that you can't avoid the water element is because the body moves completely differently underwater. Hair, for example, hair comes in your face if you have long hair, and the way in which you move your hair out of the way underwater, Jim said that was the one thing that was completely impossible for the technicians to create, with nothing to go on, with no form of reference.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe sequel is part of plans for five \"Avatar\" movies in all.

Kennedy. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said 97% of the Kennedy collection is available to the public following the release of 12,879 documents Thursday by the National Archives and 1,491 documents a year ago today. Biden has ordered the archives to conduct a six-month review \"of a subset of the remaining redacted records\" to ensure they are also disclosed \"to the greatest extent possible,\" Jean-Pierre said.

Hillary Clinton decided to run and days later, JFK Jr.'s plane went missing.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Jr., the son and namesake of the nation’s 35th president, died 10 days after then-first lady Hillary Clinton made her first public moves to run for a soon-to-open U.S. Senate seat in New York. A meme circulating on social media suggests the two events are related.\n\n“When Daniel Moynihan decided to retire his Senate seat, JKF Jr. claimed he was interested in running for that seat,” says the meme posted by an Instagram user who goes by Conspiraceye. “Days later, Hillary Clinton also decided to run for the open seat. Within months of Clintons (sic) announcement, JFK Jr.’s private plane went missing.”\n\nThe meme makes no direct accusation, but some of the commenters made the implicit connection.\n\n“Who are these people who go around murdering people when they feel threatened?” asked one.\n\nConspiraceye did not respond to a request for comment sent by the Instagram message app.\n\nMore:Fact check: Joe Biden called 'forces of intolerance,' not Trump supporters, the 'dregs of society'\n\nSetting the stage for the Senate race\n\nConspiraceye’s innuendo is not original, and fact-checkers such as Snopes and PolitiFact have shot others like it down. But let’s take a deeper dive into the origins of the claim and some of the machinations — public and behind the scenes — that led Clinton to being elected to the Senate from New York 20 years ago and the young Kennedy to stay out of the race.\n\nIn November 1998, veteran Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced he would not seek a fifth term two years later.\n\nWith the presidency of Bill Clinton also coming to an end in 2000, and the Clintons’ marriage reeling from the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Hillary Clinton began make plans for a political career of her own. In fact, she held a White House meeting with advisers in February 1999, specifically looking at the Moynihan seat, according to a 2016 profile in the Washington Post.\n\nAround the same, Kennedy, having launched his innovative magazine, George, three years earlier, also was beginning to consider entering politics. According to the 2019 biography, \"America’s Reluctant Prince: The Life of John F. Kennedy Jr.,\" historian and Kennedy friend Steven Gillion writes the fledgling magazine editor contacted to well-connected New York political operatives about a possible Senate run.\n\nClinton worries; Kennedy takes a pass\n\nKennedy, then 38, was clearly on Clinton’s radar, Gillon writes, and one of the first lady’s advisers said the camp was “scared\" over his potential candidacy. Meanwhile, one of the pros Kennedy had approached, New York union leader Dennis Rivera, assured him at a meeting on St. Patrick’s Day 1999 that state Democratic power brokers would tell Clinton to “stand back” should Kennedy chose to enter the race, Gillon writes.\n\nFor his part, Kennedy was hesitant, asking “will people take me seriously?” before bailing on the race days later. “I don’t think it’s time for me,” Gillon quotes him as saying. Besides, the author adds, Kennedy’s magazine, which sought to highlight the connection between politics and entertainment, was struggling. And his young marriage required nurturing.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, forged ahead with her plans. On July 6, she filed the paperwork required by the Federal Election Commission to begin raising money. That was followed by her “listening tour” to see if New Yorkers would accept someone who had never lived in the state as a candidate to represent the them in the Senate.\n\nA life cut short\n\nKennedy obtained his pilot license just over a year before he and his wife, the former Carolyn Bessette, and her sister flew in a private aircraft from New Jersey to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, for a family wedding. The plane crashed into the Atlantic, and all aboard were killed on July 16, 1999.\n\nGillon writes that he is nearly certain that Kennedy someday planned to seek political office, perhaps even the presidency. In interviews while promoting his book, Gillion said Kennedy thought himself more of an executive than a possible legislator and suggested he might have been biding his time to run for governor of New York in 2002.\n\nIronically, Gillon said, just days before his death, Kennedy was critical of Clinton’s decision to enter the Senate race. He said New York Democrats should choose someone from New York. Gillon writes that he reminded his friend that the seat in question had once been held by Kennedy’s uncle, the late Robert F. Kennedy, who also had just moved to the state before declaring his candidacy in 1964.\n\nTiming is everything\n\nSome aspects of the timing of the soon-to-open Senate seat and the resulting early moves by Clinton and Kennedy might provide the seedlings for the conspiracy theory hinted at in the meme. But, even if nothing else would debunk the veiled assertions, the actual timing does just that.\n\nMoynihan gave notice in November 1998. Clinton’s White House meeting with advisers to discuss a possible candidacy took place in February 1999. Kennedy’s huddle with the New York operatives took place on St. Patrick’s Day in March. That’s months, not days, as the meme asserts, after it was known the seat would be open.\n\nFor all practical purpose, Clinton’s campaign launched with the FEC paperwork on July 6, 1999, quickly followed by the listening tour. Kennedy’s plane crashed July 16. That’s days, not months, after the Clinton campaign was up and running. It was, however, months after he opted not to run.\n\nFinally, Clinton’s formal announcement of her candidacy came Feb. 6, 2000. That came within months after Kennedy’s death, not before it, as the meme suggested.\n\nOur ruling: False\n\nThe meme essentially asks readers to view separate series of events and conclude that one series caused the outcome of the other. But its step-by-step assertions are riddled with errors, and that undermines the already dubious implication that a sitting first lady would play a role in the death of the son of a former president for political advantage.

Kennedy. And who, having lost the Iowa caucuses in 2016, hinted that the result was rigged. And who, of course, has perpetuated the notion that the 2020 election was stolen from him – all claims without a shred of evidence.\n\nSo, when you say that something may be the oddest or most outlandish conspiracy theory that Trump has pushed, well, you are really saying something.\n\nAnd yet, something Trump said in a rollicking interview Wednesday night with Fox News’ Sean Hannity is so out there that it’s hard to even understand what he is talking about.\n\nLet’s start with what he said. Here’s the exchange between Hannity and Trump (bolding is mine):\n\nHannity: Is there a process – what was your process to declassify?\n\nTrump: There doesn’t have to be a process, as I understand it. You know, there’s – different people say different things, but as I understand there doesn’t have to be.\n\nIf you’re the president of the United States, you can declassify just by saying, it’s declassified. Even by thinking about it, because you’re sending it to Mar-a-Lago or to wherever you’re sending it.\n\nAnd there doesn’t have to be a process. There can be a process, but there doesn’t have to be. You’re the president, you make that decision. So when you send it, it’s declassified. We – I declassified everything.\n\nNow, I declassified things, and we were having a lot of problems with NARA. You know, NARA is a radical left group of people running that thing, and when you send documents over there, I would say there’s a very good chance that a lot of those documents will never be seen again.\n\nThere’s also a lot of speculation because of what they did, the severity of the FBI coming and raiding Mar-a-Lago. Were they looking for the Hillary Clinton emails that were deleted, but they are around someplace?\n\nUm, what?\n\nTrump can’t be suggesting that, somehow, the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago property last month was not, in fact aimed at retrieving documents marked classified that he took from his time in the White House, but was designed to find emails from Hillary Clinton’s private server as secretary of State.\n\nExcept, that – I think – he is.\n\n“A lot of people said the only thing that would give the kind of severity that they showed by actually coming in and raiding with many, many people, is the Hillary Clinton deal, the Russia, Russia, Russia stuff or – I mean, there are a number of things,” Trump added. “They’re spying on Trump’s campaign, so they spied on my campaign.”\n\nOK, so let’s walk through the, er, logic here.\n\n1. Trump believes that the search on Mar-a-Lago was very aggressive.\n\n2. Because it was so aggressive, Trump believes that the FBI was not actually after just the materials he kept after leaving the White House.\n\n3. Therefore, the FBI could have been looking for Clinton’s emails.\n\nYou may have noticed a massive logical leap from between points 2 and 3 there. Like, why would the deleted emails from Clinton’s private email server be at Mar-a-Lago? And, if they were, why would Donald Trump not know that they were there? But, again, why would they be there?!?!\n\nTrump didn’t offer any explanation for this wild theory. And Hannity didn’t press him. ” All right, so let me go – you mentioned Russia a number of times, let’s talk about that,” was his follow-up.\n\nWhat was Trump talking about? Honestly I have no idea. And I am not sure he does either. What he usually does in these comfortable settings is just talk and talk and talk – often without any real rhyme or reason.\n\nGiven that, the most likely conclusion is that Trump just threw something against the wall, without thinking about it before – or after.

It's Amy here with today's top stories out of Washington.\n\nAfter the military raid that killed Osama bin Laden, President Barack Obama sought to briskly release information as soon as the Al Qaeda leader was confirmed dead May 2, 2011, reporter Bart Jansen writes.\n\nObama's consultation with intelligence agencies to determine what intelligence to release publicly contrasts sharply with Donald Trump's assertion that as president he could declassify documents merely by thinking about it – a claim he made after FBI agents seized about 100 classified documents from his Mar-a-Lago estate in August.\n\nTrump both single-handedly declassified documents and also deferred to the intelligence community to keep documents secret during his team. In 2019, he tweeted a previously classified satellite photo of an Iranian rocket mishap, which he said he had the \"absolute right to do.\"\n\nBut in 2017 Trump postponed the release of some documents associated with President John F. Kennedy's assassination because of intelligence concerns.\n\nThe slow release of information in both Trump and Obama administrations illustrates that despite their broad powers, it's rare for presidents to unilaterally declassify documents without input from intelligence agencies to determine what can be revealed and when.\n\nDeclassifying documents can be long and deliberate, experts say, a far more intensive process than what Trump describes.\n\nHow does the process work? It's not as simple as Trump makes it seems. Here's the full explanation on how Trump's rhetoric breaks with presidential tradition.\n\nCatch up on last night's debates:\n\nPennsylvania: Pennsylvania Senate candidates John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz squared off Tuesday night in their race’s first and only debate. The hourlong debate, which took place in Harrisburg, covered topics including crime, the economy and abortion, and gave voters the opportunity to evaluate Fetterman’s recovery from the life-threatening stroke he suffered this year.\n\nMichigan: When Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Republican challenger Tudor Dixon met for their second and final debate Tuesday, the rhetorical temperature was noticeably higher than at their first debate, held Oct. 13.\n\nThat was likely the result of shrinking poll margins and the rapidly approaching Election Day, now less than two weeks away. Here are four big takeaways from the debate in Grand Rapids.\n\nNew York: Gov. Kathy Hochul and Rep. Lee Zeldin squared off Tuesday night in their first and only debate of the governor's race, clashing over crime, abortion rights, economic development and more.\n\nHochul, a Democrat seeking her first full term on Nov. 8, fended off rapid-fire jabs from Zeldin and promoted her 14-month record as governor. Meanwhile, Zeldin, buoyed by recent polls showing him trailing by only modest margins, seized the televised platform to pummel his opponent, particularly on crime.\n\nReal quick: stories you'll want to read\n\nWhat a Netanyahu comeback means for the U.S .: Benjamin Netanyahu describes his relationship with President Joe Biden as open and friendly.

Fusion creates power by fusing two atoms together, fission power comes from splitting them apart.\n\nLawrence Livermore spokesman Breanna Bishop declined to reveal details about the announcement.\n\n\"Our analysis is still ongoing, so we’re unable to provide details or confirmation at this time,\" she said in an email to USA TODAY. \"We look forward to sharing more on Tuesday when that process is complete.\"\n\nScientists around the world have been working for nearly a century on this clean, potentially limitless source of power.\n\nIf the scientists have finally achieved the goal of creating more power than they used, commercial power generation will remain years away, but it still would be a remarkable achievement. Fusion research began in the 1930s and work on the idea of energy from fusion dates to the 1950s.\n\nWhat is fusion energy?\n\nFusion is the process that powers the Sun. In the intense gravity and the 27 million degree heat of its core, atoms collide with each other and merge, releasing massive amounts of energy in the process.\n\nOn Earth, the process is enormously difficult, expensive and power-intensive. The atoms, typically deuterium and tritium, must be heated to 150 million degrees Celsius. The resulting plasma is held in place by massive magnets in what is known as a \"magnetic bottle.\"\n\nFusion generates four times more energy per kilogram than the fission used to power nuclear plants and nearly four million times more energy than burning oil or coal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nHow much energy can come from fusion?\n\nTheoretically, only a few pounds of matter would be enough to provide energy for entire countries for years.\n\nResearchers are able to create fusion reactions, but so far they have always taken more energy to create than is released by fusing the atoms – making it a net energy loss rather than the possible source of limitless energy scientists dream of.\n\nLawrence Livermore's experiments last year were done by focusing laser light the size of three football fields onto a target the size of a BB. This produced a hot spot the diameter of a human hair and generated more than 10 quadrillion watts of fusion power for 100 trillionths of a second.\n\nWhy is it happening now?\n\nScientists have known the principles behind fusion for decades, but what's been theoretically possible on paper has been extremely difficult to pull off, said Dennis Whyte, who directs the MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center.\n\nFusion had a moment in the early 1970s, around the time of the Arab oil embargo, when petroleum was seen as a major strategic issue for the U.S. and other western countries. There were a few breakthroughs then, but research stalled, Whyte said.\n\nIn the last two to three years, there's been a renewed push for fusion to both combat climate change and promote energy security. Russian aggression in Ukraine and threats to cut off oil pipelines to Europe have added urgency, he said.\n\nA few advances, both using lasers and magnets, have advanced the technology, he said.\n\nThe next major step will be showing that fusion can produce more energy than it consumes.\n\nFunding is advancing the science behind fusion\n\nIn addition to major activity in academic settings, Whyte said there are now at least two dozen startups interested in commercializing fusion energy, including MIT's collaborator, Commonwealth Fusion Systems.\n\n\"There was an inrush of private capital,\" he said. \"That has a bootstrapping effect that I think has really changed the game.\"\n\nIn March, the Biden administration announced funding and support for fusion energy.\n\n\"Then Ukraine happened,\" Whyte said. \"That spurred on even more urgency. It's not just about climate change. It's also energy security.\"\n\nWhat fusion energy could mean for the planet\n\nWhyte described fusion energy as \"the most disruptive energy source we've ever made,\" because it relies on readily available resources, like water, rather than hard-to-access oil reserves or uranium for nuclear power.\n\n\"The fuel is inexhaustible,\" he said. \"It's the same reason the sun lasts for like 10 billion years. It's using the most abundant elements in the universe.\"\n\nFor fusion to make net energy, it needs to keep itself hot. It will require a centralized, high-intensity power source to kick off and then insulation to keep the temperature high enough. That means it will only be feasible to use on a large scale, Whyte said. \"The minimum size of this is that it would power a small city.\"\n\nFusion plants would produce electricity, meaning the global effort to electrify transportation and industry would need to continue to reap the full benefits.\n\nHow long will it take for fusion power to arrive?\n\nTuesday's announcement will be a major step toward the goal of power from fusion, but it's a long road to cheap, safe power plants dotting the countryside.\n\nScientists may have finally been able to get more energy out of the process than they put in, but scaling that up to something that can power cities while making the cost reasonable will be the work of years if not decades.\n\nThe key for making fusion energy useful is to reach temperatures high enough to keep the fusion reactions going, Whyte said.\n\nFusion is tantalizing, Whyte said, because it relies on know-how rather than resources.\n\nOn paper at least, fusion \"can replace all carbon-based energy sources, because it's scalable in a way that means it can actually power civilization,\" Whyte said. Theoretically, someday it could allow humanity to stop burning fossil fuels.\n\n\"That's the dream,\" he said. \"We're not there yet.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2019/05/18/patrick-peterson-nfl-players-linked-ped-hall-of-fame/3718768002/", "title": "Opinion: Like it or not, PED suspensions could hurt NFL players' Hall ...", "text": "Patrick Peterson insists that he’s “definitely sorry” for the stain suddenly attached to his name.\n\nBusted. Performance-enhancing drugs … with a masking agent that didn’t quite cover it up.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals star — arguably the best NFL cornerback of his era, but now facing a six-game suspension for violating the league’s steroids policy — might someday also feel some additional shame if this week’s revelation costs or delays his chance of getting the right kind of bust in Canton.\n\nIt’s a debate waiting to happen: What’s the penalty for trying to game the system for an unfair advantage?\n\nMORE NFL:\n\nFollow every game: Latest NFL Scores and Schedules\n\nI mean, Terrell Owens never had any sort of suspension for PEDs or street drugs and it still took three years for the once-dominant-but-controversial receiver to get voted into the Hall.\n\nThen again, Peterson might be lucky that we’re talking Canton … and not Cooperstown.\n\nAssuming this suspension is a one-shot deal for Peterson and he picks up his pattern of shutting down lethal receivers, which has earned him eight Pro Bowl selections and three All-Pro credits, history suggests that it probably won’t be the final factor in weighing his Hall worthiness.\n\nBut he won’t – and shouldn’t – get a free pass.\n\nSure, there are several busts with blemishes on display. Lawrence Taylor and Michael Irvin had well-documented drug issues. Paul Hornung served a one-year suspension for gambling. Fred Biletnikoff used stickum – which in the 1970s was a legal way to gain an advantage. And it’s fair to wonder how many linemen from back in the day powered themselves up with one substance or another.\n\nNobody’s perfect. Yet in this age of intensified scrutiny (and you can ask Owens about that), issues with PEDs could loom as a serious demerit. A suspension could be the swing factor when weighing candidates with otherwise similar credentials.\n\nTell me about it. I’ve been a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee for more than 20 years, in the room for those marathon meetings before the Super Bowl when we’re able to hash out pros and cons of finalists – a neat, unique feature for football’s process, once you sift through the home-team biases and politicking – and it can get so tight when you’re splitting hairs between, say, four safeties, three defensive linemen and two guards on the ballot.\n\nThe Hall’s bylaws instruct us to only weigh what happens on the field. But that policy still lends itself for interpretation, when considering the effect of a player not being available to be on the field or, say, what impact a player had on his team due to chemistry issues. This policy can be a moving target.\n\nAfter all, the votes don’t come from computers and extend beyond just stats. Like it or not, human beings make the call.\n\nA squeaky-clean candidate vs. a player with a PED suspension?\n\nHey, there are only so many slots.\n\nStory continues below gallery.\n\nConsider the effect the steroids era has had on baseball’s Hall of Fame. There’s a who’s who list of would-be Hall of Famers, if not for their link to performance-enhancing drugs: Barry Bonds. Roger Clemens. Mark McGwire. Sammy Sosa. Rafael Palmeiro. Manny Ramirez. With Alex Rodriguez on deck.\n\nFootball hasn’t had such a death penalty to this point, and I’d suspect one of the reasons is the brutality and physical sacrifice of the sport.\n\nWhen Rodney Harrison – named recently to the New England Patriots’ Hall of Fame, but never a Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist — was suspended in 2007 for violating the NFL’s PED policy, his explanation was at least plausible. He maintained that he never took steroids but admitted to using human growth hormone as a means to accelerate the healing process in recovering from several injuries.\n\nWhen you think about how so many football players wind up with busted-up bodies, sacrificed for their chosen professions and seven-figure salaries, their desires to heal quickly or otherwise mitigate the pain from what is often described as “weekly car crashes” can resonate as an alternative.\n\nIn many cases, though, football players blame their suspensions on tainted supplements.\n\nThat was Antonio Gates’ explanation a few years ago when the Chargers tight end was slapped with a four-game ban for violating the substance-abuse policy. Buy it? More recently, there was the case of Julian Edelman.\n\nHe’s the reigning Super Bowl MVP. Yet some will contend that he never should have been on the field for Tom Brady to target, if the NFL had a stricter policy for PEDs. Edelman started last season with a four-game suspension for PEDs.\n\nHe owned up to it, but with scant details … and a lot of gray area.\n\n“I don’t know what happened,” Edelman said last fall.\n\nBottom line, tainted supplements or not, players are responsible for what goes in their bodies.\n\nIt’s premature to suggest Edelman will be a Hall of Fame candidate; yet, there’s no doubt Gates will someday be a likely Hall of Famer. Same for Julius Peppers, the just-retired Carolina Panthers defensive end who was suspended four games during his rookie NFL season for what he explained as an honest mistake: He took a banned dietary substance.\n\nAt the time, Peppers pledged that it would never happen again. His word was good. He was never suspended again. He wound up playing 17 seasons, and his Hall of Fame credentials are built on 159 ½ sacks, fourth on the NFL’s all-time list. The only other question about PEDs surfaced in 2015, carrying over to 2016, when Peppers was among several players threatened with a suspension after their names surfaced in an Al Jazeera report that alleged they received steroids. In the wake of strong denials from all accused, the matter was ultimately resolved without any violations.\n\nThe one-time cases hardly doom the chances for Gates and Peppers, but that doesn’t mean they won’t add a layer to the ultimate Hall of Fame discussions.\n\nAs for Peterson, there’s a different twist. His reported use of a masking agent wipes out any “tainted supplement” defense. That, too, will likely be part of the debate for his Hall of Fame case.\n\nA suspension – especially if compared to candidates who never failed a drug test — might not be the only price he pays.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2014/10/26/how-hotels-come-up-with-rates/17792537/", "title": "Method to the madness: How hotels set room rates – USA TODAY", "text": "Charisse Jones\n\nUSAToday\n\nFor hotel guests, it can be dizzying how the cost of the same room, at the same property, can vary dramatically from one day to the next.\n\nBut there's definitely a method to the seeming madness.\n\nHotels decide how to price their rooms \"based on many different factors, including the market they are in, special events or holidays that may affect their demand for rooms and the differences in the rooms they have to sell,'' said Craig Eister, a senior vice president for the hotel company IHG. IHG's brands include Holiday Inn, InterContinental and Crowne Plaza. \"Prices for rooms may change over time as any of these factors vary.\"\n\nThe guest mix in a hotel may also help dictate whether room rates go up or down, says Bobby Bowers, senior vice president of operations for hotel research firm STR. For instance, vacationers might be more price sensitive than business trekkers.\n\n\"Delivering great customer value is key for any hotel operator,'' Bowers says, \"and fair pricing is a critical component in that equation.''\n\nLike most hotel brands, Best Western says it has revenue managers to help figure out pricing. It relies on a methodology that includes forecasting demand, scanning websites like Expedia.com to see what their competitors are charging, and comparing their own booking trends.\n\nThe company recently rolled out the first phase of a new technology that forecasts demand four months in advance. Best Western also uses very specific room descriptions to help determine rates.\n\n\"Many brands have moved to a room type description that only included the bed type and whether or not the room allows smoking,'' says Patti Halter, the director of revenue services for Best Western International. She says that the chain \"encourages its hotels to describe their room types to the consumer in greater detail, which in turn allows the hotels to charge premium prices for guest rooms that demonstrate a higher consumer demand.''\n\nSimilar to airlines that might charge extra for a seat with more legroom, \"a Best Western branded hotel may identify a guest room as having a specialty mattress type or another specialty item that is in demand for their specific hotel or market,'' she says.\n\nProperties may also vary the pricing of a room type based on its popularity on a given day of the week, she says, charging more for a standard room with a king-size bed on a weekday \"based on the customer base of primarily solo business travelers ... while a room with two queen beds may be priced higher on weekends when more families and groups are traveling.''\n\nSome cast the net even wider to get the pricing just right.\n\nPatrick Bosworth, CEO and co-founder of the software company Duetto, says he uses algorithms based on a variety of data sources to help his roughly 300 hotel clients come up with the optimal room rates.\n\n\"Historically, hotels have just looked at how many reservations they have on the books or what competitors are charging,'' says Bosworth.\n\nHis company looks at data ranging from airline ticket sales, to the most popular days being searched on booking sites, to lodging reviews on TripAdvisor.\n\nIf \"airline ticket sales are up 13% in the market (and) searches on the website are up 11%,'' the hotel might consider raising room rates, Bosworth explains.\n\nOn the other hand, if searches on a hotel's site are down 9% vs. the previous year, Duetto might suggest that the hotel's marketing department send an e-mail to past customers offering a perk, like a free concert ticket, to attract guests. \"Those are the things that allow them to see further into the future so they can raise prices and earn money on days when they know they're going to be busy'' or drop prices to fill rooms.\n\nDuetto even monitors weather patterns.\n\nWeather can particularly figure into calculations for properties like beach and mountain resorts. \"If you have a particularly beautiful or bad weather forecast, it can impact last-minute demand as well as cancellations,'' Bosworth says.\n\nOne of his clients in Palm Springs, Calif., discovered that when the weather there was clear, but cloudy or rainy in Los Angeles or San Diego, occupancy could spike 20% to 30%. Knowing the forecast, the hotel could raise room rates or roll back discounts for those dates.\n\nFor hotels, it's not just a matter of setting the right price for a room, but convincing guests to book through the hotel directly, rather than a third-party site, like Hotels.com or Orbitz, which try to offer cheaper rates and require hotels to pay a fee for the bookings steered their way.\n\n\"Over the last five years the commissions paid to those third-party intermediaries have been growing at roughly twice the rate of (revenue) growth'' for the hotels, Bosworth says. Making guests want to book directly with the hotel hinges on various factors, including improving the hotel site's experience and \"getting the pricing right.''", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/allstar/2015/02/04/kyle-lowry-toronto-raptors-demar-derozan-first-time-all-stars-new-york/22879003/", "title": "Kyle Lowry became an All-Star by stealing from them", "text": "Adi Joseph\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nKyle Lowry took the money and ran. And he kept running, kept shooting, kept improving.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors point guard is having the best NBA season of his career, again. He has carried the second-best team in the Eastern Conference on his broad shoulders and stout 6-foot frame. And with a boost from Justin Bieber, he will be starting in next weekend's NBA All-Star Game, the only first-timer voted in by fans this year.\n\nLowry took the rare path to stardom, drifting in and out of starting lineups for the Memphis Grizzlies, Houston Rockets and Raptors in his first seven seasons. Things started to click last season, so Toronto gave him a four-year, $48 million contract to keep their successful core in place.\n\nBut instead of sitting back with a nearly doubled salary, Lowry went to the gym for fine-tuning — and a little thievery.\n\n\"Every year, it's always something different,\" he said. \"I'm always refining, adjusting. You can always fix your jump shot to make it even better.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\n\"I take bits and pieces from everybody. Last summer, I watched (Golden State Warriors point guard) Steph Curry, the way he shoots the ball. I want to be able to one day get — I won't be as great a shooter as he is, but why not get up there? Why not be that type of shooter, where you can't leave me at all?\n\n\"I'm a student of the game. I'm not ashamed of saying I'll steal things from everybody, I'll take tidbits from everybody. That's one thing about it: I just love the game and just watching it. ... I've got two TVs in my house just to watch basketball. I sit there and watch the games. I love watching the games.\"\n\nLowry is averaging career highs of 19.0 points and 4.8 rebounds along with 7.3 assists and 1.6 steals a game for the Raptors, who were 33-16 entering Wednesday's game against the Brooklyn Nets. His 25.9 usage rate, measuring the percentage of his team's possessions in which a player is involved, also is a career high.\n\nSo he's an All-Star, a deserving one after being snubbed last season. Lowry got a late boost from Bieber, the Canadian pop star who urged his 60 million-plus Twitter followers to vote (but forgot to include the proper #NBABallot tag in his tweet). That pushed him past Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade in the final days of the balloting.\n\n\"It's still shocking,\" Lowry said. \"It's still pretty cool. I'm still kind of getting used to me being in that position.\"\n\nLowry put himself in that position through dramatic improvement. He's always been a remarkable athlete, his speed and power offering a difficult to defend combination. But this season brought a new level out of Lowry, particularly when shooting guard DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors' All-Star last season, went down for 21 games. Lowry averaged 21.8 points and 8.7 assists during that stretch, as the team went 12-9 to stay among the East's top teams.\n\n\"He's become a lot more efficient offensively,\" said Washington Wizards guard Garrett Temple, who met Lowry at a high school All-Star camp a decade ago. \"When you saw DeMar go out, people kind of wrote off the Toronto Raptors for at least as long as he was going to be out. Kyle showed that he could basically carry a team and put them on his back. The biggest thing is he's getting in the lane more.\"\n\nDeRozan is back now, and the Raptors had a six-game winning streak before losing Monday to the Milwaukee Bucks. Lowry's chemistry and friendship with DeRozan was key in his free agency, when he was courted by the Rockets and Miami Heat, most prominently.\n\nLowry ended up returning to Toronto, where a \"We The North\" movement has increased the team and sport's popularity. He credited his teammates along with mentors such as retired All-Star Chauncey Billups. But the improvement was a process, whether he was stealing from Curry and the Los Angeles Clippers' Chris Paul (going to the right on pull-up jumpers) or developing his low-post game.\n\nThe recognition followed, though it's not the kind he wants most.\n\n\"No, I still got to work. I still got more work to put in. I still got more to do,\" Lowry said. \"I want to get to the Finals. I want to win a championship. That's my goal for my career.\"\n\nFIRST-TIMERS\n\nAlong with Lowry, four others will make NBA All-Star Game debuts Feb. 15 in New York.\n\nSG Jimmy Butler Chicago Bulls\n\nStatistics: 20.5 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.8 steals a game.\n\n20.5 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.8 steals a game.

Not his former classmates, who fear Chinese authorities beat him to death.\n\nNot his mother, who lives in a two-story house at the far end of a country road, alone behind walls bleached by the desert sun. She opened the door one afternoon for an unexpected visit by Associated Press reporters, who showed her a picture of a handsome young man posing in a park, one arm in the wind.\n\n“Yes, that’s him,” she said as tears began streaming down her face. “This is the first time I’ve heard anything of him in seven months. What happened?”\n\n“Is he dead or alive?”\n\nThe student’s friends think he joined the thousands — possibly tens of thousands — of people, rights groups and academics estimate, who have been spirited without trial into secretive detention camps for alleged political crimes that range from having extremist thoughts to merely traveling or studying abroad. The mass disappearances, beginning the past year, are part of a sweeping effort by Chinese authorities to use detentions and data-driven surveillance to impose a digital police state in the region of Xinjiang and over its Uighurs, a 10-million strong, Turkic-speaking Muslim minority that China says has been influenced by Islamic extremism.\n\nAlong with the detention camps, unprecedented levels of police blanket Xinjiang’s streets. Cutting-edge digital surveillance systems track where Uighurs go, what they read, who they talk to and what they say. And under an opaque system that treats practically all Uighurs as potential terror suspects, Uighurs who contact family abroad risk questioning or detention.\n\nThe campaign has been led by Chen Quanguo, a Chinese Communist Party official, who was promoted in 2016 to head Xinjiang after subduing another restive region — Tibet. Chen vowed to hunt down Uighur separatists blamed for attacks that have left hundreds dead, saying authorities would “bury terrorists in the ocean of the people’s war and make them tremble.”\n\nThrough rare interviews with Uighurs who recently left China, a review of government procurement contracts and unreported documents, and a trip through southern Xinjiang, the AP pieced together a picture of Chen’s war that’s ostensibly rooting out terror — but instead instilling fear.\n\nMost of the more than a dozen Uighurs interviewed for this story spoke on condition of anonymity for fear that Chinese authorities would punish them or their family members. The AP is withholding the student’s name and other personal information to protect people who fear government retribution.\n\nChen and the Xinjiang regional government did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But China’s government describes its Xinjiang security policy as a “strike hard” campaign that’s necessary following a series of attacks in 2013 and 2014, including a mass knifing in a train station that killed 33. A Hotan city propaganda official, Bao Changhui, told the AP: “If we don’t do this, it will be like several years ago — hundreds will die.”\n\nChina also says the crackdown is only half the picture. It points to decades of heavy economic investment and cultural assimilation programs and measures like preferential college admissions for Uighurs.\n\nOfficials say the security is needed now more than ever because Uighur militants have been fighting alongside Islamic extremists in Syria. But Uighur activists and international human rights groups argue that repressive measures are playing into the hands of the likes of al-Qaida, which has put out Uighur-language recruiting videos condemning Chinese oppression.\n\n“So much hate and desire for revenge are building up,” said Rukiye Turdush, a Uighur activist in Canada. “How does terrorism spread? When people have nowhere to run.”\n\nThought police\n\nThe government has referred to its detention program as “vocational training,” but its main purpose appears to be indoctrination. A memo published online by the Xinjiang human resources office described cities, including Korla, beginning “free, completely closed-off, militarized” training sessions in March that last anywhere from 3 months to 2 years.\n\nUighurs study “Mandarin, law, ethnic unity, de-radicalization, patriotism” and abide by the “five togethers” — live, do drills, study, eat and sleep together.\n\nIn a rare state media report about the centers, a provincial newspaper quoted a farmer who said after weeks of studying inside he could spot the telltale signs of religious extremism by how a person dressed or behaved and also profess the Communist Party’s good deeds. An instructor touted their “gentle, attentive” teaching methods and likened the centers to a boarding school dorm.\n\nBut in Korla, the institutions appeared more daunting, at least from the outside. The city had three or four well-known centers with several thousand students combined, said a 48-year-old local resident from the Han ethnic majority. One center the AP visited was, in fact, labeled a jail. Another was downtown on a street sealed off by rifle-toting police. A third center, the local Han resident said, was situated on a nearby military base.\n\nWhile forced indoctrination has been reported throughout Xinjiang, its reach has been felt far beyond China’s borders.\n\nIn April, calls began trickling into a Uighur teacher’s academy in Egypt, vague but insistent. Uighur parents from a few towns were pleading with their sons and daughters to return to China, but they wouldn’t say why.\n\n“The parents kept calling, crying on the phone,” the teacher said.\n\nChinese authorities had extended the scope of the program to Uighur students abroad. And Egypt, once a sanctuary for Uighurs to study Islam, began deporting scores of Uighurs to China.\n\nSitting in a restaurant outside Istanbul where many students had fled, four recounted days of panic as they hid from Egyptian and Chinese authorities. One jumped out a window running from police. Another slept in a car for a week. Many hid with Egyptian friends.\n\n“We were mice, and the police were cats,” said a student from Urumqi, Xinjiang’s regional capital.\n\nAll who returned were intensely grilled about what they did in Egypt and viewed as potential terror suspects, the students said. Many were believed held in the new indoctrination camps, while some were sentenced to longer prison sentences.\n\nThe young man from Korla rarely went out in the two years he spent studying Islam in Egypt. He played some soccer — a beloved sport among Uighurs — but wasn’t particularly athletic or popular.\n\nInstead, he kept to himself in an apartment that he kept fastidiously clean, steeped in his studies at the revered Al Azhar University, the 1,000-year-old seat of learning in Sunni Islam. He freely discussed Quranic verses with his Uighur friends but mostly avoided politics, one friend said. He spoke of one day pursuing a Ph.D. in comparative religion.\n\n“He had big dreams,” said the friend who is now hiding in Turkey to avoid being sent to China. “He wanted to be a religious scholar, which he knew was impossible in China, but he also wanted to stay close to his mother in Korla.”\n\nHe was fluent in Arabic and but also in Chinese. When they huddled around a smartphone to watch a Taiwanese tear-jerker about a boy separated from his mother, he would be the one weeping first.\n\nWhen homesickness got to him, he would tell his friends about how his mother doted on him, and about Korla and the big house he grew up in. And when he gets married, God willing, he would say, he’d start a family in that house, too.\n\n“If my wife doesn’t agree, then we don’t marry,” he declared.\n\nHe returned to China when he was called back in 2016 and taken away in February, according to three students and a teacher from Cairo. They say they heard from reliable sources in China — but cannot prove — that he died in detention.\n\nShow of force\n\nSouthern Xinjiang, the vast desert basin from where many of the students came, is one of the most heavily policed places on earth.\n\nDeep in the desert’s southern rim, the oasis town of Hotan is a microcosm of how Chen, the Xinjiang party boss, has combined fearsome optics with invisible policing.\n\nHe has ordered police depots with flashing lights and foot patrols be built every 500 meters (yards)— a total of 1,130, according to the Hotan government. The AP saw cavalcades of more than 40 armored vehicles including full personnel carriers rumble down city boulevards. Police checkpoints on every other block stop cars to check identification and smartphones for religious content.\n\nShopkeepers in the thronging bazaar don mandatory armored vests and helmets to sell hand-pulled noodles, tailored suits and baby clothes.\n\nXinjiang’s published budget data from January to August shows public security spending this year is on track to increase 50 percent from 2016 to roughly 45 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) after rising 40 percent a year ago. It’s quadrupled since 2009, a watershed year when a Uighur riot broke out in Xinjiang, leaving nearly 200 members of China’s Han ethnic majority dead, and security began to ratchet up.\n\nAdrian Zenz, a researcher at the European School of Culture and Theology who tracks Chinese public security staffing levels based on its recruiting ads, says Xinjiang is now hiring 40 times more police per capita than populous Guangdong Province.\n\n“Xinjiang has very likely exceeded the level of police density seen in East Germany just before its collapse,” Zenz said. “What we’ve seen in the last 12 to 14 months is unprecedented.”\n\nBut much of the policing goes unseen.\n\nTo enter the Hotan bazaar, shoppers first pass through metal detectors and then place their national identification cards on a reader while having their face scanned.\n\nThe facial scanner is made by China Electronics Technology Group (CETC), a state-owned defense contractor that has spearheaded China’s fast-growing field of predictive policing with Xinjiang as its test bed. The AP found 27 CETC bids for Xinjiang government contracts, including one soliciting a facial recognition system for facilities and centers in Hotan Prefecture.\n\nHours after visiting the Hotan bazaar, AP reporters were stopped outside a hotel by a police officer who said the public security bureau had been remotely tracking the reporters’ movements.\n\n“There are tens of thousands of cameras here,” said the officer, who gave his name as Tushan. “The moment you took your first step in this city, we knew.”\n\nThe government’s tracking efforts have extended to vehicles, genes, and even voices. In February, authorities in Xinjiang’s Bayingol prefecture, which includes Korla, required every car to install GPS trackers for real-time monitoring. And since late last year, Xinjiang authorities have required health checks to collect the population’s DNA samples. In May, a regional police official told the AP that Xinjiang had purchased $8.7 million in DNA scanners — enough to analyze several million samples a year.\n\nIn one year, Kashgar Prefecture, which has a population of 4 million, has carried out mandatory checks for practically its entire population, said Yang Yanfeng, deputy director of Kashgar’s propaganda department. She characterized the checkups as a public health success story, not a security measure.\n\n“We take comprehensive blood tests for the good of the people, not just record somebody’s height and weight,” Yang said. “We find out health issues in citizens even they didn’t know about.”\n\nA biometric data collection program appears to have been formalized last year under “Document No. 44,” a regional public security directive to “comprehensively collect three-dimensional portraits, voiceprints, DNA and fingerprints.” The document’s full text remains secret, but the AP found at least three contracts referring to the 2016 directive in recent purchase orders for equipment such as microphones and voice analyzers.\n\nMeiya Pico, a security and surveillance company, has won 11 bids in the last six months alone from local Xinjiang jurisdictions. It won a joint bid with a DNA analysis company for 4 million yuan ($600,000) in Kargilik and has sold software that automatically scans smartphones for “terror-related pictures and videos” to Yarkent.\n\nMeiya and CETC declined comment.\n\nPrying eyes\n\nTo monitor Xinjiang’s population, China has also turned to a familiar low-tech tactic: recruiting the masses.\n\nWhen a Uighur businessman from Kashgar completed a six-month journey to flee China and landed in the United States with his family in January, he was initially ecstatic. He tried calling home, something he hadn’t done in months to spare his family unwanted police questioning.\n\nHis mother told him his four brothers and his father were in prison because he fled China. She was spared only because she was frail.\n\nSince 2016, local authorities had assigned ten families including theirs to spy on one another in a new system of collective monitoring, and those families had also been punished because he escaped. Members from each were sent to re-education centers for three months, he told the AP.\n\n“It’s worse than prison,” he said. “At least in prison you know what’s happening to you. But there you never know when you get accused. It could be anytime.”\n\nA document obtained by U.S.-based activists and reviewed by the AP show Uighur residents in the Hebei Road West neighborhood in Urumqi, the regional capital, being graded on a 100-point scale. Those of Uighur ethnicity are automatically docked 10 points. Being aged between 15 and 55, praying daily, or having a religious education, all result in 10 point deductions.\n\nIn the final columns, each Uighur resident’s score is tabulated and checked “trusted,” “ordinary,” or “not trusted.” Activists say they anecdotally hear about Uighurs with low scores being sent to indoctrination.\n\nAt the neighborhood police office, a woman who gave her surname as Tao confirmed that every community committee in Urumqi, not just Hebei Road West, needed to conduct similar assessments. She said there were no statistics on how many residents had been deemed “not trusted,” nor were there official procedures to deal with them.\n\n“What is happening is every single Uighur is being considered a suspect of not just terrorism but also political disloyalty,” said Maya Wang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch who is studying how Chinese police are using technology to track political dissidents as well as Uighurs.\n\nThis month, Xinjiang announced it would require every government employee in the region to move into a Uighur home for a week to teach families about ideology and avoiding extremism.\n\nWhat pains most, Uighurs abroad say, is the self-imposed barrier of silence that separates them from loved ones, making efforts to say happy birthday or find out whether a relative is detained risky.\n\nWhen Salih Hudayar, an American Uighur graduate student, last called his 70-something grandfather this summer, he spoke in cryptic but reassuring tones.\n\n“Our phones will not work anymore,” his grandfather said. “So, don’t try calling and don’t worry about us. We’ll be fine as long as you’re all fine.”\n\nHe later heard from a cousin in Kyrgyzstan that his grandfather had been sent to re-education.\n\nA Uighur student who moved to Washington following the crackdown this summer said that after his move, his wife, a government worker still in Urumqi, messaged to say the police would show up at her home in 20 minutes. She had to say goodbye: after that she would delete him permanently from her contacts list.\n\nA month later he received calls on WhatsApp from a man who introduced himself as Ekber, a Uighur official from the international cooperation office of the Xinjiang regional public security bureau, who wanted him to work for them in the U.S. — and warned him against saying no.\n\n“If you’re not working for us then you’re working for someone else. That’s not a road you want to take,” he snapped.\n\nA week after that, he couldn’t help himself placing one last call home. His daughter picked up.\n\n“Mom is sick but she doesn’t want me to speak to you. Goodbye,” she said.\n\nUnanswered questions\n\nFor the past year, Chen’s war has meant mass detentions, splintered families, lives consumed by uncertainty. It has meant that a mother sometimes can’t get an answer a simple question about her son: is he dead or alive?\n\nA short drive from Korla, beyond peach plantations that stretch for miles, the al-Azhar student’s mother still lives in the big house that he loved. When the AP arrived unannounced, she said she had not received any court notices or reasons about why her son and his father were suddenly taken months earlier. She declined an interview.\n\n“I want to talk, I want to know,” she said through a translator. “But I’m too afraid.”\n\nAP reporters were later detained by police, interrogated for 11 hours, and accused of “illegal reporting” in the area without seeking prior permission from the Korla government.\n\n“The subjects you’re writing about do not promote positive energy,” a local propaganda official explained.\n\nFive villagers said they knew authorities had taken away the young student; one said he was definitely alive, the others weren’t sure.\n\nWhen asked, local police denied he existed at all.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/10/05/mast-year-means-more-acorns-falling/5934916001/", "title": "Are you seeing more acorns falling?

Or maybe a few extra crunches as you pull the car out of your driveway?\n\nSome Americans are seeing more acorns drop than usual this year. If you're in the same boat, then you could be in the middle of what's called a \"mast year\" for oak trees, which is when they produce an abundance of nuts.\n\nIn Michigan, one resident said the two \"epic oaks\" outside her house started dropping acorns in bunches this year after not producing any for years. In Connecticut, parts of the state are seeing a sparse output while others see a lot.\n\nIf acorn mast years seem a bit random, that's because they are – in some ways, at least. They can happen on varying scales and don't occur on a set schedule. They come around as often as once every year or two and can be spurred by winter weather, experts say.\n\n\"It has much to do with what's happening with the weather prior to flowering,\" which occurs in the spring for oak trees, said Nina Bassuk, a professor and director of the Urban Horticulture Institute at Cornell University.\n\nWinter 2021:Almanac says we're in for one of the coldest winters in 'years.' Should you trust it?\n\nA mild winter can often mean more acorns since white and red oak trees are able to produce more of them when they start creating seeds in the spring. But a harsh winter or a springtime freeze can lead to very little acorn production, or sometimes none at all.\n\nThis is where climate change potentially plays a role in the frequency of acorn mast years, Bassuk said. Mild winters and no spring freezes mean a more conducive environment for flowering.\n\nIn the Northeast, for instance, this past winter and spring were \"phenomenal\" for flowering, Bassuk said.\n\n\"I think that was because we had a pretty mild winter and any flower buds that did form were allowed to flower as opposed to being killed off by late frost or something like that,\" Bassuk said.\n\nAnd it's not just acorns that fall in bunches once every couple years. Other nuts like walnuts and hickory nuts go through the same process.\n\nTravel:Why climate change is making it harder for leaf peepers to chase fall foliage\n\nOn the whole, the bushels of tree nuts falling from above don't mean much more than a nuisance for humans. In rare cases, they can be damaging to parked cars or glass outdoor furniture.\n\nJeremiah Sandler, an arborist in Royal Oak, Michigan, said he gets a lot of calls this time of year about the extra tree nuts. Homeowners tell him they've never seen so many acorns and are worried. He calms them down by telling them that they have nothing to fear. Nature is doing just what it's supposed to be doing.\n\n\"I like mast years,\" Sandler said. \"It gets more people looking at trees.\"\n\nContributing: Frank Witsil, Detroit Free Press\n\nFollow Jay Cannon of USA TODAY on Twitter: @JayTCannon\n\nVideo:Bright blue fireball appeared over the Colorado sky\n\nPolitics:Andrew Yang leaves Democratic Party, registers as independent", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/23/rob-lowe-the-best-thing-ever-happened-jess-cagle-show/4069101002/", "title": "Rob Lowe's sex tape is 'the best thing that ever happened,' he says", "text": "Rob Lowe has found a silver lining in his career-threatening scandal from the late '80s.\n\nThe filmed sexual encounter made during the 1988 Democratic National Convention was brought up during the 55-year-old star's appearance on SiriusXM's \"The Jess Cagle Show.\" In 1989, the \"St. Elmo's Fire\" actor faced a lawsuit from the mother of a 16-year-old girl involved in the tape.

Among the worst atrocities under British rule occurred during the Mau Mau uprising, which started in 1952 – the year Queen Elizabeth took the throne.\n\nThe colonial administration at the time carried out extreme acts of torture, including castration and sexual assault, in detainment camps where as many as 150,000 Kenyans were held. Elderly Kenyans who sued for compensation in 2011 were ultimately awarded £19.9 million by a British court, to be split between more than 5,000 claimants.\n\nThe UK Foreign Secretary at the time, William Hague, said: “The British Government recognises that Kenyans were subject to torture and other forms of ill treatment at the hands of the colonial administration. The British government sincerely regrets that these abuses took place, and that they marred Kenya’s progress towards independence.”\n\nAfrica’s memory of the Queen cannot be separated from that colonial past, professor of communication Farooq Kperogi at Kennesaw State University told CNN.\n\n“The Queen’s legacy started in colonialism and is still wrapped in it. It used to be said that the sun did not set over the British empire. No amount of compassion or sympathy that her death has generated can wipe that away,” he told CNN.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II on her way to the Kumasi Durbah with Kwame Nkrumah, President of Ghana, during her tour of Ghana, November 1961.

Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nOthers recalled Britain’s role in the Nigerian civil war, where arms were secretly supplied to the government for use against Biafrans who wanted to form a breakaway republic. Between 1 million and 3 million people died in that war. British musician John Lennon returned his MBE, an honorary title, to the Queen in protest over Britain’s role in the war.\n\nStill, many on the continent remember the Queen as a stabilizing force who brought about positive change during her reign.\n\nAyodele Modupe Obayelu from Nigeria told CNN: “Her reign saw the end of the British Empire and the African countries … became a Republic. She doesn’t really deserve any award or standing ovation for it, but it was a step in the right direction.”\n\nNigerian magazine publisher Dele Momodu met Queen Elizabeth on a 2003 state visit to Abuja, Nigeria. From Dele Momodu\n\nAnd Ovation magazine publisher Dele Momodu was full of praise, recounting meeting her in 2003 in Abuja while covering her visit to Nigeria. He added that he had fled Nigeria for the UK in 1995, during the dictator Sani Abacha’s regime.\n\n“I told her I was a refugee and now the publisher of a magazine. She told me ‘congratulations,’ and moved on to the other people on the line. I salute her. She worked to the very end and was never tired of working for her country. She did her best for her country and that is a lesson in leadership,” he told CNN.\n\nMomodu believes that the Queen did try to “atone” for the brutality of the British Empire. “She came to Nigeria during our independence and some of the artifacts were returned under her reign. That is why the Commonwealth continues to thrive. I feel very sad that the world has lost a great human being.”\n\nAdekunbi Rowland, also from Nigeria, said: “The Queen’s passing represents the end of an era. As a woman, I’m intrigued by her story. This young woman had an unprecedented accession to the throne, and with much grace and dignity did everything in her power to protect the country and Commonwealth she loved no matter what it took.”\n\nCommonwealth Queen\n\nThe Queen once declared, “I think I have seen more of Africa than almost anybody.”\n\nShe made her first official overseas visit to South Africa in 1947, as a princess and would go on to visit more than 120 countries during her reign, many of them on the continent.\n\nElizabeth, then a princess, and Prince Philip step from their plane in Nairobi, Kenya, on the first stage of their Commonwealth tour in 1952.

Her father George passed away while she was there with Prince Phillip and she immediately ascended the throne.\n\nAs colonialism later crumbled and gave way to independence and self-rule in what had been British overseas territories, the former colonies became part of a Commonwealth group of nations with the Queen at its head and she worked tirelessly to keep the group together over the years.\n\nShe forged strong bonds with African leaders, including Nelson Mandela, whom she visited twice in South Africa, and Kwame Nkrumah, with whom she was famously pictured dancing during her visit to Ghana in 1961.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II dances with President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, during her visit to Accra, Ghana, in 1961.

In November 2021, Barbados removed the Queen as its head of state, 55 years after it declared independence from Britain, and other Caribbean countries, such as Jamaica, have indicated they intend to do the same.\n\nPrince William and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, visited Jamaica in March but they faced protests and calls for reparations during the trip. There were also calls for a formal apology for the royal family’s links to slavery.\n\n“During her 70 years on the throne, your grandmother has done nothing to redress and atone for the suffering of our ancestors that took place during her reign and/or during the entire period of British trafficking of Africans, enslavement, indentureship and colonization,” wrote members of a protest group, the Advocates Network Jamaica.\n\nIn June, Prince Charles became the first UK royal to visit Rwanda, where he was representing the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nFollowing his mother’s death, he now heads the Commonwealth, and will embark on a new relationship with its members, about a third of which are in Africa.\n\nSome are asking whether he will be as effective in building the organization as his mother, and above all, how relevant it still is, given its roots in Empire.", "authors": ["Stephanie Busari"], "publish_date": "2022/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/uk/royal-news-newsletter-03-11-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Is Buckingham Palace still the Queen's main residence ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the March 11 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nThink of the Queen and you think of Buckingham Palace. It’s up there with the White House as one of the world’s most celebrated addresses.\n\nGenerally, tourists take a cab or a bus, hop off to take a picture of the famous railings, maybe sticking around for the changing of the guard just before lunchtime, and then head on to the next destination on their list. So, why the fascination, especially when most people don’t even go inside?\n\nThey come because it’s home to the living, breathing British monarchy and they grew up seeing it in movies and history books.\n\nNone of that has changed. This is still the Queen’s head office but she doesn’t stay overnight anymore. She has, to all intents and purposes, moved to what used to be her weekend home at Windsor Castle. Some reports this week have suggested the move is permanent.\n\nPeople on the Long Walk outside Windsor Castle Steve Parsons/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe Queen’s office at Buckingham Palace declined to comment, but a royal source told us she continues to carry out a variety of engagements there and confirmed it remains the central base of the British monarchy.\n\nThe source also pointed out that the ongoing Buckingham Palace refurb is expected to continue for another five years, and who wants to live in a building site? When we’ve been behind the scenes, the place is awash with builders, tools and pots of paint – a world away from the peaceful medieval grandeur of Windsor. Where would you prefer to spend your latter years?\n\nThe bigger question is what Charles plans to do with the palace. His office rarely comments on matters relating to his own monarchy as it would be insensitive to his mother who is still very much the sovereign.\n\nHe also prefers life outside the capital. He’s passionate about walking and the countryside and spends as much time as possible in the tranquility of his rural residence in the rolling hills of Gloucestershire in the English West Country. If he inherits Buckingham Palace as an office rather than a residence, he may choose to keep it that way.\n\nBuckingham Palace continues to attract tourists to its famous gates. Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images\n\nCharles could demonstrate his desire for a leaner, more efficient monarchy by opening the building up for wider public use. He could rent it out for events and exhibitions.\n\nWhen you consider Buckingham Palace has 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 240 bedrooms and 92 offices, it probably could be used more effectively than it has in the past.\n\nBut would you, as a tourist, visit an office? Isn’t it the idea that the Queen actually lives there that is appealing about the place? She could tweak a curtain or drive out at any moment… that’s what makes it so exciting to be there.\n\nWhat do you think Charles should do with the palace? Send us your ideas and we will publish the most interesting ones in next week’s newsletter.\n\nDON’T MISS\n\nNormally the fact that the monarch completed her first in-person appearance after a bout of illness would be front page news over here. However, with the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine, attention was quite rightly diverted when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stopped by Windsor Castle on Monday.\n\nThe Queen was all smiles when she caught up with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday. Steve Parsons/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPhotographs of the pair in the now-familiar Oak Room showed Trudeau clasping the Queen’s hands as they appeared to chat and laugh together.\n\nBut it was the background that garnered the most attention from the engagement. Eagle-eyed royal-watchers spotted a large bouquet of blue and yellow flowers – the colors of the Ukrainian flag – on a table behind the pair. It’s been seen by many as a very deliberate choice of set dressing by the monarch to quietly convey her support to the people of Ukraine.\n\nIt wouldn’t be unheard of for the Queen to give subtle hints at her thinking – she’s certainly done it in the past. This latest possible example also follows her “generous” but private donation last week to an emergency humanitarian appeal currently operating in the UK.\n\nTrudeau journeyed to Europe on Sunday for a week of meetings designed to “further strengthen Canada’s solidarity with our European partners and allies in the face of Russia’s unwarranted invasion of Ukraine.” Following his stop in London, the Canadian Prime Minister – who himself recently recovered from coronavirus – traveled on to Latvia, Germany and Poland.\n\nHow to help: Looking for ways to help those affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine?

What exactly did he say about war in Europe?\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Wednesday came laden with homemade brownies and granola bars from Kensington Palace for volunteers at a Ukrainian cultural center in London, which has been collecting donations for the war-torn nation.\n\nThe couple learned about how the Ukrainian Social Club is coordinating relief packages, handling the generous outpouring of public offerings it has received and the distribution challenges in funneling aid back to Ukraine.\n\nThe royal couple conveyed their shock at Russia’s unfolding invasion and revealed their children have been asking them about the conflict. “Everyone is horrified by what they are seeing. It’s really horrifying. The news every day, it’s just, it’s almost unfathomable,” William said. “For our generation, it’s very alien to see this happening in Europe. But we’re all right behind you. We’re thinking about you … We feel so useless.”\n\nIn the hours after the engagement, “Prince William” was trending on social media after the royal’s remarks were incorrectly paraphrased by the royal pool journalist, who had filed copy saying William had compared the war in Europe to conflicts in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe pool system means British reporters take turns covering engagements and share information and photos among the group so that events can be widely reported by all outlets. Once the misheard remarks were distributed through the pool, they were widely used in various publications, before going viral on social platforms.\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, video of the moment surfaced from broadcaster ITV clarifying William had never made such a reference. Media outlets issued corrections and online articles were removed or amended.\n\nWilliam and Catherine chat with volunteers as they pack donations to be sent to Ukraine.

Charles was visiting St. Luke’s Church in west London on Wednesday to learn more about the Holy Trinity Brompton’s Refugee Response program, launched in September to help support Afghan arrivals to the UK.\n\nDuring the visit, Charles told refugees from countries including Afghanistan, Ukraine, Iraq and Iran that he couldn’t “begin to imagine the dreadful conditions” they had endured to reach the UK. The heir to the throne said he prayed they had been welcomed and that they bring much-needed skills to the country.\n\n“I know so many of you already have qualifications, training in your own countries, and we have enormous skill shortages in this country, where so much of what you can do could be of enormous benefit to it. We are very lucky in many ways to have you and your skills and all you can bring,” he said.\n\nCharles meets refugees during the visit on Wednesday.

Among the guests were Inna Prystaiko, wife of Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, former British Prime Minister Theresa May and Spice Girl Mel B.\n\nCamilla also had a bit of a royal run-in when the duchess met her television alter ego, Emerald Fennell, at the event. Fennell portrayed a fictionalized version of a young Camilla in Netflix’s most recent season of “The Crown.” Rumors about the family’s feelings on the hit series have swirled for years but Camilla was nothing but smiles during the encounter.\n\nWhile at the event, she also got the chance to catch up with three female Afghan judges, who were evacuated from the country along with 100 others by the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute, as the Taliban returned to power last year. “Their stories, of the humanity behind the headlines, are unbearably moving – but they must, and they do, have the power to stir us to action, as do the heart-breaking stories from Ukraine of brutal attacks on democracy and freedom,” the duchess said at the WOW reception.\n\nCamilla meets her \"The Crown\" counterpart, actor and award-winning writer-director Emerald Fennell. Arthur Edwards/Pool/Getty Images\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nPrince Andrew civil sex abuse case is officially over.\n\nUS District Judge Lewis Kaplan officially dismissed Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against the Duke of York Tuesday after attorneys for both parties submitted a stipulation to the court asking for a dismissal. David Boies, an attorney for Giuffre, confirmed Prince Andrew had paid the agreed settlement. That dollar figure has not been disclosed. “The payment was received, the settlement we announced last month has been completed. We are obviously very pleased with the outcome,” Boies said. CNN has reached out to counsel for Prince Andrew for comment.\n\nThe parties reached an out-of-court settlement agreement in February, which included Andrew’s payment of an undisclosed amount to Giuffre and her charity supporting victims’ rights, according to court documents.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Giuffre alleged Epstein trafficked her and forced her to have sex with his friends, including Andrew, and that the prince was aware she was underage in the US at the time. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.

The service – which will be the first in-person gathering of the Commonwealth since coronavirus struck – will pay tribute to the Queen’s life-long commitment to the 54-member organization. Lord Bishop Sentamu, former Archbishop of York, will give an address, with musical performances from Emeli Sandé and Mica Paris, according to Buckingham Palace. Later Monday, Prince Charles and Camilla will attend the annual Commonwealth reception at Marlborough House.\n\nMarch 17: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are planning to attend the St. Patrick’s Day Parade at Mons Barracks in Aldershot, England on Thursday.

The Alabama Historical Association has elected Wetumpka native Frazine Taylor as president for the upcoming year. Taylor, who works in the archives department at Alabama State University in Montgomery, was also presented with an award recognizing her contributions to Alabama history. Taylor, chair of the Black Heritage Council of the Alabama Historical Commission is known for her expertise in genealogical research and African American history. She was elected during the association’s recent statewide meeting in Tuscaloosa. The organization publishes a quarterly review and oversees a program of roadside historical markers.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State environmental officials have launched the first ambient air quality study in the capital city in more than a decade to determine if air is being affected by cruise ships or other sources. The state will collect data from 21 monitors installed in late April around downtown Juneau, the Juneau Empire reports. The devices use lasers to measure particulate and report online in near-real time. They will remain in place through October. Fine particulate is tiny particles that can be inhaled and at high levels can cause health problems including respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, heart attacks and premature death. In the Fairbanks North Star Borough, where people burn wood as an alternative to expensive fuel oil, fine particulate is a perennial winter problem.\n\nArizona\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: Scenic State Route 67 will reopen Wednesday in time for the summer season of hikers, backpackers, and tourists visiting the remote North Rim of the Grand Canyon. The area closes from mid-October through mid-May each year because of heavy snowfall, more than 9 feet during an average winter, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. When the national park lodge, campground, visitor center and restaurants reopen toward the end of spring, so does SR 67, the winding 31-mile road lined by pines and aspens that connects Jacobs Lake to the Kaibab Plateau. Only about 10% of Grand Canyon visitors go to the North Rim, but enthusiasts willing to make the extra travel are rewarded with a more intimate experience, says Grand Canyon National Park spokesperson Kris Fister.\n\nArkansas\n\nPonca: For the fourth year in a row, the Buffalo National River will host a free concert by band National Park Radio, on June 15 at Steel Creek Campground. The modern folk band from Harrison, Arkansas, is known for its hopeful, heartfelt lyrics with themes about life, love and difficult choices, echoing the band’s deep-seated roots in the Ozark Mountains. Music will begin at 6 p.m. near the boat launch at Steel Creek Campground. Free parking is available on site, but National Park Service officials advise concertgoers to carpool to minimize traffic and associated resource impacts. The annual event is sponsored by the Buffalo National River Partners, a nonprofit dedicated to the promotion, appreciation, preservation and protection of America’s first national river.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Officials say a planned subway project that will connect three rail lines downtown has been delayed again. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority says the new completion date for the Regional Connector is mid-March 2022. Rail service is scheduled to begin five months after that. The agency’s initial target date was December 2020, but that was delayed by a year in 2017 as officials increased the budget to $1.75 billion. The Los Angeles Times reports Sunday that the latest delay comes as the contractor grapples with labor shortages. The project requires nearly 4 miles of excavation for two tunnels and three subway stations. The twin tunnels are designed to connect three lines into two mega-routes that will allow passengers to ride long distances without changing trains.\n\nColorado\n\nBreckenridge: A huge wooden troll has found a new home in this ski town. The Summit Daily reports that the troll has been relocated to a spot behind an ice arena in the south end of Breckenridge. The troll’s creator, Danish artist Thomas Dambo, visited the location Friday to affix a heart-shaped stone to the troll’s wooden body. It was originally assembled beside a trail last summer for a festival, but it was so popular with visitors that nearby homeowners complained about the crowds. It was taken down in November. The troll, named Isak Heartstone, stands 15 feet high. The site is not open to the public yet. The town is building a trail and surrounding amenities, which are expected to open by early June.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation that could lead to the production of industrial hemp in the state. The Democrat says the new law will provide farmers an opportunity to “bolster their profits with hemp.” He says it will also attract veteran and first-time farmers to a new and growing market. The legislation passed both the state House of Representatives and Senate by unanimous votes. Under the new law, the Connecticut Department of Agriculture is required to establish a pilot program for growing or cultivating industrial hemp. The federal government recently allowed states to grow, use or sell the product, which proponents say has thousands of uses. Connecticut’s regulations will ultimately need federal approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state House is set to vote on a bill that largely prohibits retailers from providing single-use carryout plastic bags to customers. The bill slated for a vote Tuesday is aimed at cutting down on the amount of plastic bags cluttering landfills, littering roadways and clogging stormwater systems. The bill applies to stores with more than 7,000 square feet of sales space and chain stores with three or more locations having at least 3,000 square feet of sales space. Restaurants are excluded from the bag ban, which also allows exceptions for bags used to wrap meat, fish, flowers or plants or that contain unwrapped food items. You could also still carry a goldfish home from a pet store or your laundry from the dry cleaners in plastic bags.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital has the highest use of drugs in the entire country, according to a new report from the personal finance website Wallethub, WUSA-TV reports. The district scored a 59.95 on a 100-point scale by Wallethub’s metrics, ranking as No. 1 for the highest use of drugs and addiction. According to the findings of the report, the District of Columbia also ranked in the top five for highest use of drugs by adults and teenagers. In order to determine which states have the biggest drug problems, WalletHub compared the 50 states and D.C. in three categories: drug use and addiction, law enforcement, and drug health issues and rehab.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A quiet South Beach neighborhood has become a battleground between preservationists and homeowners who want more freedom over their properties. Residents of leafy Palm View are divided over a push to repeal the area’s historic designation, which protects the neighborhood’s Mediterranean Revival homes and low-rise apartment buildings from demolition. But it also limits property owners’ ability to build more resilient structures, and residents say flooding in the area is getting worse. South Florida is expected to see 1 to 2 feet of sea level rise by 2060, according to a projection from the Southeast Florida Climate Compact. In Palm View, some residents say being able to build newer, more resilient structures has become increasingly important. The neighborhood borders the Collins Canal.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group of students from Spelman and Morehouse colleges who’ve been studying Michelle Obama’s memoir, “Becoming,” had a surprise visitor to discuss the work – the former first lady herself. Obama came to Spelman to talk with the students Saturday about the best-selling book ahead of her sold-out appearance Saturday night at State Farm Arena in downtown Atlanta. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Obama encouraged the 18 students to have faith in themselves, saying she learned through her eight years in the White House and elsewhere that she is as smart and capable as the well-educated and famous leaders she encountered.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. lawmakers representing the state want a large-scale study conducted on the impact sunscreen chemicals have on humans and coral reefs around the world. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono, along with Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., last week introduced the Oxybenzone and Octinoxate Impact Study Act of 2019, which would require the Environmental Protection Agency to study the impacts of the chemicals on human and the environment. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard also introduced the act along with the Reef Safe Act of 2019 that would require the Food and Drug Administration to develop standards for the “Reef Safe” designation in over-the-counter sunscreens. Last year, Hawaii enacted a law banning the sale or distribution of over-the-counter sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two city parks are being renamed to honor Native Americans from the local past. Idaho Press reports the Boise City Council voted unanimously on the name changes last week. Now Quarry View Park will be renamed Eagle Rock Park, and Castle Rock Reserve will be renamed Chief Eagle Eye Reserve. The council also voted unanimously on a resolution that reasserts the city’s directives to honor contributing contributions to the area by indigenous people. Eagle Rock is the traditional name of a balancing rock above Quarry View Park, and it’s a significant site for tribes in what is now Treasure Valley. Eagle Eye was chief of a band of 70 Weiser Shoshone who moved to the mountains of Idaho secretly in 1878 instead of relocating to a reservation.\n\nIllinois\n\nUrbana: The University of Illinois is planning to name its Micro and Nanotechnology Lab after an engineering visionary who created the first practical LED. Professor emeritus Nick Holonyak Jr., a UI engineering alumnus, found a new alloy in 1962 that would emit light in the red segment of the visible spectrum. Energy-saving LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, are now universal and used in everything from flashlights and electronics to spacecraft. UI trustees will vote this week on whether to name the UI Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory in Holonyak’s honor, the News-Gazette reports. UI College of Engineering officials say very few graduates in UI’s 152-year history have had as much influence as the Franklin County native.\n\nIndiana\n\nPorter: Indiana Dunes National Park says visitors can reserve campsites, beginning Wednesday. In past years, all 66 sites at Dunewood campground were available on a first-come, first-served basis. Under the new system, 34 sites can be reserved up to six months in advance. The remaining 32 sites will remain first-come, first-served. The price is $25 per night. The campground is open April through October. An online reservation system goes live at 9 a.m. CDT Wednesday. For more information, contact the park’s information desk at (219) 395-1882, or visit its website. The park covers 15,000 acres along the southern shore of Lake Michigan in northwestern Indiana.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Officials say a dog disease that can be passed to humans has been confirmed in the state. The state veterinarian, Dr. Jeff Kaisand, says several cases of canine brucellosis have been confirmed at a commercial breeding facility for small dogs in Marion County. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship says it is notifying people who have custody of the exposed dogs. Both the animals and the facilities are quarantined while the dogs undergo testing. Signs of the disease in a dog include infertility, spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. State health officials say symptoms for humans include fever, sweats, headache, joint pain and weakness. The department says the threat to most pet owners is very low. Dog breeders and veterinary staff may be at higher risk.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: Nurse practitioners are fighting to get rid of the state requirement that they get permission to work from a physician. KCUR-FM reports Kansas is one of the few states that still make advanced practice nurses sign contracts with doctors. Physicians argue the contracts are to protect patients by ensuring that nurses collaborate with their more educated colleagues. But nurses are fighting back against the contracts, which they say limit patient options and can even give doctors a cut of their earnings for little to no work. A bill seeking to drop the collaborative contract requirement died in a legislative maneuver this year. But nurse practitioners hope to try again, offering to make new nurse practitioners work a few years before dropping their contracts with doctors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: In the past three years, the state has made great strides toward addressing food insecurity in distressed rural communities – and it’s become a model for other states looking to try new solutions. Earlier this year, Kentucky hosted the first-ever Summit on Rural Child Hunger, organized by the national No Kid Hungry campaign. The state was selected in part because of its Hunger Initiative, launched by Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles in 2016. Since it began, the initiative has donated more than 150 refrigerated coolers and freezers to dozens of food pantries statewide; created an economic incentive for summer meal programs, encouraging the purchase of more fruits and vegetables from local farmers; and advocated for the continued funding of the Farm to Food Banks Trust Fund, which awards grants to eligible nonprofit organizations that provide food to low-income Kentuckians.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A federal judge has conditionally dismissed a lawsuit that claimed three ailing death row inmates in the state were being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment through high heat indexes. The Advocate reports attorneys for the inmates and the state Department of Corrections jointly requested to dismiss the 2013 civil rights lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Brian Jackson ruled in 2016 that cell heat indexes exceeding 88 degrees constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but the ruling was overturned because it defined a maximum heat index. The conditional dismissal requires Louisiana to remain in “substantial compliance” with an agreement it signed last year. That agreement requires the inmates to have daily showers, individual ice containers and fans, water faucets in their cells and other cooling techniques.\n\nMaine\n\nSaint George: A state agency has been awarded $1 million to help acquire an island in the state’s midcoast area for conservation. The U.S. Department of the Interior’s National Coastal Wetland Conservation Grants program is making the money available to help preserve Clark Island in the Saint George area. Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree says the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife will work with Maine Coast Heritage Trust on the conservation project. Pingree says the money will be used to buy 168 acres of Clark Island. The acres abut an existing 250-acre state conservation easement in Saint George. Pingree says the preservation of the site will protect habitat for birds and allow for recreational opportunities.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan signed a first-in-the-nation measure Monday to make it easier for people without health insurance to find out if they qualify for low-cost insurance after they file their taxes. The new law will create a box for people to check on state income tax returns. If it’s checked, the state’s health care exchange will see if the person qualifies for Medicaid, based on information in the tax return, and those who are eligible will be enrolled automatically. The exchange will reach out to people who qualify for private coverage. Hogan, a Republican, highlighted bipartisan work in the Democrat-controlled General Assembly on other health-related measures he signed Monday. One of them raises the smoking age from 18 to 21 and includes vaping in the definition of tobacco products.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A proposed $2 billion wind farm planned for federal waters off Martha’s Vineyard has been awarded a key permit by a state board responsible for reviewing proposed large energy facilities. The Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board last week approved requests filed by Vineyard Wind for the construction and operation of the 84-turbine, 800-megawatt wind farm about 14 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard off the Massachusetts Coast. Project officials call the permit approval a significant milestone toward the wind farm’s construction. In February the project also received a key approval from Rhode Island regulators after the state’s Coastal Resources Management Council determined the project is consistent with state policies.\n\nMichigan\n\nDearborn: An exhibition at the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation in suburban Detroit is offering a glimpse into the world of “Star Trek.” Titled “Star Trek: Exploring New Worlds,” the exhibition runs through Sept. 2 at the museum in Dearborn. It offers a look at more than 100 artifacts and props from the original TV series and its spinoffs. It also explores its enduring impact on culture, from arts and technology to fashion and literature. The traveling exhibition from Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture includes a tricorder, communicator and phaser from the original series. It also features artifacts from the “Star Trek” films and original set pieces, including a navigation console and costumes. The exhibition is a collaboration involving CBS Consumer Products, which manages licensing and merchandizing for the network.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: A University of Minnesota study links the decline of walleye in Mille Lacs Lake to a loss of habitat resulting from clearer water. Minnesota Public Radio reports the study was published in the journal Ecosphere. Lead author Gretchen Hansen says researchers used 30 years of data on the lake’s water clarity and temperature to estimate how walleye habitat has changed. Walleye prefer low light and cooler water. But in recent decades, Mille Lacs’ water clarity has increased, most likely due to septic system improvements around the lake and the invasion of zebra mussels. Hansen says that has reduced walleye habitat. The study suggests that altering annual harvest levels based on changing water clarity and temperature could help sustain the walleye population. State officials currently base limits on the estimated number of fish in the lake.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A local chef has won a major culinary award after five previous nominations. The James Beard Foundation last week named Vishwesh Bhatt of Snackbar in Oxford as its 2019 winner for best chef in the foundation’s South region. Bhatt tells The Oxford Eagle winning was “just an incredible feeling.” He’s thanking Oxford restauranteur John Currence, whose City Grocery Restaurant Group owns Snackbar, City Grocery and other restaurants in Oxford. Bhatt also attributes his success to the restaurant’s staff. Bhatt has been the lead chef at Snackbar since it opened in 2009.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A popular animal at the St. Louis Zoo is celebrating a milestone birthday: Merah the Sumatran orangutan is 50 years old. Merah reached the half-century mark Monday. She was born May 13, 1969, at a zoo in the Netherlands. She came to St. Louis in 1992. Merah is a five-time mother, the grandmother of two and great-grandmother of one. The zoo says that when Merah gave birth to Ginger in 2014 at age 45, she became the oldest Sumatran orangutan in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Orangutan Species Survival Plan to give birth and rear her offspring. Sumatran, Bornean and Tapanuli orangutan species are classified as critically endangered due to habitat loss. The zoo says fewer than 125,000 orangutans remain in the wild.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A vintage plane restored by volunteers has lifted off for the first time in nearly 20 years. The Missoulian reports that the 75-year-old Dakota DC-3 known as Miss Montana flew over Missoula on a test flight Sunday. It was the first time it was airborne since arriving in 2001. Volunteers have been working hard to get the former firefighting plane ready to travel to France for the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Miss Montana is scheduled to participate in a re-enactment of the invasion, including dropping jumpers from Montana. A send-off gala Saturday night raised money to cover its fuel costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Landowners are seeking new solutions for a phenomenon millions of years old. Tons of sand, sediment and silt – some in dunes as high as 10 feet – have been scattered across the eastern half to two-thirds of the state by flooding in March. In some areas, washed-out cornstalks are 3 to 4 feet deep. Tree limbs are in piles, and topsoil has been washed away. “We have a mountain of sand piled up,” Valley farmer Ryan Ueberrhein told the Omaha World-Herald. Sediment from Nebraska’s rivers and streams has been deposited on nearby flooded land for millions of years. Now U.S. Department of Agriculture officials, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension specialists and extension educators are trying to figure out what to do with it. They’re racing against the clock because farmers need to plant, and ranchers need grass pastures to graze their cattle.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: Dozens of volunteers in the state’s northeast plan to return to an 80-year-old youth camp site next month to begin a $1 million rebuilding effort in the wake of an explosive wildfire. Elko Lions Club members who’ve launched a fundraising drive for Camp Lamoille hope to reopen it next year in the rugged Ruby Mountains, where the camp was established by the Boy Scouts of America southeast of Elko in 1939. Ten of the 16 buildings were lost in the fire last fall, including the historic lodge, six A-frame cabins and three storage units. So far, the Lions Club has raised about $343,000 of the estimated total cost of rebuilding through fundraisers, insurance proceeds, and other individual and corporate donations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The schedule is set for a weeklong celebration of the Statehouse’s bicentennial. While various events have been held in recent years, the formal celebration starts Sunday, June 2, with an opening ceremony, re-enactments of the first Statehouse session in 1819 and tours of the building. On Monday, there will be special roundtable discussions featuring former governors and executive councilors. Tuesday’s schedule features the state Supreme Court hearing oral arguments in Representative’s Hall and an event highlighting the history of the Statehouse press corps. Wednesday is devoted to the state’s cultural heritage and arts, while Thursday will be Homecoming Day for former lawmakers. A “New Hampshire Made” street market Friday and closing ceremonies Saturday round out the celebrations the first week in June.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPalmyra: The sighting of an invasive spotted lanternfly at Palmyra Cove in Burlington County has brought attention from the state and U.S. agriculture departments. After one of the insects was spotted in November, the U.S. Department of Agriculture followed up with an inspection, finding and removing a spotted lanterfly egg mass on a perimeter trail, says Kristina Merola, director of natural sciences and park manager at Palmyra Cove. This month, as the insects’ hatching season approaches, crews from the NJDA began working in Palmyra Cove, the vast labyrinth of wetlands and woodlands beneath the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. They’re marking Ailanthus trees, which are a crucial host for the spotted lanterfly species. State crews are then treating the trees with herbicide, Merola says. The intruding bugs pose a threat to entire agricultural industries.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: School districts have become increasingly reliant on substitutes as they contend with a growing number vacant teaching positions in the state. Districts needing to fill vacancies have turned to hiring substitute teachers, particularly long-term substitutes. Some of those substitutes have spent years in a classroom as temporary educators. School district leaders say it’s a necessary step as they deal with hundreds of vacant positions across the state. Still, they express concerns about the challenges that come with hiring substitute teachers who typically are not certified and do not build lesson plans or meet with parents. A New Mexico State University report says the state had about 740 vacant teaching positions last year, more than double the 300 vacancies reported in 2017.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Lady Liberty is ready to reveal the biggest upgrade to her island home since she first raised her torch in 1886. More than two years after breaking ground, and funded by a $100 million public campaign, the new Statue of Liberty Museum opens Thursday. The 26,000-square-foot museum, loaded with historic relics and interactive exhibits, rises uphill from the central pedestrian mall on Liberty Island, which receives some 4.5 million visitors annually. Built on the New Jersey-facing side of the island, terraced steps, made of the same Stony Creek granite used to build the statue base, lead to a 14,000-square-foot green roof, seeded with native grasses. From there, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the Upper Bay between New York and New Jersey and, of course, Lady Liberty herself.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Carolina Hurricanes have been rolling at home ever since their newly acquired grunter named Hamilton started hogging the corner. Not defenseman Dougie Hamilton – Hamilton the pig. The 90-pound Juliana potbelly who catches games from behind the boards in a personalized wagon has shown plenty of chops during his three-week run as the team’s unofficial good-luck charm. In the land of pulled pork barbecue, this pig pulls for the Hurricanes. “He’s like this little internet sensation that caught on,” says his owner, Raleigh real estate broker Kyle Eckenrode. “People just love it when we bring him out. It’s really crazy to watch it all unfold.” The Hurricanes can’t argue with the results: Ever since Hamilton began hanging out, the players haven’t lost with their prized pig in the building.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Capitol will soon welcome its visitors with a new public entrance. The Bismarck Tribune reports that state lawmakers have approved $2 million to remodel the Capitol building’s only public entrance before the next legislative session in January 2021. The entrance is accessed through a tunnel that’s long been closed to vehicle traffic. Sen. Ray Holmberg says the tunnel would cause winter winds and extreme cold to seep into the Capitol’s ground floor. The state’s facilities management director, John Boyle, says the plan calls for enclosing the tunnel and converting drive lanes into sidewalks with landscaping. Boyle says the remodel would also improve handicapped accessibility. Boyle says the changes will make it an “easier, user-friendly experience for people coming to the Capitol.”\n\nOhio\n\nNew Concord: The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be dedicated as a site on the National Register of Historic Places this month in the late astronaut’s hometown of New Concord. The museum, which was John Glenn’s boyhood home, will be dedicated in a ceremony Sunday in the Muskingum County village roughly 70 miles east of Columbus. The Glenns’ daughter, Lyn, will help dedicate the property. The former U.S. senator was born in Cambridge and moved to New Concord with his family in 1923. He was the first American to orbit the Earth and served 24 years as a Democrat in the Senate. The museum has also been designated an Ohio historic site and is on the National Park Service’s Register of Historic Places.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state investigator says cattle rustling is on the rise. The lead agent for the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture’s criminal investigation unit tells The Journal Record that the number of cattle reported stolen through March has already surpassed all of 2018. That comes to 1,210 stolen in the first three months of the year compared to 975 in 2018. Investigator Jerry Flowers says the state often works with federal agencies. In a recent case, that has included the FBI and the Bureau of Indian Affairs because the stolen cattle was on property north of El Reno that is under the jurisdiction of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal Nations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The sergeant at arms of the state Senate had a new regular duty in recent days: searching the Capitol for Republican senators who have been staying away and brought the legislative body’s business to a halt. The tactic by the minority party is rare in Oregon but has been used throughout history, sometimes creating comical scenes. In Washington three decades ago, U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., was carried feet-first into the Senate chamber after Democrats ordered the arrest of Republican senators who were denying a quorum. The Oregon standoff ended on its fifth day Monday. It had been caused by GOP senators’ anger at a bill that raises taxes on some businesses to fund education. After the Senate finally convened Monday afternoon, it passed the measure. To get the Republicans to return, Democrats, who hold a supermajority, agreed not to advance a measure requiring vaccinations for children to attend public schools. They also agreed to drop gun-control legislation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: For 20 years, visitors to Eastern State Penitentiary got a glimpse of how Al Capone may have lived while incarcerated there in 1929. But a new installation at the former prison, now a historic museum, reveals something new – that Capone had a cellmate. Capone’s solo cell was for decades based on a newspaper account in the Public Ledger that described a “beautiful rug of soft colors,” refined wood furniture, “tasteful paintings” and a cabinet-style radio that played waltzes. The exact cell to house America’s most famous gangster, in what was once the world’s most famous prison, remains a guess. As part of ongoing preservation, the history museum “moved” Capone one cell over, giving the bootlegger a more historically accurate exhibit that finds him in less fancy digs, which he shares with a cellmate. The original cell on exhibit is left empty. Visitors can tour both spaces.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers are considering a bill to waive state college application fees for veterans. Democratic state Sen. Walter Felag introduced the measure, which passed the Senate Wednesday and was referred to the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. It would authorize state higher education institutions to waive application and transcript fees for veterans. It states that the Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education should encourage the presidents of the Community College of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and University of Rhode Island to do so. Felag says it’s just one way to express gratitude for veterans’ service to the country and make their lives easier after they return home.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A program to prevent former inmates from returning to prison has launched in the Lowcountry. WCIV-TV reports Project Evolution Inc. kicked off Friday. The program helps teach former inmates basic technology and job skills and also helps them build resumes and train for job interviews. The program begin in 2015 in Washington, D.C. Founder Barbara Magwood says she’s helped about 200 former inmates readjust to life without bars and to stay out of jail. South Carolina Department of Corrections data from 2015 shows 22.3% of inmates return to jail within three years. Magwood says through encouragement, the program is able to show ex-inmates that there’s hope after prison. Elder Walter Jackson, pastor of Greater Refuge Temple in Charleston, says his church is providing program volunteers to facilitate skills training.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSpearfish: A study shows that the population of a bird listed as a threatened species in the state is stable in the Spearfish and Whitewood creek watersheds but not expanding. American dippers can be found throughout the West, but the Black Hills is the farthest east the species is located, and that population also is genetically different from others. The Black Hills Pioneer reports Bird Conservancy of the Rockies biologist Nancy Drilling last year surveyed the Bear Butte, Elk, Box Elder, French and Rapid creeks. She says the results are similar to what was found in the early 2000s. The American dipper has been listed as threatened in South Dakota since 1996. The state wants a self-sustaining population in a third watershed before the bird is removed from the list.\n\nTennessee\n\nPigeon Forge: Dollywood has expanded with a newly opened land inspired by the magic of nature. Wildwood Grove, the largest expansion yet of Dolly Parton’s amusement park, opened its gates to guests for the first time Friday. The $37 million area has 11 themed attractions and sits adjacent to the Pigeon Forge theme park’s Timber Canyon area. Wildwood Grove features trees and plants native to East Tennessee. The new land’s story also connects to the area and features a young girl who discovers and touches the Wildwood Tree, and it opens her eyes and mind to everything around her. Wildwood Grove’s 11 themed attractions range from a new roller coaster to a restaurant with Southwestern cuisine. Butterflies, dragonflies, frogs and fireflies factor heavily into the imagery of the rides and decor.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: The Texas Historical Commission has approved $150,000 to help with the “stabilization and ultimate reuse” of a historic 1914 courthouse. The commission awarded Nueces County funding for the project through a National Park Service grant, according to a release from the commission. The $12.3 million grant is meant to help historic properties in areas affected by Hurricane Harvey. Nueces County leaders have long grappled with how to save the historic building that sits in downtown Corpus Christi. In March, commissioners voted to reject an offer from the Ed Rachal Foundation to purchase the building and the property on which it sits.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Federal officials and environmentalists are joining efforts to boost protection for a rare poppy that is only found in southern Utah. The Spectrum & Daily News reports that the U.S. forest Service, Utah Valley University and The Nature Conservancy are examining how to manage the dwarf bear-poppy or bearclaw poppy, which has been on the decline for the past 40 years. The flower was first put on the federally endangered species list in 1979. Experts say it can only blossom in specific geological conditions. Those conditions, which include gypsum soil, can be found in the St. George area. The Nature Conservancy established the 800-acre White Dome Nature Preserve that protects most of the habitat occupied by the poppy. Researchers have been using a drone to study the flowers.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has joined a handful of counterparts in renaming Columbus Day to honor Native Americans. Republican Gov. Phil Scott signed a bill May 6 recognizing the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. A half-dozen states and several cities have made the change. Native American tribes and others say celebrating Italian explorer Christopher Columbus ignores the effect that the European arrival in the Americas had on the native peoples. They suffered violence, disease, enslavement, racism and exploitation at the hands of the settlers. Vermont’s law states that “Vermont was founded and built upon lands whose original inhabitants were Abenaki people and honors them and their ancestors.”\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: A new walking and bicycle trail connecting Chincoteague and Assateague islands will be named after former longtime Mayor Jack Tarr. The trail will connect downtown Chincoteague with the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on Assateague. The Chincoteague Town Council voted last week to name the new trail network the “John H. Tarr Bay to the Beach Trail.” Councilman Eddie Lewis suggested naming the trail after Tarr, and Councilwoman Ellen Richardson recommended “Bay to the Beach.” Lewis made a motion combining the two ideas, which was seconded by Denise Bowden and approved unanimously. Earlier this year, the town solicited ideas for naming the trail via the town’s website and Facebook page. More than 40 potential names were submitted for consideration.\n\nWashington\n\nWestport: A big rebound in the sea lion population along the West Coast in recent years has created a constant battle to wrangle the protected animals. They’re smart and fun to watch from a safe distance – but also noisy, smelly and proving to be a headache for some coastal marinas. “It’s a free zoo, kind of; just don’t pet ’em!” said Dennis Craig of Olympia as he watched a pier at Westport Marina nearly sink under the weight of dozens of burly bulls jostling and snoozing in the sun. The flip side of these flippered fish fiends can be seen in the mounting bill to the marina, including the cost of busted docks, broken electric stanchions and lost business. “Nearly all of our net revenue was used to repair damage caused by sea lions this year,” Westport Marina business manager Molly Bold said in an email.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A West Virginia University researcher is seeking funding to study whether using fentanyl testing strips changes the behavior of drug users, The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid increasingly involved in drug-related deaths. Some harm reduction programs use the strips to warn drug users of the presence of fentanyl in other illicit substances. Dr. Judith Feinberg, a professor at the WVU School of Medicine, told the paper people might be safer knowing there is fentanyl in their drugs. But people could also use the strips to seek out dangerous drug doses. Feinberg and researcher Jon Zibbel are asking the National Institute on Drug Abuse to fund the research. They plan to study harm reduction programs at Milan Puskar Health Right, in Morgantown, and a program in North Carolina.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: More people are dying in Wisconsin, but the state’s growing elderly population is living longer. Those are two findings of the annual death report from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The latest report released Monday looks at deaths in 2017. It found that deaths were up 15% compared with a decade ago. But the death rate for people age 65 and older decreased by 10% over 10 years. The top three causes of death in 2017 were heart disease, cancer and unintentional injury. Overall, the rates of death from cancer and heart disease both declined. But deaths from falls were up 3%, and poisonings were up 13%. Poisoning accounts for 30% of all unintentional injuries, second only to falls at 42%.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A noisy geyser in Yellowstone National Park has roared back to life after three years of quiet. Ledge Geyser is one of the biggest in Yellowstone’s Norris Geyser Basin. The Billings Gazette reports the geyser shoots hot water at an angle up to 125 feet high and a distance of 220 feet. Yellowstone geologist Jeff Hungerford says Ledge Geyser is noisy because its water and steam must pass through a narrow opening in the ground. Yellowstone has 1,300 thermal features and 500 geysers, more than anywhere else on Earth. Some geysers such as Old Faithful are predictable, but most, like Ledge Geyser, erupt erratically.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/24/baby-elephant-cougars-dognapper-burning-treehouse-news-around-states/40407493/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Two dogs have died at a shelter, prompting its temporary closure. Mobile police said in a statement Tuesday that the dogs at the City of Mobile Animal Shelter displayed symptoms of canine distemper, but a confirmed diagnosis is pending from a veterinary lab. News outlets reported that 57 dogs housed in kennels for strays might have been exposed. Quarantine protocols have been implemented. Mobile police added that it’s unlikely any dogs in the adoptions kennels have been exposed, but it’s asking families who adopted dogs on or after Sept. 24 to monitor their pets. Canine distemper is a contagious disease caused by a virus that attacks dogs’ respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems. Local animal rescue groups and the county shelter are housing new strays during the quarantine.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state Department of Fish and Game said the number of nuisance bears killed around Anchorage fell sharply this summer. KTVA-television reported the department has recorded four black bears and two brown bears were killed by the department or by citizens. Biologist Dave Battle said the department in 2017 saw 34 bears killed, including three brown bears. Last year, 42 bears were killed, including 14 brown bears. Battle said there are several theories for fewer conflicts. Bears had a lot to eat in forests this year. Also, the high number of bears killed the previous two years might have removed most of the nuisance bears. Battle said he’s encouraged by a new ordinance that fines people who don’t handle trash properly. That ordinance took effect in mid-June.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The city plans to temporarily restrict access to a popular hiking spot at the Dreamy Draw Recreation Area for parts of 2021 for the construction of a $300 million water project. The area won’t be closed entirely, city staff said. But trails will be closed at different times during this phase of the work, which is expected to take about a year. They hope to close the most popular trails during the slower summer months. The city will also renovate the recreation area’s parking, ramadas and restrooms at the same time. The entire project is part of efforts to alleviate the Valley’s reliance on the Colorado River as a water source. It is expected to take two to three years to finish, according to the Phoenix Water Services Department. Work is expected to begin in January near the Water Treatment Plant at 24th Street and Lincoln Drive, but the Dreamy Draw portion likely won’t begin until early 2021. The third phase will be along State Route 51 crossing to 32nd Street.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A report showed the obesity rate in Arkansas has increased among public school and state employees and their spouses. The Arkansas Center for Health Improvement’s analysis revealed that nearly 48% of such workers and their partners last year reported a height and weight classifying them as obese, compared to about 44% the year before. It found the average cost to its health plan of covering obese employees or spouses was $690, compared with $535 for nonobese personnel. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that the center, which is an arm of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, presented the report Monday to the board that administers the health plans covering state and school workers. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey showed that 37.1% of all Arkansas adults were considered obese in 2018.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County health officials said a visitor to Disneyland this month might have exposed others to measles. The Department of Public Health said a county resident with a confirmed case of measles visited the theme park on Oct. 16 from 9:15 a.m. to 8:35 p.m. Earlier that morning, the person was at a Starbucks on the west side of Los Angeles. Health officials said anyone who was at those locations at those times might be at risk of developing measles for up to 21 days. Those people should check their medical records to determine if they were immunized or had measles previously. There have been 19 measles cases among Los Angeles County residents in 2019 and 11 cases among nonresidents who traveled through.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Allegiant Airlines is pulling service from the airport serving Fort Collins and Loveland. The discount airline promising service to and from Las Vegas and Phoenix blamed the lack of an air control tower at Northern Colorado Regional Airport. A month before commercial air service was to return to Northern Colorado, Allegiant notified customers via email it would not be flying to the airport because its long-awaited virtual tower was not up and running. Airport Manager Jason Licon told the Coloradoan the FAA delayed testing of the virtual tower until late January, a decision over which the airport had no control. Airport and city officials had come up with an alternate plan – a mobile tower – that would have had air traffic controllers on the ground to serve as a bridge until January. The airport is owned by the cities of Fort Collins and Loveland and is located just off Interstate 25 in Loveland. Officials learned of Allegiant’s decision during an airport commission meeting Monday afternoon.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Authorities said two students were among four people taken to the hospital following a crash between a school bus and a car. Hamden fire officials said the collision occurred shortly after 7 a.m. Wednesday as the bus was taking students to the New Haven Academy. Nine people were treated at the scene. Two students, the bus driver and the car driver were taken to a hospital. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known, but a New Haven school official said the injuries do not appear to be serious. There were only four students on the bus at the time. Their ages were not released. Another bus came to the scene to transport them to school. The crash is under investigation.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be pumping sand along the north end of Rehoboth Beach. The state’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said in a statement Monday that the $7 million beach nourishment project will begin this week. The project is a partnership between the state, the city and the Army Corps of Engineers. Pumping operations will be done by contractor Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company. The project is expected to finish in 20 days and will result in some beach closures. A similar project is expected to last about 25 days in Dewey Beach.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Charter schools in the nation’s capital have seen their first drop in enrollment since 1996. The Washington Post reported the Office of the State Superintendent of Education released preliminary data Tuesday that showed the charter sector lost 404 students this academic year, lowering enrollment to about 43,556. The newspaper reported the sector has more than 100 schools, though four school campuses are not reopening because of finances or poor academic performance. Meanwhile, the district’s traditional public school system saw a 4% increase in enrollment, surpassing 50,000 students for the first time since 2006. The sectors together saw an overall a 1.7% enrollment increase. Charter enrollment might increase next year, with the charter board approving five new schools and two existing charter schools having just opened second campuses set for expansion.\n\nFlorida\n\nOcala: State wildlife officials said they have captured and relocated a black bear that had been eating out of a trash bin at an elementary school. The Ocala Star-Banner reported that Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission trapped the bear Friday and moved it to the Ocala National Forest. Officials said the bear had been visiting Ocala Springs Elementary School at night for weeks and eating chicken feed used by the school’s agriculture club. A conservation commission bear biologist is working with school administrators to prevent attracting bears in the future. One suggestion is to replace the existing trash bin with a bear-resistant model.\n\nGeorgia\n\nFitzgerald: Mayor Jim Puckett told local news outlets that the town is building the world’s largest chicken topiary, a 62-foot steel-framed chicken with plants growing on it. Wild Burmese chickens have long roamed Fitzgerald. Puckett aims to leverage that reputation to draw tourists. “They want to see chickens, so we’re going to show them a chicken,” he said. The city is spending $150,000 on the topiary, designed to top the 56-foot tall steel “Big Chicken” at a Kentucky Fried Chicken in Marietta, Georgia. Puckett said the Fitzgerald topiary could even include an apartment for overnight rentals and an observation deck. It should be ready by year’s end.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A power company is seeking public input on a proposed solar array it said will generate enough electricity to power an average of more than 14,200 households. West Hawaii Today reported Monday that Juwi Inc. is seeking community input on its solar energy project to be located on Hawaii Island land owned by BIVWR Investment LLC in South Kohala. The company planned to hold an open house Wednesday to garner public feedback on the project. The Boulder, Colorado, company said the array would be no taller than 7 feet but comprise 200,000 to 250,000 solar panels that track the sun as it crosses the sky. Juwi said the proposed 55-megawatt array would generate about 162.5 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually.\n\nIdaho\n\nTwin Falls: Family members looking through an elderly relative’s belongings found two World War II-era grenades. The Times-News reported one grenade was found Thursday tucked inside a shadow box, and another was stored among other items of memorabilia belonging to the 94-year-old former soldier. J.P. O’Donnell with the Twin Falls Police Bomb Squad said the man’s son-in-law did a bit of research before calling in authorities for help. The grenade in the shadow box was inert, but the other was believed to be a live military ordnance. The Mountain Home Air Force Base Explosive Ordnance Disposal team was contacted, and the grenade was detonated at the local landfill on Friday.\n\nIllinois\n\nMarion: Six prisoners were taken to a hospital following a carbon monoxide leak at a southern Illinois jail. Deputy Brian Murrah with the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office told WSIL-TV the Marion Fire Department performed an air quality check and discovered carbon monoxide in an area that contains booking, work release and other departments. Firefighters were called Wednesday morning after some staff and prisoners complained of symptoms. The source of the leak wasn’t immediately clear. Murrah said the general housing unit was not affected.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:Firefighters said a vehicle has plunged from the fourth floor of a downtown parking garage, killing a man and a woman inside. The vehicle, which appeared to be an SUV, landed on its roof after falling shortly before 10 a.m. Wednesday from the Market Square Center Garage. The vehicle landed in an alley behind the City Market. It wasn’t immediately clear how the vehicle fell from the garage. Indianapolis Fire Department Battalion Chief Rita Reith said code enforcement was on its way to check for structural damage to the garage, which has been temporarily closed.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Police caught a man who said he wanted to steal home plate at the city’s minor-league baseball park. Polk County court records said Daniel Igel, listed as homeless, was arrested Friday morning at Principal Park, home of the Iowa Cubs, a Chicago Cubs affiliate. He’s charged with felony burglary. Court records don’t include the name of an attorney who could comment for him. Igel’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. A court document said Igel was found after he climbed a fence to get into the park. He told officers he was trying to steal the plate and had scaled the fence the night before and tried to break into the press box. He said he hid in a dugout to evade officers who responded to a security alarm.\n\nKansas\n\nAnthony: A 3.7 magnitude earthquake centered near the Kansas-Oklahoma border was felt as far as 75 miles away, but no injuries were reported. The Kansas City Star reported that the temblor happened just after 4 p.m. Tuesday and was centered in northern Oklahoma, about 15 miles south of Anthony. The town of about 2,200 residents is 10 miles from the Oklahoma state line. Light-to-moderate shaking was measured near the epicenter. People as far away as Wichita, 75 miles away, reported feeling the earthquake. Dozens of small earthquakes have rattled the same area in recent days, but the earthquake on Tuesday was the strongest in the area in the last 30 days.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:A 2½-month-old elephant calf born at the Louisville Zoo is now known as Fitz, the namesake of a woman who was a fan of the pachyderms. The zoo said the winner of its fundraising vote was Kristin Hays of Prospect for the name she submitted after her great-grandmother, who loved elephants. Zoo spokeswoman Kyle Shepherd said Hays originally said it was her great-grandfather but later said her sister corrected her. The contest raised $6,000 for the zoo. Norton Children’s Hospital sponsored the naming contest for the calf born Aug. 2. And 23-month-old heart transplant recipient Eli Alexander and his family unveiled the winning name Tuesday. Fitz and his mother, Mikki, are on exhibit daily.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The Environmental Protection Agency has invited the city to apply for up to $111 million in loans to help restore its aging sewer system. The money could help the city’s Sewerage and Water Board meet a 2025 federal court deadline for completing that restoration, the New Orleans agency said in a news release Tuesday. The EPA got letters of interest from 51 public and private agencies, and 38 were chosen to apply for $6 billion in loans to help finance about double that amount in water infrastructure investments, the federal agency said in its own news release. The New Orleans agency and EPA will be working on the arrangement, with the aim of getting the first payment in mid-2020. New Orleans’ sewer and sewage treatment system has been under a federal court consent decree with the EPA since 1998 for violating the Clean Water Act for “sanitary sewer overflow violations” that sent untreated sewage into Lake Pontchartrain, the Mississippi River and other waterways. Deadlines were extended three times after Hurricane Katrina flooded 80% of the city in 2005.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The City Council has voted to ban the sale and distribution of plastic straws. The first phase of the ban starts in April. Patrons will have to request a straw to be provided with one. Phase two begins in January 2021, where the sale and distribution of plastic straws will be prohibited. The ordinance also bans the use of single-use stirrers and splash sticks. The Portland Press Herald reported this ban follows several other environmentally conscious moves made by the City Council, including a ban of single-use polystyrene cups and food containers, and a 5-cent fee on the distribution of single-use plastic bags.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:Don Whittington of Wicomico County caught Maryland’s first record triple tail on Oct. 19 near the Baltimore Canyon off the coast of Ocean City, weighing in at 11 pounds and measuring 25.25 inches. The triple tail can be found from the tropical waters of Florida upward to southern New England in the summer months, according to Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources. Whittington was on board his son’s boat fishing for tuna and common dolphin when the catch came on his line. Officials of Bahia Marina in Ocean City certified the triple tail’s weight, and a Maryland DNR biologist certified the species. The state recognized the triple tail in its Atlantic Division for state records.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCambridge: The student newspaper at Harvard University is facing a campus backlash over a routine request for government comment on a demonstration against a federal immigration agency. A petition signed by 11 student groups, including the Harvard College Democrats, accused the Harvard Crimson of showing cultural insensitivity. The student Democrats said on Twitter they have stopped speaking with the newspaper. Protesters at the Sept. 12 rally in Harvard Yard called for the abolition of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The Crimson contacted ICE to ask it for comment for its story on the demonstration, a standard practice in journalism. The Crimson said this week it stands by the decision. It is the latest example of heightened political sensitivity on college campuses that also have seen a wave of conservative speakers being uninvited.\n\nMichigan\n\nFenton: Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said a “well-organized machine” of thieves appears to be behind the theft of tons of apples and pumpkins from orchards and farms in Michigan and Indiana, according to authorities. An estimated 7,000 pounds of apples were discovered missing Oct. 10 from Spicer Orchards in Fenton. During the same week, 1,000 pumpkins were pilfered from McCallum’s Orchard in Jeddo, about 15 miles north of Port Huron. There were also 50,000 apples reportedly stolen from Williams Orchard in LaPorte County, Indiana, just one mile south of the state line. Pickell told the Detroit Free Press that investigators do not have any suspects but that he believes the thefts were committed by a professional group. Officials with Spicer Orchards said they will strengthen security with cameras and alarms, hoping to prevent future thieves.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Court of Appeals is deciding whether to grant requests by opponents of the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine to cancel two of its most important permits and order further proceedings. Ann Cohen, representing several environmental groups, told a three-judge panel Wednesday that PolyMet’s permit to mine and its dam safety permit lack enforceable terms and conditions needed to protect the public and environment. Paula Maccabee of the environmental group WaterLegacy argued that the Department of Natural Resources was legally obligated to hold a contested case hearing with a neutral administrative law judge before deciding whether to approve the permits. But attorneys for the DNR and PolyMet argued that the project has met the legal requirements. The Court of Appeals usually rules within 90 days of hearing oral arguments.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: Adams County is looking at ways to hold residents accountable for more than $2 million owed in outstanding garbage collection fees. The Natchez Democrat reported property owners collectively owe the sum to the local government, but the county is legally required to continue providing trash pickup service anyway. Administrator Joe Murray said the garbage collection fee per household is $15 a month, and payment is required for renewing vehicle tags. But he said the debt problem has persisted for decades. During a Board of Supervisors meeting Monday, attendees suggested adding the fee to existing taxes, but a motion didn’t move forward. Murray said a House bill that will take effect in January could add relief by authorizing the county to collect debts against a person’s income tax refund.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: WDAF-TV reported that eight to 10 horses were roaming on eastbound 152 shortly after 8 a.m. Wednesday. Missouri Department of Transportation crews and police were trying to help corral the horses. Their owner was also helping. It was unknown how the horses got onto the roadway. A portion of the highway was closed during the roundup. Kansas City Police tweeted a photo from the scene. The tweet said police might have to think about teaching roping and wrangling to new recruits.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A Montana landowner is suing the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service to halt the hunting of bison just outside of Yellowstone National Park. The complaint filed by Bonnie Lynn of Gardner and Neighbors Against Bison Slaughter contended the agencies have failed to analyze the consequences of the hunt on private property owners and visitors as required by law. The Billings Gazette reported Lynn wants to halt bison killing within a mile of her home and rental cabins. In a related lawsuit, Lynn and L&W Construction are seeking $500,000 from the federal government. The two complaints were filed Tuesday in a District of Columbia federal court. U.S. Justice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said the government is not commenting on the lawsuits.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state environmental group has launched a campaign urging the Omaha Public Power District to set a goal of dropping its carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Nebraska Conservation Voters announced the initiative last week after the power district’s board of directors proposed the goal at its meeting on Oct. 15. Eliot Bostar, executive director of Nebraska Conservation Voters, said the goal would greatly benefit all Nebraskans. Bostar said Nebraska ranks as one of the top states with clean energy potential, but the state hasn’t taken full advantage of the opportunity. The group has launched an online petition on its website. Nebraska gets almost 70% of its electricity from fossil fuels such as coal.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Officials said September marked the seventh time since January that McCarran International Airport handled more than 4 million passengers in a month. The Clark County Department of Aviation reported Wednesday the 4.3 million people arriving and departing from the airport in September was up 6.8% from the same month a year ago. Passenger traffic marks a key index of tourism in Las Vegas, where the airport has handled 38.5 million passengers this year. That’s a pace to surpass 50 million for the first time. McCarran handled a record 49.7 million passengers in 2018. It’s one of the 10 busiest airports in the U.S. based on passenger count. Southwest Airlines is the busiest carrier at McCarran, followed by Spirit, Delta, American and United.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center is opening a geriatric emergency department, joining about 100 other hospitals across the country that have implemented similar care. Although most of the others are in urban areas, Dartmouth-Hitchcock is collaborating with a group of nonprofit organizations called West Health to focus on the rural populations of northern New England. Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire have the oldest median ages in the country. Over three years, Dartmouth-Hitchcock will develop specialized areas within its emergency department in Lebanon and then use telehealth to expand to four other sites across the region. In a geriatric emergency department, staff will take a more global approach, looking, for instance, at the reasons behind repeated falls. At-risk patients would be identified through better screening, the environment would be optimized for patients with hearing or vision impairments and a room would be set aside for patients with dementia.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPrinceton: Princeton Theological Seminary will provide scholarships and set up doctoral fellowships to repent for having benefited from slavery. NJ.com reported Monday that the seminary will use an endowment of $28 million to provide 30 scholarships for students who descended from slaves or underrepresented groups. The money will also fund doctoral fellowships and other initiatives. The seminary will designate five doctoral fellowships for the descendants of slaves and hire a full-time director for the Center for Black Church Studies, among other actions. Seminary President Craig Barnes said the school is “committed to telling the truth” and considers the payments an act of repentance. Princeton Theological Seminary invested in Southern banks and had donors who benefited from slavery. Founding teachers and leaders used slave labor and some advocated to send free black men and women to Liberia\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLincoln National Forest: The state’s Department of Game and Fish is using longer-lasting motion-capture wildlife cameras, mathematical models and GPS collaring devices to count its transient cougars, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. The big cat is secretive, has a broad range of movement and often doesn’t live close to its kind. The state believes the most abundant population lives in a 6,000 square-mile stretch that extends from Albuquerque to the east of Santa Fe and north of Abiquiú. The state is touting a recent model spearheaded by former Game and Fish Carnivore Program Manager Sean Murphy, which it said has offered more dependable numbers on cougars. Murphy said a 2017 study involved capturing 16 cougars and attaching GPS collaring devices, and each animal was identified by sex. The state then put cameras in the study area to take pictures, which also allowed data to be collected on cougars that hadn’t been collared. The data was put through a mathematical model called “spatial mark-resight.” The model used information about the times and geographic locations of sightings – collared and uncollared – by the cameras over four months to estimate population density, size, sex ratio, and home range areas. It estimated 129 cougars in that area. Officials said having an accurate count informs the Department of Game and Fish’s quota on hunting and trapping of cougars. The department’s quota is 17% of the population. About 4,353 cougars live in New Mexico, according to the state. The 2019 quota is 740, according to state rules. In the past year, 409 cougars were killed. The new proposed quota for the next five years is a decrease to 580.\n\nNew York\n\nCanajoharie: A painting seized by the Nazis from a Jewish family in 1933 has been recovered from a museum in upstate New York by the FBI. The work, “Winter” by American artist Gari Melchers, was part of the collection at the Arkell Museum in Canajoharie until Sept. 10, according to federal court documents. The recovery is part of an international effort to find artwork that was stolen after the Nazis’ ascension to power. German publisher and philanthropist Rudolf Mosse first acquired the painting from the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1900. The Nazi government seized control of the family’s art collection after Mosse’s family members fled Germany in 1933. The Nazis had persecuted the family because they were Jewish and because of their affiliations with Berliner Tageblatt, a newspaper critical of the party, according to court documents. Bartlett Arkell, the first president of the Beech-Nut Packing Company, brought the painting from a New York City gallery in 1934 for his personal collection and it later became part of the collection at the museum 50 miles northwest of Albany that bears his name. Suzan D. Friedlander, the museum’s executive director and chief curator, said in an emailed statement that the museum “was of course very upset to learn the history of the painting’s seizure from the Mosse family by the Nazis in 1933.” The museum waived all rights to the painting, which is also known as “Skaters” or “Snow.” The painting will remain at the FBI’s Albany office until it is reunited with the Mosse family.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The law license of North Carolina’s first female lawyer, Tabitha Ann Holton, is now part of the state Supreme Court’s collection of historic artifacts. Officials said in a news release that the court received Holton’s 1878 license earlier this month from her grand-nephew, Walter Holton, and his daughter, Mary. The license will be displayed in the Supreme Court History Room. After graduating from Greensboro Academy in 1878, Holton petitioned the state Supreme Court to sit for the state bar examination. The court required her to return the next day with her attorney to argue for her right to take the test. The court deliberated for 10 minutes before allowing her to take the exam, which she passed. The court then presented Holton with her law license.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota Industrial Commission has approved a study of the composition of the state’s natural gas. The goal of the more than $300,000 study approved Tuesday is to determine if the composition of natural gas liquids produced as a byproduct of oil drilling changes over the life of a well. Pipeline Authority director Justin Kringstad said the study is important in determining whether projects such as a petrochemical plant are feasible in North Dakota, which could help curb the practice of burning off and wasting natural gas. The study is funded from a percentage of the state’s share of oil and gas taxes. It is scheduled to be completed by May 1.\n\nOhio\n\nNewark:Developers plan to turn the iconic, basket-shaped building that was once headquarters for The Longaberger Company into a hotel. One of the developers who bought the seven-story building in Newark in 2017 announced plans Monday to transform it into a luxury hotel with 150 rooms, a restaurant and an indoor pool. Officials with Ceres Enterprises, which owns and operates hotels, and with Sandvick Architects joined building co-owner Steve Coon in making the announcement. Longaberger opened the central Ohio building in 1997. The company that successfully sold handcrafted baskets for years went out of business in 2018. Coon said renovation work could begin by late next year. No cost estimate was given for the renovation, but project officials said the exterior look of a basket will remain intact.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Federal prosecutors said a New Jersey man has pleaded guilty to smuggling more than 1,000 box turtles that were illegally collected in Oklahoma. Court records showed 26-year-old William T. Gangemi of Freehold, New Jersey, was accused of violating a federal law against the sale or purchase of illegally collected wildlife with a market value above $350. Gangemi was part of a syndicate of wildlife smugglers involved in the purchase and transportation of three-toed and western box turtles from Oklahoma to New Jersey. The collection of both types of turtles for commercial purposes is illegal in Oklahoma. Prosecutors said Gangemi pleaded guilty Wednesday and will be sentenced on Jan. 27. Records show Gangemi was sentenced to two years’ probation in June after pleading guilty to similar charges in South Carolina.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city has rejected a request from Zenith Energy to add underground pipes at its Northwest Portland oil terminal along the Willamette River. Zenith had told city officials it would promise not to pass any fossil fuels though the three pipes, only biofuels and a low-toxin chemical used to make polyurethane, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Zenith also said the city would be welcome to inspect the pipes to make sure. But Zenith acknowledged in its application to the city’s franchise office, which controls what is put beneath city streets, that the new pipes under Northwest Front Avenue would be physically capable of transporting fossil fuels. So the city’s Office for Community Technology turned Zenith down, according to a letter it sent Friday to a Zenith official and an attorney for the company. Zenith has been contentious in Portland because tar sands crude oil from Canada is transported by train through Portland neighborhoods to the firm’s terminal on the Willamette. There, it is unloaded, stored and loaded onto ships for export, primarily to other West Coast ports. The firm didn’t comply with its promise to Oregon safety regulators to conduct a safety drill using tar sands oil, the newspaper reported in April. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a statement he supports the decision to deny Zenith the pipes.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nUpper Darby: A hazmat team responded a halfway house this week after a resident received an order of uranium through the mail. Authorities said no charges will be filed because the shipment was legal and posed no health threat. Upper Darby police said the Harwood House resident ordered two grams of powdered uranium for $12 from a Michigan company. It was in powder form and sealed inside a glass vial within a cardboard box when it was delivered Monday afternoon. The halfway house screens all incoming packages and found the powder. They notified authorities, who determined the substance was Uranium 238 – a material that can be shipped through the mail. It’s unknown why the resident ordered the uranium. Authorities said the substance posed no health threat.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Lottery said sports betting revenue in the state is at less than half the projected numbers. The Providence Journal reported the Twin River sportsbook has made $3.1 million through Oct. 19, less than half the $6.9 million projected for the first quarter of the fiscal year. The state gets 51% of the money from sports betting. Rhode Island’s budget assumes $22.7 million in sports betting revenue for the fiscal year that ends next June. The lottery reported that legal sports betting has been growing overall since it launched in November 2019. The total amount bet in September was 75% higher than last December. A separate Department of Revenue analysis that incorporates seasonal variations suggested sports betting profits are on target at least through the end of September.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Authorities are searching for a dognapper and a missing Bichon Frise worth about $10,000 that was snatched from a home. Citing the Greenville County sheriff’s office, news outlets report the dog named Leah is a 4-year-old “breeding champion” who went missing on Oct. 13. The sheriff’s office said Leah’s microchip was scanned shortly afterward at a Petco in Simpsonville, about 14 miles southeast of Greenville. Police released a photo of a woman who was seen wheeling the 11-pound dog into the pet store. Deputies are asking anyone with information on the case to contact authorities.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A Federal Election Commission report showed South Dakota’s Democratic Party’s federal campaign committee owes nearly $47,000 in debts and obligations and has a negative balance of about $8,600. The party owes nearly $12,000 to The Sutton Group, a computer consulting company in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Rapid City Journal reported about $5,800 is owed to the Sioux Falls Convention Center. Earlier this year, the FEC revealed that it had audited the party committee’s finances for the years 2015 and 2016 and found several problems, including failing to disclose debts and obligations to vendors. The state party has closed its offices in Sioux Falls and Rapid City, with its staff working remotely.\n\nTennessee\n\nCrossville:One of the tallest treehouses in the world has burned down. News outlets reported the 97-foot-tall, 10-story treehouse caught fire and quickly burned down Tuesday night in Crossville. No injuries were reported. Cumberland County Fire/Rescue officials said the cause of the fire is under investigation. The treehouse was built by Horace Burgess, an architect-turned-minister. He told news outlets that God commanded him to build the sprawling treehouse as a means of ministry. It took him about 19 years to build it with salvaged woods scraps and recycled metal. The structure spanned across several trees and was a tourist destination until the fire marshal deemed it a public safety hazard. News outlets said the treehouse has been vacant since 2012 and was frequented by vandals.\n\nTexas\n\nAbilene:The Abilene Zoo’s jaguar Estrella, who escaped in 2017, has been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and is receiving hospice care. A bone marrow test indicated the 4-year-old jaguar has chronic myeloid leukemia, the zoo said in a social media update. A high white blood cell count during routine blood work initially revealed a problem, prompting further tests. Estrella’s condition is complicated by hyperviscosity syndrome, which causes the blood to thicken. Symptoms can include headaches, vertigo, eye problems and even seizures, said zoo veterinarian Dr. Stephanie Carle. She added Estrella’s prognosis “is not good.” The veterinary staff is consulting an oncologist about possible treatment options. Meanwhile, the zoo staff will continue to monitor Estrella’s quality of life. Estrella, who is no longer on exhibit, escaped her exhibit in May 2017 and was found perched on the spider monkey exhibit. One monkey was injured and had to be euthanized. An investigation revealed that Estrella’s small size, compared to other big cats for whom the enclosure was designed, enabled her to get beneath the cable and netting atop a 12-foot rock wall. A male jaguar named Sonries that the zoo acquired in late March is rotating onto display more often, and the zoo also is home to a jaguar named Luna, Estrella’s sister.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A retired couple in Utah spends five mornings a week teaching a free Tai Chi class to members of the city’s homeless population, encouraging them to find community and stability in their lives. Bernie and Marita Hart began teaching the class three years ago after moving to Utah. The Harts said their first class had one participant, but now more than 60 people regularly crowd the downtown library’s front lawn to practice the ancient martial art. There’s a clear demand for such programming. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Utah’s homeless population has steadily increased in the last three years. State officials have cited increasing housing costs, stagnant wage growth and the opioid epidemic as possible causes. Participants said the exercise has helped them make friends and relax.\n\nVermont\n\nNewport: The City Council voted 3-1 on Monday in favor of an ordinance to allow ATVs on its streets next year. The trial period will run from May to October. Mayor Paul Monette said he thinks allowing ATVs will help attract visitors and boost the city’s economy. WCAX-TV reportded that supporters said they are excited to prove that they are responsible ATV riders. Scott Jenness, the president of the Borderline ATV Club, said he feels that ATV riders will respect the opportunity that they have been given and will follow the rules of the road. Opponents said they worry that ATVs are too loud and dangerous.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The city’s top prosecutor and the state’s attorney general said Norfolk can relocate a Confederate monument despite a state law barring the removal of war memorials. The two filed a motion Tuesday seeking to dismiss a city lawsuit that said the state law infringes on its right to free speech. Norfolk Commonwealth’s Attorney Greg Underwood and Attorney General Mark Herring said they don’t believe the law applies to Norfolk’s 80-foot 24-meter) monument and they wouldn’t try to enforce it. The 1904 law initially applied to counties and was expanded in 1997. The city’s monument was erected in 1907. Herring has previously issued an opinion saying the law didn’t apply retroactively. What happens next with the monument wasn’t immediately clear. The city attorney said his office is reviewing the filings.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: Crews are trying to clear a large logjam that’s threatening to damage a major local highway near Everett. KOMO reported that Tuesday’s floodwaters sent logs speeding down the Snohomish River, and now they are clogging the waterway near Highway 2. The floating tree trunks are putting pressure on the pilings that hold up the roadway. Crews from the state Department of Transportation are working to clear out the logs before they cause significant damage. One lane of eastbound Highway 2 is closed between Everett and Snohomish, and it will stay closed until the work is done.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWilliamson: Williamson Memorial Hospital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Monday in federal bankruptcy court. Williamson-based Mingo Health Partners LLC bought the 76-bed hospital from Franklin, Tennessee-based Community Healthcare Systems in 2018. The filing lists at least 50 creditors, including $651,000 owed to CHS and $486,000 to Huntington-based Ohio Valley Physicians, an emergency department staffing company based in Huntington. The filing lists the hospital’s assets and liabilities both at between $1 million and $10 million.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources board has approved new regulations that change how the department measures bacterial contamination in water bodies. Currently, the DNR measures the amount of fecal coliform in water bodies to determine the level of contamination. The new regulations require the department to measure the amount of e. coli in the water to determine contamination levels. DNR officials said they must make the switch to remain eligible for federal grants for beach bacteria monitoring. Wastewater plants will receive new permit requirements for e. coli levels. DNR officials believe 146 out of 356 plants might have to increase disinfection efforts to comply but said financial assistance will be available. The board approved the change on a unanimous voice vote during a meeting on Wednesday.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Not all furloughed workers offered their jobs back plan to return to work at two coal mines. Mine mechanic Christopher Orchard was among over 500 workers furloughed when West Virginia-based Blackjewel filed for bankruptcy July 1. Another coal company hired Orchard within two weeks. Many other Blackjewel employees also found other work. On Friday, a subsidiary of Alabama-based FM Coal bought the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines. Orchard said he got an offer to return to work at Belle Ayr. Orchard told the Gillette News-Record he was offered a 4% raise but the pay is still better at Cloud Peak Energy. FM Coal subsidiary Eagle Specialty Materials promised to pay wages owed from before the bankruptcy but Orchard said he’s still waiting to collect his back pay.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/14/bear-crop-circles-corpse-blood-subway-cameras-news-around-states/118819930/", "title": "Bear crop circles, corpse blood: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: A lawsuit has been filed that could decide the fate of a Confederate monument that has stood in a square at the center of a nearly all-Black city for 115 years. WSFA-TV reports the Macon County Commission has filed suit against both the local and state chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, arguing that the county owns the property where the statue is located and wants title to the plot. While records show the county gave the land to the Confederate heritage group for use as a park for white people in 1906, the suit contends the property belongs to the county because the county’s action was illegal. Macon County, which was joined in the suit by three Black residents, said it is willing to negotiate with the Daughters of the Confederacy. If someone comes forward, they could settle and give the statue to the group. The statue has been the subject of periodic demonstrations for decades in Tuskegee, which is almost all Black and the home of Tuskegee University. The nation’s first Black military pilots trained in the city during World War II. Protesters tried and failed to pull down the monument in the 1960s. In July, City Council member Johnny Ford and another man used an electric saw to cut into the statue, but the damage was later repaired by a crew hired by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawmaker requested and has received an excusal from the state Senate until mid-January, citing the challenges of traveling to Juneau from Anchorage after she was suspended from flying on Alaska Airlines earlier this year. Republican Sen. Lora Reinbold on Thursday requested the excusal from Saturday through Jan. 15. She said she was unaware of any other airline flying to the state capital during that period. Juneau is accessible by air or water, including via the state-run ferry system. Lawmakers are in their third special session of the year, due to end Tuesday. The Legislature has yet to finalize a dividend amount to pay residents this year. Alaska Airlines said in an April statement that Reinbold was not allowed to fly with the carrier “for her continued refusal to comply with employee instruction regarding the current mask policy.” Reinbold – has been critical of masking rules, including at the Capitol – said she had been in compliance and called the ban political. She said the ferry schedule is limited, and she doesn’t want to hold up legislative proceedings if she cannot reach Juneau “in a timely fashion.” After her suspension, Reinbold drove through part of Canada and took a ferry to reach the capital, a two-day trip. If there is another special session, she said it should be held in a community connected to Alaska’s main road system.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State auditors say public safety may be put at risk by reporting gaps and a backlog in the database that Arizona uses for conducting background checks of people seeking certain jobs or occupational licenses and for helping prosecutors and judges decide whether defendants should get plea bargains or lenient sentences. The problems exist in the state’s central depository of criminal history records, a database maintained by the Arizona Department of Public Safety and updated with case reports from law enforcement agencies and courts, the Auditor General’s Office said in a report released Friday. The auditors said the database didn’t include 17% of a sampling of 103 felony offense records from four Arizona law enforcement agencies, and 40% of a sampling of 30 felony offense records in the database were missing dispositions, such as whether a case was dropped or the defendant was convicted. The database is important because criminal justice agencies use it “when making decisions that could help deter further offenses, such as decisions regarding plea bargains, and sentencing repeat offenders,” and the records also are checked to see whether people seeking jobs in fields such as teaching and child care have criminal histories, the auditors’ report said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A former state senator said Monday that he would run for the Republican nomination for secretary of state, becoming the second to challenge the incumbent in next year’s GOP primary. Former Arkansas Sen. Eddie Joe Williams announced his bid for the seat currently held by Republican Secretary of State John Thurston, who was first elected in 2018. Thurston already faced a primary challenge from state Rep. Mark Lowery. Joshua Price, a former Pulaski County election commissioner, is the only Democrat running for the seat. Williams said he was running to “make sure our elections are fair, honest, and always transparent.” The former Cabot mayor was elected to the state Senate in 2010 and was the chamber’s first Republican majority leader after the GOP won a Senate majority in 2012. Williams left the Legislature after former President Donald Trump appointed him in 2017 to be the federal representative to the Southern States Energy Board. The nonprofit organization focuses on energy issues in 16 Southern states.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America installed its first openly transgender bishop in a service held in San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral on Saturday. The Rev. Megan Rohrer will lead one of the church’s 65 synods, overseeing nearly 200 congregations in Northern California and northern Nevada. “My call is … to be up to the same messy, loving things I was up to before,” Rohrer told worshippers. “But mostly, if you’ll let me, and I think you will, my hope is to love you and, beyond that, to love what you love.” Rohrer was elected in May to serve a six-year term as bishop of the Sierra Pacific Synod. “I step into this role because a diverse community of Lutherans in Northern California and Nevada prayerfully and thoughtfully voted to do a historic thing,” Rohrer said in a statement. “My installation will celebrate all that is possible when we trust God to shepherd us forward.” Rohrer, who uses the pronoun “they,” previously served as pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in San Francisco and a chaplain coordinator for the city’s police department and also helped minister to the city’s homeless and LGTBQ community. Rohrer, married with two children, became one of seven LGBTQ pastors accepted by the progressive Evangelical Lutheran church in 2010. The church is one of the largest Christian denominations in the U.S.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: A man convicted of vehicular homicide for hitting a car during a Facebook livestream that showed him speeding on a highway has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Adams County District Attorney’s Office said 44-year-old Bryan Kirby was sentenced Friday. A jury convicted Kirby of the vehicular homicide charge in July, as well as of reckless manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident causing death. Kirby was accused of driving as fast as 167 mph at night on a highway near Denver in October 2018 while making comments to viewers about his speed. At the end, he rapidly crossed from the left lane to the right and crashed into a sedan from behind at 120 mph, prosecutors said. Kirby fled the crash. The driver of the sedan died at the scene. “Mr. Kirby’s unconscionable and reckless actions took a life and destroyed a family,” District Attorney Brian Mason said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: About 300 refugees from Afghanistan are expected to arrive in the state in the coming weeks and months as immigrant advocacy groups work to find permanent homes for them, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and advocates said Monday. Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and resettlement workers anticipate that refugees will begin arriving in large numbers in communities across the U.S., perhaps as early as next week, after clearing security checks and other vetting. Some 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted to the United States under a program called “Operation Allies Welcome,” including translators, drivers and others who helped the U.S. military during the 20-year war and who fear reprisals by the Taliban, who seized power last month. “We owe these Afghan allies the safety and escape they need from murder and torture they face and their families face in Afghanistan,” Blumenthal said at a news conference with advocates in New Haven. “They sided with us. They went into combat with our troops. They protected them and our diplomats. They now have targets on their backs.” Blumenthal said he is pushing Congress to approve financial aid for resettlement services, including housing, job placement, clothing and other needs. He said the cost could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Three teenagers were hospitalized with injuries incurred at Funland on the the city’s boardwalk Sunday night, according to Sussex County Emergency Medical Services. Two patients were stable and sent to Beebe Healthcare, and one was taken to Christiana Hospital with a head injury, said Glenn Marshall, public information officer for Sussex County EMS. Rehoboth Beach Police Department later reported that the injured were two girls, 14 and 15 years old, and one 16-year-old boy. The two girls were released from Beebe, but Rehoboth Beach police said the boy was still in serious condition at Christiana as of 3 p.m. Monday. The incident happened in the area of the Superflip 360 about 7:45 p.m., according to a statement from Funland Personnel Manager Chris Darr. The injured guest was not riding the attraction, he said. “Initial efforts have determined that the injuries result from the individuals be struck by debris caused by an air storage tank failure,” a Rehoboth Beach police press release said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Foo Fighters’ performance at the 9:30 Club last week came with breaking news: Frontman Dave Grohl told the crowd that an exact replica of the original version of the venue is in the works, WUSA-TV reports. The special surprise show, part of a reopening week celebration at the 9:30 Club, was one of its first in-person shows since the coronavirus pandemic began. Grohl, who grew up in northern Virginia, played some of his earliest shows as a teenager in punk bands at the 9:30 Club. But that was the old 9:30 Club, he said Thursday, reminiscing about the old days and describing its 199-person capacity as intimate. “That was our church,” Grohl said in a video provided by I.M.P., which owns the venue. “That’s where we all played first. That’s where R.E.M. played first; that’s where the Chili Peppers played first; that’s where Nirvana played first ... magic happened in that room.” Grohl said an exact replica of the old club will be coming to 2047 9th Street NW, where The Satellite Room used to be. “For all you people who never got to see the old 9:30 Club, you’ll get to see that ... next door someday,” Grohl said on stage. “And let me tell you, if it’s the same vibe as the old 9:30 Club, you’ll see some real magic.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A Miami Beach apartment building owned by the mayor of the adjacent town where a condominium collapsed in June has given his tenants 45 days to vacate the building so extensive repairs can be completed. The lease termination letter from Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said workers have been waiting for the city of Miami Beach to issue permits to repair the damage caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017. He said he hopes the final permit will be issued imminently so work can be completed to the front of the building as well as the elevator. “We regret that this work will create potentially dangerous conditions for residents,” Burkett’s letter said. In addition, he said the Lois Apartments will also undergo the required 40-year inspection early, due to the Champlain Towers South collapse. That building was in the midst of repairs found during a 40-year inspection when it suddenly collapsed in the middle of the night, drawing new scrutiny of the structural integrity of buildings throughout the region. Burkett informed tenants they will need to leave by Oct. 24 but can return once renovations are completed in several months. Meanwhile, in court Friday, a judge was told that many personal belongings such as jewelry and photos cannot be recovered from the Champlain Towers collapse. “A vast majority of the personal property is completely destroyed,” said Michael Goldberg, an attorney appointed as receiver to handle the Champlain Towers’ finances. Many of the 17 safes found at the site, he said, “are cracked open like an egg.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDunwoody: An explosion rocked an apartment building in suburban Atlanta on Sunday, causing the three-story structure to partially collapse and leaving four people with minor injuries, authorities said. The cause of the explosion was unknown, but a local utility had received a call from a resident about a strong odor of gas shortly before the midday blast, according to DeKalb County Fire and Rescue Deputy Fire Chief Melvin Carter. He said 90% of the building had been searched, and officials were in the process of shoring up the rest of the complex so rescuers could continue searching for anyone who might be trapped. Fire Capt. Jaeson Daniels had said two people were unaccounted for and may have been in one of three apartments that had completely collapsed. Rescuers hadn’t been able to enter those apartments due to instability of the overall structure. But WSB-TV reports, citing DeKalb fire officials, that the two people were eventually found safe. A helicopter and drones circled above the structure as the local Red Cross began canvassing residents to see who might need help finding accommodations. The partially collapsed building and several others nearby were evacuated. Residents were told that Monday was the earliest they could return to their homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge has given preliminary approval to a settlement in a lawsuit by inmates who allege state officials mishandled the pandemic and failed to protect them from COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons and jails. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jill Otake said the settlement between the state and the inmates is “fair, adequate, and reasonable.” Both sides agreed to the settlement, which establishes a five-person panel to oversee public health in correctional facilities and other measures to improve sanitation, hygiene and medical monitoring. The settlement also directs officials to make vaccines available and to “promote and educate inmates and staff regarding COVID-19 vaccination.” The class-action lawsuit was meant to provide resources to improve safety during the pandemic, said Eric Seitz, an attorney for the inmates. He said Friday that he’ll pursue damages in separate, future legal action. Situations described in court documents included ailing detainees kept near a bathroom flooded with urine and feces. Their requests to use the bathroom were frequently denied, forcing them to urinate in their drinking cups, according to the documents. Other descriptions the judge noted include an inmate with lupus who contracted the coronavirus but received little to no medical care and ended up with serious kidney damage.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the city Monday morning during a visit by President Joe Biden to express their displeasure about his coronavirus plan, the election and other issues. Biden came to Boise as part of a swing through three Western states to promote his administration’s use of a wartime law to aid in wildfire preparedness, survey wildfire damage and push his economic agenda. He arrived at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise late Monday morning to meet with fire officials and Gov. Brad Little, a Republican. Lisa Mitchell, 65, of Middleton, Idaho, said she was protesting because she doesn’t believe the 2020 election was valid. “I’m here to support Trump and stand for freedom,” said Mitchell, who was wearing a “Trump won 2020” sticker. “He is in there illegally.” Though some of former President Donald Trump’s most fervent supporters believe his continued claims that the presidential election was stolen, there is no evidence of widespread fraud, and Republican and Democratic election officials certified the election as valid. Courts have also repeatedly rejected lawsuits claiming the election was tainted. About a half-dozen Boise police officers were stationed at the entrance to the National Interagency Fire Center, with other law enforcement officers patrolling the area on motorcycle.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Chicago Park District said it plans to put life rings along the Lake Michigan waterfront – but only in areas that are considered safe to swim, upsetting the mother of a college student who drowned off a pier. “I’m infuriated,“ said Maria Diaz, whose son, Miguel Cisneros, drowned last month in the Rogers Park neighborhood. “Don’t they have kids; aren’t they mothers, fathers? And how would they feel if (it were) their son?” Diaz said. “Because, believe me, you never think about this until it hits home. And it can happen to anyone.” Cisneros, 19, drowned Aug. 22, a few weeks before his planned departure for Columbia University in New York. A vigil for him was held Tuesday night. Rogers Park residents have put life rings on the pier near where Cisneros died, but they have been removed by the park district, the Chicago Tribune reports. Instead, the district is discussing ways to restrict access to the piers while installing life rings elsewhere where it’s “safe to swim,” general counsel Timothy King said. At a Wednesday meeting, a law professor said the park district could be exposing itself to liability if life rings are placed in other locations. Water safety specialist Gerry Dworkin said the rings can be hard to throw accurately from a beach, though they can be effective if dropped to a struggling swimmer near a pier.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: About 300 Purdue University students and employees face disciplinary action for failing to comply with the school’s mandatory coronavirus testing for those who haven’t provided proof of COVID-19 vaccination. That includes 84 students on the West Lafayette campus who have been notified a second time that they haven’t completed required surveillance testing three weeks into the fall semester, Purdue officials said. A third violation could result in suspension from the university as soon as this week. About 210 employees have received an initial written warning for not being tested. Those employees face disciplinary action up to and including termination. Purdue is requiring surveillance testing, which could be as frequently as each week, for any students or employees who’ve not submitted documentation of their COVID-19 shots. About 82% of the some 55,000 students and employees on the West Lafayette campus have submitted vaccination proof, according to the university’s tracking. Indiana University has mandated that all students and employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations unless they are granted exemptions or face dismissal from classes or their jobs. The latest figures released by IU show 88% compliance, but school officials haven’t yet released any information about disciplinary actions.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Polk County will purchase Sleepy Hollow Sports Park, county officials and the park’s longtime owners announced in a news release over the weekend. The 76-acre facility opened in 1994 on Des Moines’ east side. Sleepy Hollow is a central Iowa favorite for tubing and sledding in the winter and for Renaissance fairs, festivals, comedy shows and concerts in the summer. Each fall, Sleepy Hollow’s Renaissance Faire Park turns into a Halloween attraction, and the surrounding forest becomes a haunted trail. Taylor Swift once even performed there early in her career. Rick and Mary Flatt will continue to run all operations through the end of 2022. In 2023, Polk County Conservation will operate the winter sports facility. The Flatts will run camping operations and special events, including the Kosmic Kingdom music festival, the Renaissance Faires and the Scream Park. Polk County will run all operations beginning in 2024. With the announcement, the county pledged to raise millions of dollars to fund improvements at the park, including a full-service campground, ski lodge improvements, new cross-country and snowshoe trails, enhanced fishery options, and a conversion of an existing pond to an ice skating rink in the winter.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Kansas State Fair officials judging the 4-H entomology entries last week discovered an invasive insect that prompted quarantines elsewhere. Fair Board member Gregg Hadley the student who caught the spotted lanternfly didn’t know it had prompted quarantines in at least 45 counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to try to stop its spread. Hadley, who is director for extension at Kansas State’s Research and Extension, said it’s not clear how the invasive bug made it to Kansas, but it may have hitched a ride on a camper. The insect that was first found in Pennsylvania about 10 years ago feeds on some 70 different plant species and can cause plants to die by depositing excretions on them that can grow mold and block photosynthesis. One of the fair’s entomology judges was familiar with the insect and a requirement that it be reported to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Federal officials are expected to try to learn how the insect reached Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Wright: The city plans to return artifacts on loan after closing the James A. Ramage Civil War Museum forever. The City Council unanimously passed a municipal order Sept. 1 to dissolve the museum’s volunteer board, close the museum and confirm Mayor Dave Hatter’s prior order of closure. The Behringer-Crawford Museum, which focuses on Northern Kentucky history, has been called in by the city to help with what to do with all the artifacts, including Sons of the Union Veterans medals. The closed museum, in a house at Battery Hooper, was named for a retired Northern Kentucky University history professor who led efforts to preserve the key Civil War defensive position. The museum helped tell the story of one of the first Black brigades in the Civil War and the defense of Cincinnati. “We just want to make sure everyone gets the artifacts back if they want them,” said Laurie Risch, executive director of the Behringer-Crawford. Jeannine Kreinbrink, an archaeologist for the Behringer-Crawford and a former James A. Ramage Civil War Museum board member, will be assisting with the review of artifacts, Risch said. “We’re just happy to be able to help,” Risch said. “Nobody is happy to see a museum closed.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The head of the Louisiana State Police says he wants to know why 67% of his agency’s uses of force in recent years have been directed at Black people and would welcome a U.S. Justice Department “pattern and practice” probe into potential racial profiling if that is deemed necessary. “If the community is concerned about that, obviously I am concerned about that,” Col. Lamar Davis said in an interview Friday. “I’m a Black male. I don’t want to feel like I’m going to be stopped and thrown across a car just because of that, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way.” Davis’ comments came a day after an Associated Press investigation identified at least a dozen cases over the past decade in which state police troopers or their bosses ignored or concealed evidence of beatings, deflected blame and impeded efforts to root out misconduct. It included several newly obtained body camera videos of violent arrests that had been locked away for years. “It challenged me emotionally, not just from a law enforcement perspective but as a citizen,” Davis said of viewing the footage. “But I have to put my emotions in check and understand what my duties are. I don’t want the community thinking we’re going to ‘get them.’ Those are the types of things I’m trying to get to the root of.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Two companies that manufacture coronavirus testing supplies in the state say they’re ready to step up to meet demand following President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine and testing mandates for companies with more than 100 workers. Puritan Medical Products makes swabs used for testing, and Abbott Laboratories makes test kits in Maine. Both furloughed or laid off workers before the surge in virus cases tied to the delta variant. “We are monitoring the situation, and are ready to ramp up based on government orders as we did before,” Puritan said in a statement. Abbott spokeswoman Kim Modory told the Portland Press Herald that the company’s Maine workforce “continues to deliver millions of rapid tests at a time when our country needs testing, particularly rapid testing, to manage this next phase of the pandemic.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Cruise ship passengers left the city’s port for the first time in 18 months Sunday, a celebratory moment after putting in place plenty of COVID-19 safety precautions for guests. As a steel drummer played in the port terminal, the Carnival Pride welcomed 1,500 passengers for a weeklong voyage to the Bahamas, The Baltimore Sun reports. All passengers had to be fully vaccinated, with some exceptions for children under 12 and people with documented medical conditions. Those unvaccinated equal less than 5% of the passenger total, Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy said. All passengers also had to get a negative coronavirus test within three days of boarding, and guests 2 and up must wear face masks in elevators and certain indoor areas. While passenger Donna Ford, 60, of Pittsburgh, wasn’t thrilled with the mask mandate, she was still happy to sail: “I don’t like it, but if that’s what it takes for me to cruise, then I’m OK with it.” The Pride, operating at 70% capacity, is Carnival’s ninth ship to welcome passengers back since the pandemic halted cruise operations in March 2020, Duffy said. Port preparations were extensive, port Executive Director William P. Doyle said. Port officials also contracted with a transportation firm in case sick passengers must be removed from the ship during the trip.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDanvers: A tourist farm called police on a Black couple it accused of stealing six apples and is now apologizing after the family went public in a blog post. Manikka Bowman and Jeff Myers said in the post that they visited Connors Farm in Danvers on Labor Day, spending more than $100 on admission, apple picking, food and drinks. But the couple from Cambridge said they were confronted by farm staff over six apples that did not fit into the prepaid apple-picking bag. They said the overflow fruits were in their child’s stroller, and they intended to pay for them at the farm store, where they also planned to buy cider donuts. Bowman, who is a vice chair of her city’s school committee, said a security guard instead searched her purse, and the manager called police when the couple demanded the farm owner’s contact information. The responding officer, the couple said, accused them of “playing the race card.” “By jumping straight to an assumption of theft, Connors Farm created a scene, harassing us and causing our 7-year-old to burst into tears, anguish that lasted well into the evening,” the couple wrote. “We are left wondering, was it ever about the apples?” The farm, in a Facebook post Thursday, said it apologized to the family and will ensure staffers “undergo diversity, equity and inclusion training.”\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: Advocacy groups are urging the Biden administration to help provide safe drinking water in a low-income, predominantly Black city in southwestern Michigan where tests repeatedly have shown excessive lead levels in the water supply. In a petition filed Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, about 20 organizations said local and state officials have not responded adequately or quickly enough since the contamination was discovered three years ago in Benton Harbor. “It’s urgent that the EPA intervene to give this community access to water that won’t harm our health, especially our children’s health,” said the Rev. Edward Pinkney, president of the Benton Harbor Community Water Council. EPA spokesman Tim Carroll said Friday that the agency was “carefully considering the issues and concerns” raised in the petition. “We are closely monitoring lead-related health issues in Benton Harbor,” Carroll said, adding that the city was among 10 communities that participated in discussions with the EPA as it reviews changes to federal lead and copper regulations made by the Trump administration. The petition was filed one day after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for spending $20 million in Benton Harbor to replace nearly 6,000 service lines – most suspected of containing lead – within five years.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Black bear sightings are on the rise, as this summer’s drought has made it harder for the animals to find the food they need to prepare for hibernation. This time of year, Minnesota’s black bears are trying to eat as many as 10,000 to 15,000 calories a day. They start to feed nocturnally and for longer periods of time on nutrition-rich acorns, hazelnuts and berries – food sources that are harder to find because of the drought. Bears are now increasingly seeking out backyard bird feeders and other food sources. “There have been a lot of anecdotal reports of bears all over the place this year,” Andy Tri, acting bear project leader with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, told Minnesota Public Radio News. The state’s bear population has remained stable for nearly a decade at between 12,000 and 15,000 statewide, Tri said. However, their range is expanding, especially into the northern Twin Cities suburbs, he said. “So people who grew up there and didn’t grow up seeing bears are now seeing bears regularly,” Tri said. He said while it’s important to be respectful of bears, there’s no need to be afraid. He advises making sure the bear has a clear path to leave the yard, then watching it from inside the house: “Just take a moment to appreciate it. And then just make sure to give bears their space because they’re wild animals.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Six Black farmworkers say in a lawsuit that their former employer brought white laborers from South Africa to do the same jobs they were doing and that the farm has been violating federal law by paying the white immigrants more for the same type of work. Mississippi Center for Justice and Southern Migrant Legal Services filed the federal lawsuit last week on behalf of the six workers against Pitts Farm Partnership, which grows cotton, soybeans and corn in the Mississippi Delta’s Sunflower County. The lawsuit said the farm violated regulations of a foreign worker visa program, which requires equal treatment of U.S. workers and their immigrant counterparts. It seeks an unspecified amount in damages, including money the U.S. workers say they were shorted because of the uneven pay scale. Four of the plaintiffs – Andrew Johnson, Wesley Reed, Gregory Strong and Richard Strong – said they did agricultural work from February through November, and Pitts Farm Partnership usually paid them the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, with $8.25 an hour for weekend work. Two had been paid $9 an hour since 2018. The farm paid the white workers from South Africa $9.87 an hour in 2014, and that rate increased most years until it reached $11.83 an hour in 2020, the lawsuit said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A member of Washington University’s student government placed nearly 3,000 U.S. flags meant to commemorate victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in trash bags, prompting an investigation by the school. The university’s chapter of College Republicans had placed the 2,977 flags on Mudd Field at the school’s campus in St. Louis to honor Saturday’s 20th anniversary of the attacks. Fadel Alkilani, a vice president of finance for the Student Union, acknowledged he removed the flags Saturday and put them in plastic bags as part of a protest but was interrupted when another student began recording video of him. After a video was posted on social media, Alkilani said in a statement that he intended to leave the bags on Mudd Field along with statistics detailing the human cost of Sept. 11 since the attacks. He said the flag display did not mention Islamophobia in the U.S. or civilian casualties in the Middle East caused by the U.S. military, The Kansas City Star reports. Washington University Chancellor Andrew Martin said in a statement that removing the flags was “reprehensible” and was seen as “a personal affront by many, at WashU and beyond, and as an affront to the ideals of our institution.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana Youth Action, Forward Montana Foundation and Montana Public Interest Research Group are suing Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen over state laws they say reduce youth voter turnout. Plaintiffs are challenging Senate Bill 169, which changes voter identification requirements and limits the use of a student ID; House Bill 506, which prohibits ballot distribution to people who will but do not yet meet age and residency requirements; and House Bill 176, which eliminates Election Day voter registration. The complaint was filed in Yellowstone County’s 13th Judicial District Court. “Each of these laws unconstitutionally burdens Montanans’ fundamental right to vote, both subverting the will of Montana voters and upending norms that Montana covers have come to rely on – for no reason, let alone a compelling one,” plaintiffs allege in their complaint. “None of these laws accomplish a compelling state interest and each violates the Montana Constitution.” The Montana Secretary of State’s office released the following response: “The voters of Montana spoke when they elected a Secretary of State that promised improved election integrity with voter ID and voter-registration deadlines, and we will work hard to defend those measures.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Four students are suing Creighton University over its requirement to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to remain enrolled, arguing that some of them “feel coerced” to violate their religious beliefs against abortion. The lawsuit filed in Douglas County District Court also alleges that some of the four students have medical conditions that make vaccines not recommended for them. The university in Omaha is affiliated with the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church. It mandated that all students get vaccinated in August, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to a vaccine mandated by Pfizer, according to local news reports. The university had previously allowed medical exemptions to its vaccine requirements but not religious ones. The lawsuit says all four students have “religious objections” to COVID-19 vaccines because “the vaccines were developed and/or tested using abortion derived fetal cell lines.” Attorney Robert Sullivan said in a statement that a Catholic university should not place students in the position of having to violate the church’s teachings. The Vatican declared in December that it is “morally acceptable” for Roman Catholics to receive COVID-19 vaccines based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: An analysis of K-12 proficiency exams and state financial reports found Nevada’s students are doing worse on most tests than they did in 2000, when the state spent 79% less on each pupil. Meanwhile, the state continues to land on the wrong end of several nationwide school system rankings, including state-by-state comparisons of per-pupil spending and student-teacher ratios. As recently as 2019, Nevada ranked dead last in at least one test-based survey of K-12 academic achievement. Critics have raised plenty of pointed questions about exactly what such exams measure and how much they really say about the Silver State’s pupils. Yet most politicians and education advocates agree test scores are going to continue to play a key role in shaping, among other things, classroom curriculums, teacher performance evaluations and federal funding opportunities. Annual results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation’s Report Card, show Nevada’s elementary and middle students have made modest gains in writing and math proficiency over the past two decades. But student performance on three other, better known tests – the SAT, ACT and state-administered SBAC – has trended, sometimes dramatically, in the opposite direction.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has been awarded a $1.8 million grant to study how and why coastal hazards like excessive flooding are causing roads to crack and crumble. “We’re trying to better understand the causal links of not only the extreme events but also the gradual changes in sea level rise that can increase the rate of damage to pavement and trigger failures that require major road reconstruction,” Jo Sias, professor of civil and environmental engineering, said in a news release. “We’re looking at storm surges and wave action but also factors like the amount of time the pavement is under water.” UNH researchers and their partners at the University of South Alabama and the Rockingham Planning Commission will develop a number of hydrodynamic models that can analyze fluids in motion. The information will be valuable to state and town officials to assess the impact of sea level rise on the longevity of coastal roadways and help implement practical alternatives for communities to protect the infrastructure. The study will focus on the northeast coast of New Hampshire and the southeast coast of Alabama.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHerald: Farmers say they’re fed up with nuisance wildlife and the crop circle-esque damage bears are dealing to their fields. Phil Brodhecker said bears are literally eating his profits, as they tend to roll around and flatten plants when they partake of his corn. The damage in some of his fields adds up to 80% to 90%, Brodhecker said. In others, it’s only about 2% to 5%, but there is damage “in every field.” The situation will only get worse for him and other farmers due to New Jersey’s policy not to have an authorized bear hunting season this year, Brodhecker said. The hunt will be skipped because there is no Comprehensive Black Bear Management Policy in effect, which is required for one to proceed. But the bears aren’t the only ones causing damage, Brodhecker said. The deer are also in on it. The bears leave behind their signature “crop circles,” while the deer “graze” through most fields, munching on blossoms and buds beginning in the spring. Shoulder-high weeds have taken over where sunflowers were stunted by deer biting off buds. The Brodhecker family was one of the first commercial sunflower seed operations in New Jersey, producing birdseed packages for the state Audubon Society. “We have too many bears and deer,” he said following a tour of his Hampton farmland, showing the damage caused.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: As the United States battles COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, a new study co-authored by a New Mexico State University researcher examines how COVID-19 infections in social circles may influence vaccine willingness. In the study, Jagdish Khubchandani, public health sciences professor at NMSU, and a team of researchers conducted a national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine willingness among American adults based on coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths within their friend and family groups. “Education, race and political ideology are the major factors, and we need more efforts to reach sections of our society that remain hesitant about the vaccines,” said Khubchandani, who has conducted multiple studies on the topic since late 2020. The study, published last week in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, included 1,602 participants,about 79% of whom reported receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The remaining participants indicated they planned to get the vaccine (10%) or would not (11%). Overall, participants who did not have a friend or family member infected, hospitalized or die with COVID-19 were at least two times more likely to refuse vaccines, compared to those who had someone in their social networks affected by the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: All of the city’s 472 subway stations are now equipped with security cameras. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Monday that it had installed the last of thousands of cameras at the G line’s Broadway stop. The installation of the cameras has been accelerated over the past year after crime spiked in the subway system during the pandemic, when ridership dropped. Two hundred stations have been outfitted with cameras in the past year, according to the MTA. Subway ridership fell more than 90% during the height of the pandemic and continues to lag far below pre-pandemic levels. An MTA survey in the spring found that crime and harassment were as big a concern as COVID-19 for riders weighing whether to return to the subways, despite the presence of hundreds of additional city police officers deployed to stations. While crime has continued to be an issue, the MTA said the increased number of cameras has helped increase arrests recently by more than 28%. Some of the cameras broadcast in real time to the subway’s security center, while others record locally and can provide footage that can be used in criminal investigations, according to the MTA.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Certain felons who’ve been released from prison or were never incarcerated and who registered to vote recently in North Carolina will remain eligible as litigation over their right to vote continues, the state’s highest court has ruled. The state Supreme Court, in a lawsuit challenging when North Carolina residents convicted of felonies have their voting rights restored, essentially declined to reinstate a order last month that declared any offender no longer behind bars could register. That order would have affected about 56,000 people who were still serving probation, parole or other supervision, according to court records. On Sept. 3, the state Court of Appeals blocked last month’s trial order amid pending litigation filed by civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. Those plaintiffs immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which late Friday declined to block the Court of Appeals order but also declared it would be implemented only going forward. That means felony offenders who registered between Aug. 23 and Sept. 3 – when the trial judges’ order was in place and based solely on that order – can’t be removed from voting rolls and “are legally registered voters” until told otherwise, the Supreme Court wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Authorities said one person was injured in an explosion during a fireworks display in southeast Bismarck at midday Saturday. It created a dense cloud of black smoke that could be seen throughout the city. Bismarck Rural Fire Chief Dustin Theurer said fireworks or an explosive ordnance was the “likely” cause of the explosion. Authorities didn’t immediately offer other details on what happened or where exactly the incident occurred, saying the investigation was ongoing. Firefighters, police and medical professionals responded to the scene shortly before 11:30 a.m., The Bismarck Tribune reports. Roads in the area were closed, and the public was asked to stay away. One person was taken to a hospital with undisclosed injuries, according to the Bismarck Rural Fire Department. The explosion could be heard around the city, and some people reported that it rattled doors. Joshua Watts, who happened to be in the area, said he witnessed more than one blast. “There was an explosion and then another explosion,” he said. “The first one went off … and I actually saw the fireworks blow up.” The explosions touched off grass fires in the area. No buildings were damaged, Theurer said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A second federal lawsuit filed against six local hospital groups, alleging they conspired against their employees by requiring COVID-19 vaccines, has been voluntarily dismissed. It’s the second time the antitrust lawsuit has been filed and then voluntarily dismissed. Among the allegations was that the hospital groups – Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, the Christ Hospital Health Network, Bon Secours Mercy Health, TriHealth, UC Health and St. Elizabeth Healthcare – are requiring employees to be vaccinated even though, according to the lawsuit, there is no increasing spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. “The plan was simple,” the lawsuit said. “If the six large systems stuck together, all the employees would be trapped.” The pandemic and the vaccines created to battle it, the lawsuit alleged, are part of a fraud perpetrated by “government, pharmaceutical (companies), social media, mainstream media, corporate America, healthcare and political parties.” According to data from the Health Collaborative, which tracks daily bed counts at more than 40 hospitals, the number of COVID-19 patients in the region’s hospital and intensive care beds remains on an upward trajectory. The number of COVID-19 patients is at its highest point since January and February.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended the governor commute the death sentence of Julius Jones, who has maintained his innocence in a 1999 killing that has garnered national attention. The five-member board voted 3-1 to recommend Jones’ sentence be commuted to life in prison after board member Scott Williams recused himself because of a professional relationship he had with one of the attorneys who spoke on Jones’ behalf. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt ultimately will decide the fate of Jones, who claims he was framed for the 1999 shooting death of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. “Personally, I believe in death penalty cases there should be no doubts. And put simply, I have doubts about this case,” said Chairman Adam Luck, one of Stitt’s appointees on the board who voted to commute Jones’ sentence. Monday’s vote came after several hours of testimony from members of Howell’s family, prosecutors who tried the case, and attorneys and supporters of Jones. Kelly Doyle, another Stitt appointee who voted in favor of commuting the sentence, said she agreed with Luck and noted there were mitigating factors she considered, including the fact that Jones, now 41, was 19 when Howell was killed during a carjacking. A spokeswoman said Stitt plans to review the recommendation carefully.\n\nOregon\n\nYachats: A man who attempted to jump across a wide cove of frothing water at Cape Perpetua Scenic Area is presumed dead, according to state police. Steve Allen, 67, of Walnut Creek, California, apparently tried to hurdle Devil’s Churn, a narrow boiling inlet just off Highway 101 south of Yachats on the central Oregon coast. Devil’s Churn, a popular stopping point at Cape Perpetua, is a somewhat narrow slice in the coastal basalt rock known for boiling water that kicks up large sprays of waves. “Troopers and emergency personnel responded for a subject who had fallen into the ocean at Devils Churn,” Oregon State Police said in a news release. “Fellow visitors attempted to rescue Allen but were unable to retrieve him from the water.” Allen was last observed by rescue agencies unresponsive prior to losing sight of him, officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard and other responding agencies suspended their search at approximately 6:40 p.m. Allen is presumed to be dead, officials said. OSP was assisted by Lincoln county Sheriff’s Office, Newport Fire Department, Yachats Fire and Rescue and the Coast Guard.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The union that represents corrections officers in Pennsylvania prisons wants a state court to intervene over the governor’s recent mandate that they all get COVID-19 vaccines or submit to weekly coronavirus testing. The six-page Commonwealth Court complaint over a rule Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf announced last month requests that the court issue a preliminary injunction to end mandatory testing unless inmates, visitors and outside vendors are also subject to the requirement. “The entry of a preliminary injunction is necessary in order to maintain the equity” between members of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association “and all other participants in the commonwealth controlled congregate settings, and to further ensure the intent of the order itself,” which is to protect the public from COVID-19, according to the lawsuit filed Friday. “The commonwealth’s failure to apply the ‘vaccinate or weekly test’ rule to all individuals in the congregate setting unnecessarily increases the risk to the health and safety” of union members, the lawsuit claims. Wolf announced a month ago that about 25,000 employees of Pennsylvania’s prisons and state health care and congregate care facilities would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 7 or take weekly tests for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: An estate once famously owned by Claus and Martha von Bulow has sold for $30million. Clarendon Court on Newport’s famed Bellevue Avenue mansion row was sold late Thursday. The buyer’s name wasn’t disclosed. The grand estate on more than 7 acres with sweeping ocean views was built in 1904 by the architect Horace Trumbauer. The sale easily tops the $17.75 million paid by singer Taylor Swift in 2013 for her home in Westerly, which is considered the highest price fetched by a home in the state. Clarendon Court was where heiress Martha “Sunny” von Bulow slipped into a coma in 1980 from which she never woke up. Claus Von Bulow, a Danish-born socialite, was convicted but later acquitted of trying to kill her to gain her fortune so he could live with his soap opera actress mistress. His two trials in Rhode Island in the 1980s drew intense international attention with its high society overtones. The story was the subject of the 1990 movie “Reversal of Fortune” starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. Sunny died in 2008 in New York City; Claus died in 2019 in London.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A large granite monument honoring 9/11 victims was defaced by vandals who spray-painted “Taliban” on it in two places, authorities said. The granite statue is made of two towers, each weighing 4,000 pounds, with a light beam outside a Greenville County business, WYFF-TV reports. Deputies were called to investigate the vandalism Sunday morning, and the damage was cleaned up later that day, said Paul Nichols, founder and CEO of Upstate Granite Solutions. His granite company constructed the memorial, which is surrounded by 1,000 American flags, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the U.S. “This monument is meant to show the community how much we care and to offer our support to our military and our first responders and let people know there’s still something to believe in in America,” said Kelly Nichols of Upstate Granite Solutions. Nichols said hundreds of people visited the memorial Saturday night.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Badlands National Park will build a new visitor center in the southeast section of the park, the National Park Foundation said Monday. The new facility will be located in the Cedar Pass section of the park, where wind and water have carved towering geological rock formations from the prairie. The center is planned to educate park visitors about the region’s paleontological and geological resources, as well as the culture of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Lakota people. Nearly 917,000 people visited the park last year, according to the National Park Service. The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust donated $3.3 million for the project. Badlands Natural History Association has also pledged $1.8 million, and the Badlands National Park Conservancy has contributed $100,000. “Badlands National Park’s layered rocks formations and stunning buttes offer visitors a breathtaking glimpse into a scenic landscape that began forming millions of years ago,” Helmsley Charitable Trust Trustee Walter Panzirer said in a statement. “We’re excited to lead the funding effort to construct a new, modern visitor center to highlight the park’s splendor and significance.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Some residents affected by last month’s flooding can apply for emergency food benefits. The Department of Human Services announced that the state will begin accepting applications for “disaster SNAP” benefits for people who live or work in Dickson, Hickman, Houston or Humphreys counties. SNAP refers to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. To qualify, individuals must meet income requirements and can’t already be a current SNAP recipient. Individuals also must have experienced a loss of income due to the storm, damage to a residence or place of employment, or some other unreimbursed disaster-related expense. Applications from Humphreys County will be accepted through Friday. Those in Dickson, Hickman and Houston counties can apply from Sept. 20 to Sept. 24. Applications can be filled out on the department’s website or in person by appointment. The Aug. 21 flooding killed 20 people as it took out houses, roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Several Austin-area funeral home embalmers say it’s common practice to pour human blood from corpses down the drain, a procedure that Austin Water officials admit they were unaware was occurring and one that could compromise the treatment of wastewater entering the Colorado River. Death-related issues are often considered taboo, which might be why Texas Funeral Service Commission Executive Director Glenn Bower said it’s been about 20 years since he was asked how funeral homes in the state dispose of human fluids. He said if a family chooses to embalm a loved one, all the blood and body fluids mixed with embalming liquid that come out of the remains – referred to by embalmers as drainage – go down the common sink. “I can honestly say we measure the volume going in, but we don’t measure the volume coming out,” Bower said. “But that does go down the drain.” Of the solution put into the remains, “about half of that solution, give or take, will come out in the drainage,” he said. Disposing of the medical waste and embalming fluid is not dangerous to the public or to the environment, Bower said, as workers dilute the medical waste with water. Austin Water disagreed, saying in a statement that permits must be acquired to drain blood or embalming fluid into local wastewater systems.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: The Utah Shakespeare Festival is partnering with the Iron County Care and Share on a local food drive, offering discounted tickets for participants, starting this week. The food drive runs Sept. 14 to Oct. 9, and by donating at least six items of non-perishable food, playgoers can get half-price tickets to any show Mondays through Thursdays, according to a release from organizers. The deal is good on the day of the performance only and not for advance sales. The offer is limited to four discounted tickets per person. Food donation barrels will be located outside the Eileen and Allen Anes Studio Theatre, near the ticket office. “It’s important every year to support this shelter, but considering the times we’re in and all of the damage caused by the pandemic, food insecurity has only gotten worse. So the festival is very happy to help where we can,” said Donn Jersey, the director of development and communication. Flooding this year in the Cedar City area has made the food drive’s mission that much more important, organizers said, adding to an increase in need brought on by the financial instability the COVID-19 pandemic has caused.\n\nVermont\n\nThetford: Public meetings will be held this month as a plan to commit the state to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years is drafted. The Global Warming Solutions Act was passed last year despite Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto. The legislation set up a council on climate to analyze ways Vermont can reduce emissions. A virtual meeting to gather feedback from farmers will take place Tuesday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The climate council is then holding in-person public meetings in Elmore on Sept. 21; East Dorset on Sept. 22; Island Pond on Sept. 23; and Colchester on Sept. 26, the Agency of Natural Resources said. The council is in the early stages of drafting the plan that will be presented to the Legislature on Dec. 1, the Valley News reports. There will be extensive feedback and revisions through January 2022, said Administration Secretary Susanne Young, who is chairwoman of the council. Some of the strategies the panel is considering are recommendations for carbon capture and sequestration on farms; programs to encourage Vermonters to buy electric or low-emission vehicles; promoting compact communities to reduce commute distances; and building on Efficiency Vermont’s work to weatherize more homes, the newspaper reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: This year’s menhaden catch so far in the Chesapeake Bay is worrying the state’s top fisheries regulator, but the company harvesting most of the oily fish says it won’t exceed a set quota. Virginia Marine Resources Commissioner Steven Bowman wrote that Omega Protein has already caught 75% of the bay’s quota, the Daily Press of Newport News reports. “This is a troubling development, as recent harvest rates mirror those from 2019 when Omega did exceed the Bay harvest cap by 15,000 metric tons,” Bowman wrote to the Virginia-based company, which operates a fish oil and fishmeal plant in Reedville. Omega spokesman Ben Landry said the company has no intention of breaking the law. In 2019, Virginia had a different quota for the Chesapeake Bay than the one set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that manages several fish species. Omega’s catch was within the state cap, Landry said. The differing quotas led to a federal order closing the menhaden fishery unless Virginia adopted the Atlantic States commission cap and cut the allowable catch for 2020 to make up for what was caught in 2019, the newspaper reports. Virginia complied, and Omega did not exceed the 2020 cap.\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Officials say they’ve destroyed a second nest of Asian giant hornets found in northwestern Washington state this year and are preparing to take down a third. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a Facebook post that a team eradicated the nest Saturday in northern Whatcom County, near the town of Blaine along the Canadian border. It said a third nest this season has been located, and planning is underway to eradicate it. The nests have been within a few miles of each other. The first nest this year was destroyed in August. The hornets were first detected in the U.S. in 2019 in Whatcom County. Asian giant hornets are an invasive pest not native to the U.S. They are the world’s largest hornet at 2 inches long and a predator of other insects, including honeybees that pollinate many of the crops in Washington’s agriculture industry. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. They’re sometimes called murder hornets because they prey on other bees.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: This year’s West Virginia Book Festival is going virtual due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases, officials said. The free event will still be held Oct. 22-23 at the Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center, but events will be hosted online, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. “The health and safety of our guests, volunteers, presenters and sponsors is our top priority, and due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Kanawha County, we felt it was prudent to cancel in-person activities this year,” festival co-chair Sarah Mitchell said in a statement. “Instead, book festival presentations will be streamed live online, so book lovers can still engage with our renowned literary guests.” Some of the authors scheduled to appear include Pulitzer Prize winner Colson Whitehead, best-selling author and West Virginia native Homer Hickam, and children’s author Jon Scieszka.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers sought Monday to join the court fight over Wisconsin’s redistricting process, just as Republicans who control the Legislature have. The first-term governor asked a federal court to let him join a lawsuit over the shape of congressional and legislative districts for the next decade. Where the lines go will help determine which political party has the upper hand in elections. Ten years ago, Republicans controlled all of state government and drew maps that helped them. This time, Republicans won’t have as easy of a time because Evers can veto whatever they draw. If Evers and lawmakers can’t reach a deal, it will likely be left to the courts to decide where the lines go. Anticipating that could happen, voters and groups started filing lawsuits last month asking judges to set a timetable for legislators and Evers to act. Three lawsuits have been filed over the map-drawing process, two in federal court and one in state court. Evers, who is represented by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, on Monday asked to join one of the federal cases. A panel of three judges is hearing both federal cases and is considering combining the two cases it is overseeing. The panel gave GOP lawmakers permission to join one of the cases last month and is considering letting them intervene in the other one.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A man accused of choking his girlfriend has pleaded guilty in Laramie County District Court. Joshua Gene Nunn pleaded guilty to felony strangulation of a household member as part of a plea agreement. He originally pleaded not guilty to the charge, along with one count of misdemeanor domestic battery, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. If a judge follows the agreement at sentencing, Nunn could receive three years of probation, with a suspended sentence of three to five years in prison. Early last Sept. 29, a Cheyenne Police officer responded to a report of a domestic incident. The woman said that, during an argument, she had tried to lock Nunn out of their bedroom, but he broke the door and came in, according to court documents. Nunn got on top of her and choked her by pushing his forearm under her throat. The woman said she couldn’t breathe, and “her head got fuzzy,” and then Nunn punched the left side of her face, according to court documents.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/09/24/ex-overstock-ceo-spent-3-5-m-trump-election-audit-arizona/8349194002/", "title": "Cyber Ninjas' Arizona election 'audit' fueled by ex-Overstock CEO", "text": "Patrick Byrne, who has a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford University, had a vision similar to dot.com entrepreneurs when he acquired a discount retailer in 1999 and rebranded it Overstock.com.\n\nThe Utah-based online company became successful, and Byrne became a millionaire.\n\nToday, however, Overstock.com regularly distances itself from Byrne, who has become well known for espousing numerous conspiracy theories.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/24"}]}

Immigration\n\nThe Biden administration is facing a December deadline to terminate a public health authority, known as Title 42, that was invoked at the onset of the Covid pandemic and allowed officials to turn away migrants encountered at the US Southern border. As officials prepare for a surge of migrants ahead of the forced end of the Trump-era border policy, the Department of Homeland Security has deployed additional agents to El Paso, Texas, where thousands of migrants have been attempting to cross the border daily. Administration officials have also received a steady stream of calls from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers – as well as state and local officials – on the merits of the authority, people familiar with the matter said. The calls all echoed consistent concerns about the termination of Title 42 and what it will mean along the border in the coming weeks.\n\n2. Storms\n\nA massive storm is producing raging blizzards in the North and damaging tornadoes in the South, shuttering highways and hampering travel. According to CNN’s storm tracker, the storm system is moving east across the nation and is currently lingering over the central US. There have been at least five confirmed tornadoes in Texas and multiple others reported, officials said. The storms left a path of destruction across Oklahoma and the Dallas-Fort Worth area Tuesday, flattening homes and injuring at least seven people. In Louisiana, a child who was missing after a tornado touched down Tuesday was later found dead, authorities said. Meanwhile, nearly 10 million people – largely in the north-central US – are under winter weather warnings or advisories, with blowing snow and power outages a key concern. Another 6 million people across the Northeast will be under winter storm watches today.\n\n3. Student loans\n\nAbout 9 million people recently received emails from the Department of Education that mistakenly said their application for student loan forgiveness had been approved. Thus far, no one has received debt forgiveness from the Biden administration’s debt relief program because it remains blocked by federal courts. While there are some borrowers who were already deemed eligible for debt forgiveness by the Department of Education, borrowers should not expect to see debt relief unless the Supreme Court allows the program to move forward. The 9 million borrowers who received the inaccurate emails last month have now started to receive new emails from the government correcting the “human error.”\n\n4. Ukraine\n\nThe Biden administration is finalizing plans to send the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine that could be announced as soon as this week, according to two US officials and a senior administration official. Amid a barrage of Russian attacks, Ukraine has been calling for the US to send the advanced air defense system that is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming missiles, as well as some aircraft. It would be the most effective long-range defensive weapons system sent to the country, and officials say it will help secure airspace for NATO nations in eastern Europe. This comes as a Russian militia commander recently appeared on state TV calling for the use of nuclear weapons because he doesn’t believe Russia has the resources to win the war in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian commander appears to call for use of nuclear weapons 01:26 - Source: CNN\n\n5.

Since then, a new school has been built for the students of a town known, now and for decades to come, as a cradle of grief – but also of untold love and quiet resilience. Some of the victims’ families have pressed for changes that might thwart another school shooting, but all agree there is more work left to be done.\n\nTune in to CNN’s Special Report tonight at 10 p.m. ET: “Sandy Hook: Forever Remembered” as anchor Alisyn Camerota looks back at the impacted families’ decadelong fight to enact positive change to prevent others from suffering from gun violence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It was just catastrophic beyond recognition' 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nHAPPENING LATER\n\nWorld Cup semifinals continue today\n\nFrance will play Morocco today at 2 p.m. ET in the second semifinal match of the 2022 World Cup.

This is another important move forward in the agency’s efforts to combat youth tobacco use and promote health equity.”\n\nThis landmark proposal could have a big impact on public health, experts said.\n\n“I want to underscore the momentous aspect of this. It will be it will be a game-changer,” Erika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy for the American Lung Association, said Thursday. “The rules will have a tremendous impact on stopping kids from starting to use tobacco and critically save lives of people, particularly from diverse backgrounds.”\n\nA long time coming\n\nMenthol is an equity issue that the FDA has been considering for more than a decade. It is the last special flavor allowed in cigarettes in the US. It was carved out of the 2009 Tobacco Control Act that banned all other flavored cigarettes and gave the FDA the authority to regulate the tobacco industry to protect public health. The law also required the FDA to conduct and fund research on menthol.\n\nAfter several years of FDA investigation and public input from hundreds of thousands of interested parties, the Public Health Law Center and other groups filed a citizens petition requesting the agency prohibit menthol in cigarettes. A 2020 lawsuit alleged the FDA unreasonably delayed issuing a final response. In 2021, the FDA announced it would pursue rulemaking.\n\nAbout 18.6 million people smoke menthols in the United States. That’s about 36% of all smokers, according to the FDA, and a disproportionate number are people of color.\n\nAn equity issue\n\nThe tobacco industry has heavily marketed menthol products to communities of color and other minority groups.\n\nAbout 30% of White smokers choose menthols, but they are the cigarette of choice for nearly 85% of smokers who are Black. About 40% of women smoke menthols, compared with 31% of men, according to the FDA.\n\nLGBTQ people are also significantly more likely to smoke menthols. A 2013 study that looked at data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2009-10 National Adult Tobacco survey found that 36% of LGBTQ smokers chose menthols, compared with 29.3% of straight smokers.\n\n“Today marks the beginning of the end of menthol cigarettes – a truly historic moment for public health. For decades, tobacco companies have intentionally pushed menthol cigarettes to hook young people on their deadly products and implemented racist marketing practices to intentionally target Black Americans; the resulting health consequences have been devastating,” Dr. Julie Morita, executive vice president at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation advocacy organization, said in a statement.\n\nMore than half of kids who smoke use menthol cigarettes, according to the CDC. A survey of adults who smoke found that the majority started with menthols. Other studies said kids who smoked menthol cigarettes were more likely to become regular smokers than occasional smokers.\n\n“The proposed rules would help prevent children from becoming the next generation of smokers and help adult smokers quit,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement Thursday. “Additionally, the proposed rules represent an important step to advance health equity by significantly reducing tobacco-related health disparities.”\n\nSmoking rates in the US reached an all-time low in 2018, according to the CDC, but smoking is still the top cause of preventable death, disease and disability in the country. In general, cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the US, including more than 41,000 deaths from secondhand smoke.\n\nCutting out menthol in cigarettes and cigars could have a significant effect on the number of smokers, the FDA said. By one estimate, it could even prevent 650,000 premature deaths over the next 40 years.\n\nAnother study projects that an elimination of menthol as a cigarette flavor would lead 923,000 people to quit smoking, including 230,000 African Americans, in the first year and a half.\n\nA switch to flavored cigars\n\nAfter the 2009 Tobacco Control Act banned flavored cigarettes, many smokers who preferred flavors – especially children – may have shifted to flavored cigars, including menthol and “kid-friendly” flavors like fruit punch, strawberry and grape.\n\nThe FDA said that the use of flavored cigars “increased dramatically” and that public health goals may have been “undermined” by the availability of these products. More than half a million youth in the US smoke flavored cigars, according to the FDA.\n\nFlavored cigars and cigarillos are especially popular among children, particularly Black and Hispanic kids, who are twice as likely to smoke them as their White classmates.\n\nThe FDA noted that one survey found that nearly 74% of teens 12 to 17 said they smoked cigars because they came in flavors that they enjoyed.\n\nIn 2020, more young people said they tried a cigar every day than tried a cigarette.\n\n“A prohibition on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars would mark a historic turning point in the decades-long battle against tobacco use and the epidemic of tobacco-related disease,” Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement Thursday. “The science is clear: Menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health and have no public health benefits as compared to non-menthol cigarettes. They increase the likelihood and degree of addiction among youth smokers, elevating the number of premature deaths from tobacco use. Their removal from the market would have enormous benefits for public health in this country.”\n\nIndividual consumers wouldn’t be prosecuted\n\nIf enacted, the FDA was careful to note, the rule will address only tobacco companies and the industry. The agency, as well as state and local law enforcement, does not independently enforce FDA rules.\n\nThe proposed rule would not prosecute individual consumers for possessing menthol products.\n\nSome activists, like the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Mothers of the Movement, have warned that a ban on menthol products could cause more violent encounters with police as they enforce the rule.\n\nAnti-smoking advocates have found that Sharpton and some other civil rights organizations have received money from cigarette makers for decades. Sharpton acknowledged to the New York Times in 2019 that Reynolds American has been a longtime donor to his National Action Network but said, “this is not about money.”\n\nOther groups, like the NAACP and many members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are in favor of a ban.\n\n“The targeting and marketing of menthol flavoring by the tobacco industry have had a devastating impact on our community. Menthol-flavored cigarettes have induced many children and adults, resulting in lifelong addictions, health challenges, and ultimately killing our loved ones,” the NAACP said in a statement. “Today is a huge win for equity, justice, and public health concerns.”\n\nThe FDA said Thursday that it “recognizes concerns related to how state and local law enforcement may enforce their own laws in a manner that may impact equity and community safety, particularly for underserved and underrepresented communities. The FDA is seeking comment on, among other things, how it can best make clear the respective roles of the agency and state and local law enforcement, as well as policy considerations related to the potential racial and social justice implications of the proposed product standards.”\n\nCaliff said this is something the agency will address more in the future.\n\n“We take these concerns seriously,” he said. “Let us make one thing abundantly clear. These measures and related enforcement would be on the tobacco industry, not individuals who possess or use these products.”\n\nNext up: Public comment period\n\nAn FDA ban on menthol and flavored cigars won’t go into effect right away.\n\nThe next step will be a comment period that will run from May 4 through July 5. The FDA will also hold public listening sessions June 13 and 15.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe agency is then expected to take time to review the comments before a rule becomes finalized.\n\nThe rule would take effect one year after the final version is published. Public health experts are confident that tobacco companies will also try to stop the ban by suing the agency, as the companies have with past tobacco-control legislation.\n\n“This is not trivial,” Califf said. Tobacco-related deaths are high, he noted, and so are tobacco-related illnesses.\n\n“My plea is that we not lose our sense of urgency about this,” he said. “Literally, lives can be saved.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/09/11/raise-smoking-age-21-reduce-nicotine-addiction-save-lives-column/1255572002/", "title": "Ban tobacco sales until age 21. It's a bipartisan way to reduce ...", "text": "Stephanie Morain and Arthur Garson Jr.\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nPatricia Garson was a smoker who died of lung cancer. Her husband inhaled second-hand smoke for over 20 years and died of lung cancer too. Their daughter smoked for 30 years and has lung cancer. And their son — a co-author of this column — smoked for three years. One thing uniting those Garsons: Their smoking began in their teenage years.\n\nUnfortunately, this experience is far too familiar for many Americans. Tobacco is the leading cause of illness and death in the United States, claiming the lives of nearly half a million people each year. That is equivalent to three 747 planes crashing in this country every single day. However, we have the opportunity to prevent today’s teenagers from the harms experienced by the Garson family. The question is, are we willing to seize it?\n\nThere is an effective solution that can dramatically curb smoking — and one that has broad, bipartisan support. Across the country, several states and hundreds of cities have passed a law that can help ensure teenagers never start smoking — and therefore, never become addicted. These laws, known as “Tobacco 21 laws,” make it illegal to sell cigarettes and other tobacco products to anyone under the age of 21.\n\nTobacco 21 effectively reduces teenage smoking\n\nThese laws work. A study of the nation’s first Tobacco 21 law in Needham, Mass., found that smoking rates in high schoolers declined by 47 percent in the four-year period after the law was passed in 2005. Since then, over 300 communities in 21 states have passed similar laws, ranging from Sitka, Alaska to New York City.\n\nWe often hear stories in the media about how bitterly divided Americans are when it comes to health policy. But there is almost uniform agreement on the value of Tobacco 21 laws. Nationally, 82 percent of Americans support preventing the sale of all tobacco products to those under age 21, according to a 2018 poll conducted by Texas Medical Center Health Policy Institute, to be released Wednesday.\n\nMore:Do you really want kids to go back to school with Juul?\n\nDon’t let fearmongering guide vaping debate\n\nWarning: Vaping teens becoming a new generation of nicotine addicts\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats back these laws to keep tobacco out of the hands of teenagers. Support for the laws is high across different income and education levels. Support is high even among those under 21, who are most directly affected.\n\nIt's important to enact these laws because teens are especially susceptible to the addictive effects of nicotine. Young people need less nicotine than adults to become addicted, and their impulsivity prevents them from recognizing the serious risks they face if they choose to become smokers. But if you prevent them from smoking when they're under 21, many will choose not to take up smoking, even when they're of legal age.\n\nTobacco is harmful, unlike other freedoms\n\nCritics of these laws charge that they unfairly limit liberty. They argue that if you are old enough to vote or get married at 18, you are old enough to smoke cigarettes. This argument, however, is flawed. Marriage, voting, and tobacco each have very different risks and benefits. Other freedoms allowed to those at age 18, like marriage and voting, have the potential to bring about more good than harm.\n\nTobacco, however, is addictive, and it has been clearly and repeatedly shown to cause significant harm to all who consume it. Perhaps that is why, in the same survey, more than half of Americans said they believe tobacco sales should be banned altogether, regardless of age.\n\nThe Garson family and millions of others have lost their loved ones to lung cancer caused by tobacco. We can spare future families this pain. The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids has an online resource that shows the location of cities and states with Tobacco 21 laws. If your community isn’t listed, contact your elected officials and ask them to take action today. The time has come to protect teenagers from tobacco by passing Tobacco 21 laws.\n\nStephanie Morain is an assistant professor at the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine.

Joe Manchin torpedoing his party’s efforts toward writing sweeping climate action and tax legislation.\n\n“If the Senate will not move to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen our domestic clean energy industry, I will take strong executive action to meet this moment,” Biden said in statement, while overseas in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Biden didn’t mention Manchin specifically.\n\nThe President vowed to “create jobs, improve our energy security, bolster domestic manufacturing and supply chains, protect us from oil and gas price hikes in the future, and address climate change,” but did not provide specifics on what kind of action he would take.\n\nOn Thursday night, Manchin dealt a devastating blow to Democrats’ hopes for sweeping legislative action this year, telling Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and his staff “unequivocally” that he won’t support the climate or tax provisions of a Democratic economic package, two sources familiar with the talks told CNN.\n\nManchin and Schumer had been negotiating for months, and the New York Democrat had made a number of concessions to pare back the climate provisions to appease the West Virginia moderate, whose support is critical in an evenly decided Senate.\n\nIn a Friday radio interview, Manchin disputed the characterization that he had blown up the negotiations with Schumer but said that he asked that they wait until the July inflation numbers came out and pursue this after August recess.\n\n“I said, ‘Chuck until we see the July inflation figures, until we see the July, basically Federal Reserve rates, interest rates, then let’s wait till that comes out so we know that we’re going down a path that won’t be inflammatory, to add more to inflation,’ ” Manchin told Hoppy Kercheval on Talkline. “He says, ‘Are you telling me you won’t do the other right now?’ I said, ‘Chuck, it’s wrong, it’s not prudent to do the other right now.’ “\n\nCNN reported Thursday night that Manchin is open to letting Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices and to extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years, one of the sources said, which suggests that’s all Democrats are likely to get in the package.\n\nIn his statement, Biden did call on Congress to “give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices and to prevent an increase in health insurance premiums for millions of families with coverage under the Affordable Care Act” and urged lawmakers to “pass it before the August recess” and send it to his desk for a signature.\n\nBiden thanked Schumer, who took a lead role in the negotiations with Manchin, noting that he offered “significant compromises” as he sought to broker a deal.\n\n“I want to thank Leader Schumer for his dogged and determined effort to produce the strongest possible bill to bring down costs, reduce the deficit, and combat the climate crisis while boosting our energy security – even offering significant compromises to try to reach an agreement,” Biden wrote.\n\nIt’s unclear if Manchin’s public position asking that negotiators wait until September to consider raising taxes or climate provisions means that prescription drug pricing changes and ACA subsidies would be separate. Democrats have pushed to finish a deal before August recess in order to give their vulnerable members of for reelection a chance to campaign on the legislation.\n\nJohn Podesta, Center for American Progress founder and Obama climate adviser, expressed skepticism about Manchin’s push for more time to consider the deal.\n\n“I think that string has run out,” Podesta said in an interview. “He killed this, and he has to own that. If he’s happy about the consequences of that, so be it, but it’s going to be devastating to a lot of people across the country.”\n\nManchin, who has cited increased federal spending as a main driver of inflation, would not budge on other Democratic priorities, and he told Schumer that he will not consider raising taxes on the wealthy or corporations.\n\nThe change in tone of the latest negotiations was abrupt. Manchin had supported those provisions throughout the negotiations with the majority leader, both at the staff and member level, one of the sources familiar said.\n\nNews of Manchin’s stance of not supporting climate and tax provisions to Democratic leadership, first reported by The Washington Post, was met with outrage from climate activists and many fellow Democrats, who have previously seethed over Manchin’s refusal to back some of the party’s more ambitious spending proposals. In December, Manchin had torpedoed a $1.75 trillion version of Biden’s climate and economic bill, known as the Build Back Better Act, angering the White House and Democrats who had pushed for a much larger $3.5 trillion spending plan at the beginning of the Biden administration.\n\n“I’m not going to sugar coat my disappointment here, especially since nearly all issues in the climate and energy space had been resolved,” Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden, whose committee had jurisdiction over the clean energy tax credits and corporate tax provisions, said in a statement.\n\n“This is our last chance to prevent the most catastrophic—and costly—effects of climate change. We can’t come back in another decade and forestall hundreds of billions—if not trillions—in economic damage and undo the inevitable human toll,” the Oregon Democrat added.\n\nFellow Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico questioned Manchin’s chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n“We have an opportunity to address the climate crisis right now. Senator Manchin’s refusal to act is infuriating. It makes me question why he’s Chair of ENR,” Heinrich tweeted.\n\nSimilarly, climate advocates, many of whom were anticipating seeing climate and energy bill text soon, reacted on Thursday night with shock and outrage.\n\n“This is nothing short of a death sentence,” Varshini Prakash, co-founder of youth climate group Sunrise Movement, said in a statement. “It’s clear appealing to corporate obstructionists doesn’t work, and it will cost us a generation of voters.”\n\n“There truly aren’t words for how appalled, outraged, and disappointed we are,” Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, said.\n\nManchin’s office pointed to rising inflation. “Political headlines are of no value to the millions of Americans struggling to afford groceries and gas as inflation soars to 9.1%,” Manchin spokeswoman Sam Runyon said in a statement. “Senator Manchin believes it’s time for leaders to put political agendas aside, reevaluate and adjust to the economic realities the country faces to avoid taking steps that add fuel to the inflation fire.”\n\nData released Wednesday showed that inflation surged to a new pandemic-era peak in June, with US consumer prices jumping by 9.1% year-over-year – the highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nBut Evergreen Action co-founder Jamal Raad told CNN that Manchin’s argument about not spending more to avoid worsening inflation missed the mark when it came to energy and climate.\n\n“He’s not even about solving inflation because the major driver of inflation was gas prices, and he decided we should invest more in fossil fuels,” Raad said.\n\nDemocrats are now pushing to get the Affordable Care Act subsidies extended before the August recess to avoid major rate hikes that will be announced just before the midterm elections in November.\n\nThe subsidies were expanded as part of the Democrats’ American Rescue Plan Act and made coverage on the Obamacare exchanges more affordable, leading to record enrollment this year. If they are allowed to expire at the end of the year, nearly all of the 13 million subsidized enrollees will see their premiums rise for 2023, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 3 million people could become uninsured, an Urban Institute analysis found.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to avoid the negative publicity of such premium increases. If Congress doesn’t act, consumers will learn in the fall just how much more they could have to pay. Open enrollment begins on November 1, a week ahead of Election Day.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Betsy Klein Ella Nilsen Manu Raju Morgan Rimmer", "Betsy Klein", "Ella Nilsen", "Manu Raju", "Morgan Rimmer"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/opinions/american-indian-casinos-smoking-ban/index.html", "title": "Opinion: What happened when smoking was banned in American ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Patricia Nez Henderson, M.D., MPH, vice president of the Black Hills Center for American Indian Health, is Diné (a citizen of the Navajo Nation) and an authority on commercial tobacco control in American Indian communities. Catherine Saucedo is deputy director of the Smoking Cessation Leadership Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt took more than a decade to achieve. But anyone who cares about health in Indian country will gladly take the win. American Indian tribes are joining the effort across the nation to ban smoking in casinos, permanently, in the case of the Navajo Nation, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and others.\n\nCatherine Bonniot-Saucedo UCSF Documents & Media - Marco S\n\nPatricia Nez Henderson Rapid City Journal\n\nThis development may have once seemed unthinkable in communities where consuming tobacco is both a sacred ritual and a heavily entrenched public-health burden. But it’s happening. It is a striking reversal given that the tobacco industry has pushed its toxic products on American Indian lands for a century or more, and the gambling industry has argued against smoking bans since Indian casinos first emerged in the 1980s.\n\nAdvocates for preventing and treating addictions now can learn from this victory. We should work hard to help our tribal nations with only temporary smoking restrictions to make them permanent.\n\nTraditional healers have taken care to explain and preserve the crucial distinction between ceremonial tobacco, which has historically been used in both spiritual and cultural settings, and commercial tobacco products, whose only purpose is pursuit of the almighty dollar. This distinction has been blurred over many years, to the great detriment of American Indian health and well-being.\n\nFederal policies enacted in the 1800s banned American Indians’ cultural and religious practices, curtailing the ritual use of traditional plants like tobacco. Another blow to tradition came from the tobacco industry in the misappropriation of Native American Indian culture on commercial tobacco packaging, which began in 1904.\n\nMore recently, the commercial tobacco industry has targeted American Indians with their poison by offering price reductions, bingo and casino promotions, and other gimmicks to entice consumers.\n\nCommercial products are far different from the plants used in religious rites – into American Indian communities—but American Indian iconography and imagery have been used to sell cigars, cigarettes, chewing tobacco and a false history in which Indian culture and nicotine were indelibly linked.\n\nIt has taken a lot of effort and education to turn that story around. Casinos worried going smoke-free would cost them customers and precious revenue, but for a number of casinos across the nation, revenue has increased despite smoking bans being in place. The bans do not seem to deter gamblers.\n\nWhat’s more, American Indian communities which used commercial tobacco sometimes conflated tradition with addiction. Public health advocates had their hands full fighting against a range of scourges – not just commercial tobacco but also other addictive drugs – and for essentials sorely lacking on reservations, like clean water and air, with little money or support.\n\nThen, two years ago, Covid-19 hit and casino profits plunged. Advocates used the opportunity to present options to industry executives. Many of the casinos reopened with new policies designed to allow customers to breathe easier and not get sick. They included previously unheard-of smoking restrictions. It’s hard to smoke with a mask on. But much to everyone’s surprise, it seems going smoke-free could be good for business, evidenced by soaring profits in other smoke-free casinos.\n\nCovid and smoking are parallel disasters. The pandemic has killed more than 950,000 people in the United States in the last two years. Use of commercial tobacco products kills about 500,000 people a year.\n\nMany deaths result from illness laid atop injustice. Indian reservations and other communities of color have long been afflicted by poverty, ill health and inadequate health care. For generations, they have also been targets of the tobacco industry’s aggressive, predatory marketing. It’s no wonder they suffer disproportionately from lung and heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer and other conditions linked to tobacco use.\n\nThe industry’s deadly products create many opportunities for an opportunistic virus to sweep in and cut down those whom tobacco has left vulnerable.\n\nThese are the challenges confronting those trying to improve public health in Indian country. Commercial tobacco is a powerfully addictive drug, and Covid-19 is ruthless, posing a great risk to smokers.\n\nSaving lives often starts with getting people to break their smoking addiction. This can be difficult, but here is the good news: Smokers can free themselves, through proven interventions like counseling, peer and family outreach, and medications like nicotine gum, patches and other pharmacotherapies. Telephone quit lines can double their chances of success.\n\nAnd yet, on Tribal reservations, where many homes lack electricity and running water, calling a quit line or attending a smoking cessation webinar are not always realistic options for smokers.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBut smoke-free casinos are feasible and do not appear to dissuade gamblers. And American Indians seeking to quit may benefit from the role of traditional healers and techniques like mindfulness practices, which were facts of American Indian life centuries before “mindfulness” became a contemporary buzzword. And, as Dr. Nez Henderson has often said, American Indians can decolonize tobacco in every setting.\n\nAmerican Indians themselves can debunk the notion that commercial tobacco is somehow an integral part of Indigenous culture. It’s not. The casinos are a fine place to start, but this isn’t over. We are continuing to fight to change the system to deliver health equity, and we need help with basic resources to make cessation possible as we continue the decolonization struggle. The sooner commercial tobacco addiction begins disappearing from Indian country, the better we are as tribal nations.", "authors": ["Patricia Nez Henderson Catherine Saucedo", "Patricia Nez Henderson", "Catherine Saucedo"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}]}

Musk's drop in net worth happened after Tesla stock dropped by 6% Monday.\n\nThe Forbes list of the world’s wealthiest people in late 2022 is a mix of technology and business moguls. Forbes catalog of the wealthy started in 1982 with the Forbes 400, which lists the 400 richest Americans. In current iterations, Forbes includes the person's net worth, a philanthropy score and a self-made score. Both George Soros and Rihanna have self-made scores of 10, citing their underprivileged backgrounds before working their way into wealth.\n\nWho is the richest person in the world?\n\nAccording to Forbes, the richest person in the world as of December 2022 is Bernard Arnault and family. Arnault is the chairman and CEO of French conglomerate LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Christian Dior and Tiffany & Co among other fashion and cosmetics brands.\n\nArnault's family wealth has grown significantly in the past three years. In 2020, Forbes listed his net worth as $76 billion, which jumped to $150 billion in 2021.

The founder, chairman and former CEO of Amazon held the number one spot on Forbes’ billionaire list for four years until he was overtaken by Musk. Bezos owns The Washington Post and Blue Origin, an aerospace company. He was one of the participants of the billionaire space race, in addition to Musk and Richard Branson.

Adani's net worth is about $133 billion.\n\nHighest-paid NFL players:Top QBs swarm to top of list\n\nWorld's youngest billionaire:Meet the 18-year-old claiming the title", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/business/bernard-arnault-richest-person/index.html", "title": "Bernard Arnault just became the world's richest person. So who is ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBernard Arnault, the chairman of French luxury goods giant LVMH (LVMHF), has just become the first European to top Bloomberg’s list of the world’s richest people, relegating Elon Musk to second place.\n\nNow worth $171 billion, Arnault’s wealth eclipsed the Tesla CEO’s $164 billion fortune on Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Arnault had already ousted Musk from the top spot on Forbes’ list of “Real Time Billionaires” last week.\n\nMusk’s net worth has tumbled by $107 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Arnault’s wealth, which stems from his controlling stake in LVMH, has suffered a more modest $7 billion decline.\n\nThe divergence is partly down to the stock performance of the companies in which the pair own shares. Musk’s purchase of Twitter (TWTR) hasn’t helped either. Still, he is in no imminent danger of falling further down the list: His fortune remains comfortably bigger than that of Indian industrialist Gautam Adani ($125 billion) and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos ($116 billion), who rank third and fourth on Bloomberg’s list.\n\nWhile Tesla (TSLA)’s share price has plummeted 54% this year, LVMH stock has held steady, supported by robust sales in the United States and Europe. The luxury market has remained relatively steady this year, even as surging inflation has led less-affluent shoppers to change their spending habits. LVMH has a market value of €362.4 billion ($386 billion).\n\nKeeping a low profile\n\nBorn in Roubaix in the north of France in 1949, Arnault graduated from the prestigious École Polytechnique, an engineering school in Paris. He began his career in the family-owned construction company, Ferret-Savinel, becoming chairman in 1978 after successive promotions.\n\nSix years later, he got wind that the French government was looking for a new investor to take over Boussac Saint-Freres. The bankrupt textile group owned a key asset: Christian Dior, a celebrated French fashion house.\n\nArnault bought control of the group, returning it to profitability and embarking on a strategy to develop the world’s leading luxury goods company. “In the process, he reinvigorated Christian Dior as the cornerstone of the new organization,” according to a biography on the LVMH website.\n\nArnault bought a controlling stake in LVMH in 1989, two years after the group was formed by the merger of Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy. He has been chairman and CEO of the company ever since.\n\nAlthough his own name may not be immediately recognizable to many, the brands that Arnault has been instrumental in growing — from Christian Dior to Dom Pérignon — have become household names.\n\nOver the past three decades, Arnault has turned LVMH into a luxury goods powerhouse with 75 labels selling wine, spirits, fashion, leather goods, perfumes, cosmetics, watches, jewelery, luxury travel and hotel stays. He opened China’s first Louis Vuitton store in Beijing in 1992.\n\nIn January 2021, the group completed its $15.8 billion takeover of iconic US jeweler Tiffany & Co, the luxury industry’s biggest ever acquisition.\n\nArnault’s philanthropic endeavors are pursued mainly through LVMH, which focuses its patronage on arts and culture. In 2019, the group donated €200 million ($212 million) to help rebuild Notre Dame after a massive fire ripped through the Paris cathedral.\n\nArnault has long held the title of Europe’s richest person, but the 73-year old keeps a much lower profile than Musk and isn’t personally active on any major social media platforms. In October, he told the LVMH-owned Radio Classique that he sold his private jet because he had been Twitter-shamed over his frequent use of the plane.\n\nArnault is married and has five children, all of whom currently work at LVMH or one of its brands, according to Bloomberg.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/business/elon-musk-wealth/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk is no longer the richest man on the planet, according to ...", "text": "1.

Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/people/954994/billionaires-richest-person-in-the-world", "title": "Top ten billionaires: who is the world's richest person? | The Week UK", "text": "5.

Who is the richest person in the world?\n\nTesla’s chief Elon Musk took the top spot in the Forbes 36th Annual World’s Billionaires List for the first time this year.\n\nWhen Forbes “locked in” the net fortunes of the planet’s richest people in March, Musk was worth an estimated $219bn, having added $68bn to his fortune in the 12 months before “on the back of a 33% jump in the share price” of the electric vehicle maker.\n\nThe magazine’s real-time rankings show that his fortune has fluctuated and returned to $219bn as of today, while several of the other top ten have seen their wealth drop. “Investors are feeling the effects of new inflation data and hiked interest rates that hit US markets - and the richest people in the world are not immune,” said US magazine Entrepreneur.\n\nThe last few years have also been “a roller-coaster ride” for Bernard Arnault, the luxury goods tycoon, said Business Insider. The pandemic “sank” LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton stock, but “strong sales” in his fashion businesses and “an uptick in alcohol sales” have meant he has maintained a pole position in the rich list leaderboards.\n\nHere The Week looks at the top ten richest people in the world, according to the Forbes real-time billionaires list.\n\nElon Musk: $219bn Elon Musk is the CEO of electric car giant Tesla and the founder and CEO of SpaceX. He divides his time between the two companies and projects like Hyperloop, a proposed ultra-high-speed train line. In April 2022 it was announced that Musk had become Twitter’s single biggest shareholder after buying a 9.2% stake worth almost $3bn. A “months-long saga” has been underway since January, when Musk first began investing in Twitter, before offering to buy the company in April for $44bn, said ABC News. He attempted to pull out of the deal and then revived his plans again last week. A guide to Elon Musk’s big family\n\nBernard Arnault and family: $146.2bn “When it comes to the world of luxury goods, perhaps no one is more successful than Bernard Arnault,” said Business Insider. The Frenchman – and wealthiest European on the rich list – oversees the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton empire of more than 70 brands, including Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and TAG Heuer.\n\nJeff Bezos: $136bn Former hedge fund manager Jeff Bezos started Amazon in his garage in 1994. He has invested heavily in space technology too, having founded Blue Origin as a “pet project” back in 2000. After stepping down as Amazon CEO he took on the new role of executive chair. He also owns The Washington Post newspaper. Into the blue: a new frontier for Jeff Bezos\n\nGautam Adani & family $127.8bn Gautam Adani has made his money through infrastructural investment. The share price in his listed companies “in sectors ranging from ports to power stations” have risen sharply this year, and he “briefly” overtook Bezos to become the world’s second richest man in September, reported CNN Business. Now, “he may be too big to fail”.\n\nBill Gates: $101.3bn Microsoft founder Bill Gates has been a permanent fixture near the top of the rich list for the past 20 years, despite selling and then giving away much of his stake in the tech company. He now owns just 1% and focuses predominantly on his philanthropic work.\n\nWarren Buffett: $96.1bn Buffet was 11 years old when he first bought stock, according to Forbes. Now in his ninth decade, the Berkshire Hathaway chief executive, known as the “Oracle of Omaha”, is one of the most successful investors of all time. Like Bill Gates, Buffett has pledged to give away more than 99% of his fortune to charity.\n\nLarry Ellison: $89.1bn American business magnate Larry Ellison is co-founder, chairman and chief technology officer of Oracle. He owns around 35% of the software giant.\n\nLarry Page: $85.8bn Internet entrepreneur Larry Page is one of the co-founders of Google. He stepped down as CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc in December 2019 but remains a board member.\n\nMukesh Ambani: $84.9bn Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani is founder and chairman of Reliance Industries.

Regional watchers warn that the popularity of Bukele’s policy could see copycat measures in the region, with other countries in Latin America already enforcing similar extra-legal measures to tackle their own gang problems.\n\nAnd as Jonathan D. Rosen, an assistant professor at New Jersey City University, who has co-authored several books on organized crime, drug trafficking and security in the Americas, points out, history has shown that mano dura policies have a way of biting back.\n\n‘A perfect recipe for abuse’\n\nEl Salvador is home to some of the world’s most notorious gangs, including Barrio 18 and MS-13. The latter emerged in Los Angeles in the 1980s among Salvadoran immigrants who had fled their homeland amid a violent civil war funded in part by the United States. It grew to include other Central American migrants, and in the 1990s, many were deported to their home countries, causing an explosion of violence there, say experts.\n\nBefore Bukele’s crackdown, an estimated 70,000 active gang members across the country made it “virtually impossible for politicians and state officials to avoid engaging with them if they wish to, among other things, carry out an election campaign or provide services in poor neighborhoods,” according to a report by the Crisis Group.\n\nA police officer questions a young man during a security operation against gang violence in Soyapango, just east of the capital San Salvador, on August 16, 2022. Sthanly Estrada/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut rights groups fear the effort to root them out has taken a toll of its own, resulting in the arrest of 58,000 people between March and November 2022, overstuffed jails, and the militarization of Salvadorean society as forces patrol the streets.\n\nWidespread human rights violations have allegedly followed Bukele’s dragnet – torture and ill treatment in detention, and arbitrary arrests as the police and army target low-income neighborhoods, according to a HRW report released on December 7.\n\nMany of the arrests in the past year appear to be based on questionable evidence, such as the person’s appearance, background or anonymous tip-offs “and uncorroborated allegations on social media,” HRW writes.\n\nOn December 3, Bukele’s war on gangs escalated when security forces “completely fenced off” the country’s most populous municipality, Soyapango, as he described in a Twitter post. Bukele also shared a video showing gun-toting troops marching in the area.\n\nJuan Pappier, a senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), told CNN that the authoritarian measures in Soyapango constituted “a perfect recipe for abuse,” impeding on people’s freedom of movement.\n\n“There’s a trend in Latin America, of believing that in order to address very serious security concerns you need to suspend rights,” Pappier told CNN.\n\nPappier points to the example of Chile, which has had an extended state of emergency in response to violence in the country’s south, which was extended for a month in late November, and Ecuador, where the government announced similar measures in response to gang violence in prisons in November.\n\nEcudaor announced a state of emergency in response to gang violence in prisons. Juan Carlos Perez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn recent weeks, Honduras’ leftist leader Xiomara Castro, who ran for government on a human rights platform, launched a month-long partial state of emergency amid outcry against extortion levels, suspending constitutional rights in certain regions as she cracks down on criminal groups.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Jamaica – which has one of the highest murder rates in the Caribbean (per 100,000 people) – declared a widespread state of emergency on Tuesday, which allows security forces to arrest people and search buildings without warrants.\n\nWhen mano dura backfires\n\nPrevious Salvadoran governments have tried to tackle gangs with similar strategies only to worsen the outcome.\n\nFormer President Antonio Saca – who pleaded guilty in 2018 of embezzling $300 million in public funds – unveiled a plan known as “super mano dura,” where analysts say mass imprisonment led to gangs consolidating their power behind bars.\n\n“The deployment of the military and police to combat gangs resulted in the gangs fighting not only with each other but also with the government. In 2015, El Salvador surpassed Honduras as the most violent country in the world, with a murder rate of more than 100 per 100,000 inhabitants. The country has seen more violence in recent years than during the civil war,” according to a 2020 study by Rosen.\n\nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele speaks to around 14,000 soldiers in El Salvador. Marvin Recinos/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTackling crime remained the top of the agenda in 2019, when Bukele swept into power promising to end corruption and gang violence. The millennial styled himself as an iconoclast with his embrace of bitcoin and fondness of backward baseball caps, but fears quickly mounted about his authoritarian tendencies.\n\nCritical journalists and civil society members were allegedly targeted by his administration, and in 2020, he sent armed troops into Congress as he demanded that lawmakers approve his plan to secure a loan to tackle gang violence. Last September, a constitutional court stacked with his allies, according to non-profit Freedom House, cleared the way for Bukele to run for two consecutive terms.\n\nIn 2022, El Salvador’s government denied responsibility for hacking the cell phones of at least 35 journalists and other members of civil society by using the spying program known as Pegasus.\n\nAs the country’s murder rate began to fall in 2020, reports emerged of Bukele’s government allegedly cutting a deal with gangs.\n\nAccording to a US Treasury Department statement, Bukele’s administration was accused of providing financial incentives to MS -13 and Barrio 18 in 2020 to “ensure that incidents of gang violence and the number of confirmed homicides remained low.”\n\nBukele’s government has denied the allegations, with Bukele describing it on Twitter as an “obvious lie.”\n\nThere is some consensus among security watchers that Bukele’s truce with the gangs fell apart “in late March (2022) which prompted the MS-16 to do the killing spree to pressure the government to give concessions,” said Breda.\n\nThe alleged move backfired, and Bukele announced a state of emergency and the suspension of several constitutional rights.\n\nWidespread human rights violations have allegedly followed Bukele's dragnet, according to a Human Rights Watch report. MARVIN RECINOS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAccurate statistics have been hard to get hold of as authorities kept the data private, according to HRW. But citing a National Civil Police document they obtained, there was a 50% decrease in homicides between January and the end of October compared to the same period the last year, the rights group said in its report.\n\nOther analysts agree. “From what we hear from communities living close to gangs, they confirm that most of the gangs are on their knees, (many) have fled or hiding in rural areas, of course this is affecting more the rank-and-file members rather than the leadership (of the gangs),” Breda said.\n\nA new crisis\n\nRights experts have noted the US’ recent silence on the prolonged crackdown.\n\nAfter initially being tough on Bukele’s attacks on the rule of law, “most recently we have seen ambiguous positions, which seems to be part of the Biden administration obsession in preventing migration,” Pappier said.\n\nAlleged gang members at a maximum security prison in Izalco, El Salvador, on September 4, 2020. Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess crime will compel fewer people to leave the country and seek asylum in the US in the short term, he said. Though Pappier doubts it will last, as many families have lost their sole breadwinner in the crime sweep. “Some of them are scared of police…so the deprivations of rights also have a cost and can also generate its own migration,” he said.\n\nA State Department spokesperson told CNN that “gang violence is a serious problem, and El Salvador and the United States have a vested interest in ensuring that these violent criminals are off the streets. At the same time, we have urged President Nayib Bukele and his administration to address the gang threat in a way that respects and protects the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of El Salvador.”\n\nThe spokesperson reiterated the US’ belief that the state of emergency “is an unsustainable policy that has raised serious concerns about human rights violations, arbitrary detentions, and deaths.”\n\nEl Salvador now has the perfect conditions for recruiting new gang members, Pappier adds. “People with no connection to gangs are getting arrested, are in prisons, and are completely deprived of their livelihoods – that is the perfect kind of person to recruit,” Pappier said.\n\nSo will Bukele listen? “Have you noticed how the mainstream media and NGOs have intensified their attacks in recent days?” El Salvador’s President wrote on Twitter a day after HRW’s report was published.\n\n“It is not that they are interested in El Salvador (they never were), their fear is that we will succeed, because other governments will want to imitate it. They fear the power of example.”", "authors": ["Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/958946/quiz-of-the-week-10-16-december", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 10 - 16 December | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Ray III, wrote in a court filing Thursday. He previously oversaw Enron’s liquidation in the 2000s, among other bankruptcy cases.\n\nNow, Ray is overseeing an “unprecedented” mess, by his own account, in the collapse of the crypto exchange, its sister hedge fund Alameda and dozens of affiliated entities. Ray, a restructuring specialist, took over as CEO from Bankman-Fried nearly a week ago, when the group filed for Chapter 11.\n\nRay’s assessment offers one of the first definitive accounts of what went wrong at FTX and Alameda.\n\nAmong the many problems the new management has uncovered are unreliable financial statements, the mishandling of confidential data (including using an unsecured email account to manage private crypto keys), and the diverting of corporate funds to purchase homes for employees in the Bahamas.\n\nFTX also lacked centralized control of its cash, according to the filing. The mismanagement of funds was so poor under Bankman-Fried that the new management does not yet know how much cash FTX Group holds. Ray and his team have only been able to approximate the amount of cash available — about $564 million.\n\nThat compares with a roughly $8 billion shortfall that Bankman-Fried reportedly told investors last week that FTX would need.\n\n“There are, at best, signs of just absolute non-control and power in the hands of just a couple of people,” said Eric Snyder, head of the bankruptcy department at Wilk Auslander, which is not involved with the FTX case. “At worst, there’s a systemic fraud of billions of dollars.”\n\nBankman-Fried has not been charged with any crimes. His lawyer Martin Flumenbaum didn’t respond to CNN Business’ request for comment.\n\nSBF’s bizarre tweets\n\nIn the filing, Ray also sought to distance FTX’s new management team from Bankman-Fried, who he said continues to make “erratic and misleading” statements on Twitter and in statements to the press.\n\nIn an interview with Vox over Twitter this week, Bankman-Fried, who’d built a reputation as an advocate for greater regulatory oversight on the industry, told a reporter it was all “just PR.” He added: “F**ck regulators. They make everything worse.”\n\nBankman-Fried has also taken to Twitter to air his thoughts on the events of the past week and a half, a period in which his own personal fortune, estimated at $16 million earlier this month, has evaporated.\n\nSince losing control of his companies, Bankman-Fried has retained a white-collar criminal defense attorney from the firm Paul Weiss. The attorney, Flumenbaum, has previously represented the sons of Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and junk-bond trader Michael Milken, who spent two years in prison for securities fraud in the late 1980s.\n\nFederal prosecutors for the Southern District of New York are investigating the collapse of FTX Trading, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Authorities in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, launched a criminal probe into the firm over the weekend.\n\nIn a thread of more than 30 tweets this week, Bankman-Fried said he would still try to raise funds to make customers whole. In one, he lamented how “once upon a time—a month ago—FTX was a valuable enterprise…and we were held as paragons of running an effective company.”\n\nBut Thursday’s filing by FTX’s new CEO paints a starkly different portrait of how the company was run.\n\n‘Unacceptable management practices’\n\nOne of the most compelling elements of Ray’s assessment points to the “the use of software to conceal the misuse of customer funds,” and a “secret exemption” of Alameda from aspects of FTX’s auto-liquidation protocol.\n\nAlthough Ray doesn’t explicitly accuse the company of fraud, Snyder says, the document contains what lawyers refer to as “badges,” or indications, of it.\n\n“When you say you’re using backdoor software to misuse customer funds and exempt one of your major affiliates from an auto-liquidation protocol, those are badges of fraud.”\n\nAuto-liquidation refers to when an exchange like FTX automatically sells traders’ collateral when they fall into the red. An exemption for Alameda would suggest the hedge fund had an extra measure of protection against high-risk bets.\n\nOne of the most pervasive failures, Ray said, was the absence of record-keeping. Bankman-Fried often communicated on applications set to auto-delete after a short period of time, and encouraged staff to do the same.\n\nRay also noted the companies lacked sufficient “disbursement controls,” noting that some employees at FTX were given corporate funds to purchase homes and other personal items in the Bahamas.\n\nFew of the companies’ financial statements appear to have been audited, and Ray said he doesn’t have confidence in their accuracy. In one example in which an affiliate did receive audit opinions, the assesment came from “a firm with which I am not familiar and whose website indicates that they are the ‘first-ever CPA firm to officially open its Metaverse headquarters in the metaverse platform Decentraland.’ “\n\nMany of the companies in the FTX Group “did not have appropriate corporate governance,” and some “never had board meetings,” the filing said.\n\nOther procedural failures include “the absence of an accurate list of bank accounts and account signatories, as well as insufficient attention to the creditworthiness of banking partners.”", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/business/sbf-wealth/index.html", "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried's $16 billion fortune evaporated in less than a ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSam Bankman-Fried woke up on Monday still a billionaire, even as his cryptocurrency empire was beginning to unravel. By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out.\n\nBased on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”\n\nFTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.\n\nThe 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing.\n\nHe told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry.\n\nBankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans.\n\nAs a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt.\n\nOn Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/business/ftx-madoff-bankman-fried-bair/index.html", "title": "FTX crash shares eerie similarities with Bernie Madoff, ex-regulator ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn the span of just three years, Sam Bankman-Fried built FTX into a massive crypto exchange backed by marquee investors and valued at $32 billion. It took mere days for all of that to implode in a sprawling bankruptcy filing.\n\nSheila Bair, a top regulator during the 2008 financial crisis, told CNN there are eerie similarities between the dramatic rise and fall of Bankman-Fried and FTX and that of infamous Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernie Madoff.\n\nBair notes that 30-year-old Bankman-Fried, like Madoff, proved adept at using his pedigree and connections to seduce sophisticated investors and regulators into missing “red flags” hiding in plain sight.\n\n“Charming regulators and investors can distract [them] from digging in and seeing what’s really going on,” Bair, who chaired the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from 2006 to 2011, said in a phone interview on Monday. “It felt very Bernie Madoff-like in that way.”\n\nFTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday, throwing the cryptocurrency industry into chaos and raising the specter of vast losses for customers of the crypto exchange.\n\n‘It all feeds on itself’\n\nLong before his Ponzi scheme collapsed, Madoff was known as a wizard on Wall Street. He was the former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market, served on Securities and Exchange Commission advisory panels and managed money for the rich and the famous.\n\nFor his part, Bankman-Fried was a top campaign contributor to Democrats in the 2022 election cycle. He hired multiple former US regulators to serve in senior positions at FTX, and his parents are both professors at Stanford Law School. Up until the bankruptcy filing, FTX even had an application pending with federal regulators to clear derivatives, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBetter Markets CEO Dennis Kelleher said in a statement on Monday that FTX had a strategy of “revolving door hires” from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and elsewhere “to use their knowledge, influence and access at the agency and in Washington to move FTX’s agenda.”\n\n“People feel duped,” Brian Armstrong, the CEO of rival crypto exchange Coinbase, told CNN in a phone interview on Friday. “On the surface, FTX was able to garner a lot of attention. But as people looked into it, the fundamentals were not there.”\n\nFTX garnered its $32 billion valuation with the blessing of investments from BlackRock, SoftBank, Sequoia and other top investors.\n\n“You get this herd mentality where if all your peers and marquee names in venture capital are investing, you’ve got to, too. And that adds credibility with Washington policymakers. It all feeds on itself,” said Bair, who sits on the board of directors at Paxos, a blockchain infrastructure company (Bair said she was speaking for herself, not Paxos).\n\nNow, authorities in the Bahamas are investigating potential criminal misconduct surrounding the FTX explosion.\n\nNeither FTX nor a lawyer representing Bankman-Fried responded to requests for comment.\n\nIf it sounds too good to be true…\n\nMadoff offered investors marvelous returns that were remarkably consistent and an improbable track record that later proved to be made possible by an elaborate scheme that involved repaying existing clients with new client deposits.\n\nGiven the speed of its demise and media reports, serious questions have been raised about the accuracy and strength of FTX’s balance sheet. FTX’s bankruptcy filing indicates it had liabilities of $10 billion to $50 billion at the time of the filing.\n\nBankman-Fried secretly transferred about $10 billion of customer funds from FTX to his trading firm Alameda Research and used a “backdoor” to avoid triggering accounting red flags, sources told Reuters.\n\nBankman-Fried denied to Reuters secretly transferring funds, blaming instead “confusing internal labeling.”\n\nBair urged investors to use caution and be skeptical. “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” she said.\n\nCalls for regulation\n\nThe good news is the former FDIC chair is not worried about the FTX implosion threatening the entire financial system the way Lehman Brothers did in 2008. Crypto is still a relatively small part of the broader economy and financial market.\n\n“There is no systemic impact to the real economy,” Bair said, adding that this is all just “funny money in the ether with speculation.”\n\nBut the bad news is the crypto market remains largely unregulated, making it the Wild Wild West of the financial world. And that leaves investors vulnerable when something breaks.\n\n“These risks of crypto-assets are very real,” FDIC Acting Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in prepared remarks to be delivered at a hearing on Tuesday. “After the bankruptcies of crypto-asset platforms that have occurred this year, there have been numerous news stories of consumers who have been unable to access their funds or savings.”\n\nGruenberg, who was nominated by President Joe Biden on Monday to become the full-time FDIC head, drew parallels between crypto and the exotic financial instruments that ended up playing a central role in the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n“Crypto-assets bring with them novel and complex risks that, like the risks associated with the innovative products in the early 2000s, are difficult to fully assess, especially with the market’s eagerness to move quickly into these products,” Gruenberg said in testimony for a Senate Banking Committee hearing.\n\n— If you are an FTX customer and want to discuss how you have been impacted by the bankruptcy, please reach out to Matt.Egan@CNN.com", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/business/sam-bankman-fried-wealth-ftx-ctrp/index.html", "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried's net worth collapses 94% in a single day ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the crypto entrepreneur known for providing a financial lifeline to struggling firms in the industry, is now in need of a bailout himself.\n\nBankman-Fried, widely known as SBF, started this week firmly in the realm of billionaires, with an estimated fortune of more than $15 billion, according the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.

Kennedy.\n\nThe cache of over 13,000 documents is the second of two JFK assassination-related document dumps that President Joe Biden ordered last year when the White House postponed a public release because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“[T]he profound national tragedy of President Kennedy’s assassination continues to resonate in American history and in the memories of so many Americans who were alive on that terrible day; meanwhile, the need to protect records concerning the assassination has weakened with the passage of time,” the White House said in a memorandum Thursday.\n\n“It is therefore critical to ensure that the United States Government maximizes transparency by disclosing all information in records concerning the assassination, except when the strongest possible reasons counsel otherwise.”\n\nBiden said in the memo that the National Archives and other agencies have until May 2023 to review the remaining private documents. After that, “any information withheld from public discourse that agencies do not recommend for continued postponement” will be released before June 30, 2023.\n\nKennedy’s assassination prompted a whirlwind of questions from the public and researchers, plenty of conspiracy theories and reflexive secrecy from the government.\n\nResearchers have cautioned that it will likely take days to go through the thousands of documents with a fine-toothed comb to ensure there are no new clues surrounding the assassination or novel pieces of historical information about CIA and FBI operations in the 60’s.\n\nBut for many lawmakers and transparency advocates, releasing all of the remaining documents is about restoring faith in the functioning of government. Public polling has long shown that a majority of Americans do not believe the Warren Commission’s official finding that Kennedy was killed by a single man, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone.\n\nLarry Sabato, author of the “The Kennedy Half Century: The Presidency, Assassination, and Lasting Legacy of John F. Kennedy,” told CNN that while there may be some hidden gems throughout the document release, there won’t be anything that changes what happened that day in 1963.\n\n“It’s not going to change the story,” he said of the newly declassified documents. “It’s not. I guarantee you.”\n\nHe added that if people are looking for proof to back up conspiracy theories that Oswald didn’t act alone in killing Kennedy, or that the CIA was somehow involved, they won’t find that here.\n\n“The truth is not that Oswald was part of a conspiracy to kill Kennedy,” he said. “The truth is that this assassination was preventable and could have been prevented and should have been prevented if the CIA and FBI were doing their jobs. Really, that’s it. Now that’s serious, but you’re not going to find the names of other conspirators in here.”\n\nThe CIA said in a series of statements on Thursday that many of its records released in the latest batch post-date Kennedy’s assassination and do “not change the historical record and has no bearing on the assassination or the investigation itself.”\n\n“Likewise, we are not aware of any documents known to be directly related to [Lee Harvey Oswald] that have not already been made part of the Collection,” an agency spokesperson said.\n\nWhile there may not be any earth-shattering revelations about what happened on November 22, 1963, Sabato, who is the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, did note a document discussing Oswald’s time in Mexico City, which says the US was running a “highly secret” telephone tap center with the president of Mexico not even known to Mexican law enforcement.\n\nA briefing summary prepared in December 1963 said that the CIA’s Mexico City station intercepted a phone call Oswald made on October 1 to the Soviet Embassy while he was in Mexico. He used his own name, the document says, and spoke to an embassy guard in “broken Russian.” Oswald told the guard that he’d been at the embassy the previous Saturday, where he’d met a consul who’d promised to send a telegram for him to Washington.\n\nThe document explains that the call was discovered through a “telephone tap center which we operate jointly with the office of the President of Mexico.”\n\n“It is highly secret,” the CIA document says, “and not known to Mexican security and law enforcement officials, who have their own center.”\n\nThe joint tap center “very often” produced information on US citizens contacting the Soviet Embassy, the summary says, which is frequently “extremely incriminating.” They wrote that on a couple of occasions, they’d even apprehended US troops who were attempting to defect.\n\nWhile it is not news that the US got information about Oswald’s call to the Soviety Embassy, Sabato said, it has not been previously disclosed that the wire tapping was a joint operation with the Mexican president. This, according to Sabato, shows that the US and the Mexican president had a “very close, cooperative relationship.” While this was not necessarily surprising, Sabato said, it was still notable that the Mexican leader “didn’t even trust his own security people to know about” the tapping center.\n\n“Back in the 60s, the critics of the one-party system in Mexico used to say frequently that Mexico was just a client state of the United States and the US controlled a series of Mexican presidents,” Sabato said. “Well, it turns out that Mexican president and his successor, who was his interior minister … were both deeply involved with the CIA.”\n\nThe CIA spokesperson said in the statement Thursday that information regarding Oswald’s visit to Mexico City “was included in prior releases. There is no new information on this topic in the 2022 release.”\n\nHe also identified a document from the National Archives and Records Administration that said as of this month, 28 records in the JFK collection remain “not located.”\n\nAdmissions like the latter are what fuel conspiracy theories, Sabato said.\n\n“If you are of a conspiratorial mind, you go, ‘Aha! There were important documents with key information in there and they’ve conveniently ‘lost’ them.’ Now, it’s possible that’s true. But I would say the odds are enormous they just got lost. I mean, there’s so much paper,” he said.\n\nWith Thursday’s release, the CIA has released “all of its information known to be directly related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963,” its statement said, with about 95% of the CIA documents within the JFK Assassination Records Collection now public in their entirety.\n\nWhile no documents remain fully redacted or withheld, according to the agency, the small percentage of information that remains blacked out “would currently do identifiable harm to intelligence operations,” according to the spokesperson. Those records, they said, consist primarily of internal administrative records collected to provide the JFK review board with background on the CIA, to help the board “understand, for example, CIA sources, methods, terminology, cover, and tradecraft.”\n\nOver the years, millions of documents have become public, offering researchers an opportunity to pore over not only records related to the Kennedy assassination, but also a variety of other topics, from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s life and slaying to pivotal moments in the Cold War.\n\nIn 1992, Congress passed the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, in part prompted by furor caused by the conspiratorial Oliver Stone film “JFK.”\n\nThe act dictated that all assassination records should be publicly disclosed by October 2017, but former President Donald Trump and now Biden have allowed multiple postponements on the advice of the FBI, the CIA and other national security agencies. Trump ultimately released tens of thousands of documents, the majority of which include at least some redactions.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc Haley Britzky", "Paul Leblanc", "Haley Britzky"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/crime/958891/why-have-the-jfk-assassination-files-been-kept-secret-for-so-long", "title": "Why have the JFK assassination files been kept secret for so long ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Kennedy.\n\nThe National Archives released nearly 1,500 documents as part of a memorandum signed by President Joe Biden in October. The tranche is the latest made publicly available over the years under The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, or the \"JFK Act.\"\n\nThe full records collection contains approximately 5 million pages of documents.\n\nThat's why Jefferson Morley, a veteran journalist and author of three books on the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1960s, called the new release a \"sham.\"\n\n\"According to the law, all JFK records were supposed to be made available within 25 years, no exception,\" Morley told USA TODAY.\n\nBut the law also allows for postponement at the discretion of the president.\n\nIn 2018, former President Donald Trump acquiesced to requests from national archivists not to release some new documents because of national safety concerns. The Biden administration followed suit until recently, according to Morley.\n\n\"They blew the deadline twice and that indicates that the CIA does not want to obey this law,\" Morley said. \"The question is: why?\"\n\nThe Warren Commission, established by Kennedy's successor Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the assassination, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation determined U.S. Marine veteran Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK in the head while the former president rode in a motorcade through Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. Oswald was assassinated by Jack Ruby two days later while being transferred from police headquarters to a county jail.\n\nSome historians and conspiracy theorists have often challenged the result of the investigation, and doubts about the findings of the Warren Commission persist decades later.\n\n\"The Warren Commission was told the CIA knew very little about Lee Harvey Oswald,\" Morley said. \"We learned in the last 20 years they had monitored his movements for four years.\"\n\nFiles released in 2017 under the JFK Act showed the agency followed Oswald's travels prior to the assassination but agents did not consider him a threat.\n\nMorley said only about 10% of redacted records were released Wednesday.\n\n\"The government's never offered a credible explanation for the assassination,\" he said. \"People don’t believe what they’re hearing. And when they’re holding 90% of the documents that are required by law, they continue 50 years of deception and deceit.\"\n\nRedacted records are permitted by the JFK Act. Most of the collection has been made available to the public without restrictions since the late 1990s, but agencies appealed to Biden to continue postponement of certain information beyond Oct. 22.\n\nThe president, in turn, provided agencies with a temporary certification until Dec. 15, 2022, to allow for the review of all withheld documents while disclosing all information \"except when the strongest possible reasons counsel otherwise,\" according to a press release. Any withheld documentation – over 14,000 records, according to the National Archives – not proposed for continued postponement will be released on that date.\n\nReach out to Chelsey Cox on Twitter at @therealco.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/politics/nuclear-documents-trump-showdown-justice-department/index.html", "title": "Report that FBI sought nuclear documents sharpens Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA report that FBI agents searched for classified documents related to nuclear weapons at Donald Trump’s Florida resort could explain the urgency of the unprecedented operation at the home of an ex-President and takes his showdown with the Justice Department to a grave new level.\n\nThe account in The Washington Post could also undercut Republican lawmakers, who didn’t wait for details of the case before criticizing a search they claimed was more typical of a tyrannical state. The latest development also further ups the stakes of an escalating legal battle after Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday called the former commander-in-chief’s bluff and, in an unusual move, asked a court to unseal the search warrant and inventory of property taken from Trump’s home.\n\nThe details in the Post report came on yet another extraordinary day that reprised the chaos and recriminations of Trump’s presidency, and carved acrimonious new political divides ahead of the former President’s likely run for the White House.\n\nThe Post cited people familiar with the investigation as saying that federal agents were looking for classified documents related to nuclear weapons, among other items, at Trump’s resort. The people did not describe the documents in detail nor whether they related to nuclear arms belonging to the US or another nation. CNN has not independently confirmed the report.\n\nBut if it turns out that Trump did take such material from the White House, it would raise the question of why a former president would need such closely guarded secrets after leaving office. The possibility that such material would be held at an unsecured facility, where guests come and go and where it would be potentially vulnerable to penetration by a foreign intelligence service, would alarm government officials.\n\nIn the intensifying legal battle over the search, Trump has until 3 p.m. ET on Friday to officially signal whether he will contest Garland’s move.\n\nIn a statement on his Truth Social network late Thursday, the former President said he would not oppose the release of documents related to the “unAmerican, unwarranted and unnecessary raid and break-in” of his home. He did not say exactly which documents he would be ready to see released. And the FBI search was not a break-in; it was legally authorized by a warrant approved by a judge who would have had to have found probable cause that a crime had been committed.\n\nIt’s your move, Mr. Former President\n\nGarland’s gambit was a neat one.\n\nSearch warrants are generally kept under seal to protect the reputation of the person they apply to. But Trump himself broke news of the search, thereby shattering his own expectations of privacy, in order to orchestrate a political firestorm to discredit the investigation. And if Trump fought to keep the document sealed, he would look even more like he has something to hide.\n\n“This is a pro move,” Phil Mudd, a former FBI and CIA official, said of Garland’s actions on “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.”\n\n“This is not the movement of a pawn. This is a movement of something between a rook and a queen.”\n\nIf Trump decided to contest the unsealing of the warrant – a step that could neutralize GOP claims that the ex-President is a target of political victimization – his lawyers would have to explain why in court. The judge in the case, who has received death threats and abuse on social media from Trump supporters, could still decide to support the Justice Department’s motion, even if the former President wants to keep the information secret.\n\n“This is what it looks like when you see the rule of law fighting back against Trump’s lies,” Nick Akerman, a former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York, told CNN’s Erin Burnett.\n\n“I think it is extremely unlikely that Donald Trump is going to prevail here.”\n\nGarland’s play is a clear attempt to push back on the fury from Republican officials over the unprecedented search warrant at the former President’s home. Lawmakers, media pundits and Trump supporters have unleashed unhinged claims that the US is now nothing more than a police state, with a Gestapo-like secret police, and has descended into tyranny.\n\nIn deciding to come before the cameras at the Justice Department, Garland did not just call Trump’s bluff and bow to pressure from Republican leaders who have demanded to know the justification for the search. He sought to protect his department and the judicial process as he insisted every step in the probe was taken with deliberation. His short appearance, in which he did not take questions, was scripted to rebut specific criticisms and the out-of-control conspiracy theories on the right.\n\n“Faithful adherence to the rule of law is the bedrock principle of the Justice Department and of our democracy,” Garland said.\n\n“Upholding the rule of law means applying the law evenly, without fear or favor,” he said, implying that not even ex-presidents are shielded if there are suspicions that they have committed a crime. Garland also spoke out forcibly in defense of the FBI and Justice Department rank-and-file, calling them “dedicated, patriotic public servants,” as Trump’s lackeys portray the bureau as a politicized arm of Democratic chicanery.\n\nThe attorney general’s remarks, a dramatic Washington moment, were a sign of the extraordinary sensitivity and significance of the investigation into the former President. Generally, the FBI says little about ongoing probes unless someone is charged – a step that, if it happens, seems some ways away in this case.\n\nAn unsealed search warrant will not comprehensively establish whether the department’s move against Trump was justified or was an overreach. But Garland’s initiative does suggest firm confidence in any case the bureau is building against Trump. It also shows that the department, right from the top, stands behind the decision to press ahead with a search – in the obvious knowledge that it would trigger an extraordinary and vehement backlash from Trump.\n\nThe idea that the entire affair is just some politically motivated plot hatched by legal hacks – the essential Trump case against it – is much harder to believe after Garland’s appearance.\n\nTrump’s decision\n\nTrump’s lawyers have not yet responded to the DOJ’s motion.\n\nThe former President appears to have three options. He could release the search warrant and inventory of items that the FBI removed from his resort; he could accede to the department’s request that it is opened by the court; or he could oppose the release of the warrant to the public.\n\nIn a logical universe, the latter option would seem unlikely since the ex-President busted his own privacy by breaking news of the FBI search in a politicized screed on Monday night. And the Justice Department is essentially arguing in its filing to the court that the public’s interest in knowing what really led to the search is now greater than Trump’s interest in keeping the details under wraps. The public interest is arguably even greater in light of the Post’s reporting about nuclear documentation.\n\n“For him to come back now and say, ‘I don’t want this’ would be very odd and bizarre,” said Jared Carter, a professor at Vermont Law School.\n\nBut Trump doesn’t play by normal rules. Given his lifelong record of exhausting every legal option to thwart accountability and the incapacity of judicial and political institutions to constrain him, a counter-intuitive legal strategy cannot be ruled out.\n\nWhether the ex-President follows through with his pledge not to oppose the release of documents in the case is likely to become clearer on Friday.\n\nRepublicans shift the goalposts\n\nThe reporting about the FBI seeking nuclear documentation at Mar-a-Lago raises new questions for Republicans who have been attacking the bureau and the Justice Department over the search without any apparent knowledge of what it was about. In perhaps a telling sign of how Thursday night’s developments have scrambled the messaging of Trump’s usual defenders, the conservative House Freedom Caucus scuttled a planned news conference on the Mar-a-Lago search hours after the Post report on the nuclear documents was released.\n\nGarland’s move earlier Thursday should have defused demands from Republicans for him to speak publicly about the search and to publish the warrant. But as soon as the attorney general stopped talking, key Republicans demanded more.\n\n“What I am looking for is the predicate for the search,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement.\n\n“Was the information provided to the judge sufficient and necessary to authorize a raid on the former president’s home within ninety days of the midterm election? I am urging, actually insisting, the DOJ and the FBI lay their cards on the table as to why this course of action was necessary,” the South Carolina Trump ally added.\n\nWhile Garland asked for the unsealing of the search warrant, which could come with an inventory of documents taken from Trump’s residence, he did not ask for the unsealing of affidavits meant to show probable cause that a crime had been committed in support of the warrant application. So Graham made his appeal in the knowledge that he is asking for a step that would infringe longstanding Justice Department guidelines – and could undermine any criminal case that the FBI may eventually level against the former President.\n\nTrump himself responded to Garland’s on-camera appearance with one of his characteristic “Witch Hunt” posts on his Truth Social media network.\n\nIt is impossible to verify statements from an ex-President who lied as a matter of course while in office. But several of Trump’s previous claims that he was suddenly targeted in a “raid” and a “siege” by FBI agents out of the blue were undermined by Thursday’s developments. CNN’s Evan Perez, Gabby Orr and Pamela Brown, for instance, reported that federal investigators served an earlier grand jury subpoena and took away documents from Mar-a-Lago in June. This seems to indicate that Monday’s search was a last resort and supports Garland’s contention that the FBI took steps to ensure the search caused as little disruption as possible.\n\nBut the attorney general is also trying a strategy that has perpetually failed with Trump – wielding facts and legal norms to shatter his wall of lies and falsehoods.\n\nSome Trump allies have already floated another conspiracy theory – that the FBI planted documents in the ex-President’s residence.\n\nNearly two years after Trump lost the last election, the nation faces yet another exhausting challenge to the rule of law from the twice-impeached ex-President.\n\nFacts and truth are once again the first casualties.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columnists/mike-kelly/2021/09/12/saudi-arabia-involvement-911-fbi-files/8307921002/", "title": "FBI releases files on Saudi Arabia's involvement in 9/11. Why? | Kelly", "text": "Imagine you have just arrived in a large city, in a country you have never visited and where you plan to carry out a massive terrorist attack that kills thousands of innocent people. You don’t speak the language. You have no idea how to rent a car, find an apartment, open a bank account — even find a restaurant that offers food you like.\n\nDid someone help you?\n\nThis is the central question that weaves through a newly declassified FBI report, released late Saturday after a day of national mourning to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, that examines whether Saudi Arabian officials played a behind-the-scenes role in the deadliest terror attack in U.S. history.\n\nThe 16-page, heavily redacted report, written in April 2016 and titled “Encore Investigation Update,” offers no overall conclusion on the totality of Saudi government involvement — long a major question in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. But it contains plenty of alarming Saudi fingerprints and new insights on efforts by Saudi officials here in America to connect with the team of al-Qaeda operatives behind the attacks and offer help in the form of finding apartments or other seemingly ordinary tasks.\n\nAs a result, the report now looms as the most significant piece of evidence yet that at least two Saudi government officials assigned to the U.S. — and likely more — aided the Islamist jihadists who hijacked four U.S. commercial jetliners on Sept. 11, 2001. The team of 19 hijackers, proclaiming a controversial Islamist theology of suicide and murder in the name of their God, crashed two planes into the twin towers of World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, another into the Pentagon in Northern, Virginia and a fourth into a Pennsylvania farm field.\n\nAlso significant is that this report, which is only a summary of a much larger FBI inquiry of alleged Saudi links to the 9/11 plot, is just the beginning of what relatives of 9/11 victims hope will be the release of a steady stream during the coming six months of previously secret files on the U.S. investigation of the attacks.\n\n“The dam is broken. The truth is spilling over,” said James Kreindler, the New York-based attorney who represents thousands of relatives of 9/11 victims in a massive federal lawsuit against Saudi Arabia now moving through U.S. District Court in Manhattan.\n\nCan he be a saint?:9/11's first casualty Mychal Judge is a legend\n\nCOVID-19:The mu COVID variant has been detected in New Jersey. Here's what we know about it\n\nKreindler said on Sunday that he is confident that future releases of formerly secret FBI files will show even more connections to higher level Saudi officials. He even predicted U.S. authorities may indict some Saudi officials on criminal charges.\n\n“We’re climbing up the totem pole,” he said.\n\nThe release of the FBI report late Saturday was expected. Indeed, as the nation mourned the attacks, victims relatives texted back and forth with each other throughout the day, wondering when the report would be made public.\n\nTen days earlier, President Joe Biden, under pressure from victims’ relatives, ordered a sweeping declassification of FBI, CIA and other secret files on the 9/11 attacks. In his executive order, Biden specifically ordered the FBI to turn over its 16-page summary of its Saudi-related “Operation Encore” investigation by the 20th anniversary of the attacks.\n\nBiden’s order — and reversal in U.S. policy that had kept the alleged Saudi links to 9/11 top secret for nearly two decades — came after victims’ families told him not to bother attending the annual 9/11 commemoration services in Lower Manhattan, Virginia and Pennsylvania if he did not declassify the files. If Biden had not ordered the files released, some families threatened to stage protests during the services in lower Manhattan which traditionally includes a somber reading of nearly 3,000 names of those who died in the attacks.\n\nAlso, Biden’s order came as a growing number of Congressional leaders, including U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democrat from New York, announced their support for bipartisan legislation to declassify all U.S. investigative files on Saudi links to the 9/11 attacks.\n\nHow tangible are the Saudi connections?\n\nAt issue in the report — and, indeed, the overall controversy — is whether the connections of some Saudi government officials to the 9/11 plot is tangible evidence that the Saudi government officially supported the attack.\n\nIn its “Encore Report,” the FBI appears to be drawing a careful investigative line between those two issues. The FBI refrained from making a blanket conclusion that the Saudi government officially conspired with the 9/11 hijackers. Instead, the FBI focused on a handful of Saudi officials — all with links to the Saudi intelligence services and a Saudi government agency whose mission is to spread a form of Islam known as Wahhabism which promotes a fundamentalist view of religious laws and teachings.\n\nThis raises the possibility that only a rogue group of Islamists within the Saudi government may have conspired without higher-ups knowing. Or it raises a question that Saudi higher-ups turned a blind bureaucratic eye to the connections of lower officials to Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network and its growing terrorist activities.\n\nBin Laden was born in Saudi Arabia — the son of a wealthy construction magnate with deep connections to the Saudi royal family and the government. Fifteen of the 19 Islamists who carried out the 9/11 plot were Saudi citizens.\n\nSaudi Arabia has long claimed it had no connection to the 9/11 attacks, while also trying to distance itself from bin Laden and the hijackers who were Saudi citizens. Likewise, the U.S. has delicately stepped around the question of Saudi government links.\n\nThe 2004 report by the 9/11 Commission concluded that the neither the “Saudi government as an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded” the 9/11 plot. But since the report’s release, some Commission members — notably Tim Roemer — have raised the possibility that lower ranking Saudi officials were involved.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Commission’s chairman, Tom Kean, the former New Jersey governor, told NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY Network that he favored the top-to-bottom release of all top-secret files on the Saudi links to 9/11. But Kean cautioned that he did not believe the files would contain a “smoking gun” that would conclusively link the Saudi government to 9/11.\n\nDays before the 9/11 anniversary and likely in anticipation of the release of the FBI report, the Saudi embassy in Washington, issued a statement saying that “any allegation that Saudi Arabia is complicit in the Sept. 11 attacks is categorically false.” But the Saudi government, which has hired a team of U.S. lawyers to defend itself against the 9/11 allegations, has never answered the question of whether lower ranking officials — perhaps with the tacit approval of higher ups — became involved in the 9/11 plot.\n\nExclusive:9/11 hijackers lived in plain sight in North Jersey. How did they do it?\n\nColumn:Biden seeks disclosure of 9/11 files. Will the move prove Saudi links?\n\nThe FBI report details extensive links between two Saudi officials — Omar al-Bayoumi and Fahad al-Thumairy — with two hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. Al-Bayoumi and al-Thumairy both reportedly had ties to Saudi intelligence services, the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles and the Saudi government's religious arm.\n\nAl-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi arrived in Los Angeles in early 2000. Neither spoke English. Neither had ever visited the United States. But al-Bayoumi and al-Thumairy managed to not only link up with them but help them settle into American life. Was this accidental or part of a preconceived plot?\n\nAlso not clear from the FBI report is how al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi made their way across the United States and settled into a series of motels in New Jersey, including the Congressional Inn on Route 46 in South Hackensack.\n\nThe travels of al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi into the U.S. and then to New Jersey is one of the most controversial and mysterious of the overall 9/11 narrative.\n\nThe CIA had been tracking al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi. Both were known members of al-Qaeda and visited Malaysia and Thailand before boarding a flight to America.\n\nWhen al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi landed in Los Angeles, the CIA waited more than a year to tell the FBI that two al-Qaeda terrorists were on the loose inside the U.S. The CIA has never explained why it did not reach out to the FBI. Such a lapse, many critics feel, allowed al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi to set in motion the 9/11 plot with other hijackers -- and Saudi officials.\n\nThe new FBI report offers more insight into the movements of al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi. It also names several more Saudi government officials besides al-Bayoumi and al-Thumairy.\n\nJust a start, families hope\n\nSeveral prominent leaders among 9/11 relatives who have long demanded that Saudi Arabia comes clean on its links to bin Laden and the hijackers claimed that the FBI’s report is just the start of more revelations.\n\n“This isn’t a crack. This is a split that opens into all of the Saudi lies and deceit,” said Terry Strada, formerly of Basking Ridge, New Jersey, who lost her husband, Tom, when the Trade Center’s North Tower fell.\n\nStrada, who now lives in Florida and had given birth to a son only four days before the 9/11 attacks, said the FBI’s report, despite its redactions, shows “the Saudis were deeply involved.”\n\n“It’s clear,” she said.\n\nBrett Eagleson of Middletown, Connecticut, who lost his father, Bruce, at the trade center, agreed. “This is just the tip of the ice berg. It’s the opening gambit,” Eagleson said on Sunday, adding that the release of the FBI report “marks the moment when the Saudis cannot rely on the U.S. government from hiding the truth about 9/11.”\n\nA key question now is whether the Saudi government will change its strategy of denying any connection by its officials to 9/11, much like Libya altered its deny-everything approach after more information surfaced of its links to the terrorist bombing of the U.S.-bound Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Another possibility is that Congress will increase pressure — perhaps with sanctions — on Saudi Arabia to reveal more about the 9/11 plot.\n\nFor now, the relatives of 9/11 victims are awaiting the release of more files in the coming months.\n\nMike Kelly is an award-winning columnist for NorthJersey.com.

The alleged aviation official was really a Saudi spy who reported directly to a Saudi prince who happened to be the kingdom’s influential ambassador in Washington and a close friend of President George W. Bush and other top U.S. government officials.\n\nThe FBI concluded five years ago that there was a \"50/50 chance\" that this Saudi spy knew ahead of time that the two Islamists he befriended were about to join the plot to hijack commercial jetliners and crash them into buildings in what turned out to be America's deadliest terrorist attack. But the FBI refused to go public with its findings — until now.\n\nThe story of the spy and the ambassador-prince emerged in recent days as the centerpiece of a startling series of revelations in a newly declassified FBI report that could shed light on a perplexing mystery that has long shadowed the 9/11 investigation:\n\nDid Saudi government officials play a role in America’s deadliest terror attack?\n\nIf so, what sort of role?\n\nAnd who else was involved?\n\nWhile heavily redacted, the report offers the most direct link yet between the Saudi government, its secretive royal family and the team of 19 operatives of Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda terror network who hijacked four jetliners on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. The terrorists crashed two jetliners into New York’s World Trade Center, another into the Pentagon in Northern Virginia and a fourth, which was reportedly headed to the U.S. Capitol, into a farm field in Pennsylvania.\n\nNearly 3,000 people died in that mass murder-suicide scheme. But for two decades, a major question has shadowed the inquiry into how a band of 19 Islamic extremists pulled it off: Did the Saudi government offer assistance to the terrorists?\n\nMike Kelly:The FBI begins to open its files on Saudi links to 9/11. What do they show?\n\nSaudi spy connections detailed\n\nA 510-page secret FBI report, written in 2017 and declassified last week without any fanfare by the FBI or Justice Department, concludes that the California-based Saudi spy, Omar al Bayoumi, not only helped several 9/11 hijackers to find housing in San Diego, but that there was a “50/50 chance” he “had advanced knowledge” of their deadly plans.\n\nFor years, top FBI leaders and Justice Department officials kept this potentially explosive information secret, refusing to tell Congressional investigators, the 9/11 Commission and the more than 10,000 American citizens who had signed on to a massive federal lawsuit that seeks to link Saudi officials to 9/11.\n\nThe findings in the FBI report are coming to light just as the Biden administration is reportedly reaching out to several oil producing nations — including Saudi Arabia — to increase production and help curtail rising gas prices across the United States. Whether the FBI’s report will impact negotiations with Saudi oil officials remains to be seen. But for decades, critics have pointed to Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves and their importance to the economies of many western nations as a reason the U.S. has not pushed harder for more information on alleged Saudi links to 9/11 and other Islamist-based terrorist attacks.\n\nBefore the 9/11 attacks, the FBI report says, Bayoumi was on the payroll of Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, the kingdom’s influential U.S. ambassador who was so close to the Bush administration and visited the White House so often that he was nicknamed “Bandar Bush.”\n\nThe FBI concluded that Bayoumi regularly passed intelligence findings to Bandar. But the report does not say whether Bayoumi told Bandar that he had met with two members of Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda terror network who had flown to California in early 2000 to begin preparations for attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nRelated:9/11 hijackers were 'hiding in plain sight' before the 2001 attacks. How did they do it?\n\nBayoumi helped the two find an apartment in San Diego. He also introduced them to several members of a Saudi-financed mosque in Los Angeles.\n\nThe two al-Qaeda operatives later made their way to northern New Jersey, where they met with other 9/11 conspirators, rented cars, opened bank accounts and postal boxes, exercised at a local gym and hung out at Macy's and other stores at the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne.\n\nThe FBI report does not say whether Bayoumi knew they left California — or, if he did, whether he offered them advice on how to travel to New Jersey. Nor does the report say whether Bayoumi ever told Prince Bandar whether he knew about the 9/11 attacks before they took place.\n\nCompiled after years of outspoken concerns and criticism from 9/11 victims about a possible Saudi connection to the plot, the report and its findings were kept secret by FBI and Justice Department officials until late last week. The report was released as part of an ongoing executive order by President Joe Biden last September to declassify the FBI’s trove of 9/11 investigative files.\n\nIn the days leading up to the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks last September, Biden had been under intense pressure by 9/11 victims and their relatives, along with several key members of Congress, to release the FBI’s secret investigative files. Some victims and relatives even threatened to stage protests or boycotts at 9/11 anniversary ceremonies if Biden showed up without ordering the FBI to open its files.\n\nSince Biden’s executive order, the FBI has declassified a steady trickle of files. But few of the documents offered much insight into the long-rumored Saudi link to the 9/11 plot — until last week.\n\nClear evidence of a conspiracy between bin Laden’s jihadists and Saudi officials has long been scarce. These latest revelations could change that, advocates say. And, if nothing else, this latest report offers one of the most startling glimpses yet into the shadow world of spies and terrorists -- and Saudi royalty.\n\n“It’s exactly what we’ve been saying,” said James Kreindler, one of the lead attorneys in a lawsuit by more than 10,000 9/11 victims and relatives against the Saudi government. “Saudi government officials at a high level were integral to the 9/11 attacks.”\n\nThe Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington — and their American attorneys in the lawsuit — did not respond to requests for comment. The White House did not respond either. The FBI’s media office in Washington said in an email: “We have no comment on the documents.”\n\nPrince Bander, 73 who is now retired after moving from his U.S. ambassadorship to the head of the Saudi intelligence service and the Saudi National Security Council, and Bayoumi, 63, both live in Saudi Arabia. They could not be reached for comment.\n\nVictims' families, former agent angered\n\nThe revelations about Bandar and Bayoumi drew an angry response, not just from 9/11 victims and their relatives, but from a former FBI agent who tried to sound an alarm during the summer of 2001 after he found evidence that al-Qaeda operatives had secretly entered the United States.\n\n“This latest report just shows what we have known all along, but disgustingly has taken 20 years to finally be disclosed,” said Mark Rossini, an FBI counter-terror expert assigned in 2001 to the CIA’s Alec Station team, which was tracking several al-Qaeda operatives but deliberately did not alert the FBI when a terrorist team entered the U.S.\n\nRossini, who was reached at his home in Spain where he has lived since leaving the FBI in 2008 after pleading guilty to illegally accessing files on a case unrelated to 9/11, claims he was ordered by CIA officials and threatened with federal charges if he bucked orders and told the FBI about the presence of al-Qaeda terrorists on U.S. soil.\n\nNeither the CIA nor the FBI has ever explained why they did not cooperate on what now seems to be such a basic piece of an important counter-terror investigation — and, therefore, may have prevented the 9/11 attacks.\n\nBrett Eagleson of Middletown, Connecticut, who lost his father in the collapse of the Trade Center's twin towers in lower Manhattan, said the new evidence is a major step forward in the long legal and public relations battle to not only draw attention to Saudi Arabia’s possible links to 9/11 but hold the kingdom’s royal family and other officials accountable.\n\nColumn continues below gallery.\n\n“For 20 years we’ve seen a helluva lot of smoke,” said Eagleson, who has emerged as one of the most outspoken critics of Saudi Arabia among the 9/11 victims and relatives in their lawsuit against the kingdom. “I think we’ve just found the fire.”\n\nNames of sources and other identifying details in the FBI report are blacked out. Many of the 510 pages consist mostly of lines drawn through entire sentences and even paragraphs. But enough information remains to outline the seemingly strange connection between the spy (Bayoumi), the prince (Bandar) and two rag-tag Saudi-born members of al-Qaeda’s terrorist network, Khalid al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi.\n\nMihdhar and Hazmi were well known al-Qaeda operatives long before they joined the team of 19 hijackers who carried out the 9/11 plot. In 2000, the CIA tracked Mihdhar and Hazmi from the Middle East to an apartment in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where they met with other members of bin Laden’s network.\n\nWhat the CIA did not know at the time was that the initial plans were hatched in that meeting to hijack commercial jetliners in America and crash them into buildings — the essential ingredients of the massive attack on Sept. 11, 2001 that caught America by surprise and transformed U.S. foreign policy.\n\nAfter leaving the Kuala Lumpur apartment gathering, Mihdhar and Hazmi flew to Bangkok, Thailand. With U.S. travel visas in hand, both caught a flight to Los Angeles — not knowing that CIA agents were tailing them.\n\nAfter Mihdhar and Hazmi landed in Los Angeles, they were soon met by Bayoumi, who helped them find an apartment and introduced them to a handful of Saudis also living in Southern California.\n\nThe CIA had no legal authority to continue tracking the two terrorists inside the United States. By law, the CIA is strictly confined to overseas spy operations. Critics have long claimed the CIA should have called in the FBI and its domestic counter-terror squads. But the CIA remained silent and has never explained why it did not immediately summon the FBI.\n\nDuring the summer of 2001, Mihdhar and Hazmi moved to northern New Jersey, settling into the Congress Inn motel on Route 46 in South Hackensack and other area motels and apartments. From there, they met with other 9/11 hijackers, including the ringleader, Mohamed Atta, who lived for various periods at motels in Wayne, New Jersey.\n\nA few weeks before the 9/11 attacks, the CIA finally told the FBI that al-Qaeda operatives were on the loose inside America. By then, it was too late to stop them, however. Mihdhar and Hazmi had disappeared with other members of the 9/11 plot.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, FBI investigators focused attention on Bayoumi and other Saudis in Southern California. But none was ever arrested.\n\nBayoumi left the United States and returned to Saudi Arabia not long after the 9/11 attacks. While in America, he was described in the FBI report as a “co-optee of the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency” who was paid an undisclosed “monthly stipend” by Prince Bandar. The FBI report, however, does not say whether Bayoumi ever spoke directly with Prince Bandar or communicated by email.\n\nBut the report also offers this glimpse on Bayoumi’s role as a spy and his connection to Prince Bandar: “The information AlBayoumi (sic) obtained on persons of interest in the Saudi community in Los Angeles and San Diego and other issues, which met certain GIP intelligence requirements, would be forwarded to Bandar. Bander would then inform GIP of items of interest to the GIP for further investigation/vetting or follow up.”\n\nThe 9/11 Commission investigated Bayoumi’s links to Mihdhar and Hazmi before releasing its best-selling report 2004. But neither Saudi officials nor the FBI and the CIA ever spelled out to Commission investigators the extent of Bayoumi’s work as a spy or his connection to Prince Bandar.\n\nReached this week, the Commission’s chairman, Tom Kean, the former New Jersey governor, said his investigators never learned that Bayoumi was a spy.\n\n“If that’s true I’d be upset by it,” Kean said in a telephone interview, adding, “The FBI said it wasn’t withholding anything and we believed them.”\n\nBut Kean also cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the extent of Saudi involvement in the 9/11 plot.\n\n“I think you have to take a look at the evidence,” he said.\n\nThe FBI report also does not explain when it formally concluded that Bayoumi was, in fact, a spy. In the years after the 9/11 attacks, a number of media reports speculated that Bayoumi might have worked for the Saudi intelligence service. But there was no formal declaration of Bayoumi’s role until now.\n\n“This is scary,” said Jerry S. Goldman, a New York-based attorney who represents 500 victims in the federal lawsuit against Saudi Arabia. “According to the allegation in the FBI report, the Saudi ambassador is dealing with a guy who dealt with terrorists?”\n\nTim Frolich, who grew up in Little Falls, New Jersey, and escaped from the 80th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center after it was struck by a hijacked jetliner, said the latest revelations confirmed long suspicions about Saudi links to terrorism. But Frolich, who worked as an accountant for Fuji Bank in the South Tower, also harshly criticized the FBI for withholding the details about Bayoumi for so many years.\n\n“This information obviously should have been out to the family members and to the American public long before now,” said Frolich who lives in Brooklyn. “Certainly the FBI knew a whole lot more than what they said.\n\nSharon Premoli, who moved to Vermont from her home in Jersey City after escaping from the 80th floor of the North Tower where she worked as a vice president for a financial marketing firm, said she has long suspected that the FBI knew much more than it was telling about the Saudi links to the 9/11 attacks.\n\n“Knowing what we already know,” she said, “how is it possible that we continue to nurture this relationship with Saudi Arabia?”\n\nAs for the FBI and its decision to hold back for years what it knew about the spy and the prince and the terrorists, Premoli said: “We feel abandoned.”\n\nMike Kelly is an award-winning columnist for NorthJersey.com.

That includes a reminder to prosecutors that they should only speak in indictments and other court proceedings.\n\n“The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law – whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Garland said in a speech Wednesday. “We will follow the facts wherever they lead.”\n\nHis quiet approach has not satisfied Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans who openly discuss their interest in identifying crimes they believe the Justice Department should prosecute. It’s also opened Garland to criticism that he hasn’t been as publicly dynamic or aggressive as the nation needs to counter a threat to democracy.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland has been extremely weak and I think there should be a lot more of the organizers of January 6 that should be arrested by now,” Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said on CNN this week.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Anthony Coley defended the agency’s efforts. “We are proud of the men and women of the Justice Department, who are undertaking the largest investigation in the department’s history,” Coley said in a statement. “They are following the facts and the law and the Constitution while working at impressive speed and scale to hold accountable all those responsible for the attack on the Capitol, and will continue to do so.”\n\nFor the FBI, which came under criticism for failing to do more to prevent the attack, the January 6 anniversary is also a moment to urge the public to help with more tips to solve notable unsolved crimes, including the police assaults and the pipe bombs found that day near the offices of the Democratic and Republican parties just steps from the Capitol.\n\nSteven D’Antuono, assistant director for the FBI’s Washington field office, said those inquiries are priorities as part of the broader complex investigation.\n\n“In this area where the bombs were placed, if they did go off they could have caused some serious harm or death,” D’Antuono said in an interview with CNN.\n\n“On that day, over 100 police officers were assaulted that day multiple times,” D’Antuono said. “And we’re not just talking about one assault, multiple assaults and by multiple people. We’re still looking for about 250 people individuals that assaulted police officers that day.”\n\nThe Justice Department hired a contractor to help it process hundreds of thousands of hours of video in order to do the painstaking work to identify assailants, CNN previously reported. “We’re going to be at this as long as it takes,” he said.\n\nAccountability beyond the rioters\n\nThe January 6 attack reframed the face of a domestic terrorism threat that the FBI, Homeland Security Department and other agencies say has grown rapidly. And the January 6 investigation has led to several arrests of what appear to be political extremists on the far right, and extensive investigations into militarized organizations that affiliated themselves with Trump and had members participating in the Capitol violence.\n\nBut in many ways, the role of the former President, whose rhetoric fueled the mob and continues to animate supporters, is the elephant in the room that Justice Department officials try to not talk about.\n\nIn one of the first moves under Garland, the Justice Department turned over thousands of pages of internal documents to congressional committees investigating the Capitol attack.\n\nThe move, which departed from precedent, was aimed at providing lawmakers with information that they could use more quickly to expose the conduct among people in the former administration who inspired the attack. That includes former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who according to testimony by former Trump officials, sought to engineer a coup of department leadership before January 6 and wanted to use the department to support Trump’s false election fraud claims.\n\nThe tacit acknowledgment in the move, however, was an indication that it was unlikely that the former president and top officials would face criminal prosecution for actions that incited the attack.\n\nSome Justice officials say that providing the documents to Congress will help provide Americans answers that the Justice Department perhaps may never expose, since the department can only provide a narrative of events when it brings charges.\n\nJustice officials note that prosecutors generally have five years of statute of limitations for most crimes that occurred January 6 and they haven’t foreclosed on the possibility of targeting higher-level figures.\n\nIf the release of troves of records to Congress was intended to relieve pressure on the department, in some ways it has done the opposite. Members of the House select committee investigating the attack, have highlighted information they’ve uncovered so far to build a steady drumbeat of pressure for the department to make sure there’s accountability beyond the hundreds of people who illegally entered the Capitol.\n\nFast start to the largest investigation in FBI history\n\nThe investigation began with a burst of activity, with 70 people being charged in the first week and a hundred case files opened, prosecutors said in a briefing. The swiftness was motivated in part because of concerns that a repeat of violence could disrupt the inauguration of President Joe Biden just weeks later.\n\n“No US attorney’s office has charged that many cases, executed this many subpoenas and search warrants in such a short period of time,” Michael Sherwin, the former acting District of Columbia US attorney who helped oversee the investigation, said in an interview. “Speed was critical. We had the Inauguration coming up. We had to instill in the public a sense of order and the rule of law, to mitigate the damage that happened that day.”\n\nBut those early news conferences from Sherwin and D’Antuono, who together presented a tough New York-style voice to the law enforcement work, quickly gave way as Garland ushered in a lower-profile style. Sherwin left the Justice Department after he was reprimanded for not getting permission to do an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes, in which he said, among other things, that he believed the Department could charge seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe crime scene at the Capitol was unusual and unprecedented in size, in many ways because of how surveillance and police cameras captured dozens of angles of the attack of the Capitol, and because the bragging online posts from the riot’s participants gave prosecutors multiple terabytes of evidence.\n\nEarly on, the FBI opened its tip lines and published photos of high profile attackers, immediately ushering a flood of tips from average citizens turning in family, friends and strangers. A loose group of online sleuths, nicknamed Sedition Hunters, organized themselves to cull through publicly released images to help identify dozens of suspected rioters. Their work, which sometimes has been faster than the FBI’s, has been hailed by prosecutors who credited their work in criminal charging documents.\n\nPlodding pace of riot court\n\nGarland’s approach to the January 6 probe appears to mimic the plodding pace of court – what may seem sensible to the long-time federal judge but what largely keeps the wider public from witnessing much of the investigative action outside of court proceedings and documents. So far, more than 160 federal defendants have pleaded guilty, with all but 20 so far pleading guilty to lower-level misdemeanor charges – leaving the bulk of the felony cases to move forward in court in 2022.\n\nAbout 70 defendants have been sentenced, to either probation or stints in home confinement or jail. Many of the felony defendants are looking at potentially years in prison if found guilty.\n\nThe first January 6 criminal trials are set to begin in February. In those days-long proceedings, prosecutors will have to give more of a window into the breadth of communications data, video and other evidence they’ve collected in what has become the largest federal investigation in American history.\n\nAt times, the pursuits in court have already connected January 6 investigators to the phone logs of members of Congress and a vast web of MAGA celebrities, such as Roger Stone and Sidney Powell, in touch with people around Trump’s White House leading up to January 6.\n\nBut the Justice Department turning the screws on Trump’s closest contacts may be a long way off, if pursued at all. Prosecutors won’t take to trial for months major conspiracy indictments against alleged leaders of the right-wing Proud Boys that broke into the Capitol through a window, and participants in a group of Oath Keepers. In the latter case, with 17 defendants heading to trial, some are accused of stationing guns outside the city on January 6, others say they were acting as security for VIPs, and other defendants zoomed a golf cart to Capitol Hill while coordinating their group during the attack, prosecutors say.\n\nSo far, four Oath Keepers defendants have pleaded guilty and appear to be cooperating with prosecutors. And while the Proud Boys’ lawyers have murmured about cooperating witnesses for months and how prosecutors pressured some of them to cooperate, the first known Proud Boys member to be charged with conspiracy flipped only in the last weeks of 2021.", "authors": ["Evan Perez Katelyn Polantz", "Evan Perez", "Katelyn Polantz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/politics/biden-democratic-primary-challenge-2024/index.html", "title": "As worries about Biden in 2024 grow, other Democrats aren't ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA challenge requires a challenger – and all the Democrats being discussed as potential primary opponents to President Joe Biden tell CNN they’re ruling out runs and warning others to follow suit.\n\nThe chatter is fed by Democratic officials and party leaders who have begun to doubt that Biden is, as he’s insisted privately to donors and others, their strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump – or another GOP candidate – in 2024. And it’s being propelled even more by the 79-year-old President’s age, which has prompted questions about what kind of campaign schedule he’d be able to keep up.\n\nFear runs deep of yet another unfavorable Biden comparison to Jimmy Carter, who survived a 1980 primary challenge from Ted Kennedy but not the lasting wound going into the general election. Democrats privately hoping Biden might reverse course and not run are petrified that they’re backbiting their way into allowing Trump and Trumpism back into power.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped muted worries from going around the West Wing, according to four aides familiar with the conversations, that someone may yet emerge ahead of the President’s planned spring 2023 formal reelection campaign launch. Biden advisers expect to stick to that no matter what happens, including if Trump decides to jump in early.\n\n“Nothing about our timeline changes, but we’re prepared if he decides to run,” one person familiar with the Biden team’s political planning said about Trump.\n\nBut even Rep. Ro Khanna, the California congressman and former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair, who first won his seat by beating an incumbent in a primary, said he won’t entertain the thought of jumping in against Biden, although he’s aware he’s being whispered about – so much that a close friend had a dream over July Fourth weekend that he did it.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Khanna told CNN. “I plan to support (Biden) because of the danger that Donald Trump poses. I would certainly not do anything to weaken him, and I hope no one else will do anything to weaken him. He’s still the safe brand in the midwestern states to make sure Trump is kept far away from the Oval Office.”\n\nThat also goes for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been causing the most antsy whispers from the Biden orbit with his comments calling out a lack of Democratic action and energy and his buying a July Fourth ad in Florida hitting Gov. Ron DeSantis, a prospective 2024 GOP candidate. Newsom, who’s facing reelection in November, compared the Democratic dynamics to those he initially faced in his recall election last year, when he and advisers worked to scare off several Democrats who’d looked at jumping in against him.\n\n“The success of our recall was about unifying around our party and defining the opposition. We need to unify the Democratic Party and not destroy ourselves from within,” Newsom said. “We need to have our President’s back. But we also have to get on the field. He needs troops. He has to govern. Our job is to organize, and it’s to have his back.”\n\nThe same goes for J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire first-term Illinois governor who also drew some behind-the-scenes brushback from Biden world by delivering a speech about his exhaustion with the Democratic status quo in famous first-presidential primary state New Hampshire. The Democrat, who’s running for a second term in November, lit up even more speculation with his response to the Highland Park shooting in his state earlier this month, which was more forceful than Biden’s.\n\nBiden “has said he’s running for reelection and I support that,” Pritzker told CNN, adding that though he thinks some other opponent may yet emerge, Biden “will win the nomination, and yet, it’ll be Ted Kennedy running against Jimmy Carter … They will lose and they will take away from the President. That’s not what we need right now.”\n\nThe speculation is at a high enough fever that when Pete Buttigieg’s PAC reactivated on Twitter at the end of June to endorse a few candidates for US House and state legislature, several plugged-in operatives began to wonder if this was the first step in the transportation secretary relaunching as a candidate. His attendance at Democratic National Committee events and meetings with a few potential future donors only sparked more talk.\n\nBut there’s nothing to that, according to a Transportation Department spokesperson, who said, “Buttigieg has had no involvement in Win the Era PAC since his nomination as Secretary. He is 100 percent focused on his job at DOT, including implementing President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.”\n\nSome have talked about Jared Polis, the Colorado governor known for straying from what became Democratic orthodoxy on Covid-19 lockdowns and is facing voters this fall. He has a personal fortune, several operatives noted, and while not enough to self-fund, enough to possibly seed a campaign and feel confident that he wouldn’t have to worry about endangering future job prospects. Polis campaign spokesperson Amber Miller said he’s “not considering anything like that and is focused on running the state of Colorado. If he is re-elected, he plans to serve his entire term as governor of Colorado.”\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has repeatedly said Biden intends to run and that she’d be his running mate, and no one around her or anywhere else believes she’d be able to pull off a campaign that started by breaking with him.\n\nSanders, the Vermont senator who has twice sought the Democratic nod, told CNN last month he would not run against Biden. A spokesperson for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, told CNN that nothing has changed since the Massachusetts Democrat told NBC News that she’s not running for president in 2024 and would be supporting Biden. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ top political adviser and former campaign manager, said trying to run by appealing to his wing of the party “would be an almost insurmountable climb to get to the top of that mountain, given that Bernie has said he’s going to be supporting Joe Biden if he runs for re-election.”\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated a member of Democratic House leadership to come to Congress, told late night host Stephen Colbert at the end of June that she was more focused on preserving American democracy than presidential speculation.\n\nBut she’s also held off on saying she would support Biden for reelection, noting that the President hasn’t said he’s running himself.\n\nAsked by CNN if that left space for her to consider running a youthful, progressive primary against him, a spokesperson for the congresswoman didn’t return requests for comment.\n\nFacing a ‘soft’ primary\n\nCarter-Kennedy isn’t the only historical example on Democrats’ minds. There’s Ronald Reagan’s bruising 1976 primary campaign against Republican President Gerald Ford, which helped pave the way for Carter’s win. Or George H.W. Bush never quite recovering from Pat Buchanan’s 1992 primary campaign, which hurt him with the GOP base heading into the general election.\n\nSeveral senior Democrats, though, cited 1968, when President Lyndon Johnson faced a primary challenge from Eugene McCarthy. Eventually, other candidates jumped in, leading the President to withdraw that March from running for reelection.\n\nOperatives around a number of prospective presidential candidates argue that Biden is already facing a “soft” primary challenge from many directions. The goal, they say, is not to run against Biden, but rather to implicitly reassure the President that Democrats have other good options from the next generation or two, and that he should be comfortable passing the torch to them.\n\nThe other goal is for Democrats to get as ready as they can, on the chance that Biden drags out his reelection decision and then changes his mind so late into the presidential cycle that other candidates are hobbled in launching campaigns and raising money.\n\nFor all the free media attention that would come from declaring a primary campaign against Biden, no one seems to want to go down as blowing a hole in the party for Republicans to march back through – particularly at a moment when apocalyptic feelings are so high. This is about future ambitions, too: Those would-be candidates are aware Democratic voters would never forgive a spoiler.\n\n“It’s about us having his back, not taking back some wing of the party,” Newsom said. “It’s about everybody disabusing ourselves that we have the luxury of division from within.”\n\n“I believe there will be plenty of time post-Donald Trump to debate the future of the Democratic Party,” Khanna said. “For people who have future ambition, they’d much rather be running in a post-Donald Trump and post-Joe Biden world.”\n\nBarack Obama faced a flurry of primary speculation at about this point ahead of his own reelection campaign 12 years ago – to the point that Gallup tested how well he’d do if Hillary Clinton ran against him, and Sanders started poking around in New Hampshire about jumping in against him.\n\nMany of the Democratic leaders, operatives and donors who spoke to CNN about having these conversations insist it’s precisely their fear of Trump beating Biden that is driving them to cast around for possible other options.\n\nNot only is Biden now clocking lower approval ratings than almost every Democratic governor and senator on the ballot in November, but several internal Democratic polls have shown him struggling against Trump in battleground states.\n\nAsked if he understood what was generating the talk of a primary challenge that he thinks may yet emerge, Pritzker paused. First, he reiterated his support of Biden. Then, he repeated his call for more energy and action, without mentioning the President specifically.\n\n“We absolutely need to be stronger and louder in our condemnation of the right wing and what they stand for, and in our defense of the liberties of women and those who are marginalized,” Pritzker said. “There is a palpable change in attitude among Democrats.”\n\nPushing back on the nudging\n\nBefore he launched his 2020 campaign, Biden advisers had bounced around the idea of a one-term pledge as a way to answer questions about his age. Biden nixed the idea, saying he’d never be able to get anything done as an immediate lame duck. He’s made similar comments about what would happen to his power at home and on the world stage if he were to announce he’s not running for reelection.\n\nFew around Biden see that changing. Some even suggested that a primary challenger could inadvertently help him recover from approval numbers stuck below 40% by giving him a foil. If that challenge came from the left and allowed him to argue he hasn’t kowtowed to progressives – as Republicans and some Democratic moderates claim – several operatives said that would be even better.\n\nBut as White House aides regularly point out, no incumbent president has launched a reelection campaign this early, and Biden was the last serious primary contender to announce a 2020 campaign, pushing back on those who urged him to declare earlier.\n\n“There’s nobody who’s more infamous about his inability to make a decision about running for president of the United States,” joked one Democratic member of Congress, who asked not to be named. “And hey, he’s President.”\n\nAnd while four years ago at this same point ahead of the 2020 cycle, the Democratic National Committee was deep into preparations for primaries and debates, no such efforts are underway.\n\nLong before he became famous for managing Howard Dean’s anti-establishment 2004 presidential campaign (in what was an open Democratic field), Joe Trippi was a young aide to Kennedy’s 1980 primary challenge, running the floor operation for several states on the floor of the convention that summer.\n\nTrippi said he hopes anyone thinking of a Biden primary realizes it would be “murder-suicide,” and warned his fellow Democrats: “Nothing good can come from it.”\n\n“I learned that lesson the hard way as a young idealistic progressive in the late 70s early 80s,” Trippi said. “What we got for it was eight years of Reagan and four years of H.W. Bush.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}]}

And supplies could run out if temperatures dropped very low, he said, “in which case then, what you would do is you’d shut down industry”.\n\nBloomberg also warned earlier this month that “temperatures this winter will ripple through every conceivable market, from fuel to food”.\n\nA “particularly frigid outcome” would threaten to turn the current global energy crunch into a “full-blown crisis”, the news site said. The “stakes have never been higher”, with households and businesses in a string of countries potentially facing “crippling heating bills”.\n\nPutting the brr in Britain\n\nThe past year has made the Met Office’s history books for some of the chilliest UK weather on record. On 11 February, “extreme cold” temperatures of below -20C – lower than the temperature recommended “for the inside of a domestic freezer”, the weather service noted – were reported at three different weather stations. Braemer in Scotland recorded -23C, the lowest in the UK since 1995.\n\nEven the so-called Beast from the East in 2018 didn’t bring such low temperatures, in spite of “all its roar”, said the Met.\n\nBut this year’s cold snap was by no means the most extreme in modern UK history. In January 1982, Braemar saw the mercury drop to -27.2C. The same temperature was recorded more than a decade later, in December 1995, in the Scottish hamlet of Altnaharra.\n\nMercury readings are not the only indicator used to determine cold weather. The Met Office issues alerts for severe winter weather not only if mean temperatures sink to 2C or less, but also if there is widespread ice and heavy snowfall.\n\nTwo years after the end of the Second World War, “thousands of people” across the country were “cut off for days” by snowdrifts of up to seven metres, according to Met Office records. For 55 consecutive days in the first quarter of 1947, snowfall was recorded somewhere in the UK, and “breaks in the cold weather were short-lived”.", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2021/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/953574/worlds-most-extreme-weather-events-2021", "title": "The most extreme weather events in 2021 | The Week UK", "text": "This year was regarded by scientists, politicians and environmentalists as pivotal in the global effort to take action on climate change.\n\nStark warnings and alarming forecasts were issued, as regions that were previously not considered to be on the frontline of climate change saw unprecedented weather events destroy homes and claim lives. As mercury levels in Moscow hit record-breaking highs in June, the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was reaching a “point of no return”\n\nIn August, Boris Johnson described the latest global assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a “wake-up call to the world”. The “most comprehensive” climate report from the panel issued a “code red for humanity”, said The Independent, and stated the link between global warming and the increased rate and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nClimate scientist Professor Hannah Cloke said that this year’s extreme weather events “ought to serve as a canary in the coal mine to spur faster action to adapt society to the reality of a changing climate”.\n\nHere are some of the most costly weather incidents recorded so far this year.\n\nRecord-breaking snowfall, Madrid In the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\nStorm Christoph, UK The period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\nCyclone Ana, Fiji Cyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\nWinter storms, Texas The Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\nDust storm, China Flights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\nFlooding, New South Wales In March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\nCyclone Seroja In April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\nRecord temperatures, Moscow As temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\nHeat dome, Pacific Northwest Soaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”.

This poses a grave threat to rivers and, as a result, the wider landscape.”\n\nShe added that the country needed to build resilience against the future climate.\n\n“This means detecting household leaks, fixing mains infrastructure leaks, more efficient water use domestically plus implementing sustainable drainage solutions as part of desperately needed green infrastructure,” Colvin said.\n\nThe shift in the river’s headwaters comes as authorities in England warn that the nation could officially fall into drought at some point in August.\n\nA view of Tower Bridge, spanning the River Thames in London.

I said good news. But trust me, it is good. The past weekend’s temperatures were in the low 90s by lunchtime and by the late afternoon were pushing over the triple-digit mark.\n\nPower outages due to the heat were reported in the region, forcing people to find other ways to stay cool.\n\nAnd then there was the humidity this weekend, which made it feel even worse.\n\nThe good news is after the storms push through, today’s temperatures will moderate through the end of the week.\n\n“The stifling heat that enveloped much of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend will be on its last leg today as daytime highs make one last run at the low to mid 90s from central Virginia on north to southern New England,” the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nIt won’t be cool, but it should be slightly better than this past weekend.\n\nTriple-digit heat will still linger in the southern Plains.\n\nDallas is having its third-hottest summer on record.

Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nLondon got so warm this summer that newspapers splashed with headlines saying temperatures in the city had exceeded those of scorching hot Dubai.\n\nOne after another, European countries such as Spain and Portugal registered record highs this year.\n\nThe northern hemisphere did indeed witness record temperatures, with wildfires engulfing parts of Europe and drought threatening food supplies. And, often, European cities witnessed hotter conditions than those in the Persian Gulf.\n\nBut experts say that temperature alone isn’t an adequate measure of the livability of a city – a combination of heat and humidity is. And that’s why the Middle East is far less livable than Europe even at the same temperatures.\n\nThe Middle East is still quite hot. The Iranian city of Abadan set the record for the hottest dry heat temperature this year when it hit 53 degrees Celsius (127 degrees Fahrenheit) on August 5. But combine that with the high levels of humidity in the region and it becomes an even more inhospitable place for human beings. It’s harder to cool down when the weather is humid, as our bodies struggle to transfer their heat to “wet” air rather than dry air, making it harder to sweat it out and lower our body temperatures.\n\nThe measure of heat combined with humidity is called the wet bulb temperature. The name stems from the way this condition is measured, literally by wrapping a wet cloth around a thermometer and measuring the temperature as the water evaporates.\n\nThis speaks directly to our body’s ability to cool itself through sweating.\n\n“The wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be reached by evaporative cooling,” Tapio Schneider, a professor of environmental science and engineering at the California Institute of Technology, told CNN.\n\nThe Middle East is especially vulnerable to rising global temperatures. “The region is already warm and can be humid,” he said. “Therefore, global warming can push it into the zone where human health is endangered.”\n\nOn July 19, the UK experienced its hottest day on record, surpassing temperatures of 40C for the first time, with a high of 40.3C in eastern England. On the same day, average temperatures in both London and Dubai were 34C – but the wet bulb temperature in London was 20C, while Dubai was a more painful 27C.\n\nThe Persian Gulf is one of the few places in the world ever to record a wet bulb temperature that exceeds the threshold of human survivability, 35C. Since 2005, there have been nine separate occasions of this on record.\n\nA wet bulb temperature of 35C means the body can no longer cool itself to a temperature that can maintain normal functions.\n\n“It is a hard threshold for survivability in that independent of age and fitness, humans cannot survive in those conditions; they will die within hours without special exertion,” said Schneider.\n\nWet bulb temperatures just under 35C aren’t ideal either. “Humans experience heat stress at lower wet bulb temperatures too,” he said. “And the degree to which they can survive such heat stress does depend on fitness, age, and pre-existing conditions.”\n\nThe oil-rich Arab states of the Persian Gulf have equipped themselves against the heat, with energy-intensive air conditioning, but other regional countries haven’t been as privileged.\n\nIn Iraq, employees in the city of Basra were asked to stay home due to high temperatures earlier this month. However, households only get up to 10 hours of electricity from the national grid, with those who can afford it paying private generator providers to cover the other hours.\n\nIn Gaza, residents cool off in the three to four hours of electricity they get per day, suffering for periods of up to 20 hours with no electricity daily. Similarly, Lebanon’s government no longer provides more than two hours of electricity per day.\n\nAnd even in some Gulf Arab states, such as Kuwait, where there is a building boom, access to air conditioning isn’t available to all, including construction workers toiling outdoors.\n\nResearch by Purdue University found that at around a wet bulb temperature of 32C, it becomes impossible even for healthy people to work outdoors, with physical labor having a limit of 31C.\n\nAn MIT simulation found that if the current pace of greenhouse emissions remains constant in the Persian Gulf, annual maximum wet bulb temperatures in cities such as Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Doha would exceed the threshold for human survivability (35C) several times a year by the end of the century.\n\nThe digest\n\nSaudi activist gets 34 years in prison for Twitter activity\n\nSaudi women’s rights campaigner Salma al-Shehab, 33, was sentenced to 34 years in prison on Monday for publishing “false and tendentious rumors on Twitter,” according to independent human rights organization ALQST and court documents viewed by CNN.\n\nBackground: Al-Shehab, a PhD student at Leeds University in the United Kingdom, was arrested in January 2021 and subjected to questioning sessions over a period of 265 days before being brought to the Specialized Criminal Court, ALQST said in a statement. The mother of two was initially given a six-year sentence late last year which was increased to 34 years after al-Shehab filed an appeal, according to court documents. The charges filed against her by the Public Prosecution included “providing succor to those seeking to disrupt public order and undermine the safety of the general public and stability of the state, and publishing false and tendentious rumors on Twitter,” ALQST added.\n\nWhy it matters: Al-Shehab’s prison sentence is the longest ever for a peaceful activist in the kingdom’s history, according to ALQST. Lina Al-Hathloul, the organization’s head of Monitoring and Communications, told CNN that al-Shehab had been arrested for supporting her sister Loujain al-Hathloul, a prominent activist who spent more than 1,000 days in jail. Lina Al-Hathloul said in the ALQST statement that al-Shehab’s sentence “makes a mockery of the Saudi authorities’ claims of reform for women and of the legal system,” adding that it “shows that they remain hellbent on harshly punishing anyone who expresses their opinions freely.”\n\nIsraeli army raids Palestinian civil society organizations in the West Bank\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) raided seven offices belonging to five Palestinian civil society organizations in the West Bank on Thursday morning, according to Israel’s Ministry of Defense.\n\nBackground: The five groups had been labeled as terrorist organizations by the Israeli government last year, which accused them of acting “undercover on the international front on behalf of the ‘Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),’ to support its activity and further its goals.” The Palestine Liberation Organization condemned the move, saying it will appeal to human rights organizations “to intervene immediately and condemn the closure of non-governmental organizations and pressure to reopen them.”\n\nWhy it matters: The move drew dismay and protests from international organizations. B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights watchdog, condemned the raids and described Israel’s accusations as false. “We will continue to work with our colleagues in the Palestinian NGOs to dismantle the apartheid regime,” a statement from the organization said. Although not directly connected, the news also comes after the worst bout of violence between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants since a brief war last May. Earlier in August, more than 40 Palestinian militants and civilians, including 15 children, were killed during two and a half days of fighting, after Israel launched strikes on targets of the Islamic Jihad militant group in Gaza. Palestinian militants launched more than 1,000 rockets back toward Israel.\n\nTurkey’s Erdogan meets with Ukraine’s Zelensky and UN chief\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart Volodomyr Zelensky and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in the Ukrainian city of Lviv on Thursday, expressed concerns about the ongoing conflict around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, warning of the danger of “a new Chernobyl.”\n\nBackground: Ministers from Ukraine and Russia signed an agreement to unblock Ukrainian Black Sea ports, which was brokered by the UN and Turkey in Istanbul on July 22 amid concerns over a global food crisis. Urging Russia and Ukraine to find “the shortest and the fairest way to the negotiating table,” the Turkish leader said on Thursday: “I maintain my belief that the war will eventually end at the negotiating table. In fact, [Zelensky] and Guterres echo this view.” Zelensky responded by saying he was surprised by Erdogan’s suggestion and that he has “no faith in the Russian Federation.” “The people who are killing, raping, dropping rockets on our civilian infrastructures every day cannot want peace, so they have to free our territories first,” the Ukrainian President added.\n\nWhy it matters: Turkey has been hosting talks between delegates from Russia and Ukraine for months now, and Erdogan has been vying for a mediation role in the conflict. That role was seemingly elevated after Ankara helped broker the deal to allow exports of grain from the blockaded Ukrainian ports. In the process, Erdogan has been engaged in a strategic balancing act between Russia on one side, and Ukraine and the West on the other. At Thursday’s meeting in Lviv, the Turkish President said, “We are ready to act as a facilitator or mediator towards the goal of reviving the negotiations over the parameters that took form in Istanbul.”\n\nWhat to watch\n\nClimate change and poor water management are causing alarming droughts across the globe, drying up lakes that once flowed with abundant fresh water. Israel is hopeful, however, that by desalinating sea water from the Mediterranean, it can pump back fresh water into lakes across the country.\n\nWatch the full report here:\n\nIsrael will take the salt out of seawater and pump it in into the drying Sea of Galilee https://t.co/qXxQTq0T5u pic.twitter.com/HjtAkY4N1Z — CNN International (@cnni) August 19, 2022\n\nAround the region\n\nThe Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art was forced to temporarily close due to insect infestation, the museum said in a statement and apology on Wednesday.\n\nThe news broke after a video posted on the BBC Persian website went viral. It showed two silverfish crawling under the glass of a famous photograph taken by influential German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher.\n\n“The treasure works of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Arts, national wealth and their proper maintenance are the most important concern of all of us, and the attention and sensitivity of the Iranian art family is a valuable asset,” the statement said.\n\nOnce the museum became aware of the situation, pest control technicians rushed over to tackle the problem, it said. “Fortunately, this work was not damaged, and no insects were seen in the other works of the exhibition,” it continued.\n\nThe statement said that experts will be fumigating the building’s exterior spaces, as it is likely the insects entered from outside.\n\nThe Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is one of the largest art museums in the country, carrying large collections of both Iranian and Western paintings. After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, many of the renowned Western art pieces were stored and hidden in the museum vault for decades. Now, the museum frequently displays artwork from around the world, including the United States and Europe.\n\nBy Zeena Saifi\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Mohammed Abdelbary"], "publish_date": "2022/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/history/2018/01/24/heres-what-made-great-blizzard-1978-so-devastating/1056978001/", "title": "Cincinnati weather: Here's what made the Great Blizzard so ...", "text": "The winter of 1977 was colder. Three other storms dumped more snow on Cincinnati. So, what made the Great Blizzard of 1978 so devastating?\n\nThe storm that struck more tha40 years ago brought snow — just under seven inches fell in Cincinnati on Jan. 26 and 27. But there was already a huge pile of snow on the ground. The snow was 14 inches deep on Jan. 21.\n\nThen, the blizzard brought near-hurricane strength wind gusts that heaped the snow into enormous drifts. Some snowdrifts reached 15 to 25 feet in height, whipped up by 60 mph winds. Visibility was zero.\n\nThe winds resulted from an \"explosive intensification of a surface low-pressure system moving north from the Gulf Coast into Kentucky and Ohio,\" according to the National Weather Service in Wilmington.\n\nBomb cyclone.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it's because the same thing happened in 2018 on the East Coast. Fox19 Chief Meteorologist Steve Horstmeyer said the weather phenomenon — also called \"snow hurricane\" or \"bombogenesis\" — hit Cincinnati hard.\n\n\"It exploded so very very quickly and strongly that Cincinnati saw snow that was falling as slushy snow, freeze as the temperature plummeted,\" Horstmeyer said.\n\nThough bomb cyclones typically happening on the coast, they can happen anywhere.\n\n\"This would have been of historic proportions, there's no doubt about that,\" Horstmeyer said.\n\nMore than 70 people died in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana as a result of the epic storm, according to the weather service.\n\nBlizzard conditions arrived in Cincinnati around 1 a.m. Jan 26 with an arctic airmass pushing in. By 7 a.m., Cleveland was engulfed.\n\nTemperatures plunged into the single digits with wind chills around minus 50 degrees.\n\n\"An ore carrier stranded in thick ice on Lake Erie just offshore from Sandusky reported sustained winds of 86 mph with gusts to 111 mph that morning!\" according to an NWS report.\n\nThousands of trees and many miles of electric and telephone lines were blown down. Hundreds of thousands of homes were left without power and heat, and means of communication.\n\nRoofs collapsed under the weight of the snow. Cars were buried. Interstate 75 was closed for three days.\n\nThe Red Cross and armed forces stepped in to help get food to people. Helicopters were called in for medical help. And volunteers with snowmobiles and four-wheel drive vehicles helped move medical crews.\n\n\"College students mingled with business travelers at the airport to wait it out,\" according to one Enquirer account. \"Some roads, like Mason-Montgomery in Warren County, had been plowed so many times with so much buildup on the sides that they were tunnels.\"\n\nAnd, yes, the river \"was a jumble of giant blocks of ice,\" The Enquirer's Jim Rohrer wrote in 2011.\n\n\"Many people claim to have driven cars across it in '78, but only a few did,\" Rohrer wrote.\n\nWinter records set\n\nThe winter of 1978 was a record-breaker.\n\nSeasonal snowfall record: 53.9 inches of snow fell in winter of 1977-78\n\nMonthly snowfall record: 31.5 inches of snow fell in January 1978\n\nLongest stretch with 1 or more inches of snow on the ground: 63 days from Jan. 8 through March 11\n\nLongest stretch with 5 or more inches of snow on the ground: 43 days from Jan. 13 through Feb. 24, 1978.\n\nLongest stretch with 10 or more inches of snow on the ground: 10 days from Jan. 16-25\n\nWhat caused the blizzard\n\nThis storm was the result of a relatively rare merger of two upper-level waves (one over Texas and one over the Northern Plains) that caused an explosive intensification of a surface low-pressure system moving north from the Gulf Coast into Kentucky and Ohio.\n\nThe massive storm system produced some of the lowest pressure readings ever recorded in the United States mainland that were not associated with hurricanes. In fact, several weather stations in the storm's path had to readjust their barographs as station pressures fell below the initial chart scale.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 1978, the barometric pressure dropped to 28.81 inches at Cincinnati. Even more impressive was Cleveland's record low-pressure reading of 28.28 inches, which remains the lowest pressure ever recorded in Ohio and one of the lowest pressure readings on record within the mainland United States (not associated with a hurricane).\n\nSource: National Weather Service in Wilmington", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/07/19/heat-wave-uvalde-school-shooting-response-missouri-sign-war-nomi-health-its-tuesdays-news/10096410002/", "title": "Heat wave, Uvalde school shooting response, Missouri sign war ...", "text": "100 million Americans are under heat warnings this week.

Those lockdowns had fostered a culture of complacency at the school, it said.

Even at just nine-tenths of a cent, it was the biggest single-day decline in gas prices since August 2021.\n\nOf course, gas prices remain historically high. Before last week, the record high had been $4.11 a gallon, a level first reached in 2008. Last week, gas set four records in a row before prices stayed virtually unchanged through the weekend and Monday.\n\nThe drop in retail gas prices follows a sharper drop in oil prices in Monday trading as prices fell 8%. If oil prices stay at this level, there could be more meaningful relief on the way at the pump, perhaps as much as 20 cents a gallon, predicted Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Analysis, which tracks gasoline prices for AAA. But it’s not surprising the drop in gasoline prices has trailed the drop in oil prices.\n\n“Gasoline prices can go up like a rocket and come down like a feather,” said Kloza.\n\nEven if drivers get that 20 cent a gallon break at the pump, it’s not likely to last.\n\nUS demand for gasoline is likely to increase, especially with record job gains over the last year and more workers who had been working from home returning to the office.\n\nKloza said as the summer driving season approaches and the United States switches over to a more expensive summer blend of gasoline meant to fight smog and pollution, prices are likely to rise to about $4.50 a gallon.\n\nThere are two factors that could limit the rise in oil and gasoline prices: one good, one bad.\n\nThe good one would be peace in Ukraine, especially a peace that led to the lifting of sanctions on Russia by the United States and many other western nations. Hopes of peace negotiations Monday in part helped to drive down oil prices.\n\nRussia is the one of the largest exporters of oil in the world. Although relatively little Russian oil reaches US customers, oil is priced in global commodity markets. So the disruption to its flow of its oil had sent prices soaring.\n\nThe bad news that could drive down prices would be a new surge of Covid-19, forcing countries that had been opening up to reimpose restrictions on businesses and individuals. China imposed new lockdowns over the weekend because of a Covid surge. That was one of the factors in the drop in oil prices on Monday, according to analysts.\n\nThe run-up in gas prices so far this year has been historic, at times achieving the the steepest rate of increase since Hurricane Katrina hit the US Gulf Coast in 2005, devastating oil platforms and refineries in the region. The average US price rose 78 cents, or 22%, since February 23, the day before Russia invaded Ukraine.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/energy/record-gas-price-causes/index.html", "title": "Why US gas prices are at a record and why they'll stay high for a ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is a major reason that US drivers are paying record prices for gasoline. But it’s not the only reason.\n\nNumerous factors are combining to push gas prices up to a record. Gas hit $4.25 for a gallon of regular gas, according to AAA’s survey Wednesday.\n\nGas prices were already expected to breach the $4 a gallon mark for the first time since 2008, with or without shots fired or economic sanctions imposed in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe good news for drivers is that crude oil prices have been falling in recent days, amid concerns that China keeping Covid lockdowns in place to combat will continue to hurt oil demand. Gas prices could be near their highest point for the month, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, which tracks gas prices for AAA.\n\nBut prices aren’t likely to fall much whenever they do start to retreat. And Kloza expects they could once again set a record after schools let out and drivers start hitting the road for vacations next month.\n\nThe national average price could easily hit $4.50 a gallon or even higher this summer, he believes. “Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said.\n\nHere’s what’s behind the record price surge:\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia is one of the largest oil exporters on the planet. In December it sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets, 5 million of them as crude oil.\n\nVery little of that went to the United States. Europe got 60% of the oil and 20% went to China in 2021. But oil is priced on global commodity markets, so the loss of Russian oil affects oil prices around the globe, no matter where it is used.\n\nThe concerns about disrupting global markets led western nations to initially exempt Russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they put in place to protest the invasion.\n\nOn Tuesday the United States announced a formal ban on all Russian energy imports. The UK government said it, too, will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 and explore ways of ending natural gas imports.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This is what determines the price of gas 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\nLess oil and gasoline from other sources\n\nWhen pandemic-related stay-at-home orders around the world crushed demand for oil in the spring of 2020, oil plunged, briefly trading at negative prices. OPEC and its allies, including Russia, agreed to slash production as a way to support prices. Even when demand returned sooner than expected, they kept production targets low.\n\nUS oil companies don’t follow those types of nationally mandated production targets. But they have been reluctant or unable to resume producing oil at pre-pandemic levels amid concerns about the prospect of tougher environmental rules that could cut future demand. Many of those tougher rules have been scaled back or failed to become law.\n\n“The Biden administration is suddenly interested in more drilling, not less,” said Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group. “People are more worried about high oil prices than anything else.”\n\nIt takes time to scale up production, particularly when oil companies are facing the same supply chain and hiring challenges as thousands of other US businesses.\n\n“They can’t find people, and can’t find equipment,” McNally added. “It’s not like they’re available at a premium price. They’re just not available.”\n\nOil stocks have generally lagged the broader market over the last two years, at least until the recent run-up in prices. Oil company executives wanted to redirect cash to buying back stock and other ways to help their share price rather than increase production.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nOne of the starkest examples: ExxonMobil (XOM) last month announced first quarter profits of $8.8 billion, more than triple the level of a year ago when excluding special items. It also announced a $30 billion share repurchase plan, far more than the $21 billion to $24 billion it expects to spend on all capital investment, including searching for new oil.\n\nNot only is oil production lagging behind pre-pandemic levels, there’s also less US refining capacity. Today, about 1 million fewer barrels of oil a day are available to be broken into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum-based products.\n\nState and federal environmental rules are prompting some refineries to switch from oil to lower carbon renewable fuels. And some companies are closing older refineries rather than invest the money it would cost to retool to keep them operating, especially with massive new refineries set to open overseas in Asia, the Middle East and Africa in 2023.\n\nAnd major US refineries have yet to return to full operation after two were damaged by hurricanes last year and another by an explosion.\n\n“Economics mandate you make more jet and diesel fuel to the detriment of gasoline,” said Kloza.\n\nStrong demand for gasoline\n\nRecord job gains in 2021, and the strongest economic growth since 1984, have combined to fuel the rebound in driving, as did pent-up demand for travel after the first year of the pandemic.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How to save money on gas by being more fuel efficient 01:40 - Source: CNN\n\nThe US economy had record job growth in 2021, and while those gains have slowed, they remain historically strong. Demand is getting another boost as the many employees who have been working from home for much of the last two years return to the office.\n\nThe start of the summer travel season on Memorial Day weekend is likely to spark the typical annual increases in demand for gas and jet fuel. US airlines all report very strong bookings for summer travel, even with airfares climbing above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe end of the Omicron surge and the removal of many Covid restrictions is encouraging people to get out of the house for more shopping, entertainment and travel well. US trips in passenger vehicles have increased 25% since the beginning of this year, according to the mobility research firm Inrix.\n\nThere may not be quite as much commuting as before the pandemic. Many who plan to return to the office will be there only three or four days a week, rather than five. The total number of jobs is still slightly below 2019 levels.\n\n“Even before Ukraine, I was expecting to break the record,” Kloza said. “Now it’s a question of how much we break the record by.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}]}

That’s why I came here,” Lee said.\n\nNearby was Mandy Lee, who flew from Hong Kong to see Jin off.\n\n“We wish him all the best and stay safe and healthy and we will wait him the 18 months,” she said.\n\nMilitary service is compulsory in South Korea, where almost all able-bodied men are required to serve in the army for 18 months by the time they are 28 years old.\n\nSouth Korea’s parliament passed a bill in 2020 allowing pop stars – namely those who “excel in popular culture and art” – to defer their service until the age of 30.\n\nIn October, BTS’ record label said that all seven members of the group were planning to undertake military service. BTS is expected to reconvene as a group around 2025, according to BIGHIT Music.\n\nJin’s service will begin with a five-week basic training course before being assigned to a unit, based on standard practice.\n\nKim Seok-jin, 20, from Daejon, the exact same name as the musical superstar, poses for pictures at Yeoncheon, South Korea, on December 13, 2022.

Military officials said Jin would get limited access to his cell phone at the weekend.\n\nOne thing Jin and the other recruits may appreciate is the food, Park said, adding: “We were given a lot of snacks during the training – beef jerky, butter waffle snacks, and drinks.”\n\nOnce integrated into South Korea’s forces, Jin will be one of about 560,000 army troops, according to the South Korean army website.\n\nThe military base in Yeoncheon, South Korea, on December 13, 2022.

Their enlistments have prompted a fierce domestic debate over whether it’s time to revise the country’s conscription system to expand exemptions to include prominent entertainers like BTS, or not to provide such benefits to anyone.\n\nWith lawmakers squabbling at Parliament and surveys showing sharply split public opinions over offering exemptions to BTS members, their management agency said in October that all BTS members would perform their compulsory military duties. Big Hit Music said that both the company and the members of BTS “are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment.”\n\nJin, who turned 30 earlier this month, entered the boot camp at Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, for five weeks of basic military training together with other new conscript soldiers, the Defense Ministry said. After the training involving rifle shooting, grenade throwing and marching practices, he and other conscripts would be assigned to army units across the country.\n\nPrevious:BTS to serve mandatory military duties in South Korea, will regroup as a band in 2025\n\nBTS takes on the White House:K-pop stars to meet Biden, discuss Asian representation\n\nAbout 20-30 fans — some holding Jin’s photos — and dozens of journalists gathered near the camp. But Jin didn’t meet them as a vehicle carrying him moved into the boot camp without getting him out.\n\nA couple dozen fans could be seen as a small turnout given Jin’s huge popularity. But Jin and his management agency had earlier asked fans not to visit the site and notified them there wouldn’t be any special event involving the singer, in order to prevent any issue caused by crowding.\n\nAuthorities still mobilized 300 police officers, soldiers, emergency workers and others to maintain order and guard against any accidents, according to the army. Strict safety steps were expected as South Korea is still reeling from the devastating Halloween crush in October in Seoul that killed 158 people.\n\nHours before entering the camp, Jin — whose real name is Kim Seok-jin — wrote on the online fan platform Weverse that “It’s time for a curtain call.” He posted a photo of himself Sunday with a military buzzcut and a message saying, “Ha ha ha. It’s cuter than I had expected.”\n\nBy law, all able-bodied South Korean men must serve in the military for 18-21 months under a conscription system established to deal with threats from North Korea. But the law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have won top prizes in certain competitions and enhance national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren’t given such benefits even if they gain worldwide fame and win big international awards.\n\n“Though BTS members have opted to go to the military, there are still some sort of regrets,” said Jung Duk-hyun, a pop culture commentator. “Those in the pop culture sector experience little bit of disadvantages and unfairness, compared with those in the pure art sector or athletes. This will likely continue to be an issue of controversy so I wonder if it must be discussed continuously.”\n\nExemptions or dodging of duties are a highly sensitive issue in South Korea, where the draft forces young men to suspend their studies or professional careers. Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup and Lee Ki Sik, head of South Korea’s enlistment office, previously said it would be “desirable” for BTS members to fulfill their military duties to ensure fairness in the country’s military service.\n\nChun In-bum, a retired lieutenant general who commanded South Korea’s special forces, said the government must move to repeal any exemptions as the military’s shrinking recruitment pool is “a very serious” problem amid the country’s declining fertility rate. He called a debate over BTS’s military service “unnecessary” as it wasn’t raised by BTS members, who have shown willingness in carrying out their duties.\n\nBTS on hiatus:South Korea leader says it's 'desirable' for BTS to serve military duties\n\nBTS was created in 2013 and has a legion of global supporters who call themselves the “Army.” Its other members are RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook, who is the youngest at 25. The group expanded its popularity in the West with its 2020 megahit “Dynamite,” the band’s first all-English song that made BTS the first K-pop act to top Billboard’s Hot 100. The band has performed in sold-out arenas around the world and was even invited to speak at United Nations meetings.\n\nHybe Corp., the parent company of Big Hit, said in October that each member of the band for the time being would focus on individual activities scheduled around their military service plans. In October, Jin released “The Astronaut,” a single co-written by Coldplay.\n\nJung, the commentator, said sold projects could give BTS members much-needed time to develop themselves after working together as a group for many years. But Cha Woo-jin, a K-pop commentator, said it’s unclear if BTS would enjoy the same popularity as a group when they get together again after finishing their military duties in a few years.\n\nIn August, Lee, the defense minister, said BTS members who are serving would likely be allowed to continue practicing and to join other non-serving BTS members in overseas group tours.\n\nCha said K-pop’s global influence wouldn’t be hurt much because of BTS members’ enlistments as they “appear to represent K-pop but aren’t everything of K-pop.” Chung agreed, saying that other K-pop groups like BLACKPINK, Stray Kids and aespa could rise further.\n\nMore:Elton John, more stars return to the White House under Biden.

He said his ministry will also look into various other factors such as BTS's economic impact, the importance of military service and overall national interest.\n\n'It's not wrong to be different':BTS talks inclusion at the White House\n\nAfter his comments created a stir, his ministry clarified in a statement that Lee ordered officials to examine whether such a survey is needed, rather than launch it immediately.\n\nIt said officials were asked to study details including which agency would be responsible for a survey, how long would it take and who exactly would be surveyed. The statement said if the survey is carried out, it will be done by a third organization, not by the ministry or related authorities, to ensure fairness.\n\nThe ministry said the results would be only one of the many factors determining BTS members' military status.\n\nMore:BTS 'not taking a hiatus' after video says otherwise, but members to focus on solo projects\n\nBy law, all able-bodied men in South Korea must serve 18-21 months in the military under a conscription system established to deal with threats from rival North Korea.

But now that House Democrats finally have access to six years of Trump’s taxes, speculation is growing about what could happen next. On one hand, there is mounting political pressure to share the information with the public, while on the other hand, Democrats are weighing the potential fallout if there’s not a treasure trove of financial entanglements as anticipated.\n\nHere’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.\n\n(You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily.

Nuclear fusion\n\nFor the first time, US scientists have successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, a source familiar with the project confirmed to CNN. The discovery would be a massive step in a decadeslong quest for a new form of clean energy that could eventually power your house and help end dependence on fossil fuels. Researchers have attempted for decades to recreate nuclear fusion – the result when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one – a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat. Scientists across the globe have been inching toward the achievement, but ultimately, it was the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that made the discovery. The US Department of Energy is expected to officially announce the breakthrough today.\n\n2. Winter storm\n\nAbout 15 million people in a dozen states are under winter weather alerts today as a massive coast-to-coast storm continues to head east. The storm system has already caused huge snowfalls in California and is on track to strengthen today, forecasts show. Meteorologists warn the storm will bring dangerous blizzard conditions in the Great Plains, icy weather in the upper Midwest, and severe storms along the Gulf Coast. Some areas inside the blizzard warnings could receive as much as 20 inches of snow, with winds strong enough to knock down tree limbs and cause power outages. Meanwhile, the southern end of the storm is expected to bring late-season tornadoes along with strong thunderstorms and large hail.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Winter storm crosses US 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Marriage bill\n\nPresident Joe Biden today will sign into law a bill passed last week by Congress that mandates federal recognition for same-sex and interracial marriages. The White House is planning to mark the occasion with a ceremony built to a scale that it believes is fitting for the moment, with one official saying it was planning to simply “go all out.” This comes a little more than 10 years after Biden shocked the country with an unexpected declaration in support of same-sex marriage for the first time in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Biden’s remarks in 2012 marked a stunning personal evolution for the then-vice president, who once as a senator had voted to block federal recognition of same-sex marriages and previously insisted that marriage should only take place between a man and a woman.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Lawmaker gets called out by her own nephew after tearful speech on House floor 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Covid vaccines\n\nAs the US approaches two years since its first Covid-19 vaccinations, a new study shows the vaccines have kept more than 18 million people out of the hospital and saved more than 3 million lives. Researchers from the Commonwealth Fund and Yale School of Public Health found that without Covid-19 vaccines, the nation would have had 1.5 times more infections, 3.8 times more hospitalizations and 4.1 times more deaths than it did between December 2020 and November 2022, according to the study. To date, Covid-19 has caused at least 99 million cases and more than 1 million deaths in the US, data from the CDC shows. The study estimates that the vaccinations were also a good financial bet, saving the US $1.15 trillion in medical costs.\n\n5. Immigration\n\nMore than 2,400 migrants crossed into the US near El Paso, Texas, daily over the weekend, a senior border official said, marking what he described as a “major surge in illegal crossings” in the region. Officials have been raising concerns that a wave of migrants will occur when the Trump-era border policy known as Title 42 ends on December 21. The Biden administration is asking Congress for more than $3 billion as it prepares for the end of the policy, according to a source familiar with the request. “The team has been working really hard to ensure we’re taking steps to manage the expiration of Title 42 and put in place a process that’s orderly and humane. And we believe in doing so, we can protect our security concerns,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday. Since March 2020, border officials have turned away migrants at the US-Mexico border more than 2 million times.\n\nHAPPENING LATER\n\nWorld Cup semifinals begin today\n\nThe 2022 World Cup semifinals kick off today with a highly anticipated match between Argentina and Croatia at 2 pm ET. Argentina and its star player Lionel Messi are just two matches away from winning the country’s first World Cup since 1986 – and Messi’s first in the famous blue and white shirt.

Kyrsten Sinema’s potential 2024 race if she runs for reelection in Arizona. After Sinema’s surprise decision to become an independent, Democratic leaders are trying to handle the politically fraught situation delicately because a misstep could have serious ramifications for their party. If Sinema runs for a second term but party leaders put their muscle behind a Democratic candidate instead, the electorate could splinter in the purple state and help Republicans win back a critical seat. Plus, backing a Democrat in the race could also risk alienating Sinema, whose decision to align with her former party essentially solidifies its 51-49 majority.\n\nTODAY’S WEATHER\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Heavy snow and ice for the North and severe storm threat for the South 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nCheck your local forecast here>>>\n\nAND FINALLY\n\nThis Turkish Ice Cream Doesn’t Melt\n\nThis ice cream doesn’t melt\n\nUnlike your typical scoop of ice cream, this version is sticky, stretchy, and most importantly – doesn’t melt.

Contesting a fourth final, Les Bleus is also attempting to become the first side to retain the World Cup since Brazil managed the feat 60 years ago.\n\nAccording to FIFA’s most recent rankings, Argentina is No. 3, while France is No. 4.\n\nArgentina's forward Lautaro Martinez celebrates after scoring his spot kick and defeating Netherlands in the penalty shootout. Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMessi vs. Mbappé\n\nThe match provides one last chance for the 35-year-old Lionel Messi to fulfill his lifelong dream of guiding Argentina to its third title.\n\nStanding in Messi’s way is his Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé, as France seeks to win back-to-back World Cup trophies.\n\nAfter a shock defeat by Saudi Arabia in its opening group game, Argentina’s World Cup campaign got off to the worst possible start.\n\nHowever, Lionel Scaloni’s team regrouped and in the following five matches rediscovered the form that saw Argentina go on a 36-match unbeaten run before that defeat by Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnd as so often before, the magical Messi has cast his spell over opposition teams at Qatar 2022, doing everything he has within his powers to ensure Argentina had the best chance possible to win a first World Cup title since 1986.\n\nThere was the touch and finish against Mexico in the group stages, the sublime pass to set up Argentina’s first goal against the Netherlands, and then a penalty and an assist that saw his country beat Croatia 3-0 in Tuesday’s semifinal.\n\nOn Sunday, Messi will have a final shot at winning – and lifting – the trophy, in front of some of the 40,000 Argentine fans estimated to have traveled to Qatar for this World Cup. Eight years ago, Messi and Argentina reached the final in the World Cup hosted by Brazil, but were beaten 1-0 by Germany.\n\nWhen asked whether Sunday’s game will be his last at a World Cup, Messi replied: “Yes. Surely yes. There’s a lot of years until the next one and I don’t think I have it in me and finishing like this is best.\n\nThe trophy is in touching distance for France, who took a win over Morocco and ousted them from the tournament Wednesday.

To finish my World Cup career playing my last game in a final.\n\n“Everything I’ve lived in this World Cup, what people experienced and how much the people back in Argentina are enjoying it all is very emotional,” he said.\n\nAlong the way Messi has been ably assisted by striker Julian Alvarez, who scored two of the three goals to overpower Croata in the semifinals, and midfielder Alexis Mac Allister.\n\nGoalkeeper Emi Martinez also further endeared himself to Argentine fans with two saves in the penalty shootout against the Netherlands in the quarterfinals, following his heroics in the Copa America semifinals against Colombia last year.\n\n‘Savor the moment’\n\nMbappé, who is tied with Messi as this tournament’s top goalscorer, will be doing his very best to derail Argentina, with France looking to have the most complete team of the tournament.\n\nAntoine Griezmann has provided much of France’s creative force, while also helping out defensively. The Atletico Madrid star was instrumental in France’s win against England, superbly crossing for Olivier Giroud to head home France’s winner in a 2-1 quarterfinal victory.\n\nLike Griezmann, the 36-year-old Giroud has had a renaissance in this World Cup, after failing to score a single goal in 2018.\n\nBut at Qatar 2022, the AC Milan forward has scored four goals at the World Cup – only one behind Mbappé – and has become France’s all-time record goalscorer.\n\nA World Cup winner with France as a player in 1998 and as Les Bleus’ coach in 2018, Deschamps said that he wants his players to savor their achievements at Qatar 2022.\n\n“It’s been a month we’re together with the players. It’s never easy,” said Deschamps, per FIFA, after France’s win over Morocco.\n\n“But it’s been such a joy until now, and that my players, the group has been compensated for this success. We’re going to go after the title on Sunday.\n\n“We’re going to take the time. I tell this to my staff and players: ‘Take every moment in the day to really appreciate and savor the moment.’ In four days, we are going to play for a world title.

Instead, a team of functional, hard-working players keep the game ticking by until Messi decides he wants to influence the game.\n\n“Argentina has always produced some world-class players,” French captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris told reporters on the eve of the final.\n\n“Maradona of course was a perfect example of that, and now we have Lionel Messi … [both] who are legends of football.”\n\nMessi’s heroics have helped drag Argentina from the depths of a disastrous opening day defeat to Saudi Arabia to the summit, a journey that has sparked delirium in his native country.\n\n“I’ve seen lots of images of people back home watching the semifinal and celebrating, it makes us very emotional,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni told reporters.\n\n“I think we have the best fans in the world. Our fans have not had reasons to cheer for a long time but I think we are making them happy now.”\n\nIn only two World Cups, Mbappé has already scored nine goals. Only Messi and Thomas Müller have scored more goals as active players. Martin Meissner/AP\n\nThe desire to see Messi emulate Maradona in leading his country to glory extends far beyond Argentina, with much of the footballing world desperate to see the 35-year-old finally clinch the trophy that has long-eluded him in what will, by his own admission, be his last World Cup appearance.\n\nAsked whether he gets the feeling he is “alone in the world” given the global support for Messi, France manager Didier Deschamps flashed a wry smile.\n\n“I often get that feeling,” Deschamps told reporters. “But I am fine being alone, that doesn’t bother me.\n\n“I know Argentina and many people around the world, and maybe some French people as well, would hope that Lionel Messi could win the World Cup, but we’re going to do everything to achieve our objective,” he added.\n\nLloris echoed his manager’s sentiments, insisting his side would “pull out all the stops” to thwart Messi’s fairytale ending.\n\n“As long as we have the support of our fans, and we know that the French people are behind us, then nothing else really matters,” he said.\n\n“Of course we know what Lionel Messi means in the history of football, but this is a match between France [and Argentina] at the end of the day and there are some very good players in the two squads.”\n\nCroatia players celebrate their 2-1 win over Morocco in the third-place playoff on Saturday, December 17.

Several players, including central defensive pair Ibrahima Konaté and Raphaël Varane, as well as midfielder Adrien Rabiot, were infected with a virus that has hit the French camp.\n\nKonaté, Varane and winger Kingsley Coman all missed collective training on Friday, and Deschamps said there was no further update to give on the eve of the game.\n\n“We try to take the maximum precautions, to adapt and to deal with it, without going overboard. It is obviously a situation,” he said.\n\n“If it could not exist it would be better, but we manage as best we can.”\n\nMbappé stormed onto the scene at the last World Cup, becoming the first teenager to score in a World Cup final since the competition’s greatest ever player, Pelé.\n\nThe 23-year-old has gone up a notch at this tournament, already scoring five goals – one more than he did in 2018 – and adding a couple more assists to that mix.\n\nWhile he has not scored in the previous two games, his influence has been felt. Against Morocco, despite not scoring, his mere presence was instrumental in both France goals in the 2-0 win.\n\nBoth Messi and Mbappé have scored five goals this World Cup and across the last two tournaments have both scored or assisted eleven goals each, more than anyone else.\n\nLess is more\n\nThe last time the two teams played was at the 2018 World Cup. In the round of 16 they played out arguably the best game of the tournament, with France coming out on top with a 4-3 win.\n\nThis game is unlikely to follow suit.\n\nDespite both Argentina and France possessing all four of the top scorers at the tournament – Messi, Mbappé, Olivier Giroud and Julián Álvarez – both teams have been defined by their defensive doggedness.\n\nBoth teams have shown that they are much more comfortable defending than keeping the ball. The two finalists have had less possession that their opposition in both the quarterfinals and semifinals.\n\nLes Bleus looks at its best when playing direct, counter-attacking football. Using Giroud’s strength and Mbappé’s speed, the French can dominate any defense on the transition.\n\nArgentinian fans are expected to outnumber French fans in the Lusail Stadium on Sunday. Richard Gordon/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images\n\nArgentina is not as quick in moving the ball from defense to attack, but similarly the team prefers to keep the opposition at arm’s length, rather than try control the game with the ball.\n\nIn being a defensive team, Argentina has made itself far more than the sum of its parts. La Albiceleste have only lost one game in its previous 42.\n\nArgentina has had a much higher percent of possession across the tournament, but showed that against the best teams, it prefers to have less of the ball.\n\nWhat is more likely is that both teams will dominate the ball for periods of the game, while being very happy to cede control of the ball at other times.\n\nInstead the questions will center more around those individuals. Can Argentina stop Mbappé from having space to run into with the ball? Can France stop Messi receiving the ball around its own box?\n\nBoth Messi and Mbappé seem too good to stop once they have the ball and so the game will be won or lost on each team’s capacity to stop either superstar from receiving the ball.\n\nWhen and where\n\nArgentina vs. France: 10 a.m. ET, Lusail Stadium\n\nHow to watch\n\nUS: Fox Sports\n\nUK: BBC or ITV\n\nAustralia: SBS\n\nBrazil: SportTV\n\nGermany: ARD, ZDF, Deutsche Telekom\n\nCanada: Bell Media", "authors": ["Alasdair Howorth"], "publish_date": "2022/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/football/gallery/world-cup-2022/index.html", "title": "The best photos of the 2022 World Cup | CNN", "text": "Lionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.\n\nProduced by CNN Digital's Photo Team\n\nWhat a match.\n\nAfter a dramatic penalty shootout, Argentina defeated France on Sunday to win its first World Cup since 1986.\n\nIt was a final for the ages, with momentum swinging both ways throughout a pulsating 120 minutes that ended 3-3. Gonzalo Montiel scored the penalty that clinched the title.\n\nIt is the crowning achievement for Argentina legend Lionel Messi, who said this would be the last World Cup game of his remarkable career.

Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCroatia\n\nPerhaps the weakest team on paper in the quarterfinals, Croatia looks like a side struggling to reclaim the control that took it all the way to the final in 2018. The team was held comfortably by Morocco in the group stages, was very lucky to draw with Belgium and had to rely on penalties to beat Japan in the last 16..\n\nFor any other team, that would be a worry. But Croatia has shown that it is the master of navigating matches that go down to the wire. All three of its knockout games in 2018 went to extra-time or penalties, but in every one of those, the Croatians looked like the side in control.\n\nThat experience was on show against Japan. Like its semifinal victory over England four years ago, this was a game in which Croatia looked stronger and stronger as the game went on. That tournament experience and nous will be put to the test as Kockasti face a Brazil team that looks every bit as good as its pre-tournament tag as favorite would suggest.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nMorocco 0-0 Croatia\n\nCroatia 4-1 Canada\n\nCroatia 0-0 Belgium\n\nRound of 16:\n\nCroatia 1-1 Japan (Croatia won 3-1 on penalties)\n\nAccording to Opta, Brazil has a 27.6% chance of winning the World Cup. Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nBrazil\n\nA Seleção, for the first time in 20 years, looks as good as fans expect. The five-time world champion comfortably beat stubborn European opponent, Serbia, before giving the first team a rest against Cameroon. But against South Korea, the world saw what this team is truly capable of.\n\nWithin the first seven minutes, Brazil had already won the match and brought jogo bonito (the beautiful game) back to the World Cup, scoring for fun. Neymar – after missing the final two group stage matches through injury – was back again and playing with a freedom that the star has rarely been able to exhibit in the green and gold shirt.\n\nBrazil will once again be heavy favorite as it faces Croatia, but manager Tite and his team will not be underestimating its opponent. For the last 16 years, Brazil has come to tournaments with hype before crashing out against European opponents in the knockout stages. But this team looks like it could be the first since 2002 to bring the World Cup trophy back to its spiritual home.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nBrazil 2-0 Serbia\n\nBrazil 1-0 Switzerland\n\nCameroon 1-0 Brazil\n\nRound of 16:\n\nBrazil 4-1 South Korea\n\nNetherlands vs. Argentina\n\nWhen: Friday, December 9, 2 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Lusail Stadium\n\nAccording to Opta, the Netherlands has a 8.96% chance of winning the World Cup. Ricardo Mazalan/AP\n\nNetherlands\n\nIn what is expected to be the last tournament of Louis van Gaal’s stellar career, the Netherlands manager is looking to replicate his 2010 accomplishment of reaching the final of the World Cup – and maybe going one step further this time.\n\nLacking the stars of 2014, the Dutch have been a far more practical side, only conceding two goals so far in the tournament. But that did not stop it from scoring one of the goals of the tournament against the US. The team strung 20 passes together in a picturesque advertisement of the beautiful game before Memphis Depay stroked the ball home.\n\nThe Netherlands had arguably the easiest path to the quarterfinal stage, and their resilience will be tested as they play a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina.\n\nGroup Stage:\n\nSenegal 0-2 Netherlands\n\nNetherlands 1-1 Ecuador\n\nNetherlands 2-0 Qatar\n\nRound of 16:\n\nNetherlands 3-1 United States\n\nAccording to Opta, Argentina has a 17.4% chance of winning the World Cup. Molly Darlington/Reuters\n\nArgentina\n\nIn its first game of the tournament, Argentina suffered arguably the biggest upset in World Cup history as Messi and co. lost to Saudi Arabia. But since then, La Albiceleste has kicked into gear, comfortably winning its last three games.\n\nIn what is likely his final World Cup, Messi has slowly grown into the tournament, but against Australia he showed glimpses of why he is widely considered to be the best to grace the game. He scored a trademark goal against Australia, curling home a finish with irresistible ease, and was at his creative best as time and time again he created chances for his teammates.\n\nThis is arguably the least glamorous Argentina squad of the 21st century, but Lionel Scaloni’s side has a functional system that has served the team well. Like the Netherlands, Argentina is facing its biggest test of the tournament.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nArgentina 1-2 Saudi Arabia\n\nArgentina 2-0 Mexico\n\nPoland 0-2 Argentina\n\nRound of 16:\n\nArgentina 2-1 Australia Cup\n\nEngland vs. France\n\nWhen: Saturday, December 10, 2 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Al Bayt Stadium\n\nAccording to Opta, England has a 18.83% chance of winning the World Cup. Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEngland\n\nThe Three Lions have had the best start of any team in Qatar, keeping three clean sheets and dispatching African champion Senegal with ease in the last 16. Which begs the question: is this the best England team since 1966, when it last won thee World?\n\nUnder Gareth Southgate, England has become a tournament specialist, playing functional football and restricting its abundance of attacking talent in favor of defensive solidity. But against Senegal, fans were treated to a glimpse of what this England attack can do when given the space and opportunity.\n\nWith the addition of Jude Bellingham to the midfield, England is now playing like one of the best teams in the world, adding goals to a staunch defense. The one criticism of arguably England’s best ever manager is that Southgate struggles against superior opponents. There is no greater test of that theory than facing France in the quarterfinals.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nEngland 6-2 Iran\n\nEngland 0-0 United States\n\nWales 0-3 England\n\nRound of 16:\n\nEngland 3-0 Senegal\n\nAccording to Opta, France has a 14.74% chance of winning the World Cup. Ebrahim Noroozi/AP\n\nFrance\n\nAfter a shaky first half against Australia, the French have quickly dispelled any of the pre-tournament concerns that they would follow the previous three World Cup champions and make a group-stage exit.\n\nLes Bleus have looked irresistible at times, and bar their second-string team losing a dead rubber to Tunisia, the team looks every bit as good as the one that dominated Russia in 2018. Olivier Giroud has become France’s all-time top scorer, Aurélien Tchouaméni and Adrien Rabiot have filled the Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kanté shaped hole in midfield, and forward Antione Griezmann looks back to his best.\n\nBut this team is all about one man: Kylian Mbappé. The PSG forward has looked irresistible and the best player at the tournament. Whether he is sitting defenders down, or curling in stunning goals, it looks like no one on the planet has the tools to cope with the mercurial talent.\n\nFrance faces its neighbor from across the Channel next, but for England to pass into the semifinals, it will have to find a way to stop the world’s best player.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nFrance 4-1 Australia\n\nFrance 2-1 Denmark\n\nTunisia 1-0 France\n\nRound of 16:\n\nFrance 3-1 Poland\n\nMorocco vs. Portugal\n\nWhen: Saturday, December 10, 10 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: Al Thumama Stadium\n\nMorocco\n\nThis Morocco team has been a revelation this tournament, defending valiantly and attacking with verve and is more than deserving of its place in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn Achraf Hakimi, who scored an audacious ‘Panenka’ to win the penalty shootout against Spain, Morocco boasts a bonafide superstar and the Paris Saint-Germain fullback’s boundless energy down the right flank is the Atlas Lions’ greatest attacking threat.\n\nChelsea winger Hakim Ziyech provides Morocco’s creative spark, while Fioretina’s Sofyan Amrabat has undoubtedly been one of the best midfielders so far in this World Cup.\n\nHead coach Walid Regragui has instilled incredible belief and organization into his team and Morocco will justifiably feel confident it can beat Portgual and become the first African team in history to reach a World Cup semifinal.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nMorocco 0-0 Croatia\n\nBelgium 0-2 Morocco\n\nCanada 1-2 Morocco\n\nRound of 16:\n\nMorocco 0-0 Spain (Morocco wins 3-0 on penalties)\n\nGonçalo Ramos scored a brilliant hat-trick against Switzerland as he spearheaded a scintillating Portugal performance.

Fernando Santos’ side looked unstoppable with 21-year-old striker Gonçalo Ramos bursting onto the world stage with a brilliant hat-trick.\n\nThe youngster was replacing Cristiano Ronaldo, who was dropped to the bench for the crunch tie.

Or, will Croatia become just the ninth different nation to win the tournament?\n\nHere's a look at every World Cup, a trip through the world's biggest sporting event's history that includes a wild bit of U.S. soccer trivia.\n\n2014: Germany\n\nLocation: Brazil\n\nFinal: Germany over Argentina, 1-0 (extra time)\n\nAfter knocking on the door of greatness for nearly a decade (two third-place World Cup finishes, one runner-up finish in the Euro), Germany finally earned that elusive championship. A stunner of a semifinal against Brazil — a 7-1 dump trucking of the hosts — was followed up by a grind-it-out extra-time win over Lionel Messi and Argentina. You know how U.S. presidents appear to age rapidly while in office? Yeah, that seemed to happen to Bastian Schweinsteiger in the final. Germany collected its fourth World Cup win, tying it with Italy with the second most behind Brazil's five championships. That also means that three nations have won 13 of 20 World Cups.\n\n2010: Spain\n\nLocation: South Africa\n\nFinal: Spain over Netherlands, 1-0 (extra time)\n\nThis is the crowning achievement of an incredible run of success for Spain. Over a four-year span, Spain won the 2008 Euro, 2010 World Cup and 2012 Euro. The only blemish for Spain was losing to the U.S. in the 2009 Confederations Cup. Spain's win\n\nalso marked the first time a European nation had won the World Cup when it was hosted outside of Europe, a feat matched four years later by Germany.\n\n2006: Italy\n\nLocation: Germany\n\nFinal: Italy over France, 1-1 (Italy won penalty shootout, 5-3)\n\nIt's one of the most indelible moments in sports, a \"where were you when?\" experience that separates the final of this World Cup from any other. In the most unforgettably crazy World Cup moment since Diego Maradona's \"Hand of God\" play in 1986, one of the greatest to ever play the game was sent off in shame after being red carded for a head-butt. Even 12 years later, people are still making memes about Zinedine Zidane's shocking head-butt of Italy's Marco Materazzi in extra time of the World Cup final.\n\n2002: Brazil\n\nLocation: South Korea/Japan\n\nFinal: Brazil over Germany, 2-0\n\nSure, the final featured two bluebloods, but this was a wild World Cup. Upsets highlighted the group stage, as defending World Cup champion France and another tournament favorite, Argentina, did not make it to the round of 16. Neither did Portugal, which was upset in its opener by the U.S., which had its best World Cup performance since 1930. Turkey and South Korea each reached the semifinals, with Turkey — which was playing in its first World Cup since 1954 — winning the third-place game. Featuring Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo — who scored both goals in the final — Brazil cruised to the title.\n\n1998: France\n\nLocation: France\n\nFinal: France over Brazil, 3-0\n\nFrance became the sixth nation to win the World Cup as a host nation, joining Uruguay, Italy, England, Germany and Argentina. Until Germany's 7-1 rout of Brazil at the 2014 World Cup, the 3-0 loss in the final to France was Brazil's most lopsided World Cup\n\ndefeat. For France, this started an impressive run that also featured a 2000 Euro win and that infamous 2006 World Cup final appearance for a core of players that included Zidane, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Fabien Barthez.\n\nWorld Cup:Top 10 best moments in tournament history\n\nWorld Cup:Top 10 craziest moments ever\n\nWorld Cup:11 greatest players to never win\n\n1994: Brazil\n\nLocation: USA\n\nFinal: Brazil over Italy, 0-0 (Brazil won penalty shootout, 3-2)\n\nA generation before soccer games the world over could be found on multiple national TV networks, the game was still a bit of a curiosity when this World Cup was played in the U.S. The tournament was an overwhelming success, despite concerns over\n\nplaying it in a nation where soccer was considered a niche sport. The 1994 tournament — even with increasing the field from 24 to 32 teams for 1998 — still remains the most attended World Cup. The tournament capper was the first goalless final in World\n\nCup history, and first decided by a penalty shootout. Italian Roberto Baggio's penalty kick miss secured Brazil's first World Cup win in 24 years.\n\n1990: Germany\n\nLocation: Italy\n\nFinal: Germany over Argentina, 1-0\n\nThe lowest-scoring World Cup ever had a sloppy conclusion, which featured the first red-card ejection in a final (watch Jurgen Klinsmann make a meal out of this foul). The only goal came on a penalty kick, and Argentina became the first team to fail to net a goal in a World Cup final. After 40 years in the wilderness, the USMNT qualified for its first World Cup since 1950.\n\n1986: Argentina\n\nLocation: Mexico\n\nFinal: Argentina over Germany, 3-2\n\nDiego Maradona's opening goal in a 2-1 Argentina win over England in the quarterfinal is the most infamous and controversial goal in World Cup history. The \"Hand of God\" was so incredible that it was voted the \"World Cup Goal of the Century\" in 2002. Argentina went on to win its second World Cup in eight years.\n\n1982: Italy\n\nLocation: Spain\n\nFinal: Italy over Germany, 3-1\n\nItaly's run to World Cup glory came at the expense of an impressive list of vanquished opponents: Defending World Cup winners Argentina, and perennial favorites Brazil and Germany. Germany advanced to the final after an epic semifinal against France, in\n\nwhich German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher administered a vicious hit on Patrick Battiston that would make Jack Tatum proud.\n\n1978: Argentina\n\nLocation: Argentina\n\nFinal: Argentina over Netherlands, 3-1 (extra time)\n\nLosers in the inaugural World Cup final, Argentina finally were winners 48 years later, and were the third World Cup winner over a four-tournament span to win on home soil. On the other end, the Netherlands found heartbreak in the final for the second\n\nstraight World Cup against the tournament hosts.\n\n1974: Germany\n\nLocation: Germany\n\nFinal: Germany over Netherlands, 2-1\n\nJohan Cruyff-led Netherlands, with its revolutionary \"Total Football\" tactics, made a valiant run to the final, but were defeated by Der Kaiser, Franz Beckinbauer, and host Germany at Munich's Olympiastadion. This was the first time that the reigning European champions won the World Cup, a feat matched in 2010 by Spain.\n\n1970: Brazil\n\nLocation : Mexico\n\nFinal: Brazil over Italy, 4-1\n\nLed by future teammates with the New York Cosmos, Pele and Carlos Alberto, Brazil won its third World Cup over a four-Cup span. This triumph was so impressive that the 1970 Brazil team — which also featured Tostao, Rivellino, Gérson and Jairzinho — is considered the greatest team of all time, and this tournament as a\n\nwhole is often cited as the best World Cup ever played.\n\n1966: England\n\nLocation: England\n\nFinal: England over Germany, 4-2 (extra time)\n\nEngland's record in major international tournaments is not very impressive, especially given that the nation is home to arguably the best domestic league in the world. England has never won the Euro (much less even reach the final of one), and has one\n\nWorld Cup win in nearly 70 years of competing in the tournament. In 1966, with the World Cup being played on its own soil, \"The Three Lions\" collected their lone championship. Geoff Hurst completed a hat trick with two goals in extra time as England defeated Germany. Hurst's hat trick remains the only one ever in a World Cup final.\n\n1962: Brazil\n\nLocation: Chile\n\nFinal: Brazil over Czechoslovakia, 3-1\n\nDespite losing Pele in the second group stage match of the tournament (against eventual finals opponent Czechoslovakia no less), Brazil won a second consecutive World Cup. The tournament itself was marred by on-field violence, and included a game between host Chile and Italy called the \"Battle of Santiago\" in which two Italian players were sent off.\n\n1958: Brazil\n\nLocation: Sweden\n\nFinal: Brazil over Sweden, 5-2\n\nThis tournament is known as Pele's coming-out party. The 17-year-old Pele scored six goals in three knockout stage games — including two in the final — as Brazil won its first World Cup. While the game's greatest star emerged and Brazil came of age as a global powerhouse, another historic milestone was set in Sweden. France's Just Fontaine scored a World Cup-record 13 goals (over six games).\n\n1954: Germany\n\nLocation: Switzerland\n\nFinal: Germany over Hungary, 3-2\n\nOften hailed as one of the greatest World Cup matches ever played, Germany defeated Hungary in what has become known as the \"Miracle of Bern.\" Sure, Germany beating Hungary in a game of soccer football is an expected result these days, but back in 1954 this was considered a major upset. This was the \"Golden Team\" of Hungary, and a World Cup favorite that year. In the final, Hungary stormed out to a 2-0 lead, Germany answered to tie it up and then scored the match winner in the 84th minute.\n\n1950: Uruguay\n\nLocation: Brazil\n\nFinal: Uruguay over Brazil, 2-1\n\nAfter a 12-year hiatus due to World War II, the World Cup returned. There were 16 teams expected to participate, but 13 showed up in Brazil. One of those teams was the U.S., which famously defeated an England team considered to be a tournament favorite. Rather than have a knockout stage, the final round was a round robin. Going into the final game, Brazil needed only to avoid defeat in order to win the World Cup. Instead, Uruguay prevailed 2-1 and won the tournament.\n\n1938: Italy\n\nLocation: France\n\nFinal: Italy over Hungary, 4-2\n\nWith the world on the cusp of war, France hosted the tournament two years before it would be occupied by Nazi Germany. On the field, Italy became the first nation to win back-to-back World Cups, winning the final against Hungary, which would emerge as a\n\nworld football powerhouse in the years following the war.\n\n1934: Italy\n\nLocation: Italy\n\nFinal: Italy over Czechoslovakia, 2-1 (extra time)\n\nYes, two years before Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany got the Olympics, Italy's Benito Mussolini got the World Cup. In a not-so-shocking development, a World Cup hosted by a fascist dictatorship had the wretched stench of foul play. Defending World Cup winner Uruguay refused to participate in this World Cup because only four European nations participated in the inaugural event in Montevideo. Italy's run to the title started with a 7-1 demolition of the U.S., which — following this tournament — would play in just one more World Cup over the next 56 years. Italy also defeated Austria's famed Wunderteam in the semifinal.\n\n1930: Uruguay\n\nLocation: Uruguay\n\nFinal: Uruguay over Argentina, 4-2\n\nIn the inaugural World Cup, Uruguay continued its dominance of world football after winning Olympic gold at the 1924 Games in Paris and 1928 Games in Amsterdam (where they defeated their regional rival, Argentina). Uruguay's win in the inaugural World Cup on their home soil was the first of six out of 20 World Cups won by the host nation. The USMNT might have peaked early when it came to World Cups. FIFA recognizes the U.S. as the third-place finisher of this World Cup after losing in the semifinal to Argentina, which is the best-ever finish for the U.S. And, who says American soccer has no history? The USMNT can boast about ownership of two World Cup firsts: Goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas recorded the first \"clean sheet\" and Bert Patenaude has the first hat trick in World Cup history.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/football/lionel-messi-argentina-saudi-arabia-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Saudi Arabia vs Argentina: Lionel Messi's team in one of the biggest ...", "text": "Lusail, Qatar CNN —\n\nSaudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.\n\nMany had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.\n\nAll the pre-match talk focused on Messi, one of the greatest players ever who is playing in what is likely to be his last World Cup. The Argentina captain scored an early penalty to put his side in the lead, but two second-half goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al Dawsari turned the game on its head.\n\nThe thousands of Saudi fans inside the Lusail Stadium couldn’t believe what they were watching as they celebrated their unexpected victory.\n\nSuch a comeback hadn’t looked remotely possible for much of the match. Argentina controlled the game after taking the lead but whatever Saudi manger Hervé Renard said at halftime worked. His team came out with a new-found belief and stood toe-to-toe with Argentina’s world-class team.\n\nSaudi Arabia players celebrate their shock win. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nAl Dawsari’s incredible winner from distance – and subsequent acrobatic celebration – will become one of the moments of this or any World Cup and undoubtedly, in time, an ‘I-was-there’ moment for fans.\n\nAs full-time neared, fans cheered every tackle and save as if they were goals and, when the match did indeed end, Saudi Arabia fans reacted with frenzy.\n\nBoth sets of players sunk to their knees, from disbelief and exhaustion. Messi, who so many had come see play, looked distraught as he walked off with Saudi fans cheering his name ironically.\n\nAccording to sports data group Gracenote, which is a Nielsen company, Tuesday’s result was the biggest upset in the history of the competition.\n\n“The most surprising World Cup win ever according to Gracenote was USA’s victory over England in 1950 with a 9.5% chance of victory for the US team but Saudi Arabia’s chance of victory today was estimated at 8.7% so takes over at number one,” it said in a statement.\n\nAs much as this was a historic win for Saudi Arabia, it was a humiliating defeat for Argentina who capitulated on the biggest stage.\n\nSaudi players smiled and laughed with reporters as they left the stadium, a stark contrast to the Argentine squad who walked with their heads down onto the team bus.

It’s going to be a bit crowded because we didn’t expect the Argentina contingent to be joining us, but we’ll make do.\n\nYour first game at the World Cup didn’t go quite as planned. Or at all as planned for Lionel Messi and the Albiceleste. But fear not. There’s still a path out of the group — to the final even! – and one bad result doesn’t necessarily have to derail your entire World Cup.\n\nI know you know this, but it’s worth repeating: The top two teams in each group after three games advance to the knockout rounds. Yes, whether you win the group or finish second plays a role in your title hopes but, for now, let’s just worry on getting out of the group.\n\nDrawing against England would mean the USMNT would likely have to beat Iran on Tuesday. Though that’s also dependent on what happens in the Wales-Iran game earlier Friday, and the USMNT will have the benefit of knowing that result before it kicks off against England.\n\nNow, as for Argentina. Go ahead, have a good cry, eat your feelings and do whatever else you need to do to forget about that 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, perhaps the biggest upset in World Cup history.\n\n“The truth? Dead,” Messi said afterward. “It’s a very hard blow because we did not expect to start in this way.”\n\nI know it seems like a tall ask, but remember that Spain lost its first game in 2010 and things turned out pretty well for Xavi, Xabi Alonso, Andres Iniesta and Co.\n\n— Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports\n\nRead the full column here.\n\nDespite Australia taking the early lead, France stormed back with two goals for the 2-1 score.

They look forward and go forward.”\n\n— Associated Press\n\nSaudi Arabia was an 18-1 underdog against Argentina when they beat Lionel Messi and company 2-1 in their World Cup opener.

Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters The best photos of the 2022 World Cup Prev Next\n\nKylian Mbappé\n\nBeing only 23, Mbappé doesn’t have the same global reach as Messi yet but his ability to excite is just as powerful and his quality is evident even before kickoff.\n\nThose who have taken their seats inside stadiums early at Qatar 2022 have witnessed the forward’s finishing prowess.\n\nJust before the players finish their warmups, strikers often take 10 minutes to practice their shooting against the goalkeeper – and Mbappé always looked more eager than most.\n\nWhile his teammates saw attempts saved or miss the target,time and time again, his efforts whistled into the top corner of the net with the crowd, many for the first time, witnessing what world-class finishing looks like up close.\n\nThe Frenchman's electrifying pace has fans on the edge of their seats. Francois Nel/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nOnce the match starts, those same fans wait eagerly for the ball to land at Mbappé’s feet, knowing exactly what he’ll do when he gets it.\n\nThe Frenchman doesn’t complicate the game and relies heavily on his speed. His pace looks superhuman live, with the attacker breezing past even the quickest opposition with ease.\n\nAt every opportunity, Mbappé looks to square up his defender and knock the ball past him. Once he’s free, there is simply no stopping him.\n\nAccording to FIFA, Mbappé hit a top speed of 35.3 kilometers per hour (about 22 miles per hour) during his team’s round of 16 win against Poland – among the fastest speeds recorded at the tournament.\n\nDefenders often can’t cope with the acceleration and, when combined with his precise shooting, the youngster has won games in a blink of an eye.\n\nIt’s a trick that never gets old and there is a rumble of excitement around the stadium whenever Mbappé looks like he’ll get a chance to demonstrate that raw speed.\n\nLike Messi, Mbappé is not too interested in defending and seeing him strut around the pitch before bursting into action is like watching the Argentine icon.\n\nBut he seems to always be scanning his surroundings, taking a mental picture of the pitch and identifying when and where he’ll terrorize next.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to stop him, teams often task at least two defenders to pay close attention to the Frenchman’s movements – but Mbappé seems to relish the challenge and seems to enjoy making the opposition look foolish.\n\nManagers and coaching staff on the touchline scream instructions to remind their players of exactly where Mbappé is. They know, given even half a yard of space, that Mbappé has the ability to change a game.\n\nFrench fans in Qatar have been particularly confident throughout the tournament and, when asked why, they often all have the same answer – it’s because they have Mbappé in their team.\n\nAll eyes will now be on Sunday to see which superstar can get the last laugh at Qatar 2022.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/12/17"}]}

The finding, from a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in January and February, highlights the entrenched politics driving the nation at the start of the midterm year, with little agreement across party lines on priorities for the government or how to handle the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe President’s ratings have fallen across the board, the survey found. Just 41% approved of the way he’s handling his job while 58% disapproved, a significant drop from his approval numbers in CNN polling last year. Just 36% of independents and 9% of Republicans approved. Although his approval rating still stood at 83% among Democrats, that was down from 94% late last summer. Biden also continues to have more strong detractors than he does fervent supporters: 41% of Americans disapproved strongly of his performance as President versus 15% who strongly approved. Some of the shift in Biden’s numbers comes from a change in Americans’ partisan tilt: Republicans and Democrats were about at parity in the new poll, with fewer identifying as Democrats than in other recent CNN polling.\n\nWhen those who disapproved of Biden’s overall performance were asked to name a single thing he’d done that they did approved of, 56% had nothing positive to say. “I’m hard pressed to think of a single thing he has done that benefits the country,” wrote one survey respondent.\n\nOf those who generally approved of Biden, a smaller 26% couldn’t find anything negative to say. “I totally believe that he has the best interests of the American [p]eople in mind,” wrote another respondent. “I think he understands the severity and importance of his job and is doing the best he can.”\n\nOverall, Americans said, 57% to 41%, that the first year of the Biden administration has been more of a failure than a success. For comparison, in January 2010, Americans were split about evenly on how to define Barack Obama’s first year as president. An 83% majority of Democrats called Biden’s first year a success – more than the 78% of Democrats who said the same about Obama in 2010. But just 35% of independents saw Biden’s first year as successful, down from the 44% who said the same of Obama.\n\nOver the past two months, the twin challenges of widespread inflation and a deluge of coronavirus cases due to the Omicron variant appear to have hit Biden’s ratings hard: His approval rating for handling the economy has dipped 8 points to 37% since early December, while his ratings for handling coronavirus have dropped 9 points to 45%. And few Americans have deep confidence in Biden to either deal with the economy (18% said they had a lot of confidence in his ability to do so, down from 30% in March 2021) or lead the country out of the coronavirus pandemic (25% had a lot of confidence, down from 42% last spring).\n\nAmericans overall are divided over the best approach for the country to take on the pandemic now: 51% said that “it’s time to learn to live with the virus,” while 48% said that “stopping the spread of the virus must continue to be the highest priority.” The Omicron wave crested while the poll was being conducted, between January 10 and February 6.\n\nViews on the best way to move forward are starkly divided by partisanship. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats, 73%, said that stopping the spread should remain the highest priority, while 72% of Republicans and 54% of independents said it was time to learn to live with the virus.\n\nDemographic divides on this question tend to mirror the partisan tilt within each group – women were more likely than men to say stopping the spread should be the priority, and White Americans were more likely than Black or Hispanic Americans to say it was time to learn to live with the virus. But younger Americans, who tend to be more Democratic, were more likely than seniors to say it was time to learn to live with the virus.\n\nThere is also a sharp divide between parents and non-parents on this question: 64% of people with children under the age of 18 said it was time to learn to live with the virus, while 54% of those without young children said stopping the spread must continue to be the highest priority.\n\nThose who say the US should learn to live with Covid-19 were generally positive about the country’s ability to accomplish that goal, with 69% saying they were at least somewhat confident the nation could do so. Those who said the country should remain focused on stopping the spread were less broadly optimistic, with 53% saying they were not too or not at all confident the country could stop the spread.\n\nThree-quarters of Americans said they were burned out by the pandemic, with most also describing themselves as angry (60%) and worried (58%). About half (49%) said they were confused about the pandemic, with 47% describing themselves as optimistic.\n\nPartisan gaps on these emotional reactions are more muted than on most Covid-related issues, though there is a wide partisan divide when it comes to worrying about the current state of the pandemic in the US (76% of Democrats were worried versus 43% of Republicans). Women were more likely than men to report being worried (65% vs. 51%) or confused (54% vs. 44%), while men were more optimistic than women (54% vs. 41%).\n\nBeyond the coronavirus, there’s little public consensus over a single top issue for the US government to tackle this year. Given a list of options relating to domestic policy, 24% called reducing inflation the most important priority, followed by voting rights (16%) and border security (15%). Fewer than 1 in 10 chose reducing violent crime, slowing climate change, addressing racial inequality, solving the labor shortage, dealing with opioid addiction or expanding access to affordable child care. Republicans’ focus coalesced around two main issues: border security (31%) and inflation (29%). Democrats were most likely to cite voting rights (28%), with 15% or fewer agreeing that any other issue was a top priority.\n\nBut the poll suggests few have much faith in anything Washington or Biden may do this year. The share who say they felt even somewhat well represented by the federal government remained low at 32%, and only 21% of Americans said they currently had a lot of confidence in Biden’s ability to provide real leadership for the country. The share who said they had a lot of confidence in the President’s ability to work effectively with Congress has dropped by half since last March, from 32% to 15%, including a 28 percentage point drop among Democrats over that time.\n\nIn many cases, Americans’ views of Biden are well set – particularly the negative ones. Among those who generally disapproved of Biden’s performance, 61% said they disapproved of him on each of the eight issues tested in the survey.\n\nAt the same time, most who approved of Biden were able to find something they disliked when asked directly. About one-fifth expressed disappointment in some aspect of his economic performance, such as his failure to cancel student loan debtor the limits of his stimulus programs. One-tenth mentioned his response the coronavirus pandemic, and another tenth his foreign policies, often related to the Afghanistan withdrawal.\n\nFor Americans who disapproved of the President, those who could highlight a positive about Biden leaned toward economics – 15% praised policies such as the stimulus bill or the child tax credit. Another 6% said they approved of aspects of his Covid response, including the provision of free Covid tests. Four percent noted aspects of his temperament or personal characteristics, although this sometimes amounted to faint praise: “He’s not Donald [T]rump. That’s pretty much it,” one respondent wrote, while another noted approvingly that “I really like his new cat, Willow Biden.”\n\nThe new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 10 through February 6 among a random national sample of 1,527 adults initially reached by mail.

It might be lifesaving, according to a new study.\n\nMore than 110,000 US deaths could be prevented each year if adults over 40 added 10 minutes of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity to their normal routines, according to the study published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nAn increase of 20 or 30 minutes could lead to even more lives saved, the study noted.\n\n“We know exercise is good for us. This study provides additional evidence of the benefits at the population level: if all adults in the United States (over age 40) were to exercise just a bit more each day, a large number of deaths could be prevented each year,” said Pedro Saint-Maurice, the study’s first author and an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute, via email.\n\nThe study used accelerator data the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey recorded from participants ages 6 and older between 2003 and 2006. Researchers then looked at the activity levels of nearly 5,000 participants ages 40 to 85 and tracked death rates through the end of 2015.\n\nThe method used to conduct the study was rigorous, said Peter Katzmarzyk, professor of pediatric obesity and associate executive director for population and public health sciences at Louisiana State University’s Pennington Biomedical Research Center.\n\nAlthough the number of prevented deaths is an estimate, it “is a valid approach since it would be almost impossible to conduct an actual human trial to manipulate people’s activity levels and look at long term outcomes like deaths,” said Katzmarzyk, who was not involved in the study, in an email.\n\n“We have reported previously that even a little bit of exercise can result in health benefits,” said Saint-Maurice. “This study doesn’t focus on the benefits for individuals, but rather at the level of the population. We can make our nation healthier by encouraging everyone to add an additional 10 minutes of activity or more each day.”\n\nImportant note: If you experience pain while exercising, stop immediately. Check with your doctor before beginning any new exercise program.\n\nThere are many ways to add 10 more minutes of activity into your day -- like walking, yoga or dancing in your kitchen, said Santas. Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nHow to get your 10 more minutes\n\nDaily exercise is not just for gym rats, said Dana Santas, a CNN fitness contributor and mind-body coach for professional athletes.\n\n“Fitting in ten minutes of exercise every day is so much easier than people think. Consider how fast ten minutes goes by when you’re mindlessly scrolling social media or watching your favorite TV show,” Santas said in an email. “It’s not a big time investment, but it can deliver big health benefits.”\n\nWalking outside or on a treadmill is one of the best and simplest ways to bring consistent physical activity into your life, Santas said.\n\nYoga, for those who are practiced at it and those less so, is another great option, with the added benefits of stress relief and the ease of online access to all levels of instruction, Santas said.\n\nAnother at-home activity with a low cost of entry: body weight exercises.\n\nWith no equipment, it is easy to get in four rounds of three-minute body weight exercises – and you get an extra two minutes of benefit.\n\nThe key is finding a sequence of movements that will moderately work your full body, balancing upper body strength, lower body strength and cardiovascular exercise, like 10 to 25 pushups, 25 to 40 squats and a minute of jogging in place, Santas said.\n\nAnd when in doubt, you can always dance it out.\n\nTurning on some of your favorite songs and moving alone in your kitchen or grabbing family and friends in the living room is exercise that feels more like a celebration. It takes only three or four songs to get you to your 10-minute goal, Santas said, but no one will blame you if you can’t stop there.\n\nExercise doesn’t have to be grueling to be effective, and bumping up your routine by just a little bit can have huge impacts, the experts said.", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/alcohol-by-age-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "No amount of alcohol is healthy if you're under 40, study says | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nNo amount of alcohol is healthy if you are younger than 40, mostly due to alcohol-related deaths by auto accidents, injury and homicide, according to a new global study.\n\nIf you are 40 or older without underlying health conditions, however, the new research found small amounts of alcohol might reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes.\n\n“Those diseases just happen to be major causes of death in a good chunk of the world,” said senior author Emmanuela Gakidou, professor of health metrics sciences at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine.\n\n“So when you look at the cumulative health impact, particularly among older adults, it shows that a small amount is actually better for you than no drinking. For all other causes, it’s harmful at all levels of consumption.”\n\nIndeed, the study found no protective effect for diseases such as tuberculosis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, liver disease, epilepsy, pancreatitis and many cancers.\n\n“Alcohol guidelines, both global ones and national ones, have typically emphasized the difference between consumption level for men compared to women,” Gakidou said. “What our work suggests is that global guidelines, national guidelines and local guidelines would be more effective if they emphasize age as opposed to sex.”\n\nThe findings underscore “the importance of alcohol recommendations that are tailored to specific regions and populations,” Amanda Berger, vice president of science and health for the trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, told CNN in an email.\n\n“Importantly, no one should drink alcohol to obtain potential health benefits, and some individuals should not drink at all.”\n\nYounger than 40 found at highest risk\n\nThe report, released Thursday in the journal Lancet, is the first to report alcohol risk by global geographical region, age, sex and year, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which prepared the study.\n\nThe analysis looked at 30 years of data on people ages 15 to 95 from 204 countries and territories gathered by the institute’s Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, which tracks premature death and disability from over 300 diseases.\n\nThe analysis estimated that 1.34 billion people around the world consumed harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020. More than 59% of the people who drank unsafe amounts of alcohol were between 15 and 39. Over two-thirds were men.\n\nIn every geographic region, the study found drinking alcohol does not provide any health benefits to people under age 40 but does raise the risk of injury, such as motor vehicle accidents, suicides and homicides.\n\nThe study defined a standard drink as 10 grams of pure alcohol, which might be a small 3.4-fluid ounce (100 milliliters) glass of red wine, a 12-fluid ounce (355 milliliters) standard can or bottle of beer (3.5% alcohol) or a 1-fluid ounce shot of spirits (30 milliliters) that is 40% alcohol by volume.\n\nConclusions criticized\n\nWhile praising the analysis as well-conducted, some experts not involved with the research expressed concern about the study’s conclusions.\n\nStatistics show there are “over 14 times as many alcohol-attributable deaths in the UK among 70-74 year-olds than 20-24 year olds,” said Colin Angus, a senior research fellow at the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the UK’s University of Sheffield, in a statement. The data “contradicts the assertion in this new study that we should focus on the drinking of younger age groups,” Angus said.\n\n“The elephant in the room with this study is the interpretation of risk based on outcomes for cardiovascular disease – particularly in older people,” said Dr. Tony Rao, visiting clinical research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London.\n\n“We know that any purported health benefits from alcohol on the heart and circulation are balanced out by the increased risk from other conditions such as cancer, liver disease and mental disorders such as depression and dementia,” Rao said in a statement.\n\nA study published in March found just one pint of beer or glass of wine a day can shrink the overall volume of the brain, with the damage increasing as the number of daily drinks rises. On average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank half of a beer.\n\nResearch in the US has shown drinking among adults rose during pandemic, particularly among women, with “a 41% increase in heavy drinking days,” said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nA study published in June found many moderate drinkers over age 30 binge on the weekend – defined as five or more drinks in a row or within a short period of time. Drinking an average of more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men – or five or more drinks on the same occasion – was linked to alcohol problems nine years later.\n\nWomen are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAA. Alcohol-related problems appear sooner and at lower drinking levels than in men, it said.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to alcohol-related brain damage and heart disease than men, and studies show women who have one drink a day increase their risk of breast cancer by 5% to 9% compared with those who abstain.\n\n“The recommendation that those under 40 should not drink at all is totally unrealistic,” Matt Lambert, CEO of the Portman Group, an industry-funded group that regulates alcohol marketing in the UK, said in an email.\n\nGakidou, the study’s senior author, admitted that “it’s not realistic to think young adults will stop drinking. Still, we think it’s important to communicate the latest evidence so that everyone can make informed decisions about their health.”\n\nFor those over age 65, any increase in drinking is worrisome because many older adults “use medications that can interact with alcohol, have health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, and may be more susceptible to alcohol-related falls and other accidental injuries,” the NIAA said.\n\n“There is a high threshold for being able to say that alcohol is an effective prevention therapy, and the studies so far do not reach that threshold. If they did, then you can be sure that the drinks industry would be applying to the FDA for a license,” said Dr. Nick Sheron, a professor in the hepatology department at the UK’s University of Southampton.\n\n‘A more detailed and nuanced analysis’\n\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation last published a report on alcohol four years ago when it analyzed 2016 Global Burden of Disease data on people 15 to 49, finding no amount of liquor, wine or beer was safe for overall health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“What we have done in this new study is a more detailed and nuanced analysis of 21 different world regions,” Gakidou said. “What we’ve been able to do now is break it down: Who is alcohol harmful for? Who is alcohol beneficial to? That’s why the message is coming across as different, but it is actually consistent with what we said before.\n\n“If you ask me, ‘Will the message be different in 10 years?’ Maybe.

That’s less than the 71% who reported working remotely in October 2020, but is well above the 23% who did frequently before the pandemic.\n\nAnd among those who have a workplace outside of their homes, the majority (61%) said they are choosing to work from home, while the remainder said they’re remote because their workplace is closed or unavailable to them.\n\nPew researchers said they found that 60% of workers with jobs that can be done from home say they’d like to work from home all or most of the time when the pandemic is over if given the choice.

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nAmericans are failing In their endless quest for adequate slumber, leading to deficits that can impact health, according to a new study on sleep habits in the United States.\n\nThe study, which authors called the the first to separately evaluate sleep duration between workdays and free days, analyzed sleep data on over 9,000 Americans age 20 and older collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2017 and March 2020.\n\nAlmost 30% of respondents had trouble falling or staying asleep and about 27% were very sleepy during the day, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open.\n\nThe analysis also found over 30% of adults reported an hour of sleep debt -— when you sleep less than your body needs — while nearly 1 in 10 adults had a sleep debt of two hours or more.\n\nAdults over 18 need at least 7 hours of solid sleep at night to be healthy, according to the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Sleep debt, along with irregular sleep duration, has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, dementia and mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.\n\n“This is a well done study examining a very large and representative sample,” said Dr. Bhanu Prakash Kolla, a sleep medicine specialist in the Center for Sleep Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n“At least a quarter of the population complained of daytime sleepiness and difficulties with sleep,” said Kolla, who was not involved in the study.\n\nSocial jet lag\n\nIn addition, nearly half of the adults in the study reported social jet lag – a bad fit between the sleep timing preferred by a person’s inner biological clock and the one dictated by society.\n\n“The timing of your sleep on workdays is the societal and work constraints, but the timing of your sleep on free days is what your body clock really wants you to do,” said Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology in the division of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nIf you have a big difference between the two, “it’s like you’re living in a state of jet lag during the work week,” said Klerman, who was not involved in the study.\n\nOver 46% of the survey participants reported at least 1 hour of social jet lag, while 19.3% experienced at least 2 hours.\n\n“With strict work schedules and jam-packed weekend activities, it’s not surprising that many individuals report that their sleep needs are not being met during the week,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a clinical associate professor of medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. He was not involved in the study.\n\nUntreated social jet lag can have serious consequences, including insomnia, early waking or excessive sleepiness, daytime fatigue, difficulty concentrating, constipation or diarrhea and increased cortisol levels. It may also play a role in the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\n\nA June 2021 study analyzed the sleep habits of 85,000 people in the UK and found those people with a misaligned sleep cycle were more likely to report depression, anxiety and have fewer feelings of wellbeing.\n\nWhile the JAMA study did not examine if people preferred mornings or evenings, it is the “night owls” who prefer to stay up late that will suffer most, Kolla said: “These are the folk who are likely going to have more of a sleep debt and more social jet lag due to this mismatch between their internal body clock and current work requirements.”\n\nHow to get better sleep\n\nTo overcome sleep deficits and social lag, experts suggest backtiming your bedtime from your morning alarm. If you need to be up by 6 a.m., you’d want to go to sleep by 11 p.m. to get the recommended seven hours of shuteye needed to refresh your body.\n\nTips to help with falling asleep quickly include meditation, deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Then, to keep your internal clock running smoothly, it’s also best to keep to the same schedule on non-work days.\n\n“You should try and have the same sleep and wake times on weekdays and non-work days,” Klerman said. “But if you aren’t getting enough sleep during the work week, you should try and get more on your free days.”\n\nResearch over the last few years is finding “catch-up sleep” is helpful, she said: “For example, a 2020 study found adults who caught up on sleep on their free days were less likely to show higher inflammation levels.” Inflammation is a key contributor to chronic disease.\n\nA 2019 study that followed almost 44,000 people for 13 years found that for people under 65 sleep of less than 5 hours on free days was associated with a 52% higher premature death rate. However, longer sleep of about 9 hours on off-days was not.\n\nOne 2017 study of Korean adults found that catchup sleep on free days may be linked to lower weight, while another 2017 study found sleeping an additional hour on non-work days also helped control blood sugars.\n\nAdults need at least seven hours of restful sleep a night for good health, the CDC says. Shutterstock\n\nOther tips to counter sleep deficits include exercising, avoiding naps and practicing good sleep hygiene, such as avoiding coffee in the afternoon and alcohol at night, keeping smartphones and other electronic devices out of the bedroom and taking a warm bath or relaxing with yoga.\n\nThen, when you get up in the morning, “don’t hit that snooze button,” Dasgupta said. “Try your best to get out of bed when your alarm goes off and try to get outside; especially if the weather is good and there is a lot of sunshine in the morning. This will allow suppression of melatonin and reset that circadian rhythm.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/health/step-dementia-risk-wellness/index.html", "title": "Walk this number of steps each day to cut your risk of dementia | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nWant to reduce your risk for dementia? Slap on a step counter and start tallying your steps – you’ll need between 3,800 and 9,800 each day to reduce your risk of mental decline, according to a new study.\n\nPeople between the ages of 40 and 79 who took 9,826 steps per day were 50% less likely to develop dementia within seven years, the study found. Furthermore, people who walked with “purpose” – at a pace over 40 steps a minute – were able to cut their risk of dementia by 57% with just 6,315 steps a day.\n\n“It is a brisk walking activity, like a power walk,” said study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark, and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\nEven people who walked approximately 3,800 steps a day at any speed cut their risk of dementia by 25%, the study found.\n\n“That would be enough, at first, for sedentary individuals,” said del Pozo Cruz in an email.\n\n“In fact, it is a message that doctors could use to motivate very sedentary older adults – 4k steps is very doable by many, even those that are less fit or do not feel very motivated,” he added. “Perhaps, more active and fitter individuals should aim for 10k, where we see maximum effects.”\n\nBut there was a even more interesting result buried in the study, according to an editorial entitled “Is 112 the New 10,000?” published Tuesday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nThe largest reduction in dementia risk – 62% – was achieved by people who walked at a very brisk pace of 112 steps per minute for 30 minutes a day, the study found. Prior research has labeled 100 steps a minute (2.7 miles per hour) as a “brisk” or moderate level of intensity.\n\nThe editorial argued that individuals looking to reduce their risk of dementia focus on their walking pace over their walked distance.\n\n“While 112 steps/min is a rather brisk cadence, ’112’ is conceivably a much more tractable and less intimidating number for most individuals than ‘10,000,’ especially if they have been physically inactive or underactive,” wrote Alzheimer’s researchers Ozioma Okonkwo and Elizabeth Planalp in the editorial. Okonkwo is an associate professor in the department of medicine at the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison; Planalp is a research scientist in Okonkwo’s lab.\n\n“We do agree this is a very interesting finding,” said del Pozo Cruz via email. “Our take is that intensity of stepping matters! Over and above volume. Technology could be use to track not only number of steps but also pace and so these types of metrics can also be incorporated in commercial watches. More research is needed on this.”\n\nPeople who walked with \"purpose\" -- at a pace over 40 steps a minute -- were able to cut their risk of dementia by 57% with just 6,315 steps a day, a new study said. West Photo/Adobe Stock\n\nDon’t have a step counter? You can count the number of steps you take in 10 seconds and then multiply it by six – or the number of steps you take in six seconds and multiply it by 10. Either way works. But remember, not everyone’s steps are the same length, nor are their fitness levels. What might be a brisk pace for a 40-year-old may not be sustainable for a 70-year-old.\n\nEditor’s Note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.\n\nInside the study\n\nThe study, also published Tuesday in JAMA Neurology, analyzed data from over 78,000 people between the ages of 40 and 79 who wore wrist accelerometers. Researchers counted each person’s total number of steps per day, and then placed them into two categories: Fewer than 40 steps per minute – which is more of an amble, like when you’re walking from room to room – and more than 40 steps per minute, or so-called “purposeful” walking. The researchers also analyzed peak performers – those who took the most steps within 30 minutes over the course of a day (although those 30 minutes did not have to occur on the same walk).\n\nResearchers then compared that person’s steps against their diagnosis of dementia of any type seven years later. After controlling for age, ethnicity, education, sex, socio-emotional status and how many days they wore an accelerometer, researchers also factored out such lifestyle variables as poor diet, smoking, alcohol use, medication use, sleep issues and a history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe study did have some limitations, its authors point out – it was only observational, so it cannot establish a direct cause and effect between walking and a lower risk of dementia. In addition, “the age range of participants may have resulted in limited dementia cases, meaning our results may not be generalizable to older populations,” the study said.\n\n“Because there are often considerable delays in dementia diagnosis, and this study did not include formal clinical and cognitive assessments of dementia, it is possible that the prevalence of dementia in the community was much higher,” the authors added.\n\nWhile agreeing that the findings cannot be interpreted as a direct cause and effect, “the mounting evidence in support of the benefits of physical activity for maintaining optimal brain health can no longer be disregarded,” wrote Okonkwo and Planalp.\n\n“It is time for the management of physical inactivity to be considered an intrinsic part of routine primary care visits for older adults,” they added.\n\nResearch adds up\n\nIndeed, recent research published in July has found many leisure activities, such as household chores, exercise, adult education classes and visiting with family and friends, affected dementia risk in middle-aged people.\n\nAdults who were highly engaged in physical activity such as frequent exercise had a 35% lower risk of developing dementia compared with people who were the least engaged in these activities, researchers found.\n\nRegularly doing household chores lowered risk by 21% while daily visits with family and friends lowered the risk of dementia by 15%, when compared with people who were less engaged.\n\nEveryone in the study benefited from the protective effect of physical and mental activities, whether or not they had a family history of dementia, researchers found.\n\nAnother study published in January found that exercise may slow dementia in active older people whose brains already showed signs of plaques, tangles and other hallmarks of Alzheimer’s and other cognitive diseases.\n\nThat study found exercise boosts levels of a protein known to strengthen communication between brain cells via synapses, which may be a key factor in keeping dementia at bay.\n\n“Dementia is preventable to a great extent,” said del Pozo Cruz. “Physical activity as well as other lifestyle behaviors such lack of alcohol and smoking, maintaining a healthy diet and weight and sleep can put you on the right track to avoid dementia.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/10/uk/boris-johnson-number-10-drinks-lockdown-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson: Downing Street staff invited to lockdown-breaking ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has more questions to answer after it emerged that one of his top officials sent an invitation to a Downing Street party to dozens of employees during the first Covid-19 lockdown in the country.\n\nThe email, from Johnson’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds, invited more than 100 staffers to “socially distanced drinks in the No. 10 garden” on May 20, 2020, encouraging them to “bring (their) own booze” and “make the most of the lovely weather.”\n\nAt that time, strict lockdown restrictions were in place in England that banned more than two people from meeting outdoors.\n\nThe revelation deepens a scandal over a series of allegedly rule-breaking parties held in and around Downing Street that have sparked public fury, sunk Johnson’s Conservative Party in opinion polls and led to scrutiny over his position as prime minister.\n\nIn the email, first published by ITV News on Monday, Reynolds said: “After what has been an incredibly busy period it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No10 garden this evening.”\n\n“Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!” the email added.\n\nA source who worked in Downing Street at the time has confirmed the contents of the email independently to CNN.\n\nThe revelations led to another round of public outrage, which has been simmering since the first reports of a Christmas party inside Downing Street in 2020 were published last December.\n\nTwo-thirds (66%) of UK adults say that Johnson should resign following allegations that he attended the BYOB social gathering when England was under lockdown, according to a new Savanta ComRes snap poll, published on Tuesday.\n\nAnd four out of 10 (42%) people who said they voted for Johnson’s Conservative Party in the last election said that he should resign, the poll found. That’s a rise of nine points – from 33% – in people saying he should resign in December.\n\nHannah Brady, a campaigner for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said her father had died with the virus four days before the email was sent. “At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK?,” she said in a statement.\n\n“To think that whilst it was happening Boris Johnson was making the ‘most of the weather’ and throwing a party for 100 people, is truly beyond belief,” she added. “Could there be a more disgraceful example of ‘one rule for them, and another rule for the rest of us’?”\n\nMixing between households was at the time limited to two people, who could only meet outdoors and at a distance of at least 2 meters (6.5 feet). In workplaces, official guidance stated that in-person meetings should only take place if “absolutely necessary.”\n\nThe wisdom of organizing a drinks party during that period was questioned by some staffers who were invited, according to the BBC. One wrote to a colleague: “Is this for real?,” while another message said: “Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?,” the BBC reported.\n\nJohnson refused to respond to reports that he and his wife, Carrie Johnson, had attended the event when pressed by a journalist on Monday, saying only: “That, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray.”\n\nGray, a senior civil servant, has been tasked with investigating the alleged parties. She took on the role after Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was removed from the probe, following revelations that he had known about a party held in his own department.\n\nEdward Argar, the minister of state for health, also deflected questions on the issue on Tuesday. “I don’t know what did or didn’t happen. All I’ve seen are the reports, the email that was reported yesterday, and various sources quoted by various media and journalistic outlets,” Argar told British broadcaster Sky News.\n\n“That’s why it’s right that this is looked into independently by Sue Gray, and therefore it’d be wrong for me to comment.”\n\nBut Keir Starmer, the opposition Labour Party leader, said on Tuesday: “Boris Johnson, your deflections and distractions are absurd.”\n\n“Not only did you know about the parties in Downing Street, you attended them,” Starmer added. “Stop lying to the British public. It’s time to finally come clean.”\n\nAnd the Metropolitan Police, which has been criticized for refusing to investigate any of the reported parties, said it was “in contact with the Cabinet Office” over the event.\n\nA deepening scandal\n\nJohnson has faced multiple claims that social events were held inside 10 Downing Street in the spring of 2020 and the run up to Christmas that year, when local restrictions barred such gatherings.\n\nWhen those questions began, Johnson rebuffed them by saying that no parties had taken place and his staffers and aides had followed the rules at all times. But since then a flood of allegations and leaks have shed light on several alleged gatherings.\n\nLast month, a photo emerged allegedly showing Johnson drinking wine with Downing Street staff during a gathering that took place on May 15, 2020 – five days before the “bring your own booze” gathering was scheduled. The image, shared with the Guardian, shows staff gathered in the garden at Downing Street, which is also the Prime Minister’s residence. In the photo, Johnson is seen with his then-fiancée Carrie Symonds and two others seated at a table with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson responded to the image saying: “Work meetings often take place in the Downing Street garden in the summer months. On this occasion there were staff meetings following a No. 10 press conference.”\n\nMeanwhile a video of staff joking about a “Christmas party” in December 2020 that “was not socially distanced” prompted the resignation of Allegra Stratton, one of Johnson’s closest aides.\n\nCNN established last month that social gatherings were indeed held on December 18, 2020, as well as November 27 of that year, and confirmed a Daily Mirror report that Johnson himself gave an impromptu speech at the latter.\n\nA separate photo of Johnson hosting a Christmas quiz party at Downing Street that allegedly broke Covid-19 restrictions was then published by British newspaper The Mirror. A spokesperson said “the Prime Minister briefly took part virtually in a quiz to thank staff for their hard work throughout the year.”\n\nPublic anger prompted Johnson to call for an inquiry. On Monday, the Prime Minister would not elaborate on whether he had already been interviewed by Gray yet.\n\nAngela Rayner, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responding to reports of the email, said: “Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us.”\n\n“He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates,” she added.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Rob Picheta Arnaud Siad Niamh Kennedy Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee", "Rob Picheta", "Arnaud Siad", "Niamh Kennedy", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/health/balance-on-one-leg-longevity-wellness/index.html", "title": "The ability to balance is linked to a longer life, study finds | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series.

Previous research has linked the inability to stand on one leg to a greater risk of falls and to cognitive decline.\n\nThe study involved 1,702 people ages 51 to 75 living in Brazil, who were asked to balance unsupported on one leg during an initial check. Researchers told the participants to place the front of the free foot behind the standing leg, keep their arms by their sides and eyes fixed straight ahead. Up to three attempts on either foot were permitted.\n\nBeing able to balance on one leg is important for older people for a number of reasons, and it is also reflective of wider fitness and health levels, said study author Dr. Claudio Gil Araújo at Exercise Medicine Clinic - CLINIMEX - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n“We regularly need … a one-legged posture, to move out of a car, to climb or to descend a step or stair and so on. To not have this ability or being afraid in doing so, it is likely related to loss of autonomy and, in consequence, less exercise and the snowball starts,” he explained.\n\nPoor balance and longevity\n\nThe study participants had an average age of 61 and two-thirds of them were men. Around 1 in 5 failed to balance on one leg for 10 seconds at the initial checkup.\n\nResearchers monitored the participants after the initial checkup for a period of seven years, during which 123 – 7% – of the people being studied died. The proportion of deaths among those who failed the test (17.5 %) was significantly higher than deaths among those who were able to balance for 10 seconds (4.5%).\n\nMore than half of those ages 71 to 75 were unable to complete the test compared with 5% in the 51 to 55 age bracket. mheim3011/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe study found that for those unable to complete the balance test there was an 84% higher risk of death from any cause, and this link remained even when other factors – including age, sex, BMI, and preexisting conditions or health risks such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes – were taken into account.\n\nHowever, the researchers were not able to include in their analysis other variables such as recent history of falls, pattern of physical activity, exercise or sports practice, diet, smoking, and the use of medications that may interfere with balance.\n\nThe research was observational and doesn’t reveal cause and effect. The study didn’t look at any possible biological mechanisms that might explain the link between poor balance and longevity.\n\nDr. Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine in the Institute of Cardiovascular & Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow, said the research was interesting but not definitive.\n\n“As one leg standing requires good balance, linked to brain function, good muscle strength and good blood flow, it likely integrates muscular, vascular and brain systems so it is a global test of future mortality risk – albeit crude,” said Sattar, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\n“If someone cannot do the 10 seconds and is worried, they should reflect on their own health risks,” he said.\n\n“They could try to make positive lifestyle changes such as walking more, eating less if they realize they could do better – most underestimate importance of lifestyle to health,” he said. “But also they could consult with their doctor if, for example, they have not had risk factors for cardiovascular disease measured or other chronic conditions such as diabetes tested for.”\n\nImproving balance\n\nIn general, those who failed the test had poorer health and included a higher proportion of people who were obese and/or had heart disease, high blood pressure, and unhealthy blood fat profiles, according to the study. Type 2 diabetes was also more common among those who failed to complete the test.\n\nThe study took place between 2009 and 2020 and was part of wider research project that started in 1994.\n\nThe inability to complete the balance test rose with age, more or less doubling at subsequent 5-year intervals from the age range of 51 to 55 and onward. More than half (around 54%) of study participants ages 71 to 75 were unable to complete the test, compared with 5% in the lowest age bracket who couldn’t do it.\n\nThere were no clear trends in the deaths, or differences in the causes of death, between those able to complete the test and those who weren’t able to do so.\n\nAraújo said that balance could be substantially improved by specific training, and this was something he worked on with patients involved in a medically supervised exercise program. However, he said that he didn’t yet have the data to assess whether improving balance influenced longevity.\n\nIf you want to test your own ability to balance on one leg for 10 seconds, Araújo advised that it is best to stand close to a wall or table or another person for support.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/health/weight-loss-drug-diabetes-wellness/index.html", "title": "Overweight people lost 35 to 52 pounds on newly approved ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style.

Participants with obesity or who were overweight and took the 5-milligram dose lost an average of 35 pounds (16 killograms), those on the 10-milligram dose lost an average of 49 pounds (22 kilograms), and participants on the 15-milligram dose lost an average of 52 pounds (23.6 kilograms).\n\n“Almost 40% of individuals lost a quarter of their body weight,” said coauthor Dr. Ania Jastreboff, codirector of the Yale Center for Weight Management in a briefing for the media.\n\n“The data was quite impressive,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, who spoke to CNN from the ADA’s 82nd Scientific Sessions in New Orleans, where the study results were presented.\n\n“The weight loss that they got in this study was even greater than what had been seen in the previous studies of people with diabetes,” Gabbay, who was not involved with the study, said.\n\n“The middle range of weight loss for people in this new study was 49 pounds – 49 pounds is a lot,” he said. “It’s the range of weight loss that we typically think only possible through surgery.”\n\nAll in all, people without diabetes lost an average of 15% to 20.9% of their starting body weight over the course of the 72-week double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, which was published Saturday in The New England Journal of Medicine. Participants who got a placebo lost between 2.4% and 3.1% of their body weight, on average.\n\nIn comparison, studies on people with diabetes who used tirzepatide found they lost an average of 15% of their starting body weight, Gabbay said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's why you can't stop eating pizza, ice cream and chocolate chip cookies 01:42 - Source: CNN\n\n“This is a not uncommon observation,” he said. “The impact of previous weight loss medications are less effective in people with diabetes, and we honestly don’t know exactly why.”\n\nHowever, the impact of tirzepatide on people with diabetes is still “profound,” Gabbay said, “providing much more than other tools that we’ve had.”\n\nSelf-injected dose\n\nFor the new study, weekly injections of tirzepatide were tested in more than 2,500 people without diabetes who had a body mass index (BMI) over 30 or who were over 27 BMI and had at least one weight-related health condition such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or cardiovascular disease. A measure of a person’s height-to-weight ratio, a BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight in adults.\n\nAt the start of the study, the participants had an average weight of 231 pounds (104.8 kilograms) and average BMI of 38.\n\nAdults in the study injected themselves with tirzepatide or a placebo once a week, using “a small penlike device with a tiny, tiny needle,” Gabbay said. “The prick from that needle is less painful than, for example, people that prick their fingers to measure blood glucose.”\n\nPeople in the study also received counseling sessions to help them stay on a healthy diet with a daily 500-calorie deficit, as well as at least 150 minutes of physical activity each week. While that certainly helped, it does not explain the magnitude of the weight loss seen in the study, Gabbay said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback VIDEO: If you do just one exercise every day, try this one 02:32 - Source: CNN\n\n“The kind of weight loss that we see when people exercise and change their calorie intake is somewhere in the order of 5% to 7%,” he said. “This study showed a profoundly greater weight loss, far above what we would imagine with lifestyle changes.”\n\nThe most common side effects reported were nausea, diarrhea and constipation. Between 2.6% and 7.1% of the participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events.\n\nMounjaro carries a boxed warning about thyroid tumors and should not be used by people with a family history of certain thyroid conditions.\n\n“Obesity should be treated like any other chronic disease – with effective and safe approaches that target underlying (causes of) disease … and these results underscore that tirzepatide may be doing just that,” Jastreboff of the Yale Center for Weight Management said in an American Diabetes Association news release.\n\n“These results are an important step forward in potentially expanding effective therapeutic options for people with obesity.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte Virginia Langmaid", "Sandee Lamotte", "Virginia Langmaid"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}]}
